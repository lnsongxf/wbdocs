﻿Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Background
2013 saw dramatic progress in the extractive industries sector in Myanmar on several fronts. The Myanmar Oil & Gas
Enterprise (MOGE), ran bid rounds for onshore and then offshore blocks. In the offshore bid round, a total of 60
companies, including many International Oil Companies (lOCs) bid for 30 blocks. At the end of the process, in March
2014, 13 companies were successful in bidding for 20 blocks, (with ten blocks yet to be awarded), including companies
such as BG, Chevron, Woodside Energy, Shell and Eni. The offshore bid round process placed Myanmar on the
international oil and gas map, and a vote of confidence was placed in the Government of the Union of Myanmar (GOUM)
with the entrance of a number of super-major companies into Myanmar. The GOUM committed to implementing EITI in
2012 and after a period of stakeholder consultation, the first Multi-Stakeholder Group (MSG) meeting took place in
February 2014 in Nay Pyi Taw. There have subsequently been regular MSG meetings on monthly or bi-monthly basis.
Meanwhile, the Myanmar Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (MEITI) applied for candidacy of EITI on 17th April
2014 and was accepted as a candidate country on the 2nd July 2014.
As Myanmar is increasingly viewed as a new destination for investment in the extractive industries sector, highlighted by
the recent bid rounds and its EITI candidacy approval, the country will come under increasing focus from international
non-governmental organisations (outside of human rights organisations, who have long focused on Myanmar) and from
international media organisations. In the wake of the 2013-14 bid rounds, and just before Myanmar was recognised as an
EITI Candidate Country, precisely this happened with the publication of a Global Witness report on beneficial ownership
in the bid rounds (Global Witness, 2014). The report quickly gathered media attention, with the Financial Times running a
story the day after publication of the report casting a critical glance at the hidden ownership structures behind some of the
bid winners.'
Given the centrality of EITI to reform efforts, and as a result of the importance of natural resources to the development of
Myanmar's economy, MEITI will need to begin preparing to implement its work plan, focusing on the most important task
of planning the first MEITI report. This report will need to be completed by January 2016. In advance of these work-
streams, this report provides a baseline assessment of the extractive industries sector in Myanmar, focusing on the
systems, processes and institutions involved in the governance of the sector. It should be noted that the scope of the
present report does not pre-empt the selection of sectors to be included under EITI reporting. This report has both a
broad and a narrow focus. The broad focus takes a holistic view of natural resource governance from an institutional and
regulatory perspective, including political-economy considerations where relevant. The narrow focus is to assess the
implications for EITI.
The report aims to provide a stock-take of the extractive industries sector in Myanmar, rather than provide substantive
recommendations for improvements in governance or ways in which EITI should best be implemented. The focus is on
governance, examining institutions, processes and the relationship between formal and de facto arrangements. For this
reason, the report does not provide comprehensive industry data and quantitative analysis and is a broad based
document.
1.2 Methodology
Our approach is based on the "extractive industries sector value chain" model, which covers in broad outline all the key
processes and operations involved in natural resource governance, from the awarding of concessions and licences to
how revenue is distributed and managed. Our aim was to assess the role of institutions, formal and informal processes
and the incentive structures of key stakeholders. This can be represented diagrammatically in Figure 2:

Stakeholder Analysis: Who are the most important stakeholders in the sector, both in terms of hard power
and soft power? What are their interests and incentives? How can we qualify their power? What is their
relative influence vis-A-vis each other? Etc.
Institutional analysis requires first of all identifying the core organisations involved in the governance of the extractive
industries sector and the key people to meet within those organisations. We identified the recently-formed EITI Multi-
Stakeholder Group (MSG) as the priority body to engage, and focused on meeting as many MSG members as possible
during the two missions. In terms of government representatives, the MSG has six GOUM representatives from the
Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Energy (MOE), the Ministry of Mines (MOM), the General Administration
Department (GAD) within the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), the Ministry Of Environmental Conservation and Forestry
(MOECAF), the Internal Revenue Department of the Ministry of Finance (IRD), MOGE within the Ministry of Energy and
the Auditor General's Office (OAG). As well as the six representatives from the government on the MSG, GOUM has also
established a working group on the implementation of EITI, which includes the Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP), the
Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development (MNPED), the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) and a
representative from the President's National Economic and Social Affairs Commission. The MSG has six represenatives
from private sector operators and nine representatives from civil society.
As well as meeting as many civil society and private sector representatives on the MSG at national level, we decided to
visit Shan and Kayin States. We selected Shan State because there is a range of extractive operations across the state,
including oil and gas, mining and gemstones. In addition, Shan State has a complex set of actors involved in the
extractive industries sector, including ethnic armed groups (EAG). Kayin State was selected for the second field trip due
to the heritage of attempted alternative forms of governance (the KNU), which facilitated an assessment of the impact of
this history for the extractive industries sector in contemporary terms. Taken together, the field trips aided in the
understanding of the sub-national complexity of Myanmar from the perspective of the extractive industries sector.
Existing Analyses
Although Myanmar is only a few years into the reform process, there is already a substantive body of research that has
been produced, this was read and assessed during desk study prior to the first mission. There are several substantive
assessments of specific extractive operations produced by civil society organisations. These reports detail the negative
outcomes associated with specific operations. There are reports which assess the changing role of the Defence Services
in Myanmar and others which attempt to provide economic forecasts. Most recently, Myanmar Development Resource
Institute (MDRI) has, in association with the Asia Foundation, published two reports examining sub-national government
and business in Myanmar which were particularly helpful for this report. A full list of references is included in Annex 1.

﻿Chapter 2: Institutional Analysis
2.1 Introduction to the Governance Structure of Myanmar's Extractive
Industries Sector
This chapter will present the institutional and regulatory framework governing extractive industries in Myanmar. It will start
with a review of the institutions and legislation which regulates mining, oil and gas. Regulatory and institutional issues
concerning hydropower are found in Chapter Seven. Other potential sectors for EITI, such as forestry and fishing, are not
assessed in this report, although the MSG may decide to include these sectors as within scope for EITI reporting.
A visual overview of government institutions most closely involved in the extractive industries sector is provided in figure
3. While not exhaustive, this diagram presents the core organisations involved in policy, legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of the sector. Throughout this report, the words "ministry", "institution", "organisation" and "agency" are used
interchangeably to refer to government entities.
As well as describing formal institutional arrangements, the chapter will also include information on informal practices
related to the governance of the three sectors throughout the value chain, from awarding of concessions to monitoring
and regulating. Detailed discussions regarding taxation of natural resource wealth, the consequent financial flows and the
management of these revenues is the subject of Chapter Six.
Given that Myanmar is a country in transition with an increasingly significant number of revised laws and mandates, it is
unsurprising that extractive industries sector development is still transitioning from the forms of business operations that
took place under the pre-2010 government. The GOUM has stated its intention to introduce greater transparency in
decision-making and better oversight mechanisms, which will entail changes in long-standing practices and relationships
which moulded development and the economy under previous governments.

﻿2.2 Institutional and Regulatory Mapping of the Mining Sector
Ministry of Mines
The MOM is the government agency responsible for implementing the GOUM's mineral policy, for planning, and for
enforcing the laws and regulations related to the mining sector. As this report notes, the mineral policy is yet to be fully
developed. The Ministry's core functions include mine inspection and safety, mineral conservation and mining related
environmental control. The Ministry evaluates and processes all licence applications for the prospecting, production and
beneficiation of minerals (value added processing) in accordance with the 1994 Mines Law; it also monitors production
operations and promotes investment in the mineral sector. According to the Mines Law, any naturally occurring minerals
found on or under the ground and on Myanmar's continental shelf belong to the State of Myanmar.
There are six enterprises and two departments under the Ministry of Mines.
Department of Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration (DGSME). The department is directly responsible for
countrywide geological mapping, mineral prospecting and exploration using geological, geochemical, geophysical and
exploratory drilling techniques.
The Department of Mines is responsible for administration of mineral policy and planning mineral legislation, mine
inspection and safety, mineral conservation and environmental conservation. The Mines Law 1994 specifies oversight
responsibility for monitoring of all exploration and mining permits residing in the Ministry of Mines. Under the Myanmar
Mines Law, the Director General is the Chief Inspector of Mines and also responsible for scrutinising applications and
granting of permits.
The investment promotion function is also located under the Department of Mines. Although there is no substantive
mining policy guiding foreign investment, the Ministry has been engaged in promotional activities and has been
attempting to attract foreign investment into the mining sector, particularly calling for investors in light of the on-going
privatisation of mines process.
The Mining Enterprises: (According to the Myanmar Mines Law, 1994)
No 1 Mininq Enterprise (ME1) is to undertake mining, production and marketing of antimony, lead, zinc, silver,
iron, nickel and copper ores.
No 2 Mininq Enterprise (ME2) is responsible for mining, production and marketing of gold, platinum, tin, tungsten,
molybdenum, niobium, columbium, heavy mineral and gold ores.
No 3 Mining Enterprise (ME3) is responsible for productions and supply of industrial raw minerals such as barites,
bauxite, bentonite, gypsum, limestone, dolomite, clay, manganese and coals.
Myanmar Gem Enterprise (MGE) is responsible for mining and marketing of various precious gemstones and
jade.
Myanmar Pearl Enterprise (MPE) handles breeding and cultivating of mothers of Pearl, and production of Pearl.
Myanmar Salt and Marine Chemical Enterprise (MSMCE) is responsible for production and marketing of common
salt, marine chemical and soda ash.
GOUM officials stated that all mines are now either JVs or have been privatised, with none operated either by the State
Economic Enterprises or ministry staff, who have a regulatory role.

﻿Evolving Role for the Mining Enterprises
The role of the six mining enterprises has evolved from the country's socialist era when SEEs were set-up in all sectors of
the economy. Up to the late 1980's mining was predominately conducted by the state and only certain mining activities
were permitted for cooperatives and private individuals based on privileged relationships with the Defence Services.
In 1989 Myanmar adopted a policy of encouraging foreign investment and invited foreign companies to invest in the
mineral sector in Myanmar. The Foreign Investment Law was promulgated in 1989. The government initially focused on
attracting private sector investment into copper, gold, lead, zinc, iron and steel.
Types of possible investment are via production sharing (sharing of the physical proceeds from mines) or profit sharing
(sharing of the profits) arrangements and either by JV with the relevant mining enterprise or via fully-privatised ownership.
Going forward, the MOM is not planning on making new investments by itself; rather, it wants to encourage investors to
develop mineral assets. The MOM notes that it is prepared to offer new areas or deposits for new projects, as well as
offering existing facilities as its participation in the joint ventures. The stated aim of the Ministry is to value participation on
a fair and equitable basis so that the foreign investor receives reasonable returns and the Ministry and people of
Myanmar enjoy the mutual benefits. (Ministry of Mines website, 2012).
According to the privatisation policy, the MOM is gradually shifting its mandate from owner/operator to
regulator/administrator according to the government's adoption of market oriented policies and privatisation objectives.
The enterprises are responsible for negotiating contracts, marketing the share of the mineral product defined in the
Production Sharing Contracts and monitoring the operations.
The following outlines the conditions for private sector investment:
Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development
The other key Ministry that is involved in the process of mineral development is the Ministry of National Planning and
Economic Development (MNPED).
The key Directorate of the MNPED in charge of foreign investment matters is the Directorate of Investment and
Administration (DICA). It was formed in 1993 and as the laws on foreign investment have changed, the role of the
directorate has been required to adapt to the new policy of attraction of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and promotion of
the private sector.
The major functions of DICA lies in assessing proposals for projects that are submitted for investment in Myanmar,
monitoring and reporting the implementation of licenced enterprises, the registration and administration of limited
companies; JVs; partnerships and associations; and taking part in regional cooperation relating to investment matters.
DICA has departments responsible for foreign investment and company registration, the two main areas of interest for
foreign investors. According to the DICA website, the Company Administration Department has an oversight role in terms
of ensuring compliance with the relevant legislative framework. The department is responsible for monitoring the
implementation of registered enterprises to ensure that they are in line with existing laws, rules and regulations.
Adam  Smith                                Institutional and Regulatory Assessment of the Extractive Industries in Myanmar  21
International


﻿According to the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law, 1988 and 2012, DICA's Foreign Investment Department is
responsible for providing information regarding foreign investment opportunities; for clarifying regulations concerning
foreign investment; and working under the guidance of the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) to promote
investment. The department provides a review of required documentation before sending on to the MIC. Following
approval by the MIC, the department issues the approval letter and notifies the applicant of the status of their investment
proposal.
The MIC is referred to in sections of this chapter that relate to the procedures for mining licences and also in the following
chapter on foreign investment. As noted above, together with the DICA, the MIC is the main government agency that
grants permission to foreign investors and companies who wish to invest in Myanmar. Potential investors need to fill out
an application form requesting permission from the MIC and must submit the application to the MIC's head office in Nay
Pyi Taw and a branch office in Yangon.
Proposals are then submitted to a Proposal Assessment Team meeting held weekly in the capital Nay Pyi Taw, and the
team decides and informs respective organisations whether their applications have been accepted or rejected. The team
also seeks advice from regional governments and respective ministries concerning the proposals. In addition, the MIC
has wide authority under the Foreign Investment Legislation to supervise and monitor foreign investments in Myanmar
and ensure compliance with the conditions imposed on foreign investments. (Tun, 2013).
There have been suggestions that the MIC has historically favoured influential companies and had less focus on issues of
transparency and corruption. The MIC is heavily involved in the current offshore oil and gas negotiations following on from
the 2013-14 bid rounds, along with MOGE and the President's Office. The MIC has undergone a restructuring process so
that it is arm's length from the Office of the President, and includes a focus on energy and tourism sectors. The Ministry of
Planning will remain the secretary of the MIC, but with the participation of the Ministers of Energy and Tourism.
The Regulatory Regime for the Minerals Sector
The relevant instruments for regulating Myanmar's minerals sector are listed below:

﻿Mining Exploration and Exploitation Contracting Processes
The policy direction of the MOM specifies that approximately 90% of the mines should be private sector owned, with the
remaining 10% still owned and operated by the MOM. Where MOM allows the private sector to operate the mine it
maintains an equity ownership share of 30% (which is also the portion of product it retains through the PSC).
Currently there is no public register of mining permits and concessions in Myanmar and limited information can be
obtained. According to the Ministry of Mines (December 2014), there are 139 large-scale mining permits (See Annex 2).
Currently, amendments to the Mines Law are in Parliament to facilitate environmental conservation, to decentralise
mining sector governance and to promote better investments in the country. According to the MOM website, the
amendments are now ready for promulgation and shall be put into effect soon. Under the new regulations, the investor
will be required to indicate which type of exploration mechanism it is willing to engage in (such as a greenfield exploration
or to confirm existing deposits). Funds for exploration are 100% provided by the investor; they are also encouraged to
add value to the minerals locally by processing minerals in refinery plants or smelters with the most up-to-date
technology.
The mining legislation specifies six types of permits that can be issued (prospecting permit, exploration permit, large scale
production permit, small scale production permit, subsistence production permit and an integrated permit). However, it is
understood that MOM no longer issues subsistence production permits and integrated permits. (Tun, 2013).
In addition to the procedural information included below, several key points include the following:
exploration of metallic or industrial minerals can only be undertaken through a JVA with citizens of Myanmar; and
awarding of the permit is based on the availability of land and compliance with the procedures listed below.

﻿Procedures for the Award of Mineral Concessions and Licenses:
The following general procedures are required both for licensing of mineral exploration and exploitation. The focus of the
discussion is on requirements for foreign investors as they represent the level of investment most germane to EITI
requirements. However, the procedures noted below are also required for domestic investors. The specific technical
processes for applying for an exploration permit and a mining permit are represented diagrammatically in figures 5 and 6

permits for mining without consulting MOECAF
regarding the national land cadastre. There are
conflicts regarding the awarding of permits
particularly in areas designated for forests.
Examples of Informal Practices Related to the Mining Regulatory Framework
There are a number of areas where de facto practice deviates from formal administrative processes.
Negative impacts on host communities. Negative impacts experienced by host communities often result either from
illegal mining that is unregulated or from mining that has been permitted but is insufficiently and inadequately monitored.
It is entirely possible that the mines in question have received permits and fall under the responsibility of the MOM. The
reasons why point to varying combinations of a lack of capacity, conflict preventing access to operational sites and
influence of vested interests. Further information on social and environmental issues can be found in Chapter Eight.
Defining informal practices: Most the illegal mining in Myanmar occurs in the border areas that are sometimes either
partly or completely under the control of EAGs or other quasi-military/non-state individuals or bodies (such as border
guard forces and people's militias). In some cases, licensed companies undertake mining but the sales of product are
not transacted within the formal regulatory framework (either partly or entirely). Therefore, it is difficult to break down the
illegal activity according to the stages in the minerals value chain as in some cases the entire process is non-legal due
to the particular nature of how mineral resources have been linked to conflicts. Chapter Four further explores the issue
of informal mining sector governance in more detail and provides case studies on this in both Shan and Kayin States.
Lack of Application of Automatic Right to Mine Provision: Although the 1996 Mines Law Rules provides a degree of
formal security of tenure by specifying that the Ministry shall:

﻿In practice, companies must submit a feasibility study for the deposit they wish to exploit at the end of the exploration
period (as noted in the licence process analysis above). However, it is not clear if the company submitting the feasibility
study has the right of first refusal due to the clause in the law, or if another company can submit an exploitation proposal
for the same property for consideration by the MOM (the language in the English translation of the Mining Rules is
unclear). Mining companies that are investing significantly in exploration projects require security of tenure, otherwise
they will choose to place their exploration funding elsewhere (there is a fierce worldwide competition for exploration
funding).
Lack of a Mining Cadastre and Implications: Most modern mining regimes have a mining cadastre that includes
details of the ownership, the tenure, the precise location (some include GPS coordinates), the dimensions (and area) of
land for which an exploration or mining permit is granted. Cadastres can be used in conjunction with other records
regarding land use such as a title register. Modern land use systems normally use a Geographical Information System
(GIS) that facilitates the "first come, first served" principle that is used worldwide to ensure fairness and transparency
with regard to the process of licensing. The absence of such a system in Myanmar contributes to the potential for
transactional irregularities and overlaps in tenements.
The mining cadastre is linked to the previous issue regarding the investment community's requirement for security of
tenure and the question of discretionary decision making vs. transparent business processes. If the process for granting
exploration or exploitation permits is perceived to be opaque or lacking in transparency, this will result in a deterrent to
investment. Additionally, access to the type of information normally included in a mining cadastre (such as the type of
permit, the owner, the land coordinates, the stage of activity, the life of the permit and the work done to date on the
property) is required for external processes such as the EITI to ensure that all extractives industry operations are
captured through a neutral (i.e. computerised) system that reduces discretion in licence-application and management
administrative processes and ensures completeness of information. The MOM cannot regulate or manage the mining
industry as effectively without the kind of in-depth and up-to-date information on mining titles that a cadastre would
provide. The implications of this lack of formal system for managing permits relates to the increased potential for
informal practices, either illegal mining on available areas, or mining that has been permitted without due process that a
cadastre would highlight and require.
Cost / Expense: From our investigations, it is difficult to obtain the exact expenses/costs for equipment used in the
mining sector. Cost is of course important in order to calculate the real income and profits for each operation in the
sector. Profit = Total Income - Production Cost. Therefore, to express the real income (profit) from extractive industries,
production cost data must be correct. Vehicles, machineries, mine instruments are bought for mining sector operations.
Most mining operations buy vehicles and machineries on credit and pay back with instalments gradually when there is
revenue from the mine.
2.3. Institutional Mapping of the Oil and Gas Sector
Oil and Gas Sector Overview
The first exports of oil in Myanmar date back to 1854. Between 1886 and 1963, the country's oil industry was dominated
by Burmah Oil Company, which discovered the Yenangyaung field in 1887 and the Chauk field in 1902. Both are still in
production. The oil and gas sector was nationalised in 1962. The State owned MOGE has the exclusive right to carry out
all oil and gas operations with private contractors. Currently, there are 17 onshore blocks and 20 offshore blocks in
exploration and production (see Table 2 and 3). The offshore Yadana (TOTAL, Chevron and PTTEP) and Yetagun
(Petronas, PTTEP) natural gas projects started production in 1998 and 2000 respectively under gas sales contracts to the
Thai state oil company, PTT. The Daewoo (Daewoo and three partners) natural gas project (often called the "Shwe Gas
Project") started production in 2013. Natural gas produced is sold to China National Petroleum Corporation. The offshore
Zawtika (PTTEP) natural gas project started production in March 2014. The Zawtika project includes a new 300km long
pipeline (270km of which will be offshore and only 30km onshore).
Myanmar's output of oil is small. The country produces around 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per dayl2. According to the
US Energy Information Administration, Myanmar produced 416 billion cubic feet of gas in 2012.
The Irrawaddy-Andaman and Indo-Burman Geologic Provinces were recently assessed for undiscovered technically
recoverable oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids resources as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) World Oil

﻿and Gas Assessment. Using a geology-based assessment methodology, the USGS estimated mean volumes of 2.3
billion barrels of oil, 79.6 trillion cubic feet of gas, and 2.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids (USGS, 2012).
Early in 2014 the MOE announced the selected operators for 10 shallow water and 10 deep-water blocks from the 2013
offshore oil and gas tender. Shell re-entered Myanmar as the only company awarded 3 deep-water blocks in a consortium
with Mitsui Oil Exploration Company (MOECO). Other deep-water blocks include BG/Woodside, Eni, Statoil/Conoco
Philips, Ophir Energy and Total. Shallow water blocks were awarded to Reliance and the Oil India consortium,.
BG/Woodside, Chevron, ROC Oil/Tap Oil, Transcontinental Group (TRG) and Berlanga (VDB-Loi, 2014). A breakdown of
the blocks is provided in Tables 2 and 3 and a map of the corresponding block locations is provided in Figure 7.
Institutional Framework Governing the Oil and Gas Sector
The Ministry of Energy is the coordinating body for all types of energy in Myanmar, including the oil and gas sector. It has
oversight of three state-owned enterprises:
Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE): Created in 1963, MOGE is responsible for exploration/production
and land transmission of oil and gas through a 2,488 km onshore transmission pipeline network; and to oversee
Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) entered into with foreign investors.
Myanmar Petrochemical Enterprise (MPE): Operates three refineries, five urea fertilizer plants and a number of
other processing plants.
Myanmar Petroleum Products Enterprise (MPPE): Responsible for retail and wholesale distribution of
petroleum product.

﻿Legal Framework Regulating the Oil and Gas Sector
The legal review conducted for the MEITI Coordination Office in 2013 considered the following legislation to be most
relevant to the management of the oil and gas sector. It is of note that these laws are viewed as out-dated and that in
practise, all oil and gas operations in Myanmar are today governed by the terms of contracts entered into between MOGE
and private operators, including PSCs and improved petroleum recovery contracts. (Tun, 2013).
Oil-Fields Act 1918;
Oil-Fields Rules 1918;
Notifications under the Oil-Fields Act 1918;
Petroleum Act 1934; and
Petroleum Rules 1934.
The information highlighted below is provided in the interests of illustrating the history of oil and gas related legislation
and to provide a more complete legislative review

﻿Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs)
The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) is the legal instrument most commonly used in Myanmar to establish the terms
and conditions to develop petroleum or natural gas areas in Myanmar.
The major objectives of the Myanmar PSC are to:
Facilitate the exploration and development of Myanmar's oil and gas resources;
Provide the Government with a fair share of income from the production operations;
Provide a reasonable rate of return to the oil company, taking into account geological, geographic and other risks;
Provide an incentive to evaluate properly the oil/ gas potential of the country and to encourage as much as
possible the development of marginal fields; and
Provide for a system that can be easily administered within technical capabilities.
Incentives usually Included in the PSC are:
During the implementation period exemption of duties on the import of oil and gas industry-equipment and
materials;
No export duty is levied on the export of oil/gas;
Negotiated rates of accelerated depreciation;
Domestic market supply required is satisfied by pricing close to fair international market value; and
A re-negotiation or "stabilisation" clause which allows necessary adjustments/amendments in the event of
situations arising not envisaged in the original contract.
The Model PSC has not changed to accommodate companies accustomed to the standards in place in more developed
economies. There are a number of provisions which companies accustomed to operating in other countries may find
difficult.:
The parent company guarantee, whereby the parent not only guarantees the work commitment of the operator,
but all its obligations. The fear is that this might be taken to include all unforeseen liabilities which might
conceivably result from oil and gas exploration and development, including liability for environmental and social
issues;
Adam  Smith                                Institutional and Regulatory Assessment of the Extractive Industries in Myanmar  34
International


﻿The reference to a future agreement on gas transportation. At this stage, it is difficult to appreciate what will
happen once the PSC will be replaced with, at least where gas is concerned, a Gas Supply Agreement (GSA). If
the exploration is successful, the GOUM will conclude a GSA with the contractor. The operator will propose a
development plan which includes wider economic terms, including those related to ownership, financing and
construction of pipeline and/or transportation facilities. Such pipeline and transportation will be under a separate
contract between the GOUM and the contractor. This is part of where contractors make their investment back.
However, it is actually very difficult to pin down the financial conditions of such agreements in advance13;
Additional concerns relate to the arbitration system in Myanmar generally, model terms regarding work
obligations, bonuses, and production splits. Additionally it is not clear if the pending new Petroleum Law will
impact the terms of the PSCs.14
Contracting (Bidding) Process for Oil and Gas Blocks (for exploration and development)
In practice direct contracting (without competitive tender) is used for lower value contracts. MOGE informed us that open
tendering is required for projects larger than US$50,000 on domestic procurement and larger than US$100,000 for
foreign currency transactions. MOGE also suggested that, for ministry procurements below US$5,000 in value, direct
contracting would be used and for contracts of above US$5,000 (and presumably up to US$50,000) some form of
requests for quotations is required.
It was suggested that before 2010, there was no oil and gas bidding process and the senior authorities allocated certain
blocks to certain companies. However, since 2010, a bidding process and evaluation procedure has been implemented
for the award of licenses.
A technical team provides recommendations to the Energy minister for the bidding process, aimed at ensuring a more
professional and transparent bidding process compared to the past (pre-2010).
For the bid rounds under the new process, MOGE set out the bid assessment criteria:
Technical capability;
Financial capability;
Prior experience in Myanmar;
Financial terms for the block; and
Experience relevant to the block (e.g. deep-water).
Figure 9 outlines the application process for available oil and gas blocks"6. As noted above the process relates more to
procedures that the GOUM has employed for many years to manage the development of the oil and gas sector than to
requirements contained in a specific Petroleum Law. It is speculated (by interviewed investors in the sector) that the new
Petroleum Law may include provisions that will reduce the reliance on the negotiated PSC process, thereby reducing the
possibilities for discretion.

﻿Deviations from Formal Rules Related to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Framework (Licensing,
contracting, oversight, tax, community issues)
Awarding process of oil and gas blocks
Companies submit a proposal with a training fund and signature bonus amounts included. The President has emphasised
that he wants a transparent and fair bidding process, but there are allegations that this direction does not seem to be
carried out at the middle management level of MOGE. The criteria against which companies were selected or the
evaluation criteria were not published. The GOUM hopes that the new Competition Law will address issues around
transparency, public governance, and disclosure so that the process is fair.17 The UK-based NGO, Global Witness
published a critical initial report on the bid rounds (in June 2014). This is discussed in Chapter Five.
Oversight, disclosure and management of revenue from oil and gas'
Gas exports are a major source of revenue for the Myanmar government. However historically there have not been
standards of accountability and transparency for transactions and revenues in this sector, leading to allegations of mis-
management. Myanmar has lacked an efficient public accounts system, including mechanisms for revenue reporting and
transparency. Efforts are underway to introduce these systems (and also with the implementation of MEITI) so that
revenues must be accounted for, reported, and on budget
Signing of an MOU on energy cooperation between Myanmar and China
In June, 2009, Myanmar and China signed several new cooperative agreements. The Shwe Gas Pipeline was one of these
agreements. Some commentators observed that these agreements did not include sufficient terms and conditions to ensure that social
and environmental issues would be resolved adequately. Hence, the project has been the subject of protest and controversy.
Environmental and social standards that were in place during earlier pipeline construction projects (Yadana and Yetagun) were not
used as standards for the negotiation of the Shwe pipeline contract. This was probably due to the different standards required by the
companies involved. Further information on Myanmar's oil and gas pipelines are included in Figure 10.

﻿2.4 Inter-Ministerial Decision Making and Capacity Constraints
The award of contracts and licenses and the management and operations of contracts require coordination between
Union and sub-national government institutions. The roles of agencies throughout these levels will be required for the EITI
implementation process.
There are clear channels of information and decision-making regarding permitting that flow from the MOM to the
executive branches in the Regional/State governments, down to the Quarter and Village levels, and back again (Chapter
4 will provide further in-depth analysis of sub-national governance). For example exploration and production permits are
only granted once there has been approval from the respective State / Region government, GAD, MOECAF, Settlement
and Land Records Department, Village Administrators and local communities9.
However, it appears that the MOM does not always communicate sufficiently with other Union Ministries who also have a
regulatory responsibility over the sector. MOECAF expressed concern over this siloing and lack of communication. It has
been pointed out that there have often been land use conflicts as a result of the MOM not following due process in terms
of allocation of land for mineral exploration or exploitation.
The lack of a coordinated land use strategy was expressed as a serious concern and the source of many land use
conflicts between the two ministries. There is a land use planning process underway, including a strategy for
implementation. The development of a coherent land management system (including a land cadastre) would simplify the
process of land allocation for the use of various industrial sectors including mining, forestry, agriculture, oil and gas
development and manufacturing and increase inter-ministerial collaboration20.
The MOM's permitting process not only involves the Union-level Ministry and State/Regional governments, but also the
MIC. The MIC also has a role in the approval of ESIAs/ESMPs that are part of the licensing process.
The MOE's Planning Department is in charge of coordinated energy management across all ministries with a regulatory
responsibility related to energy. The MOE has an influential role in setting policy and direction for the overall energy
sector, including MOGE, the state enterprise in charge of negotiating and managing contracts with oil and gas
companies.
Inter-Ministry Coordination Mechanisms
There are several other legal mechanisms that have been put in place to coordinate the involvement of all ministries with
a regulatory role in the energy sector. These include the National Energy Management Committee (NEMC) and an
Energy Development Committee (EDC) that were created in early January 2013.
National Energy Management Committee
The NEMC is a minister-level committee and sits under the Vice President, Sai Mauk Khan. The NEMC secretariat is
composed of staff seconded from the energy-related ministries, with its office under the Ministry of Energy.
The membership of the NEMC is as follows:21
Chairman - Union Minister for Energy;
Vice Chairman - Union Minister for Electric Power;
Members (9) - Ministers from Agriculture, MOECAF, Mines, National Planning, Industries and representatives
from NGO's focused on renewable energy;
Secretary - Deputy Minister for Energy; and
Joint Secretary - Deputy Minister for Electric Power.
The core functions of the NEMC are:

EITI Coordination within Government
At the most senior level, the Leading Authority was constituted by Presidential Decree in December 2012, with U Soe
Thane from the Office of the President as Chair and the ministers from the MOE, MOF, MOM and MOECAF as the other
members. In April 2013, the Leading Authority set up an implementing committee of Director General and Director level
staff to coordinate and support the implementation of EITI from the GOUM side. The committee's full name is the
"Committee on Implementing Transparency in Natural Mineral Resources." The committee has the following membership:
Chair: Deputy Minister, Ministry of Finance and Revenue

﻿The Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development
The Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development (MNPED) has a key role in coordinating other government
agencies, both at national and subnational level. For example, the MNPED is the institutional author of the five-year
National Comprehensive Development Plan (NCDP), the umbrella framework which guides the formation of Regional
Comprehensive Development Plans (RCDP) at sub-national level (see Chapter Four). The MNPED plays a key role in
coordinating development partner input to the GOUM. At the highest level, the Foreign Aid Management Central
Committee, which is chaired by the President with the Minister of MNPED as the committee's secretary. The Foreign Aid
Management Working Committee is chaired by Minister No.3 in the President's Office, with the Deputy Minister of
MNPED as the committee's secretary. The National Economic and Social Advisory Council (NESAC) is an independent
body that provides expert advice on Myanmar's national development priorities, with members from the private sector,
civil society and academia. The MNPED meets and engages with NESAC members. Development partners may engage
with the GOUM through the annual Myanmar Development Cooperation Forum (MDCF). A more frequent engagement is
provided by seventeen sector working groups, which were established in 2013. While there are working groups for
electric power and public financial management, there isn't an equivalent group for extractives, natural resources, oil and
gas or mining. Meanwhile, the GOUM has recently (in June 2014) signed up to the International Aid Transparency
Initiative (IATI), a publishing standard for development projects, which enables the comparison of project data.22
The MNPED plays a role at the project-level within the extractive industries sector, with, three ministry officials sitting on
the 39 member ESIA Review Committee (which is currently assessing the draft ESIA report for the Letpadaung copper
mine). The Central Statistical Organisation, an agency within the MNEPD, produces data, which includes extractive
industries sector information (and hydro generation data), via a monthly indicators publication as well as a statistical
yearbook.
2.5 The Role of Parliament
During this period of transition, Myanmar's Parliament has proven to be a dynamic body and has played an active role in
oversight and budget scrutiny, as well as an increasing role in constituent services. The Myanmar Parliament consists of
an upper house, the Amyothar H/uttaw, and a lower house, the Pyithu H/uttaw. The 2008 Constitution defines the role of
certain key standing committees, such as the Bill Committee and the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). Section 117 of
the constitution authorises the formation of joint committees. The lower house currently has 24 committees, whereas the
upper house has just four committees (including the Bill Committee and the PAC). The lower house has a maximum of
440 members, whereas the Amyotha H/uttaw has a maximum of 224 members23.
Both the lower house PAC and the joint PAC meet weekly to review reports submitted by the Office of the Auditor
General (OAG). Following on from submitted reports, the joint PAC will conduct hearings with the relevant ministry, before
filing its report to the speaker before onward submission to the plenary sessions.
Because of its foundation as a standing committee defined by the constitution, as well as its substantive role in
scrutinising audited information from the sectoral line ministries (sent via the OAG), the PAC will arguably play the most
significant role in parliament in terms of the implementation of EITI.
The Minerals and Natural Resources Management Committee (MNRMC)of the upper house and its equivalent, the
Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation Committee of the lower house. is responsible for providing input on
relevant issues regarding the development of the natural resources sector (such as input into legislation); for mediating
conflicts between the state/region and Union governments and between the mining companies and GOUM; for promoting
investment into the sector, and for building capacity of its members through study tours and other kinds of training
initiatives. The MNRMC does not appear to discuss social issues or engage with citizen complaints regarding the mining
sector in the course of its duties.
The MNRMC engages with issues regarding the following Ministries: MOE, MOM, MOEP and MOECAF. The terms of
reference of the MNRMC are as follows:

﻿If there are any relevant issues related to the extractive industries sectors that need to be resolved or action taken
by region and state governments or the national government, the respective case is prepared and presented in
detail to the chairman of the H/uttaw.
The committee has a role in developing and mediating for the rights and mandates of mine operators in
accordance with the law. If there are grievances, depending on the case presented, the committee will contact the
respective ministries for mediation, testimonies, etc., and submit the findings (the recommendations must not
have any adverse effect on the country and the people) to the upper house in a timely manner.
The committee can conduct press conferences with the permission of the upper house speaker (Amyothar
H/uttaw Chairman).
The committee will report relevant discussions with those who are officially contacted and would like to invest in
the mining and extractive industries sector to the upper house speaker. Then, with the agreement of the
chairman, the committee will discuss with the investors and, if necessary, the agreements will be submitted to the
GOUM through the chairman. Therefore, the committee can invite foreign investors to discuss investment
opportunities in this manner.
If necessary, the committee will make field trips and surveys for sites where there is conflict regarding the location
of mineral and natural resources and where new sites should be explored, that will support the GOUM planning.
The committee can make study tours to foreign countries with the permission of the chairman upon an invitation
for studying the development in mineral and extractive industries sector.
The H/uttaw chooses the chairman and members of the MNRMC. The committee does not engage with the ministries
administering the mining industry with regard to administrative matters. However, if there are any problems between the
GOUM and the public on administering the sector, the H/uttaw can have them meet and resolve the issue.

﻿Chapter 3: Foreign Investment
3.1 Introduction
This chapter will explore issues related to FDI into the extractive industries sector, highlighting the types of reforms the
GOUM is putting in place in order to attract foreign investment, the amount of investment coming into the country and the
sectors of the greatest concentration of FDI (with a focus on natural resources); geopolitical issues related to FDI with
particular reference to China, the largest investor in Myanmar; and a discussion on investor perceptions of the impacts of
MEITI on extractive industries sector governance in Myanmar.
Government Reforms to Attract FDI
Myanmar's transition from a centrally-planned to a market economy has proceeded in fits and starts. Following the 1988
uprising there was an attempt to open the economy, but this was only a partial attempt, which arguably contributed to the
rise of a small group of businessmen with privileged access to the exclusion of others. The current transition started in
2010. Myanmar has unified its currency exchange rate and reached out to international investors across a range of
sectors. A presentation to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development24 included the following points,
noting that the GOUM was in the process of:
Enacting the new Foreign Investment Law in 2012: a milestone towards a more open and secure legal
environment and followed quickly by implementing rules to provide more detailed regulation of investment;
Providing strong protection to foreign investors through bilateral investment treaties but few BITs signed yet;
Ratifying recently the New York Convention on Arbitration;
Sequencing private sector development reforms, allocating responsibilities among agencies, elaborating a
strategic vision with all relevant stakeholders;
Strengthening SMEs, through the SME Development Centre launched in April 2012 and an upcoming SME law;
Entrenching DICA's role as a coordinator of investment attraction by creating a new Investment Promotion
Department and an investor one-stop-shop in Yangon; and
Enacting an ambitious programme of Special Economic Zones (SEZ) and industrial parks and completing the
Thilawa SEZ by 2015.
Additional financial sector reforms communicated included:
The development of a financial sector roadmap to: foster monetary development with a new foreign exchange
management law; and
Further opening the banking sector to foreign participation; and developing the country's capital market.
Improvement of regulatory capacity was also highlighted through the following:
In the 2012 Framework for Economic and Social Reforms (FESR) significant regulatory developments are
planned for energy, transport and communications sectors;
Resolution in the lack of clarity in the Foreign Investment Law and its implementing rules; and uncertainties
surrounding the protection of investment is planned;
Attention will be paid to out-dated framework for the protection of Intellectual Property rights; and
It was noted that there was room for improving contract enforcement and dispute settlement mechanisms; need
to strengthen judicial independence.

﻿3.2. Foreign Direct Investment into Myanmar
Table 4: FDI net inflows to Myanmar (World Bank)
Myanmar is largely perceived (due to the presence of
natural resources and the improving investment climate) to
have significant economic opportunities for the extractives
sector, and although some researchers have noted that
the operating environment is more challenging than
anticipated (Bissinger, 2012), FDI has been increasing
steadily since 2010 (see table 4).                       2011     1,000,557,266
2012     2,242,980,000
Official figures indicate that FDI into the power, oil and gas and mining sectors accounts for the majority of foreign
investment into Myanmar (see Figure 11 below). However, these figures do not take into account informal aspects of the
economy, including illegal mining and gems trade. Myanmar has a significant "shadow economy" made up of informal
investments that the UNDP noted comprised as much as nearly 50% of the country's GDP in 2005. It should be noted
that the GOUM presents approved figures that come directly from the MNPED's Central Statistics Office. In this regard,
approved investment means the total number of projects and amount of foreign investment that the MIC approves
annually. It is not disaggregated by source country and sector and it does not represent foreign funds that have already
entered the country. Actual investment is recorded directly by the Central Statistics Office.

Notwithstanding increasing FDI figures, it is important to note suggestions that Myanmar's mineral assets are overpriced,
not taking into account the frontier nature of the market place and the lack of precedent for success stories for
international companies. One company interested in investing in the mining sector in Myanmar suggested that the price
inflation was due to two factors;
The liquid capital of regional investors, without the high cost of finance shouldered by foreign companies lead to
Chinese companies raising prices; and
Sanctions restrictions led to a reinvestment in the country by investors hit by capital transfer restrictions, inflating
real estate prices, which have filtered down to the El sector asset.

After oil and gas, investment in Myanmar's power sector is the most significant. In the border areas there are hydropower
mega-projects planned (discussed in more detail in Chapter Seven below), although as noted above, it is doubtful if the
massive hydro projects on the upper reaches of the Ayeyarwaddy will recommence in the near or medium term.
Meanwhile, coal-fired plants are also significant, with the GOUM announcing in June 2014 an increase in the energy mix
from clean coal technology25. Countries that have invested in power in Myanmar include China, Bangladesh, India and
Thailand. The power sector has long been attractive to regional governments due to the high need for energy and the
availability of water sources in the border lands of Myanmar.
Pre-2011 FDI Amounts
While Figure 12 does not differentiate between sectors, it is clear that FDI pre-2011 was significantly lower than current
levels. Approximately US$3.24 billion of FDI went into the oil and gas sector up to November 2007, representing 22% of
the country's total FDI, which stood at $14.736 billion for the same period. Foreign investment into more than 80 oil and
gas concessions comprised US$3.24 billion. Notable is the relatively new interest of Asian multinational companies,
particularly from China and South Korea who have bid on these offshore and onshore blocks in addition to International
oil and gas companies (from France and US).

2010 saw an enormous surge in Chinese interest in Myanmar. By mid-2010 more than US$8 billion in investment accords
had been signed, which boosted total contracted FDI since 1988 by more than 50 percent.
As a Myanmar Times article noted, "The US$8.173 billion was spread across four projects in the oil and gas, electric
power and mining sectors, with the two power investments coming from mainland China and the mining and oil and gas
FDI from Hong Kong, figures from the Central Statistics Office show. The projects that materialised in the Central
Statistics Office data in May 2010 were two hydropower dams in Kachin State, valued collectively at US$5.030 billion
(one of which was Myitsone); CNPC's Shwe gas pipeline (US$2.146 billion) and Norinco's subsidiary Wanbao's planned
development of the Letpadaung copper deposit near Monywa (US$997 million).26

Sector and Source (Bissinger 2012)    almost $20 billion, more than the previous twenty years

$4,500-
exemplified a decade long trend of investment being
$1,500 --
overwhelmingly concentrated in the extractives (mining and oil
and gas) and power sectors. Only 1% of the FDI from FY2010-
11 was outside these sectors, evidence that foreign investors
saw few other viable investment opportunities in Myanmar's
challenging business climate."27
Figure 13 charts the pattern of FDI (approved and actual
figures) over the past several decades. It illustrates the
I i~ Apredominance of investment into the extractive industries
[EUnkn- ___00th.r_      m__Vanufacluring_    sector, with investment into tourism, real estate and
:dDevopent  Hots and tourism  Mi,  manufacturing  also  receiving  significant attention from  foreign
investors (these latter sectors enjoyed a much greater
proportion of FDI in the earlier part of the period examined below). Since 1988, mining and quarrying have attracted the
majority of actual inflows, around 68% of Myanmar's total. (Bissinger, 2012)
Recent Bid Rounds
Discussions with participants in the most recent offshore bid round have indicated the high level of sophistication with
which the tender was conducted. The model PSC (which is based on the Indonesian model PSC) is one of the more
advanced in Asia (a PSC overview is provided in Annex 7). Additionally, in contrast to many other countries in a similar
stage of development, the signature bonus was not seen as core criteria for award of contract or licence, instead stating
that this fiscal tool will be used in the evaluation of the contract, only in the case of a tie. This represents a long-term
thinking from the GOUM perspective. A number of institutional constraints were observed in the tender process, including

﻿the lack of communication and interaction between GOUM institutions. In light of the differing mandates between GOUM
ministries and the silo-based nature of their operations, very strong local representation was required in order to gain sign
off from all agencies. Although detailed enough to identify prospectively, the 2D geological data presented for the tender
involved a relatively widely-spaced grid structure28. Informants suggested there were a number of inconsistencies in the
PSC, such as Singapore as the seat of arbitration even though GOUM does not recognise the country as such.
Timing was presented as a risk to the tender process, with investors noting that the climate of Myanmar requires the
tender round to be closed (and contracts signed) in August or September 2014 in order to conduct seismic surveys within
a limited weather window. Should the contracts and licences not be awarded at this time, it was suggested that
exploration operations may be delayed by a year. However, other observers (without any commercial interest) noted that
these comments are simply a pressure tactic; that seismic surveys will take several years to complete and that it is well
that the GOUM takes time to review any variations from the model contract, given that agreements will last for the next
20-30 years.
3.3 Investment Impact on Fiscal Status
Revenue Related to Natural Resources
A large share of GOUM's revenue is directly or indirectly related to investment in the extraction of natural resources, in
particular gas. New fields coming on stream in 2013/14 will boost gas revenues in the next few years, with a peak
economic output of 6.5% of GDP projected in 2014/15. In 2014 natural gas exports were $4.2 billion, equivalent to 34
percent of total exports and 7 percent of GDP. In the medium term, however, gas production is expected to level.29 Under
current projections, which exclude revenues from potential new discoveries, all gas revenues are needed to finance the
public sector budget (which would still leave fiscal deficits of around 5 percent of GDP, in line with the GOUM's fiscal
strategy). Windfall receipts may also occur as the GOUM licences the use of state-owned assets, such as the
telecommunications sector, and oil and gas blocks, or privatises productive state owned enterprises (IMF 2013).
The ultimate goal of Myanmar's economic policies is to attain sustainable growth and poverty
reduction
In addition to the institutional and macroeconomic policy reforms outlined above, the focus of Myanmar's reforms is on
improving health and education and attracting domestic and foreign investment to enhance human capital and attain
higher growth. In addition to increased allocations for health and education in the budget the GOUM is also working with
development partners to build strategies to maximise the impact of expenditure, and obtain additional funding.
The Foreign Investment Law, 2012 and accompanying regulations are intended to encourage the flow of foreign direct
investment into the country. Laws on SEZs to incentivise investment and SMEs that provide clarity and guidance for small
business development are proactive legislative measures that the GOUM has undertaken. There are also specific
infrastructure requirements that affect the country's investment profile, including hard infrastructure such as transportation
networks, and provision of energy, as well as soft infrastructure such as telecommunications. The GOUM's foreign
investment strategy is focusing on attracting foreign investors into these infrastructure sectors. Improved transparency
around the bidding process has been illustrated in the recent tenders for oil and gas concessions and for
telecommunications licensing. Agricultural development is a significant priority for the GOUM, and in response to the
need to further develop the section, new micro financing and land laws were passed recently by Parliament. (IMF, 2013;
Myanmar Bank Governor Speech, 2013).
3.4 Geopolitical Issues Related to Myanmar's FDI
Myanmar is strategically positioned to take advantage of regional interests in the development of its natural resources.
Due to its location, situated between China, India and South East Asia, it is potentially well placed to take advantage of
the massive market these countries represent, although the question remains whether these overseas markets would be
interested in manufactured goods as well as natural resources and therefore to what extent Myanmar's geopolitical
position might feed or avoid the resource curse.

﻿Both approved and actual investments correspond well with major political and economic events. Following the passage
of the Foreign Investment Law in 2012 there was a surge in initial investment, but FDI interest waned as a result of lack of
progress on reforms and political uncertainties related to the fall of Senior General Saw Muang, Chairman of the ruling
State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and rise of his successor Senior General Than Shwe. When the U.S.
imposed trade sanctions in the late 1990's, combined with a global economic downturn, investment levels also started to
fall. The recent international investment interest in the country has closely followed Asia's (particularly that of China)
increasingly urgent requirement for mineral and energy resources, the recovery in the global economy, as well as the
recent political changes in Myanmar.
China's Involvement in Myanmar's Extractive Industries Sector
An important change in the source of investment is the rise of China, which has been especially pronounced in the latter
half of the 2000's, mostly because of approvals for Chinese investments in the extractives and power sectors for year
2010-11 (Bissinger, 2012).
Such transactions, including financing for the Shwe Gas pipeline, have significantly increased China's approved
investment figures in recent years. As we shall explore in more detail in the following chapter and in Chapter Eight,
Chinese investments have attracted significant controversy in Myanmar. Their operations have frequently faced protests
from local communities. As public discontent has mounted, Chinese executives have sought to assuage the concerns,
with some implementing social programs in Myanmar that have included the provision of schools and medical facilities.
From discussions with GOUM officials and other well-informed stakeholders, it is doubtful whether even large-budgeted
CSR programmes will be sufficient to restart projects such as the suspended Myitsone hydro project. National sentiments
against non-tributary dam projects in Kachin state are often vehemently strong.
Meanwhile, discussions with commodity traders based in the Chinese provinces bordering Myanmar illustrated that the
smelters, furnaces and mills operating in these regions are currently trying to move away from using agents to source raw
materials, instead moving towards taking direct investments or offtake interest in Myanmar's resources. Investments in
domestic retail in China have been in decline and both individual and institutional investors are assessing new markets for
their money. The Chinese government is prepared to allow investment outside of China if it sees a strategic interest, as is
the case with Myanmar. Although other countries bordering China - such as Laos and Vietnam - present a more attractive
investment destination, it was noted by Chinese commodity traders that Chinese investors still view opportunities in the
extractive industries sector in Myanmar positively, placing it above Cambodia in terms of its enabling environment.
The biggest constraints to Chinese investment were presented as follows by both international and Chinese businessmen
operating in the commodities and extractive industries sector in South West China:
Security of Tenure: uncertainty over the political stability and therefore the security of tenure;
Logistics: currently those importing ore from Myanmar into China are unable to use the same logistics company
from mine head to processing destination and the border crossing is often subject to lengthy delays;
Finance: mine operators are unwilling to let ore leave the mine head unless a Letter of Credit is in place at this
point. A reduction in the traditional / informal credit arrangements for jade and gemstones was also suggested to
have occurred due to the experience of scams.
Language barrier; and
Layers of middle men.
Other International Investors
The GOUM has taken steps to reduce the Chinese dominance in FDI into Myanmar. DICA officials have attended OECD
and related meetings to stress that Myanmar is open for business to the International community. In a DICA presentation
in October 2013, it is noted that "Investment is dominated by Chinese investors in the power and oil and gas sectors, but
change is underway nonetheless: Only one new investment by Chinese enterprises was approved in 2012-13, worth US$
0.76 million." (Oo Naing, 2013).
Thailand has been another source of FDI funding into the extractive industries sector, almost US$3 billion of investment
into projects in Myanmar, including the Zawtika gas field and the Dawei Port projects. While investment from many other
Asian countries has risen in the last half-decade, investment interest from India never materialised. Some commentators
attribute this phenomenon to India's focus on mergers and acquisitions, a business development model not favoured in

﻿Myanmar. Most Chinese investors prefer greenfield opportunities whereas the majority of Indian outward investments are
mergers or acquisitions.
Discussions with competitors for deep-water blocks in the offshore bid round suggested that the latest round, open to
international companies, was a means for GOUM to diversify its exposure to China and Thailand and bring in
international companies, from which it believes it can learn. Table 6 illustrates the trend away from Chinese and Thai
ownership.

Many international business environment indexes place Myanmar near the bottom of their rankings as a desirable place
to invest.30 But it should be noted that surveys have been completed after the effects of the reforms starting in 2012, for
this reason, an up-tick in investor perceptions can be expected as the reforms trickle down. As has been noted in this
chapter, the extractive industries sector (particularly oil and gas) is one economic sector that continues to attract
geographically diversified investment into Myanmar.
FDI and Conflict
The somewhat challenging FDI investment climate is exacerbated by Myanmar's conflict-ridden border areas, which are
endowed with high levels of natural resource wealth.
Foreign investment in Myanmar's ethnic areas occurs both as formal FDI and through informal channels. Foreign
investment in hydropower and in oil and gas projects goes through formal channels as these sectors are controlled by the
state and entail massive investment. The remaining foreign investment is largely informal, involving local proxy investors
to facilitate resource-extraction and production deals.

﻿3.5 Relationship between Transparency Initiatives and FDI
The reputation of Myanmar as an investment destination has been negatively affected by the decades-long stranglehold
of a military regime. Under the previous government, a system of patronage gave rise to a small, favoured business elite,
and although the current government has taken steps to create a more level playing field, such as requiring open
procurement processes, it will a take a long time for a more level playing field to emerge.
Complementary to an investor-friendly policy and legal framework, greater transparency of revenues paid and obtained
from the extraction of natural resources is widely acknowledged to be a critical step in any country's progression toward
improved governance of the sector. Multinational companies that are listed on national stock exchanges to obtain
financing for their projects are familiar with good governance requirements, including the disclosure of payments to
government, as well as many other requirements related to the social and environmental aspects of an extractive
industries operation. These companies will view Myanmar's EITI candidacy as a positive step. Interviews with junior
mining companies and their financiers demonstrated compliance with EITI has tangible financial value, with EITI
compliance decreasing the discount on the valuation of an El sector asset. Consequently, EITI compliance is a standard
which financiers look for when assessing investment opportunities.
Without exception, industry representatives strongly endorsed the reforms the GOUM is putting in place to increase
fairness and transparency in the extractives sector governance. For example, one smaller company noted that it was
difficult to compete with the "big guys" and that contracts were still awarded on the basis of personal relationships and
entrenched mind-set. The hope expressed was that EITI will provide impetus to move toward the President's stated
objectives of modernising Myanmar's economy and attracting responsible investment into its extractives sector.
Petronas noted that as a company already operating internationally in countries implementing EITI, it was familiar with
reporting and disclosure requirements in all jurisdictions in which it operates." Hence, it viewed EITI positively, noting that
the process should assist Myanmar in moving more quickly toward modernising its administration and ways of doing
business. The smaller, oil and gas company MPRL also indicated a willingness to participate fully in MEITI, again
confirming that such transparency initiatives would only serve to increase the credibility of the MOGE, and improve the
reputation of the GOUM as a safe place to invest.32
The Chinese Nickel Mining Company (CNMC), represented on the MEITI MSG, noted that the EITI process was an
opportunity to share information on CSR programmes with civil society members also sitting on the MSG. Given the
negative image of many Chinese companies operating in Myanmar, EITI can be viewed, at least by the larger companies
that are operating under a spotlight, as a process where different stakeholders can come together and share information
related to many aspects of a project, not just related to financial disclosure.
The Myanmar Federation of Mining Association (MFMA) was equally supportive, noting that many of its member
companies were currently involved in Joint Venture arrangements with foreign investors. The Myanmar Gemstone
Association was also outwardly pleased about the introduction of EITI into Myanmar, although the interview with the
group did not include discussions about the prevalence of informal jade mining in Kachin State, or whether formal
companies would welcome greater transparency and disclosure around their operations.33
However, regional governments with existing extractive industries sector investment in Myanmar, and especially those
that we are led to believe were negotiated with little transparency may be less pleased about the new reforms directed at
ensuring greater control and management over revenue flows from extractive resources.
Moreover, the question remains whether increased transparency through initiatives such as EITI and increased foreign
investment will lead to a more equitable distribution of resources from the extractives sector. The International Crisis
Group (2012) warned that economic liberalisation does not necessarily lead to a fairer distribution of resources. It argued
that a new, more transparent system will simply provide different opportunities for fifteen to twenty individuals that have
controlled a major part of the national economy for decades to consolidate their business interests and maintain their
power over how natural resources are developed. These "cronies" received privileges because they were useful to the
former military regime, not because they wielded any particular influence over it. The reforms being initiated are a

﻿challenge to the dominance of these business interests, but the cronies may well have the resources and know-how to
adapt to the new rules of the game.
It will be a challenge for Myanmar to seek positive foreign investment partners that are performing at a best-practice level
internationally, and who can view Myanmar's future potential without inadvertently supporting to some extent the negative
aspects of its past. In this respect, the oil and gas sector will likely lead the way, with the mining (and jade/gemstones)
sectors playing catch-up in the years to come.

﻿Chapter 4: Sub-National Governance
4.1 Introduction
In Myanmar lucrative natural resources such as jade, timber and hydropower are found in border areas such as Kachin
and Shan State, regions which suffer disproportionally from the negative impacts of extractive industries sector
operations, ensuring that the question of devolution and federalism (and the economic aspects of the peace process)
include a significant focus on the management and ownership of extractive industries sector revenues34. However, as the
chart below indicates, from the perspective of mining, many large-scale operations are also found in the central areas of
Myanmar, in particular in Mandalay Region.

At present, given overall economic reforms (such as the telecom expansion and the pending finance sector changes) and
ongoing political change, the extractives sector remains carefully balanced between the previous rules of the game, top-
down centralised management from the GOUM, and increasing demands from the states and regions for greater control
and ownership of the natural resources in their area. It is regularly asserted, particularly by state and region governments,
that more power to make decisions and benefit from proceeds from the extractive industries sector should devolve to sub-
national governments. However, there is a question of degree, with different sets of stakeholders likely to put forward
positions ranging from limited local level control and ownership to claims toward majority ownership and control at the

Economy of Myanmar's EITI Process", Pyoe Pin, July 2013

﻿local level. It is too early in the deconcentration process, however, for specific negotiations and calculations on the
distribution of natural resource management and ownership across Myanmar to begin.
Since late 2011, the Myanmar government and 18 opposition Ethnic Armed Groups (EAG) which have historically fought
against the government have been engaged in a peace process aimed at ending Myanmar's long-running wars. This
process is quite distinct from the government's administrative initiative toward greater deconcentration. The EAGs do not
have administrative or political links with the state and region administrations, which are under the administration of the
central government. The larger EAGs administer, including providing services, to varying degrees territories they control,
mostly along the borders. Some EAGs represent populations spread across multiple states. However, as the peace
process progresses toward increasingly substantive political dialogue, discussions of economic issues, including resource
sharing, will assume increased importance. As a representative of the Myanmar Peace Centre noted, "one of the biggest
issues of the political dialogue is to negotiate on resource revenue sharing."36
With the political and economic opening, there is widespread expectation of greater revenue sharing. For example, the
Arakan National Conference, held on 28 April 2014, included a call for the region 'to get 50% of oil and gas revenues',
including those from sites offshore, and for local groups to be included in resource management.7 The expectation from
the Shan State Mining Minister is that 70% of the revenues from natural resources should stay within the state".
MEITI may contribute to these discussions on resource sharing by providing an independently verified dataset on the
extractive industries sector, disaggregated by revenue type, by project and by mineral type, which will facilitate evidence-
based negotiations. MEITI may also be able to provide case studies on how resource sharing has been managed
elsewhere from the perspective of a distributed approach to natural resource management and ownership.
4.2 The Constitutional Powers of Sub-National Governments
Under the 2008 Constitution, state and region governments are empowered to enact laws and collect taxes in relation to
the extractive industries sector, but only for marginally significant types of operation. In each state or region, there is a
unicameral H/uttaw (with two elected members per township, and 25% of the parliament sourced from the Defence
Services), as well a Chief Minister and a Cabinet. The Chief Minister is selected by the President and confirmed by the
H/uttaw. The sub-national H/uttaw is entitled to set its own budgets (under Article 252), based on the envelopes set by
the annual Union budget. Under Article 188, the sub-national H/uttaw is empowered to enact laws related to matters
defined by Schedule Two of the constitution. In terms of the scope of the report, this relevant part of Schedule Two is
section 4:
Under Article 254, the Region/State is also entitled to collect those taxes and revenues listed in Schedule Five (and
deposit them in the Region/State fund), which are:

﻿4.3 The sub-national political units of Myanmar
The Republic of the Union of Myanmar comprises seven ("Ethnic") states and seven ("Bamar") regions named in the 2008
Constitution, as well as six self-administered zones or divisions, and one union territory containing the capital Nay Pyi
Taw and surrounding townships. The smallest formal administrative unit is the village, with several villages grouped
together into "village tracts". Meanwhile, urban wards and village tracts are grouped into townships, where the lowest
levels of government offices are generally located. Collections of townships are organised as districts, which in turn form
the core components of the region or state.39
39 For more detail and analysis on this point, see the report State and Region Governments in Myanmar, published by MDRI and the Asia Foundation in
September 2013, especially page 9.

﻿4.4 The Central Role of the General Administration Department at Sub
National Level
The backbone of government at the sub-national level is the General Administration Department (GAD), which is a unit of
the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. This ministry is one of three union ministries whose minister is constitutionally
appointed by the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces from among active duty military personnel. At sub-national
level, the GAD takes the form of the "Office of the Region or State Government" with its head being the Executive
Secretary of the Region or State Government.40 Typically, the Executive Secretary oversees a staff of several hundred
GAD staff that run the General Administrator Office, the Government Office and the H/uttaw Office. While the Executive
Secretary for each region or state is directly accountable to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, he or she is also expected
to report to the Chief Minister. Nonetheless, it is the Executive Secretary (not the Chief Minister) that has the power to
release the state or region budget.41 The MDRI/Asia Foundation report notes that, "How this relationship actually functions
is ambiguous and likely varies from one state/region to another, and depending on the personalities involved."42 A
State/Region auditor general, appointed by the Chief Minister, audits the state/region budget and reports to the H/uttaw
on the findings. However, the role of the state/region level Auditor General is ambiguous, as it involves reporting to both
the President and the Auditor General of the Union (through the Chief Minister).
At district level, a township administrator, also a GAD official manages individual townships within the state or region.
Township administrator encompasses a wide variety of functions, including land registration, tax collection, water
provision and local dispute resolution. The GAD also extends its administration down to the village level, with village tract
and village-level administrators appointed by the township administrator and paid for under the GAD payroll. As the
MDRI/Asia Foundation report notes:

﻿4.5 The Organisation Structure of State and Region Ministry of Forests and
Mines
In Chapter 4, Section 96 of the 2008 Constitution, the power to enact laws is granted to the Pyidaungsu H/uttaw for all
schedule one sectors, which includes, under section six of this schedule:
Section 96 effectively centralises government control of the extractive industries sector, foreclosing any powers at state or
region level to enact laws related to environmental protection or natural resources. At the sub-national level, the only
powers granted in terms of legislation is to enact laws regarding salt and timber (under Schedule 2 of the constitution).
This effectively means that at state or region level, in terms of natural resource administration, there are "Ministers but no
ministries."44 The core role of the sub-national mines minister, from what we could gather from our field trips, is to carry
out land checks on behalf of the GOUM as part of the licence application process (checking that the land to be surveyed
or exploited is not a forest area, does not include a cemetery or place or religious significance) and inspections. However,
as the IGC report notes, "Although state/region governments are able to endorse applications, they generally do not have
the power to veto them."45
4.6 Trends Towards Revenue Sharing
It is important to note that discussion on sharing of natural resource revenues is in itself significant, given that such
discussions were not possible in the past. These are at a very early stage, but some first steps have been taken in the
form of revised legislation and increased revenue sharing with the states and regions.
Analysis of the Draft Mining Law
The Draft Mining Law has gone through two series of amendments, with the latest version before parliament during the
time of writing this report, with over thirty rewritten clauses and some debate on whether a new mining law should be
drafted from scratch. While there was preference for a new mining law in the lower house, representatives in the upper
house argued for amendments to existing code. A key change in the proposed amendments is to devolve the
management of small-scale and subsistence mining to state and regions and to empower them to collect taxes on behalf
of the GOUM. These proposed changes may create an incentive problem for the state and regional governments: if they
are charged with collecting revenue from mines but not retaining any of this revenue, the revenue collection process may
at best be inefficient, and at worst lead to corruption. As the IGC report notes, "For local governments to collect
effectively, they generally should be able to retain what is collected without decreasing their other sources of support.
Where the discretion to issue licences and the benefits of good enforcement are separated, corruption has a tendency to
flourish."46

﻿4.7 Increased Transfers to Sub-National Governments
As noted above, Schedule Five of the 2008 Constitution entitles state/region governments to collect and keep revenues
from land, excise, water resources, vehicles, royalties from fisheries and payments from tolls. The GAD collects most but
not all of these taxes. Because of the small size of sub-national budgets, these revenues comprise 58% of the state or
region budget on average. 65% of this retained revenue comes from SEEs, of which 99% comes from the Department of
Public Works47. From the perspective of the extractive industries sector and EITI, the most significant payments collected
and retained at sub-national level that the MSG may consider to be material for reporting purposes are land and excise
payments, as well as contributions to state/region social development funds (where they exist). For example, as we will
see in the case study below, Shan State has a social development fund, which takes one-off payments from companies,
calculated by mineral type and size of the mine. There are currently no derivation type transfers (whereby the subnational
unit may retain a share of what is collected within their boundaries), from Union government to state or region budgets
based on extractive industries sector production volumes (either for oil and gas or for minerals).
There are planned increases in the transfers to sub-national governments from the Union budget. In the 2013-14 fiscal
year, the share of the Union budget estimate assigned as grants or loans to state and region budgets is 3.6% of overall
public spending. Meanwhile, in the 2014-15 budget estimate, this amount has more than tripled to 11.8% of overall public
spending."48 The question remains whether these increases will be perceived to be sufficient from the sub-national
government perspective as the deconcentration process transitions from a political to an economic discussion.
4.8 Self-Administered Zones, EAGs and extractives
Apart from the fourteen states and regions of Myanmar, there are five self-administered zones:
Naga (Sagaing Region)
Danu (Shan State)
Pa-O (Shan State)
Pa Laung (Shan State)
Kokang (Shan State)
And one self-administered division:
Wa (Shan State)
These six self-administered sub-national units are all recognised in the 2008 Constitution (in section 56) and are the
result of earlier ceasefire agreements. Each self-administered unit is run by a Leading Body, which has at least ten
members and includes State or Region H/uttaw members and other members nominated by the Commander-in-Chief.
According to officials at the MOM, the ministry currently receives little or no information on the extractive industries sector
from these self-administered areas. This poses the question of the extent to which these areas will either be willing to
comply with EITI reporting, or alternatively are sufficiently capacitated to be able to provide data based on international
accounting standards. It also leaves unaddressed the question of whether any of these areas contain significantly large
mineral resources to be of relevance for EITI purposes. It may be that there are varying degrees of willingness to
participate.
4.9 Expanding Role of the Environmental Conservation Department
The Environmental Conservation Department (ECD) under MOECAF has one core function: to implement the rules and
regulations of the new Environmental Conservation Law, which include carrying out ESIA and SIA assessments. Five
regional offices have been established thus far:
Yangon (Yangon Region)
Mandalay (Mandalay Region) Central Myanmar
Pathein (Ayeyarwaddy Region) Delta Area

4.10 Civil Society at Sub-National Level
Any analysis of governance at sub-national level would be incomplete if the focus relies solely on an assessment of
administrative processes within sub-national government institutions. As well as top-down decision making by local
government, governance also refers to market-based processes and decision-making (corporate governance) as well as
community-based governance, which most often takes the form of research, advocacy and demands for increased
transparency and accountability among government agencies and the private sector. The question of governance (both
at national and sub-national level) therefore mirrors closely the three core stakeholder groups at the institutional core of
the EITI framework.
The starting point of the analysis is an appreciation of the history of civil society in Myanmar, including organizations
established originally in neighbouring Thailand. CSOs and Community Based Organisations in the country were
responding to a situation where the standard relationship to government was based on authority and control.
While community confidence levels to engage with the government at a local level are gradually improving, there is a long
way to go. Civil society organizations still face scrutiny from state and region governments and in practice must frequently
seek permission prior to carrying out their activities There are now many new civil society organisations, many of which
are well organized. A review of some of civil societies' contribution to the discussion on the impact of the extractive
industries sector at the sub-national level may be found at Annex 8.
The Myanmar Alliance for Transparency and Accountability (MATA)
The Myanmar Alliance for Transparency and Accountability (MATA), formally established in April 2014, is a civil society
umbrella body that supports civil society actors to advocate for transparency and accountability in all sectors across
Myanmar. MATA currently has 448 member organisations across the country. Although some CSOs (notably Spectrum
and EcoDev) have been working with EITI for a number of years, the first large civil society gathering for the extractive
industries sector (as part of the EITI preparation to sign-up process) took place in October 2013 at the Strand Hotel. This
was the initial stimulus that eventually led to the formation of MATA. MATA was therefore formed as a mechanism for civil
society coordination with the EITI process. MATA is the body through which the nine civil society members of the MEITI
MSG are selected. However, MATA has defined its remit well beyond EITI toward the promotion of transparency and
accountability in general. The coalition is also engaged, for example with the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and
Trade (FLEGT), an EU initiative which aims to improve the governance of the forestry sector globally.
MATA has rapidly organised itself in the past few months. By January 2014, civil society working groups had been set up
in each state and region and had finalised the selection of representatives to participate in the national steering group
where they join civil society MSG representatives to make decisions collectively. As noted in the draft "MATA Process
Paper", MATA's mission and strategic objectives are as follows:
Mission
To advocate for transparency and accountability by government, elected representatives, companies, donors and
civil society; and
To promote the freedom of public participation in, and scrutiny of, Myanmar's legal frameworks and guidelines
relating to resources.
Objectives
Advocate for transparency and accountability in the management of natural resources by Government, private
sector and civil society organisations;

All strategic decisions by MATA are made by the National Steering Group which is formed of the nine MSG CSO
representatives from CSO and 14 representatives from the 14 sub-national units of Myanmar. The National Steering
Group meetings are quarterly. At the regional level, each working group's structure and representation are decided
autonomously without interference from the national body. MATA therefore has adopted a decentralised approach to
decision-making at the sub-national level.

﻿4.11 Corporate Social Responsibility
The private sector's contribution to good governance in the extractive industries sector typically comes through either
individual projects (which can be classed, in EITI terms, as "social payments"), as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
programmes, or in a more structured form as Community Development Agreements which are incorporated into legal
contracts between the operator and the government. Under the EITI 2013 Standard, all forms of social payment must be
recorded in the annual EITI reports, whether these social payments are either mandated by law or included within the
contract49. A comprehensive survey of all significant CSR programmes in the extractive industries sector in Myanmar
should be included in the scoping study that will follow this report. Here, we shall refer to two major CSR programmes, for
the Yadana and Shwe Gas pipelines. In the course of the research for this report, it was discovered that Wanbao, the JV
partner with UMEHL in the Letpadaung copper operation, has an annual $1.8m CSR budget. However, it was not
possible to find further information to substantiate this claim or unpack the major elements of the CSR budget during the
course of our research. MEITI may wish to play a role in ensuring greater transparency and accountability in these
programmes by requiring detailed reporting on revenue and expenditure for all the major extractive industries sector CSR
programmes in Myanmar.
Yadana Pipeline
The Yadana consortium is comprised of Total Exploration & Production Myanmar (31.24%, operator), Chevron (28.26%),
Petroleum Authority of Thailand Exploration & Production (25.5%) and MOGE (15%). The consortium produces natural
gas from the Yadana field, which is located in the Andaman Sea, approximately 60 kilometres from the shore in
Myanmar. The gas is transported through a 346-kilometer offshore pipeline and a 63-kilometer onshore pipeline for
delivery to Thailand and also to the Myanmar domestic market. Since 2010, part of the gas is transported to Yangon
directly from Yadana through a MOGE pipeline, for delivery to Myanmar market. The consortium has a Yadana Socio-
Economic Programme (SEP) which is implemented by Total on behalf of the consortium partners. The SEP has been in
operation since 1995 and has invested a total of $34.6m to date. Since 1998, the consortium is also supporting socio-
economic projects outside its area of operations, mainly in the field of public health and social welfare. The SEP budget
for 2013 was $3,78m, with 61% being spent on development projects along the pipeline, and 39% funding projects on
HIV, blindness prevention and orphanages in Yangon. Reports on SEP investments are not publicly available documents.
Shwe Gas Pipeline
As highlighted in the reports by the Shwe Gas Movement reviewed in Annex 8 and quoted below, by far the most
significant extractive industries sector project in Shan state is the Shwe oil and gas pipeline that runs from the Andaman
sea, through the state onwards to China. The officially named "Myanmar-China Pipeline Project" involves two pipelines,
one for crude oil and another for natural gas. The oil pipeline is a joint venture between CNPC and MOGE. Meanwhile,
the gas pipeline is a joint venture between CNPC, MOGE, Daewoo International, KOGAS, Indian Oil and GAIL. The oil
pipeline starts at Maday Island, while the gas pipeline starts at Ramree Island, both in Kyaukphyu, Rakhine State, on the
west coast of Myanmar. The pipeline crosses Rakhine State, Mandalay Region and Shan State. The gas pipeline became
operational in the last quarter of 2013, while the oil pipeline is expected to operate imminently. As the below quote
highlights concerns exists over the damage which the pipeline will occur to the environment and society due to the
pipeline.

﻿Despite the detailed documentation of negative social impacts highlighted by the Shwe Gas Movement and other non-
governmental organisations, CNPC purports to have a CSR programme that is much larger than the programme run by
Total for Yadana. As of March 2012, CNPC reports a contribution of US$20m to the GOUM and local communities on
social projects (infrastructure provision, health service provision, education and disaster relief).s" CNPC also reports a
US$10m donation towards Rakhine States new transmission line project. A municipal water system was installed for the
villagers on Maday island, capable of providing 220,000 tons of fresh water per year to more than 2,000 local residents.
Meanwhile, between December 2010 and January 2011, two chemical fertilizer plants were constructed by a CNPC
subsidiary, HQCEC. Again, in April 2011, CPNC signed an agreement with the MOE to spend $6m on building or
reconstructing local hospitals and schools. There are 45 primary and secondary schools and 24 hospitals and medical
centres planned, covering approximately 20,000 students and 800,000 residents. So far, 30 schools and 18 medical
centres have been completed. Previously, CNPC contributed $300,000 in funds and $30,000 in relief supplies in the wake
of Cyclone Nargis.52 However it must be noted that there has also been concerns over the delivery of this assistance.

﻿4.12 Case Study 1: Shan State
Background
With 12 Districts, 40 Townships and a population of approximately 5 million, Shan State is the largest sub-national unit in
Myanmar. It is also the most socio-politically complex, with five self-administered areas and a variety of on-going tensions
between border guard forces (aligned with the Defence Services), EAGs and militias, which are less formal local groups
set up to fight the EAGs. The area east of the Salween River is largely outside of GOUM control. The Shan State Army-
South (whose political wing is the Restoration Council of Shan State - RCSS) is largely oppositional to the GOUM
(whereas the Shan State Army-North has a more conciliatory stance), as does the Ta-ang National Liberation Army
(TANL) and, as noted above, the United Wa State Army (UWSA).
Significant Mining & Gemstone Operations
Shan State is rich in lead, silver, antimony, manganese, gold, coal, tin, wolfram and gypsum (as well as, in former times,
rubies). The major extractive operations include53:
The Namtu/Bawdwin silver-lead mine in Northern Shan, which was once the world's largest single source of lead
and silver. he Namtu mine also produces zinc and nickel;
The Baw Sai silver-lead mine in Kalaw township in Southern Shan State;
The Yadanar Theingi silver/lead mine;
The Mong Hsu ruby mines near Lashio, (whose rubies are not as well-known for their quality as those found in
Mogok and have often been heat treated.)54;
The Nampaka gold mine in Kutkai township (very little is known about this operation as it is in a black area,
however the Shan State chapter of the Mining Federation identified it as a significant deposit);
The Tigyit coal mine. This mine is 16 miles from Inle Lake and produces approximately 2,000 tons of coal dailys;
Pinpet (also known as Pangpek) - see the analysis of the Robbing the Future report above; and
Sanlong coal mine. This mine has approximately 12m tonnes of reserves.
Mining Sector Governance in Shan State
Shan State is an example of weak decentralisation of governance arrangements, where a minister at state or region level
may have been appointed, but lacks a legal framework and an institutional structure to be a significant administrative
force. The "Ministers but no ministries" portrait of sub-national administration outside of the GAD characterised above is
apparent in the case of the mining sector in Shan State. Both the Shan State Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of
Forestry and Natural Resources have little visibility on revenue flows to the Union government from the mining sector in
their state. The Ministry of Forestry and Natural Resources' only significant role lies in performing a series of checks in
advance of the Union Ministry of Mines awarding a licence to explore or to mine (on land ownership, the presence of a
forest or settlement in the designated area). However, Shan State has a social development fund, which takes one-off
payments from companies, calculated by mineral type and size of the mine. For gold, the fee is 100,000 kyat per acre,
whereas for other minerals, the charge is 50,000 per acre. The Shan State Mining Minister's preference is for Shan state
to have a far greater degree of control and ownership of natural resources in the State, suggesting that 70% of revenues
to be held for expenditure by the state.
Informal Mining Practices in Shan State
The lack of accurate geological knowledge in Shan State (as elsewhere in Myanmar) turns small-scale mining into a form
of gambling with the ground, relying on local village-level knowledge (which may or may not be accurate). This fact alone
makes it difficult to mine legally. Under Production Sharing Agreements, there is a minimum production required each
year, which is the basis for which the government calculates its withholding tax charges. This minimum production
53 Although not published in this report the authors have the beneficial ownership breakdown for these mineral assets

﻿requirement may or may not be feasible. This leads to licences being sold-on informally to other operators, who then face
the same production deficit issues. In addition, licence processes are commonly flouted; mining operations often begin in
advance of a licence being granted or community consent being given. If a commercially viable deposit is identified, the
local township officer is bribed and GAD officials pressure villagers into accepting the presence of the mine. Meanwhile,
seasonal artisanal mining is prevalent across Shan State, partly because farming revenue is low during the dry season.
4.13 Case Study 2: Kayin State
The Context for Mining in Kayin State
The historical context of conflict between the central government and EAGs continues to exert an influence on mining in
Kayin State. The Karen National Union (KNU) and Government of Myanmar agreed to a ceasefire on 12 January 2012.
Other, smaller Kayin armed groups already had or have also concluded ceasefires. Many of the state's mines reportedly
are in areas control by EAGs or contested between government and EAGs. While the KNU maintains a form of civil
administration, mostly centred on health and education services, in their areas this does not constitute a full parallel
administration to government. Further it is not clear how much the EAGs actually earn from mining, given that majority of
the EAGs are not well-resourced and have conventionally relied on timber and fees on transport and border trade. The
reality of historical conflict has meant limited access to, inspection, and regulation of mining operations in Kayin State by
government staff. Although ceasefires are in place, these limitations remain and are likely to continue for some time to
come.
The Government Regulated Mining Sector
To place mining sector governance in an administrative context, according to government classification, there are three
districts, seven townships and four thousand and ninety-two villages in Kayin. Each district has a planning office, and five
out of the seven townships have a planning office. As noted in Chapter Two there are two levels to planning in
Myanmar.; first, the National Comprehensive Development Plan (NCDP - the first plan spans the 2011-16 period).s"
Secondly, state and region governments have their own Regional Comprehensive Development Plans (RCDP). As part
of the preparation and implementation of its own RCDP, the Kayin State Ministry of Planning compiles its own economic
statistics, based on data provided from township level. The data is categorised according to three macro sectors:
services, production and trade. The largest production sector is agriculture, which contributes 41% to the GDP of the
state. Second is industry, which contributes 21%. The combined services sector contributes 27.9% to the GDP total.
Meanwhile, the mining sector only contributes 0.7% to the GDP of the state (and the forecast is for mining to shrink
slightly to 0.6%) in coming years. The data for mining is calculated based on production reports and the local market
price. The only payments from the mining sector are the one-off payments mine operators pay to contribute to the state
development fund. Consequently, the State Mining Ministry in Kayin State is not a front line ministry in the state.
The five major minerals in Kayin State are gold, antimony, zinc, tin and tungsten. The four large-scale mines under official
government purview are a zinc mine, a coal mine in exploration/development phase and two antimony operations. There
are twenty other smaller mining companies extracting antimony, and a further 16 other (non-antimony - zinc, tin and
tungsten) mines. In terms of inspections, we were informed that there are only 87 Union-level inspectors for the whole of
Myanmar, and only two working in Kayin State. It is therefore not possible for the inspectors to visit all parts of the state,
due to security concerns. This means it is impossible for all the mines in the state to be regularly inspected. The Kayin
State Ministry of Mines therefore has to rely on monthly reports sent by the companies.
In terms of antimony production, the twenty companies mentioned above reported 3,640 tons last year. With a market
price of above US$600 per ton, this implies that the formal antimony sector is worth over US$2m in revenue terms in the
state. The price is set by quality-testing of samples at the Ministry of Mines geological laboratory in Yangon. The Ministry
of Mines mining enterprises also have staff stationed in Hpa'an, seconded there on a rotational basis. Mining Enterprise
1 has two staff (whose focus is on antimony mining). Meanwhile, Mining Enterprise 2 has six staff, whose role is
regulating gold mining in the state. Finally, Mining Enterprise 3 has one staff member seconded to the state who monitors
limestone mining.

﻿Despite Mining Enterprise 2 having six staff based in Kayin (reporting both to the state mining minister and the Union-
level ministry), officials from the state government appear to have limited information on gold mining in the state and also
state that they have no access to the gold mining areas. They add that there is an informal agreement between the Kayin
State Government and the EAGs that the state government will not interfere in business conducted in areas under the
control of EAGs. When asked to estimate how much more of a contribution to the state's GDP the mining sector might
make if gold mining were included, officials suggested between two and ten times the current amount, if the gold were
based on international market prices.
There are two official reporting mechanisms for mining companies, whether domestic or foreign-owned. If the company
has a registered headquarters (via DICA) in the state, they must report to the Kayin state government. The report is sent
to the government, the Ministry of Mines, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning. Alternatively, if the
company is headquartered outside the state, the report is sent to the Union Ministry of Mines in Nay Pyi Taw.
Government officials in Kayin State informed us that there is coordination on reports between the Union Ministry of Mines
and the Union Ministry of Planning. In terms of applications for exploration licences, as noted in Chapter 2, the Union
Ministry of Mines requires the state government to fulfil a series of checks, in terms of land records, proximity to forests
and settlements and community consent, all of which require engagement of the relevant state government departments.
Although there is reported to be plentiful illegal mining in the state (in riverine areas), the government reports signs of
improvement via demands to formalise artisanal mining. For example, in June, the state Minister of Mines was invited to
Myawaddy to meet miners who are interested in acquiring formal licences.
Geological data in the area, as elsewhere in Myanmar, is poor, resulting in a "wildcat" approach to mining. As an
example of this, during the field trip, the mission team visited a small antimony mine across the state boundary in Mon
State. The mine was located in the middle of a rubber plantation. Although the mine had been explored for two years (and
was under previous ownership of a Chinese company), antimony had yet to be found in commercial quantities.

﻿Mining Practices in Kayin State not Regulated by Government
There appears to be a wide disparity between mining practices as laid out in formal terms under the regulation of Kayin
state government and informal realities. During our mission, it was learnt from discussions with informants that four or
perhaps five foreign companies (from Korea, Thailand, Japan and China) are working in Kayin State, with benefit streams
(such as taxes and fees) from these operations accruing to EAGs, militias and to the state government. Chinese
companies specialise in gold mining whereas Korean, Thai and Japanese companies mine antimony. The licences are
bought from local companies who sell on their leases. The operations are small in scale and both open pit and
underground, often based on old mines exploited since colonial times. Villagers are often involved in the mining, selling
minerals to the companies, renting their pit from the operator.
Informants also explained that the state government requires a minimum amount of product per mine, thought to be
between 5-6 ounces of gold ore per month. The company is responsible for paying for security fees to EAGs to protect
the mining area. In addition, the government's inspector receives both an official and an unofficial payment, which is
known as a "production tax". The gold mines do not make payments directly to local army commanders, although they did
in previous years before the reforms. Payments to the EAGs may be made locally, to local officials or commanders,
although the team did not seek detailed information on this topic.
Licence acquisition in gold mining sometimes involves a meeting with the Chief Minister. The recently established the
"Kayin State Development Company" (KSDC),is a conglomerate of local companies, including mining companies and the
Kayin State government is promoting the company as a vehicle for investment. Whether the KSDC evolves into a
mechanism for facilitating investment and levelling the playing field, or a means of concentrating interests in the reform
era remains to be seen. Environmental standards in the brown or black area gold mines of the state are weak. There is
widespread (if not universal) use of mercury. Gold ore is placed in containers with mercury and left overnight.
Civil Society Engagement on the Mining Sector
There are 21 members in the local MATA coalition group in Kayin State, with representatives from ten organisations. The
local group has made contact with several hundred community-based organisations (CBOs) (there are estimated to be
1,000 CBOs in the state) and has begun outreach activities on the extractive industries sector. The key priorities of the
local group are the peace process, increasing the participation of civil society in politics, education and civic
empowerment and finally, EITI implementation. However, there is little full understanding of EITI - what the process is,
how it works in practice and its benefits at sub-national level. It is therefore difficult for coalition members to explain to
others in the network and to grow the coalition. One of the stated core extractives concerns at present for the coalition is
a proposed cement factor in Myaing Ka Lay track, in Hpa-An Township. The coalition is currently self-funded, out of the
pockets of seven key members. A funding request has been submitted to Paung Ku, but the coalition is not focusing on
funding in advance of developing a strategic plan for their work. The coalition has no access to areas where there is gold
mining because the mines are to some extent in areas controlled by the EAGs. The members do not try to access the
areas because they do not wish to compromise relationships with the EAGs. Despite this restrictive operating
environment, relations between the coalition and the government have improved in recent years; there is therefore a
perceived opportunity to create some space for reform, with sufficient "push" from civil society, which did not exist
previously.

﻿Chapter 5: Contracts and Beneficial Ownership
5.1 The 2013 EITI Standard
EITI reporting requirements, as set out in the EITI 2013 Standard, require increasingly more information on industry
structure. For example, the reconciliation report must now describe the legal and fiscal structure governing extractive
activities". Again, the 2013 Standard requires an explanation of the prevailing rules regarding transfers of funds between
state owned companies (SOEs), subsidiaries and joint ventures and the state regarding: 6
Retained earnings
Reinvestment practices
Third-party financing
Quasi-fiscal expenditures such as payments for social services, public infrastructure, fuel subsidies and national
debt servicing.
SOE(s) level of beneficial ownership in mining, oil and gas companies in subsidiaries and joint ventures
Any changes in the level of ownership during the reporting period.
Responsibility of SOEs to cover expenses at various phases of the project cycle, e.g. fully-paid equity, free equity,
carried interest.
Changes in the level of government and SOE(s) ownership
The terms of the transaction, including details regarding valuation and revenues.
The EITI 2013 Standard also requires reporting on:
Licence holder(s)
Coordinates of the licence area
Date of application, date of award and duration of the licence
In the case of production licences, the commodity being produced.
It is anticipated that governments will disclose information on licences held by individuals, companies or groups as stated
above, even though the amounts paid fall below the agreed materiality threshold, to be able to consider all licence holders
authorised to explore for and exploit non-renewable resources. However, only those operations above an agreed
materiality threshold will have their payments to government reconciled against receipts.
5.2 Extractive Industries Sector Contracts in Myanmar
Oil and Gas
As noted in Chapter Two, oil and gas operations in Myanmar are governed largely by contract terms and conditions
entered between MOGE and private investors via either Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) and the Improved
Petroleum Recovery Contracts (IPRCs). In contrast to the PSC under the IPRC (akin to a Risk Service Contract) the oil
company provides the technical, financial and managerial services from exploration through to the production phase for
the government in exchange for an agreed on fixed fee or some other form of compensation. Other contracts used within
the petroleum sector are Performance Compensation Contracts (PCCs), Improvement of Marginal Recovery Agreements
and Reactivation Agreements. The model PSC for onshore and offshore blocks provided bidders with the main
contractual framework to enter into exploration, development and production of oil and gas with MOGE (see Annex 7 for
57 EITI Requirement 3, 3.2
58ETI Requirement 3.6

﻿the standard terms and conditions for onshore and offshore contracts). What follows is an analysis of the model contract
for an onshore block. The model contract states that the contractor and contracting party shall be individually and jointly
liable for all obligations established within such PSC. This agreement provides the fundamental context for analysing tax
and non-tax payments and obligations for both parties (MOGE and the contractor) within the revenue structure described
in the following chapter.
Under these PSCs, MOGE has an equity stake but is not the operator. The operator's main responsibilities are:
Provide all the financial and technical assistance required for such operations
Carry the risk of Operating Costs required in carrying out operations
Have an economic interest in the development of the Petroleum deposits in the Contract Area
During the term of this contract, total production achieved in the conduct of such operations shall be divided, according to
a share arrangement described in the tables below (in the case of onshore blocks see Annex 7).

What follows is an analysis of some of the key points of the onshore model contract, Reference to the "Contractor" refers
effectively to the operator. The extent of the variance with the offshore model contract is not known, as the team did not
have access to this during the project.
Clause 9.11 of the model contract describes payment of Income Tax imposed upon the Contractor, which shall be
determined under the applicable provisions of the Income Tax Laws of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and as per
the below:
Institutional and Regulatory Assessment of the Extractive Industries in Myanmar  72
Adam Smith
International


﻿In terms of royalty payments, for both onshore and offshore blocks, the contractor must pay the GOUM (through MOGE)
a royalty of 12.5% of the value of available petroleum from the contract area. Royalty fees shall be paid in whole or in
part, in cash or in kind, at the option of the GOUM. In the absence of such option on the part of the GOUM, royalties
accruing during an accounting period shall be paid in cash within thirty (30) days after the end of that accounting period.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Government and contractor, royalties taken in kind by the Government shall be delivered
at the delivery point.
The contractor shall pay to MOGE within thirty (30) days after the signature of the Contract a signature bonus negotiated
by the parties and production bonuses, divided by crude oil and natural gas production is payable to MOGE as set out
below." The idea is to ensure that production bonuses are in step with an increasing rate of production.

﻿With regards to State Participation, clause 19.1 of the onshore model contract states that MOGE shall have the right to
demand from Contractor a 15% undivided interest in the total rights and obligations under this Contract and MOGE may
extend up to 25% at its own discretion.
For the assignment of the undivided interest in the total of the rights and obligations arising, MOGE shall reimburse the
Contractor an amount equal to the same percentage of the sum of Operating Costs which the Contractor has incurred for
and on behalf of its activities as well as the same percentage of the Signature Bonus paid to MOGE referred to in Section
11.1 of the PSC.
According to the above analysis, it is clear that the agreement gives MOGE the responsibility to declare and pay taxes
upon their portion of revenues as is the case for Contractors.
MOGE may also decide that the above-referred amounts shall be reimbursed:
Either by transfer by MOGE within three (3) months after the date of its acceptance of the Contractor's offer
referred to in Section 19.3, to the Contractor's account with their chosen banking institution, in the currency in
which the relevant costs have been financed; or
By way of "Payment out of Production" of fifty percent (50%) of MOGE'S production entitlement under this
Contract valued in the manner as described in Section 12 of the PSC, commencing as from the beginning of
Commercial Production.
When MOGE accepts a contractor offer, it shall state whether it wishes to reimburse in cash or out of production in the
manner indicated in Section 19.7. In Section 23.1,the Contractor shall supply all funds necessary for Petroleum
Operations in Myanmar in freely convertible currency from abroad except to the extent that Myanmar currency is
generated in connection with the performance of the Petroleum Operations.
In addition, in accordance with the Foreign Investment Law and the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act in force, the
contractor shall have the right to open and maintain foreign bank accounts in Myanmar at authorised banks and to
receive, remit, retain abroad and use the entirety of the Foreign Exchange proceeds which are received from export and
local sales of its share of Petroleum and generated in connection with the performance of the Petroleum Operations.
The rate of exchange for transactions referred to in Section 23.3 shall not be less favourable to the contractor, expatriate
employees, foreign controlled Contractors, Sub-contractors than the market rate through Government recognised
exchange centres applicable for similar transactions undertaken by any private or state enterprise on the date the
transaction is initiated.
Section 23.7 states that unless otherwise expressly agreed, all payments by the Contractor to MOGE or the Government
and all payments by MOGE or the Government to Contractor shall be made in US$ at a bank in Myanmar or abroad as
specified by the recipient.
In terms of accounting and auditing, MOGE and the GOUM (through the OAG, as described in more detail in the next
chapter) have the right to inspect and audit the contractor's books and accounts relating to the contract for any financial
year. Any exception must be made in writing within sixty (60) days following the completion of such audit. Such audits
shall be performed within two financial years after the closing of the accounting year.
The section on accounting procedures establishes that accounting books and records will be kept in accordance with a
generally accepted and recognised accounting system consistent with modern petroleum industry practices and
procedures and in the English language and in US$. In this regard, the Contractor is entitled to appoint an independent
auditor "of international standing", to audit annually the accounts and records of its petroleum operations.

﻿Note that there is no reference to reporting in terms of EITI in the model onshore contract provided by MOGE for this
report. It is not clear whether a clause on EITI will be included in the new onshore and offshore PSCs to be signed
shortly.
In the below diagram, the Yadana field has five different contractual arrangements:
A PSC and Petroleum Production JV with the following participants: Total as operator with 31.24%, Chevron with
28.26%, PTT Exploration and Production Plc (PTTEP) with 25.50% and MOGE with 15.00%.
An Export Gas Sales Agreement (EGSA) with the above PSC and the buyer of gas PTTEP to be used in Thai
power plants.
An Export Gas Transportation Agreement (EGTA) between Moattama Gas Transportation Company (MGTC) and
the above PSC with the same shareholders, participants and interest percentages.
A Production Operating Agreement for the above PSC and
A Gas Pipeline Operating Agreement (GPOA) in which Total is the operator.
Using recommendations provided from the forthcoming scoping study as a guide, the MSG will need to discuss and agree
on which revenue types should be reported on and the materiality threshold for including those revenue types. For
instance, withholding taxes on employee's salaries would be a source of revenues for the country but these taxes are, for
the purposes of defining materiality for EITI reporting, not linked with the main extractive activity of the operator or joint
venture. Table 9 shows oil and gas projects registered by the Ministry of Energy in 2011-12:63

﻿Mining Contracts
As we saw in Chapter Two, mining legislation in Myanmar is principally composed of a Mines Law (and accompanying
rules as well as laws governing gemstones, salt and pearls). These legal instruments are partially applied in conjunction
with the Myanmar Mines Rules which includes procedures on how to obtain licences and PSCs for exploration, feasibility
studies and production of minerals. The preferred type of contractual arrangement within the mining sector is either
through production sharing or profit sharing arrangements. It is also the intention of MoM not to make new investments by
itself but rather have investments come through foreign and private national investors. As indicated in Chapter Two, MoM
can enter into agreements with mining operators through joint ventures with state owned enterprises (Mining Enterprise 1,
2 or 3 etc.) on a production sharing basis. However, these joint ventures only happen for the most significant large-scale
projects. Currently there are 139 large-scale mining licences out of approximately 1,315 licences64 in total (see Annex II).
A parliamentarian interviewed for this report explained that mining companies' reports to the government typically hide up
to 10 times the actual revenue from the mines to avoid paying tax. He explained that mine owners sometimes have two
versions of their financial reports (one for the IRD and the "real" one to indicate profits for shareholders). The informant
also complained that mine owners have difficulty obtaining loans from outside as the government doesn't help the
operators to access finance. Without solving these problems by reforming laws and the banking system, he stated
candidly that MEITI would not have access to the real reports from the mining sector. This raises the issue of the extent
to which EITI in Myanmar will be successful in obtaining reliable information from companies through the annual reporting
and reconciliation process.
5.3 State Owned Enterprises
The State Owned Economic Enterprises Law promulgated in 1989 grants the government the sole right to develop
economic activities such as:
The exploration, exploitation, production and sale of oil and gas
The exploration and exploitation and export of pearls, jade and precious stones
The exploration and exploitation and export of metals
It also allows the government to participate in Joint Venture agreements with other parties and provides wide powers to
the government to prescribe conditions regarding the products used or produced by state owned operations."s
Even though the law remains in effect, the Foreign Investment Law largely determines, in practical terms, how the GOUM
exercises its involvement in the extractive industries sector. For example, in contrast to the State Owned Economic
Enterprises Law, the GOUM no longer exercises its right to monopolise resource extraction.
5.4 Contract Disclosure
In Myanmar, the MOE currently does not publish the signed contracts but has published on its website the Standard
Terms and Conditions of PSCs for Onshore, Offshore and Deep Water blocks as of 9th July 2012 and the Standard Terms
and Conditions of IPRC for Onshore Blocks (referred to in the analysis above and included in Annex 7 of this report).
Under such terms and conditions, information regarding the exploration period, the work programme and expenditures,
production period, royalty, production split, data fee (only for offshore blocks), production bonus for both crude oil and
gas, domestic requirements, cost recovery provision, training and research and development funds, state participation,
income tax and tax holiday period, profit sharing and arbitration, governing law are described. What is not mentioned is
the amount of signature bonus to be paid within thirty days of contract signature. Even though signature bonuses are
normally a significant and material amount of and source of revenue for governments they are in many cases very
politically and commercially sensitive information and could affect negotiations for future investments in the country.

﻿The MoM does not currently publish either a model contract or existing signed contracts on its website. Table 22
highlights some of the issues felt by communities with regard to the implementation of contractual terms or the lack of
rigour within contracting.
There are now many precedents for extractives contracts being made public, such as in Afghanistan, where petroleum
and mining contracts or contract terms are published on the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum website,66 as well as in the
DRC, Liberia, Peru, Azerbaijan, Ghana and Mongolia.67 The MEITI MSG may wish to consider publishing the main
contracts and agreements for the mining and oil and gas sectors, in line with the trend towards open availability of
contract information globally and the encouragement to do so by the EITI 2013 Standard.
5.5 Beneficial Ownership & EITI
The term Beneficial Ownership refers to the publication of the names of the owners of the individuals who own and
control entities which operate or invest in the extractive industries. The EITI 2013 Standard (in Requirement 3.9) requires
implementing countries to produce a Register of Licences which provides timely, comprehensive and publically available
information on each of the licences covered in the EITI Report. The information must include:
In cases where there are legal or practical impediments preventing such disclosure, reasons should be well documented
and disclosed in the EITI Report as well as government plans put in place to overcome such barriers. The EITI 2013
Standard also recommends (in Requirement 3.11) that implementing countries maintain a publicly available register of the
beneficial owners of the corporate entity that bids, operates or invests in extractive assets. Where such registers do not
exist or are incomplete, it is recommended that implementing countries request companies participating in the EITI
process provide this information for inclusion in the EITI Report. It is also required that the government and/or state-
owned enterprises disclose their level of beneficial ownership in oil, gas and mining companies operating within the
country, and any changes in the level of ownership during the accounting period covered by the EITI Report68. The
definition of beneficial ownership should take international norms and relevant national laws into account. Publicly listed
companies and joint ventures, including wholly-owned subsidiaries, are not required to disclose information on their
beneficial owner(s). But when not available, each entity is responsible for the accuracy of the information provided.
Ownership of extractive industries sector assets is a sensitive and somewhat secretive issue in Myanmar. There is no
comprehensive and publicly available database on beneficial ownership. It is nonetheless possible to obtain information
on beneficial ownership, by online research, consultation with informants and with beneficial owners themselves. Some
of the so-called "cronies" with interests in the extractive industries sector are not opposed to reform or to EITI. With the
economic opening, many of these companies no longer have the favoured position with respect to the government which
they had under the military government. The attitude of most extractive industries sector cronies towards governance
reforms such as the implementation of EITI in Myanmar is likely to be largely positive. The companies on the remaining
sanctions lists, notably the US, would like to be removed and their commercial interests tend to focus on more lucrative
and less risky businesses such as banking, airlines, hotels, trading, tourism, construction, transportation and retail. In
some cases, interest in the extractive industries sector, especially mining, is in fact waning. A number of companies
engaged with during the research for this report stated explicitly that they would be interested in cooperating with the EITI
process as they believe that this will improve their corporate image. A recent report by the Myanmar Centre for
Responsible Business documented the progress some companies have made toward greater transparency." Despite the
largely favourable attitude towards EITI among the cronies, some with extractives interests may pose certain challenges
for the implementation of MEITI.

﻿Conflict of interest among public officials, including parliamentarians, who also own extractive companies, may also pose
a challenge. Some parliamentarians and former extractive industries officials have expressed the view that the
participation of parliamentarians with extractive industries interests on the MNRMC should be viewed as a conflict of
interest, as their influence may still be used to protect and promote personal business interests.
Another challenge comes from illegal mining business operations whose income and reports will be difficult to access.
This is highlighted in the Harvard Ash Report (2013) which argued that jade revenue is likely to be far higher than that of
gas and oil, with at least 50% of jade revenues flowing through informal (non-taxed) networks
A recent Global Witness Report "The shell starts to crack," published in October 2014 highlights that there are 17 out of
36 oil and gas blocks where all companies owners have been declared. This followed the publication of a previous report,
'Who are the real winners of Myanmar's latest oil and gas block sale," in June 2014, which criticized companies for not
releasing beneficial ownership. This demonstrates the potential for reporting on beneficial ownership in the face of public
demand for this information. However 7 Myanmar companies and 11 international companies have not yet declared their
ownership, and the report suggests that some of the published names of the winning companies were incorrect or
incomplete.
"Citizens have the right to know who has been granted access to their most valuable resources, and companies should
seize the opportunity to show they have nothing to hide." The Global Witness report highlights how important analysis of
beneficial ownership is in order to truly understand who the final owners of wealth in resource-rich countries are and to be
able to minimise corrupt practices. That said, the setting up of a Securities Exchange Commission (anticipated in 2014)
and a stock market in Myanmar (to be established in 2015) will require companies operating in Myanmar to disclose
beneficial ownership arrangements. Discussions with informants on the stock market and its beneficial ownership
reporting requirements indicated a degree of confidence that beneficial ownership issues would be gradually addressed
and resolved in Myanmar.
5.6 State-owned Economic Enterprises vs. Military Holdings Companies
State involvement in the economy dates to independence in 1948, when the ascendant postcolonial government faced
dire economic circumstances. Politically, all elites, regardless of partisan or ideological leanings, blamed the European-
dominated colonial economy, along with the devastation wrought by multiple occupations during World War II, for the
hardships they faced.
In this context, foreign capital was highly suspect, while domestic wealth was neither concentrated nor particularly open to
risk. Hence, the legal architecture that emerged in early postcolonial Burma was one that enshrined a significant state
planning and regulatory apparatus along with direct government roles in SEEs. Throughout the postcolonial period,
cabinet ministries, government departments and the armed forces have operated formal national economic enterprises,
as well as wide-ranging small-scale formal and informal businesses that served local officials' procurement, revenue and
other needs.
Privatization did not occur until the early 1990s, despite the enormous inefficiencies that characterized public and private
enterprises, and efforts at privatization have been almost entirely opaque and piecemeal, at best, in nature.
The Legal Architecture of SEEs
Nearly all state-involved firms are regulated under the combination of two laws, all of which arose from particular historical
contexts that are reflected in their provisions, restrictions and content.
Drafted in the first two years after independence, The Special Companies Act of 1950 provides the basic legal
classification system that distinguishes private from public companies. Reflecting the ideological and pragmatic mind-set
of the time, it promotes public or state companies as vehicles for large-scale capital investment, as required for
modernization. As such, privileges such as tax exemption were likely intended to increase the capacity of these firms to
use capital productively.
Since then, a succession of laws has regulated the category of companies that came to be known as "state-owned
economic enterprises." These legal instruments were also products of their times and reflective of ideological, popular
and supply- and demand-driven interests and concerns.
Today, most formal, state-based economic enterprises are regulated under the State-owned Economic Enterprises Law
(The State Law and Order Restoration Council Law No.9/89), decreed in March 1989. After the collapse of the autarchic,

﻿centrally-controlled socialist economy and the Burma socialist government in 1988, the military took direct authority over
the government and declared an interest in opening the economy to foreign investment. Law 9/89, however, revealed its
ambivalence to foreign influence, as it declared government monopolies in major sectors, including most mineral and
energy exploration, extraction, production and trade. Section 4 of the law allowed exceptions in the form of government-
based joint ventures. The law was amended in March 1997 (SLORC Law No. 4/97) to allow the Government to "constitute
any organization to enable enterprises to be carried out without subscribing from State finances but by causing
investment [to] be made from the funds owned by the relevant employees' organization." This clause allowed government
bodies and their employees to become shareholders in SEEs.
5.7 The Military Holding Companies
Although founded in the 1990s, the two military holdings companies prominent in today's economy, UMEHL and MEC,
have their roots in the same context that gave rise to SEEs in the early days of independence. In a period of widespread
insurrection and an almost defunct tax collection process, the military had to rely upon its own devices for supply, funding,
and logistics. By 1950, the War Office formalised and centralized its role in the economy with the establishment of the
Defence Services Institute (DSI). Initially intended to supply consumer goods to soldiers as well as the public, DSI
eventually grew into a conglomerate that included the nation's largest shipping company, banks, popular magazines, and
major department stores. In the socialist era (1962-88), DSI's holdings were transferred to the new Burma Economic
Development Corporation (BEDC), but many of the subsidiary firms remained largely intact. Some thirty years later after
DSI closed down, most of its businesses were transferred to the Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings (UMEHL).
Early in the post-Socialist era, the military as an institution reclaimed a considerable presence in the economy, with the
emergence of two major holdings companies. First in 1990, UMEHL was established under the 1950 Special Companies
Act. Originally under the Adjutant General, it was later was moved to the Office of Defence Industries. According to Dr
Maung Aung Myoe, who cites internal UMEHL reports and other internal military records, UMEHL formed 77 companies
between 1990 and 2007, in addition to those inherited from the DSI/BEDC. Its breadth of investment covered garment
factories, wood-based industries, hospitality, construction, telecommunications, gems, automobile imports and sales,
cement production, cosmetics and stationery.
In 1997, the SLORC established the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) under the terms of both 1989 State-Owned
Economic Enterprise Law and the 1997 amendment. Administered by the Quartermaster General, its express purpose
was "to contribute towards the development of the State economy, to decrease defence expenditure by fulfilling the needs
of the Defence Services, to carry out the welfare of the Defence Services personnel" MEC invested capital in all industries
and sectors that the 1989 SEE Law protected from foreign investment. However, it must be noted that MEC and UMEHL
are considered private sector entities by GOUM, not SEEs.
Other State Businesses Relevant to EITI
As noted in Chapter Four above, other military units, whether locally-based infantry battalions, staff, logistical platforms in
regional or higher commands, are likely to be involved in gem and precious metals businesses and other EITI-covered
endeavours. It is also likely that they are involved in energy production and distribution. Reliable information - such as
whether these are legally-recognized entities (and if so under what legal code), what kind of accounting practices are or
are not followed, where revenue goes - about these activities is difficult to obtain.
Locally based military garrisons engage in a wide variety of economic activities to support themselves, although in some
cases we are led to understand they also report to or finance regional commands. There are probably similar small-scale
enterprises undertaken by other kinds of government departments at township and district levels. The most likely sectors
of relevance to EITI would be mining and small-scale energy projects in rural areas.
A Note on Conflict Implications
For Myanmar citizens who live in areas heavily impacted by conflict, there is widespread recognition that the Defence
Services gained control over much of the extractives industries in the period during which tenuous ceasefires between
ethnic armed groups and the government were in place from early-mid 1990s to 2010s. Some leaders of, or
entrepreneurs associated with the "ceasefire groups" in the 1990s and 2000s are also believed to have received profits.
For non-elites in these areas, their economic interest is to remove "the military" (by which they mean soldiers on the
ground, as well as a range of SEE-linked ventures, including those associated with the military holdings companies) from
their daily lives and to privilege local control over extractives.

﻿5.8 UMEHL and MEC
The two large military holdings companies, UMEHL and MEC, hold important positions in Myanmar's economy, including
in the energy, mining and gems sectors. These two conglomerates which report to directorates of the Defence Services
are organized under laws that provide protections and privileges to state-based companies. Although there is a Ministry of
Defence in the executive branch of the government, the 2008 Constitution provides for no significant executive or
legislative oversight of any Defence Services activities, policies or finances.
Overview
In some ways, these military holdings companies are neither atypical in comparison with the economic activities of other
Asian militaries, nor are they unusual given Myanmar's history', as state institutions have long operated businesses to
finance both small and large-scale enterprises, supplement budgets and raise funds for the welfare of employees and
their families.
What stands out about Myanmar's military companies both from a regional and domestic comparative perspective are the
following characteristics:
The secrecy that surround their activities;
Their supposed size (both in terms of capital and geographical coverage); and
The range of lucrative monopolies held (although some of these monopolies are now in the process of being
dismantled).
It is very difficult to obtain information on either of these holding companies. There are no reliable public sources on
revenue flows, decision-making and governance structures. What follows is a summary of existing literature on these
military holding companies.
The stated purpose for establishing both companies was to generate funds for the welfare of both active-duty and retired
Defence Services personnel and their families. This has been accomplished through a combination of profit distribution
and job provision for family members of military personnel as well as for veterans themselves. We are led to believe that,
in all likelihood, these holdings include numerous businesses that operate at a loss, but would be politically difficult to shut
down due either to vested interests of senior military officials or to concerns about unemployment of existing personnel.
These holding companies have also suffered significant - but unknowable - losses as a result of the modification of
currency exchange policy. Since 2011, their tax-exempt status has eroded. The tax exemptions which the military holding
companies previously enjoyed are reported to have been eliminated, and some joint ventures were among the top
taxpayers reported by the Internal Revenue Department in 2013. However, shifts in economic policy have also yielded
opportunities for the holding companies. For example, in November 2012 subsidiaries of both received licences to start
insurance businesses.
UMEHL
Founded in 1990, UMEHL is the more diversified of the two holding companies. Its early base was in manufacturing, but
in the mid-2000s it expanded into services and trading activities. Its current holdings include stakes in almost all sectors
of the Myanmar economy. It is understood to constitute a de facto military pension system.
In terms of revenue flows, UMEHL probably does not channel resources directly to the military-as-an-institution; in other
words, it would appear that UMEHL revenues do not directly impact the Commander-in-Chief's budget. However, military
directorates and units are among shareholders that received distributions of profits.

﻿According to Maung Aung Myoe, shareholders are divided into two categories, as follows:

There is conflicting information about UMEHL's current reporting and revenue arrangements within the military command
structure, which is largely independent of the executive and legislative branches of the GOUM. The International Crisis
Group (ICG) recently stated that it operates out of the Adjutant-General's office, but Nakanishi and Maung Aung Myoe
reported several years ago that it was moved to the Office or Directorate of Defence Industries. Both are in the Defence
Services' chain of command, which ultimately reports to the Commander-in-Chief. According to Maung Aung Myoe,
UMEHL is overseen by a ten-member board of directors.
UMEHL classifies its holdings into three kinds: fully-owned and-operated, affiliate subsidiaries and joint ventures. During
the 20 years of SLORC/SPDC rule, the prevailing wisdom was that foreign investors had to go through UMEHL, either as
a formal JV partner or as service contractors.
Fully-owned UMEHL companies have significant roles in extractives industries. These include Myanmar Imperial Jade
Company and Myanmar Ruby Enterprise, which operates mines at Mogoke, Mongshu, Nayar, Mawchi and Thabeikkyin.
Some of these operations are subcontracted to other domestic companies.
In addition to the recent new tax burden, UMEHL has lost important monopolies it held in the past, including - according
to ICG - "tobacco products, alcohol, the rice trade and imports of vehicles, refined petroleum products and edible oils."
UMEHL is reported to produce annual reports to its board. Such reports will help in determining what EITI reporting may
be required from the company. Access to annual reports of this kind might be a first step toward understanding UMEHL's
financial practices.
MEC
The Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) was established in 1997, during the Asian financial crisis. It was situated in
the Quartermaster General's Office, and - like UMEHL - undertook investments in most of the major sectors protected
from outright foreign ownership under SLORC SEE laws. Unlike UMEHL, MEC was more explicitly focused on serving the
industrial and technological needs of the armed forces, as well as on larger-scale infrastructure projects.
There is even less information about the operations of the MEC than UMEHL. Maung Aung Myoe calls it "perhaps the
most secretive business organisation of the Defence Services," noting that "it is a government within a government in
reality." Most analysts view MEC as more closely aligned with national security institutions, although - like UMEHL - it
has diversified into a wide range of sectors. In terms of EITI, it will be important to determine what documentation can be
obtained of the MEC's role in the construction of dams along the Salween River, and in particular, the 7,110 MW Tasang
Dam.
Although less is publicly known about MEC than UMEHL the OAG has the power to request audits from MEC but not from
UMEHL. It is thought that there is an auditing department within the Directorate of Defence Industries, which has the
power to audit UMEHL.

﻿Chapter 6: Financial Flows
6.1 Introduction
The EITI Standard requires that there should be timely publication of EITI reports70 within established reporting deadlines,
which are:
The production of a first EITI Report within eighteen (18) months after the country is recognised as an EITI
Candidate country; and
The data included in the report must cover the second to last complete accounting period.
In addition to the above, the standard requires information on the total government revenues from extractive industries
sector operations in kind and in cash, with a materiality threshold set by the MSG defining which companies make
sufficiently large payments to government to be fully reconciled in the EITI report, and which companies should provide
data for information purposes only.
A recently published paper 7 notes the difficulty of capturing information on the extractive industries sector in Myanmar,
whether in terms of accurate reserves estimates and also financial information. The paper notes that financial data on oil,
gas, mining and hydro available to the MOF is not disaggregated by sector or by project but aggregated at the level of the
line ministry's total contribution to the budget. The paper states that:
72
In addition there is a "Union Dividend" whereby the State Economic Enterprises contribute 20% of their net profit to the
Union Budget. It wasn't possible to determine how this revenue is allocated in terms of expenditure. As well as the line
ministries and the IRD collecting extractive industries sector payments, in some cases the GAD (under the Ministry of
Home Affairs) receives land tax, dam tax, and mineral tax payments (paid at the Township level); in addition, some taxes
are collected by state and region governments. Figure 23 describes the general revenue flow for the oil, gas, mining and
hydropower activities in Myanmar after discussions with the Budget Department at the MOF and experienced
commentators in the country.

﻿Further Explanation of Figure 23 - Flows of Revenue and Information in Myanmar's Extractive Industries Sector
In Figure 23, the Budget Department within the MOF coordinates the receipt of information on the types on tax and non-
taxes73 received from the MOE, MOM and MOEP respectively.
Meanwhile, IRD within the Ministry of Finance collects taxes such as corporate income tax (including withholding taxes),
commercial tax, capital gains tax, stamp duties and customs duties either in local or foreign currency.
All government SEEs including MOGE, MPPE, Mining Enterprises 1,2,3, the Myanmar Gems Enterprise, the Myanmar
Salt and Marine and Chemical Enterprise and the Myanmar Pearl Enterprise, as well as hydroelectric enterprises are
required to submit reports about their revenue sources and expenditures in cash and in kind at the time of the budget
review on an annual basis.
Normally, the SEE's are in charge of collecting all non-tax revenues such as royalties, production sharing split, land fees,
signature bonuses and other compulsory payments mandated by contracts as per the corresponding extractive operation.
On the other hand, the hydropower sector generates taxes and fees by the IRD and the MOEP. In general terms, oil, gas,
mining and hydropower revenue payments in cash are transferred by the taxpayer or the contractually responsible entity
to the Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB) when the payment is in national currency and to the Myanmar Foreign Trade
Bank (MFTB) when it is in foreign currency. Both MEB and MFTB are state owned commercial banks and are controlled
74
by the Central Bank of Myanmar as well as by the MOF through its reporting line process.
It is suggested75 that over 40% of revenues, mostly from extractives industries sources, are managed by ministries and
SEEs through "Other Accounts" at the MEB. Other Accounts are used to manage own-source revenue and are by
definition off-budget (they are not reported on), which weakens external oversight and raises concerns about
accountability and transparency practices. The MOE has three Other Accounts (based in Singapore), whereas MOGE
has 14. In total, the GOUM has 4,319 Other Accounts, while at state/region level, there are 517.76 Total Other Account
receipts for 2011-12 were 2.54 trillion kyat (44% of total budgeted revenue).It has been suggested that these accounts
are in existence in order to beat government sanctions and in order to facilitate payments outside of Myanmar.
Sub-national revenues collected by Union and states and regions are sent directly to the Central Bank in either national or
foreign currency. However during the study there was no clear indication of the destination of revenue flows from
extractive operations once received by the SEEs, however other sources of information gathered showed that there are
currently procedures in place to transfer at least some parts of these revenues to the MOF. The above circumstances
should be acknowledged by the MSG during the scoping phase when determining how the EITI reconciliation reporting
process will minimise duplications and delays in reconciling taxes and non-taxes.
73 The "non-tax" term  is normally used  to indicating mandatory payments, which differ from  regular taxes paid to the Ministry of Finance/Tax
Administration that have its origin in resource rents as per laws, regulations and agreements within hydrocarbon and mining projects.

﻿Figure 23: The Legal Context for Tax and Non-Tax Resource Revenues in Myanmar
Figure 24 describes the legislative hierarchy of taxes and non-
taxes. This legal framework is the basis for the Union to receive
revenues from resource operations as owner of the soil and sub-
soil wealth. Non-tax revenues are defined within contractual terms.
These Tax laws and regulations establish which types of fiscal
.. . .       .                                      instruments are applicable to individuals, companies and
enterprises that are dedicated to explore and exploit oil, gas,
mining and hydroelectric activities in Myanmar.
The 2008 Constitution states that all natural resources found
within the territory of Myanmar are owned by the Union and
provides for the enactment of laws to supervise the extraction and
...............use of natural resource. The Foreign Investment law (FIL) and the
Notifications No. 11/2013 of the Ministry of Planning and

﻿6.2 Extractive Industries Sector Taxes
The accounting and taxable year are the same in Myanmar, which is from April 1st until the 31st of March. Normally, tax
returns should be filed within three months after the end of the year by the 30th June. Advance tax payments are required
under the Income Tax Law and Regulations on both a monthly and quarterly basis calculated based on estimated total
income for the corresponding year. These advance payments as well as withholding taxes are creditable against the final
tax liability indicated in the noticed of demand issued by the IRD after the final tax assessment. The taxes77 applicable to
all companies and state owned enterprises that develop extractive projects in Myanmar are assessed in turn below:
Corporate Income Tax (CIT)
Myanmar residents and legally registered companies are subject to an income tax levied on net taxable profits at a 25%
tax rate. Non-resident companies authorised under the Foreign Investment Law to develop resource activities in Myanmar
are levied on Myanmar source income at a flat rate of 35% on net taxable profits. Companies and legal entities are
required to deliver advance payments on a monthly or quarterly basis within the taxable period (April 1st to March 31st)
calculated based on the estimated total income for the corresponding taxable year. Dividends paid to shareholders are
exempt from corporate income tax.
Companies are generally required by the IRD to file income tax returns together with the audited financial statements by
the end of June, within three months after the end of the taxable and accounting year if they have any taxable income.
Corrections can be made and the revised income tax return should be submitted before being assessed. Companies must
also file an annual report (Form E) with audited accounts and minutes of the annual general board of directors meeting to
78
the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration
Withholding Taxes within CIT
Withholding tax collected from non-resident individuals are regarded as income tax after final assessment. Apart from
payments related to trade market and property rights, other deductibles can be collected from the accessed tax amount.
Foreign resident citizens and resident foreigners, income taxes are being assessed based on their income and back
interest.

﻿Capital Gains Tax.
The sale or transfer of capital assets are levied for income tax purposes on gains calculated based on the difference
between gross sales and the purchase cost of assets plus any additions less depreciation. Capital assets for income tax
purposes are defined as lands, buildings, vehicles or any other asset owned by an entity including shares, bonds and
intangibles. Companies and non-resident individuals involved in hydrocarbon projects are taxed at a different rate.

Commercial Tax.
In Myanmar, a commercial tax is levied on the domestic sales of goods and services, imports of goods and business
activities, sales of goods and services and applies to certain transactions as defined in the Commercial Tax Law.
Commercial tax is applied to the gross sales of goods and gross income from services. For imported goods, commercial
tax is calculated based on landed cost derived from the cost determined by the customs, the custom duty levied, cargo
unloading charges combined. The tax rate varies from 5% to 100%. There are (60) goods and services exempted from
commercial tax.
Commercial tax is not applicable for exports, except in the case of natural gas, crude oil, timber, teak, jade, ruby,
sapphire, emerald, diamonds and other precious raw gemstones. Even though the Commercial Tax is not technically a
Value Added Tax (VAT), it contains certain characteristics of the latter, in the sense that companies and entities could
collect this charge from customers and consider it as an "output tax" payable to the tax administration on the one hand,
and as "input tax" when the business purchases goods in connection with the product or service sold (with the exception
of special items indicated in the Commercial Tax Law). It is important to note that only commercial tax paid on the

﻿acquisition of goods can be claimed as input tax and only under certain conditions are met. The MOF has plans to void
commercial tax and to introduce a value added taxaO
Customs Duties.
The Customs Tariff of Myanmar regulates the applicability of Customs Duties for the import of goods at rates that vary
from 0% to 40%. Companies registered under the Foreign Investment Law who have obtained permits by the MIC may be
exempted from customs duties, especially for pre-existing Production Sharing Contracts in the hydrocarbon industry.
Tax relief can be granted by the MIC for the import of machinery, instruments, equipment, machinery components, spare
parts and materials during the preoperative stage or construction phase. Raw materials for the first three years of
commercial production may also be exempted.
Stamp Duties.
The Myanmar Stamp Act defines the rules to implement Stamp Duties for various types of instruments payable in Kyats
such as:
Sale or transfer of immovable assets. The rates are 5% of the sale or transfer value fixed assets or immovable
properties plus 2% if the property is located in the Yangon development area;
Sale or transfer of shares, 0.3% tax rate;
Amount or value of secured bonds, 2% tax rate; and
Inheritance transfers of properties, 2% tax rate.
If the instrument is paid in other currencies, stamp duty payable in Myanmar currency is converted into a foreign currency
based on the prevailing foreign exchange rate of the day signing the instrument.
Property Tax.
This tax is levied on immovable assets located within the city development area imposed by the city development
committee with the aim of covering maintenance costs in the cities. Within Myanmar's tax legislation, there are a variety of
tax levies that apply to all taxpayers including entities that develop resource activities.
6.3 Extractive Industries Sector Non-Taxes: Oil and Gas
As of January 2014, there are 16 onshore and 19 offshore oil and gas blocks either in exploration or production, all of
which may be included in the first reconciliation process for oil and gas operations in Myanmar (due to be concluded in
January 2016). Under Myanmar law, each partner or participant in a hydrocarbon project is responsible for paying their
own taxes and non-taxes. Income tax is paid on a quarterly basis for the fiscal year starting the 1st of April and ending the
31st of March. Income tax for the previous years are assessed retrospectively when the annual statements and proper
documents are submitted. As noted in the section on auditing below, we were informed that the relevant SEE submits
audited accounts on behalf of the consortium, although this was not confirmed independently, via access to any sample
audited accounts.
With the exception of income taxes, since 2010, oil and gas companies have acted as withholding tax agents collecting
and paying taxes on salaries for national and expatriates. A land fee is also paid on a yearly basis for the area covered by
pipelines. Old Production Sharing Contracts are exempt from Customs Duties and Commercial taxes. In addition to the
above MOGE audits the cost recovery items on a yearly basis. All the above payments are delivered to MOGE as shown
in Figure 25.

Pipeline transit fees
It was not possible to find full information on pipeline transit fees during our project. However, we discovered that an
annual US$1m in transit fees is paid to Kanbauk township (both the Yadana and Yetagun pipelines pass through this
township in Tanintharyi Region). The fee is apparently paid directly by Total, however it is unclear to which account the
fee is paid into and whether this contributes directly to the budget. It was not possible to discover whether the Shwe Gas
pipeline also requires transit fees, or where and to whom these fees are paid. The scoping study should try to make
further assessments of this revenue stream with the support of MOGE.
Potential Leakages
All upstream activities are coordinated and controlled by MOGE. Investors are required to report and pay non-tax
payments and other contractual payments to MOGE on a regular basis in both local and foreign currencies. As noted
above, private companies have reported that they were sometimes requested to submit tax payments to MOGE instead
of to the IRD.
Section 23.7 of the model onshore contract assessed above (in Chapter Five) stipulates that payments to MOGE (which
are non-tax in nature) must be made in US$ but can be paid either to a bank in Myanmar or overseas. There is an
unfortunate precedence to this arrangement in Myanmar, involving both foreign accounts (based in Singapore and
"facilitated by the MFTB") and currency manipulation."

﻿The MSG may decide that the scoping study should determine which overseas banks are still used by the MFTB for the
extractive industries sector; what exchange rates are used and whether it will be possible to assess inflows and outflows
from these accounts into MFTB accounts. The MSG may also wish that the scoping study should also examine whether
there is a relationship between the Other Accounts held by the SEEs and these offshore payments and reconcile
payments made by companies to offshore accounts with revenue returns into the Myanmar banking system.
There is additionally the potential for the transfer of profits between downstream and upstream sections of oil and gas
operations in Myanmar, due to shared corporate ownership, which may reduce GOUM revenues.
6.4 Mining
The Foreign Investment Law allows foreigners and Myanmar citizens or ministries and organisations to engage in mining
exploration and exploitation through JVAs. Mining operators are required to contribute all capital investment and the
government receives a negotiated share of production. Operators are also required to pay signature bonuses, dead rent
and royalties.
Non-tax instruments that typically apply to the Mining industry in Myanmar are Royalties, Production Split, Land Fees,
Signature Bonuses and Licence Fees.
Royalties for Mining Projects are:
Precious metallic minerals from 5% to 7.5%;
Iron, copper, zinc, lead, etc. from 3% to 4%; and
Gold, silver, platinum from 4% to 5%.
The Signature Bonus should be paid within 30 days after the agreement is signed and Land Rent (also called "Dead
Rent") is payable on mineral prospecting and exploration stages, depending on the type of minerals. The PSC split is
generally 30% for State Owned Enterprises and 70% for investors. The MOM production take can be increased if
production increases.
Compared to the hydrocarbon and hydropower sectors, revenue collection for the mining industry is of greater complexity.
Not only is the taxation diversified by commodity value chains and mineral types but due to its interest and outreach
within the military holding companies. To add to the complexity, mining often takes place in "brown" areas where there is
at least partial control of mineral rents by EAGs.
Figure 26 below describes the general tax and non-tax rent dynamics within the mining sector for the a Large-Scale
mining company interviewed as part of this study: As per the responsibilities of each state owned mining enterprise,
Mining Enterprise 1 is in charge of controlling the exploration and production of Lead, Zinc, Silver, Copper, Iron and
Nickel. But during our interview with the company's representative, the production sharing split, land fees, and bonuses
generated from the exploration and exploitation of nickel are reported and paid to Enterprise No. 3. Royalties, which are a
non-tax rent, are apparently in one case paid directly to the IRD as well as all other taxes.
However, another informant well versed in mining finance stated that all non-tax revenues from mining operations
(including royalties) are received and controlled by mining enterprises and taxes by IRD. This discrepancy over who
collects royalties suggests that there is little or no clarity or consistency in revenue practices within the mining sector from
the very initial understanding of who should manage what within the mining enterprises. It was also not clear from our
interviews if there was a certain rule to pay in cash or in kind and if the payment was delivered in cash in which type of
currency for which kind of revenue type (taxes or non-taxes). The potential leakages described for the oil and gas sector
above (via the use of overseas accounts and questions to be asked about exchange rates and the amounts returned to
Myanmar) should also be asked of the mining sector.

Estimates show that Myanmar produces up to 90 percent of the world's rubies, with its best quality products, often described as "pigeon-blood" gems, fetching higher
prices than diamonds at some international auctions. Figures from the 2011-2012 fiscal year recorded 43,185 tonnes of jade and 13.398 million carats of precious stones
were recorded through official export channels. GOUM representatives were unable to provide data on the monetary value of these exports or how much was recouped in
tax.
Currently, there is a 30% commercial tax on all gem exports payable to the government and 10% retail tax at emporiums.

﻿6.5 Accounting Standards
The Myanmar tax regime is outdated and assessments are based on audited annual financial statements submitted from
the companies. Currently, the Internal Revenue Department is transforming its tax regime to "Self-Assessment System:
SAS" with the tax payer assessing his own tax liability.
Now, the EITI report must describe the distribution of revenues from resource rents82 whether in cash or in-kind recorded
or not in the national budget with reference to the relevant financial reports from entities such as sovereign wealth and
development funds, sub-national governments, SOE and other extra-budgetary sources. During the reconciliation
process, the Independent Administrator should apply international accounting and professional standards and be
perceived by the MSG as credible, trustworthy and technically competent. The Independent Administrator within
Requirement 5.2 for EITI implementation will be required to examine the audit and assurance procedures within
government and companies participating in the EITI reporting process and propose assurances to be provided by
companies and government entities. This could include the below:
Accounting practices in Myanmar have been historically based on British accounting standards and Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP). For several years, Myanmar adopted International Accounting Standards for reporting
purposes, while the Myanmar Accountancy Council (MAC), through the Myanmar Institute of Certified Accountants
(MICPA) has adopted the majority of International Accounting Standards that existed in 2003 and 2004. In 2010, the
MAC withdrew all 30 of International Accounting Standards and replaced them with 29 new Myanmar Accounting
Standards and 8 new Myanmar Financial Reporting Standards that were identical to the 2010 International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). Such standards were notified in the Official Gazette and became effective on 4th January
2011.
Myanmar currently has no stock exchange, only an over the counter market for the sale of a number of publicly
accountable companies share. Even though the MAC has made significant progress in adopting the latest International
Accounting Standards in Myanmar, it still needs to adopt the following:
Such IFRS measures would significantly assist in the implementation of EITI, given that the first reconciliation report must
be produced within 18 months after Myanmar becomes an EITI Candidate country. The MSG (perhaps advised by the
planned scoping study that follows this report) must also agree on appropriate provisions to safeguard confidential
information, agree on the level of disaggregation for the publication of data from the extractive industries and if possible
make EITI reports machine readable and code or tag EITI reports and data file so that the information can be compared
with other publicly available information.
The Foreign Investment Law allows foreign entities to open bank accounts prescribed by the Myanmar Investment
Commission in foreign and national currency authorized within a formal licence or contract. Also foreigners serving in any

Recently Myanmar implemented the following new laws/amendments:
On the 1st April, 2014 the IRD opened a Large Taxpayers Office in Yangon, suggesting that in the near future Myanmar
will modify its tax payment process for hydrocarbon activities to move to a self-assessment system.
6.6 The Auditing Process and EITI
In March 2012, the World Bank published a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report for Myanmar,
which includes details on the audit process. According to the PEFA, the OAG performs audits consistent with the
International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) audit standards. All SEEs are required to submit
financial reports that are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Standards. However, as noted above, this
does not include reporting on the Other Accounts, nor does it include auditing the Ministry of Defence (and companies
owned by the military, such as UMEHL). As the PEFA notes, the OAG was established under the 2008 constitution as an
independent agency, which is a ministerial equivalent under the law. The appointment of the Auditor General is made by
the President with the approval of Parliament. The Auditor General reports through the President to the Parliament and is
thus not fully independent. At present the OAG performs mainly financial audits, with limited performance and
procurement audits. Audit reports are expected to be submitted to the Parliament six months after the time the MOF
submits the financial statements to the OAG. However, in practice, audits can take many years to complete, with a the
process taking a minimum of eight months after the financial year and, according to officials, up to ten years in some
cases. During the mission, our team learnt that one IOC has not submitted an audit for several years.
There is apparently no legally defined time limit for the submission of audit reports to the OAG. The IRD reported that
there is no direct recourse to companies to request that they speed up the reporting process, and that sometimes they
are forced to pressurise the State/Region government where the company is based to access reports in a more timely
fashion.
All SEEs send financial reports to the OAG every six months. Meanwhile according to an interview with the OAG the
annual audit includes all tax and non-tax payments made by all partners to the extractives industries sector project (as we
were not able to view audited accounts this report is unable to confirm this). The OAG has the power to audit private
companies, but currently lacks the capacity and the resources to do so. The OAG works closely with the Public Accounts
Committee in Parliament, sending bi-annual summary reports to the PAC.
Role of the Public Accounts Committee in EITI
As noted in Chapter Two, the Pyithu Hluttaw PAC is a powerful standing committee that also operates as a joint
committee. One generic risk with EITI reporting whenever EITI is implemented is that EITI reports are not closely
integrated with public financial management processes in the executive branch, and analysis generated by EITI
implementation is therefore perceived by government (and parliament) as an external body of information, and are
therefore often not as relevant to good governance as they might be. The opportunity often missed is to integrate EITI
Adam  Smith                   Institutional and Regulatory Assessment of the Extractive Industries in Myanmar  103
International


﻿reporting processes more closely into reporting flows within government. One option here is for the PAC to be granted
powers of review over the draft EITI reports (along with the Office of the President). The other (weaker) option is for the
PAC to formally receive the final report once it has been concluded (discrepancies reduced/reconciled to a minimum) but
with no powers of review.
6.7 Final Remarks
During the research it was observed that the petroleum, mining and hydropower sectors have made significant progress
to come in line with international best practice by incorporating formal processes that will assist in managing Myanmar's
current resource wealth, with MOGE and the MOE taking the lead.
However, more efforts should be dedicated to reduce informal processes to control the possible leakage of revenues that
may be occurring, particularly within the mining industry. For the purpose of preparation of the MEITI scoping study, it is
suggested that the MSG evaluate the possibility of including companies and SEEs that are both already producing and
also those which expect to begin production of oil and gas, minerals, precious metals, gems and hydropower within the
18 month period after Myanmar became an EITI Candidate Country (in July 2014), in order to be able to reconcile tax and
non-tax payments originating from these sectors. Resource rents derived from the production of natural resources
typically occur several years after exploring and evaluating the commerciality of the natural resource through long-term
forecast of projected cash flows. Significant revenue streams start from the moment contracts are signed with the
payment of signature bonuses. This would therefore include the new PSCs resulting from the 2013-14 bid rounds.
In order to meet the first reporting date, which is due by or before 18 months from the time Myanmar becomes candidate
country, the MSG should review recommendations from the planned scoping study and agree on which types of tax and
non-tax instruments the extractive industries sector should consider. This will allow the GOUM to be able to effectively
evaluate the performance of the extractive industries sector and its impact in the economy of the nation and how these
rents contribute to the wellbeing of its citizens. In addition a "materiality threshold" should be agreed, below which
companies will not have their payments to government reconciled.
Finally, it is suggested that the MSG takes into consideration that there could be transfers of cash from the SEEs within
the MOE, MOM and MOEP to the MOF after oil, gas, mining and hydropower projects have paid their taxes and royalties.
It would be important to examine this potential issue during the scoping study, when determining how the EITI
reconciliation reporting mechanism will minimise duplications and delays in reconciling taxes and non-taxes.

﻿Chapter 7: Hydropower
7.1 Introduction
The regulatory framework for the power sector in Myanmar includes:
A new 2014 Electricity Law is currently being drafted.83 This Law will make provision for the formation of a new Electricity
Regulatory Commission and will define its roles and responsibilities.
As noted in Chapter Two, in January 2013 the GOUM established the National Energy Management Committee (NEMC).
The Military Vice President of the GOUM (currently U Nyan Tun) is the Committee Patron and the Union Minister for
Energy is its Chairman. It is intended that the implementation of the Myanmar Energy Policy will be guided by the NEMC
and supported by all concerned organisations, agencies and civil society. The GOUM has also constituted an Energy
Development Committee (EDC) to support the activities of NEMC. The EDC's role is to assess the appropriateness of the
institutional structure and the organisation of the energy sector entities, and to formulate a capacity building programme
to fulfil the long term needs of the sector.
The decision making power for medium-sized hydro plants (i.e. less than 30 MW), which had been directly under the
central government control has now been transferred to regional and state levels of government, in accordance with the
2008 Constitution. However, if the medium-sized hydro plant is to be connected to the national power grid, it will remain
under the decision making power of the GOUM.
The regulatory structure for the power sector is thus in a transition phase with the future framework to be established in
the new Electricity Law and the detailed regulation of the sector to be governed by the, yet to be established, Electricity
Regulatory Commission. The GOUM is also considering options for the privatisation of the power sector however it has
come across difficulties including low electricity tariffs and the poor condition of the distribution networks.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation is responsible for the construction of reservoirs and dams for water storage and
distribution to agricultural lands for the whole country.
7.2 The Ministry of Electric Power
The Ministry of Electric PowerB4 (MOEP) is responsible for the power sector. The MOEP has three departments with
responsibility for hydroelectric power:
The Department of Hydropower Planning (DHPP),
Department of Hydropower Implementation (DHPI), and
Hydropower Generation Enterprise (HPGE).
The DHPP plans hydropower projects that are to be implemented by:
MOEP itself,
By local provincial enterprises
By joint ventures with foreign investors
The DHPI has four institutes that are responsible for design, investigation, and mechanical work. The department also
has seven engineering construction companies for undertaking large hydropower projects. HPGE operates and maintains
83 This Bill is still being actively drafted and it is thus premature to comment upon it at this stage.
84 Formed by the merger of MOEP1 and MOEP2 in September 2012

﻿all of MOEP's hydropower stations, and participates in the operation and maintenance of power plants that are built as
joint ventures. HPGE also operates a coal-fired power plant. The construction of hydropower joint venture projects is
contracted out and the operator is the JV company.
7.3 Existing Hydro Projects
Before 1960, the Myanmar generation system consisted mainly of isolated grids supplied by diesel generators and mini-
hydropower. The first medium-scale hydropower plant, Baluchaung-2 (in central-east Myanmar about 420 km north of
Yangon), was commissioned in 1960 with an installed capacity of 84 MW. The plant was designed for an annual
production of 595 Gigawatt hours (GWh)s. The second stage of Baluchaung-2 was commissioned in 1974, with the same
rating and energy production as stage 1.
During the subsequent 30 years, another eight hydropower plants with a total capacity of 264MW were built with station
sizes ranging from 12 MW to 75 MW. In 2005, the 280 MW Paunglaung Hydropower Plant (about 20 km east of Nay Pyi
Taw) was commissioned. From 2005 to 2011, eight further power plants with a total capacity of 1,934 MW were built.
Two large-scale hydropower plants, Shweli-1, (600 MW) and Yeywa, (790 MW), were commissioned in 2008 and 2010,
respectively. Shewli-1 was built with the intention that part of its output was for export to China. The 240 MW Tapein-1
hydropower plant is also being developed by Chinese investors with 10% of the generated electricity to be made available
to the Myanmar central grid.
The agreement with China for Shweli-1 is that three of its six generating units will provide power to the Myanmar grid. Of
the total electricity generated, 50% will be provided at zero cost to Myanmar with the option of an additional 15% to be
provided at cost if this is required.
The hydroelectric power plants that were operational in 2012 are listed in Table 16.

The total operational capacity of hydro plants increased to 2,780MW in 2013. However, it is important to note that during
the summer months of 2013, hydro generation capacity was only 986MW (i.e. 35% of installed capacity) the hydro output
is reduced as a consequence of the low water inflow (see Figure 30). Despite the list of operating hydro plants in the table
above, it has been reported that only Shweli 1 is producing commercial quantities of electricity at present, with Dapein 1
still in start-up phase.
The Ministry of Electric Power is planning to complete the construction" of:
Nancho (40MW) and Phyu Chaung (40MW) in 2013/14
Upper Paunglaung (140MW) and Baluchaung 3 (52MW) in 2014/15
Upper Baluchaung (30MW) in 2015/16.
For on-going projects such as Tha-htay (111MW), Upper Yeywa (280MW), Upper Kyaing Taung (Keng Tawng)
(52MW), loan facilities are already in place. Middle Paunglaung (100 to 115MW) and Dedote (40 to 60MW) are
scheduled for implementation.
By 2013, the total number of dams and reservoirs was around 240 with most of the dams (including the
multipurpose dams) having hydro units installed. The Sedawgyi, Kinda,Thaphanseik, Mone, Yenwe, Khapaung,
and Kyi-on-Kyiwa (Kyee On Kyee Wa) power plants generate power as determined by the availability of water for
irrigation.
The GOUM strategy" for the expansion of the power system over the period to 2030 is to develop the following energy
mix:
7.4 Power Exports
With the commissioning of the Shweli 1 (2009) and Dapein 1 (2011) projects, Myanmar commenced preparation for
power exports to China. Total exports to China in 2011 were 1,723GWh."1 If these exports are valued at 7 US cents per
kilowatt hour" (the reported market price in the Southern Union Grid in China), they would have been worth US$120
million for that year. If hydro projects continue to be developed for export then the value of energy exported could rise
dramatically. There are no operational joint ventures with Thailand at present, although there are proposals for hydro
plants close to the Thai border.
86 Note that the capacities of these stations quoted here are not fully consistent with those given in tables 17 and 18 below.

﻿7.5 Potential for Hydro Development
The MOEP defines three categories of hydro development:
Ministry only development (i.e. funded from their budget);
Local entrepreneurs - on a Joint Venture (JV) Build Operate Transfer (BOT) basis; and
Foreign Direct Investment on a Joint Venture BOT basis.
Under a BOT contract the private sector will build and operate the plant and eventually transfer ownership of the project
to the government.
Details of the proposed projects"o under each of these three categories are listed in tables 17, 18 and 19 below. The hydro
potential is huge and offers the possibility of some very large business opportunities.
The value of annual hydro production would be in excess of US$15 billion were all the FDI projects (41GW) to proceed.
However (and as will be explored in more depth in the following chapter) it is vital that any such projects are developed
within an appropriate regulatory framework and that careful attention is paid both to the environmental impact and the
equitable sharing of project benefits.
7.6 Hydro Project Economics
In order to establish whether a given hydro scheme will be economic, the net present value91 (NPV) of the benefits
associated with the electricity produced should be compared with the NPV of the costs (capital and operating costs).
Each of the cost streams (capital and operating costs) is discounted from the time at which costs are incurred to the
reference date that is being used for the analysis (often the first year in which expenditure takes place). Likewise the
project revenue streams are also discounted from the year in which the revenue is generated to the reference date. If the
NPV of the revenues exceeds the NPV of the project costs then, from an economic perspective, the project is economic
at the chosen discount rate and the project should proceed as soon as funding is available.
There are a number of specific issues that need to be resolved for a multipurpose scheme including:
The ownership of the overall scheme and the ownership of the electro-mechanical equipment for power
generation;
The operational responsibilities of the dam and power generation equipment;
A water sharing agreement between the various interested parties;
The allocation of the costs and benefits of the scheme between the parties involved; and
To whom is the power output sold and on what commercial terms.
Annual operation and maintenance costs for a hydro plant are often quoted as a percentage of the investment cost per
kW per annum. Typical values range from 0.5% to 4% and the International Energy Agency assumes a figure of 2.2% for
large hydropower projects. This figure would usually include the refurbishment of the mechanical and electrical equipment
such as turbine overhaul, generator rewinding and replacement of communication and control systems after around 20
years of operation.
'o Note that there appear to be various inconsistencies in the project details provided in these tables. The spelling of a given power plant can also vary.
-Q The present value of a time series of cash flows. It is a standard method for using the time value of money to appraise long-term projects.

﻿7.7 The Approval Process for Developing New Hydro Plants
The development of a new FDI Joint Venture BOT hydro project92 involves the following stages:
Concession rights are granted to developers for between 30 and 60 years.
A similar process is required for a JV BOT project to be built by local entrepreneurs but for such projects the final stage is
not required.
92 Hydro projects with a capacity of less than 30MW are the responsibility of the State governments. The development procedures are the same and the
Ministry of Power will provide assistance to the State as required.
93 Projects are normally financed on the basis of a 70/30 debt equity ratio. In the past most debt for hydro projects has been raised in China. We were
informed that the first call on project revenues is to pay the interest on the loan and to repay the project loan itself. The loan should be fully repaid within
the BOT term of 30 years.
94 These must be produced by an independent third party.

﻿7.8 Joint Venture Companies
Once a concession has been approved a JVA is signed which establishes a JV company comprising the developer and
the MOEP. The JVA specifies the Board of Directors (which must include two directors from the Ministry of Electric
Power) and the laws and regulations that must be observed (the tax law, FDI law).
A JV company can be responsible for a number of hydro projects95. Each hydro project, however, requires a separate
JVA.
The JVA agreement will specify:
The MOEP will also have an option to purchase up to 40% of the project output at the "market price". The market price is
defined as the price in the Southern Union Grid in China (as stated above the current market price of the Southern Union
Grid in China is 7 US cents per kilowatt hour"). However the price is also is adjusted according to the capacity of the
hydro project (the larger the project, the lower the applicable price).
There are thus a total of four taxes that a developer of a hydroelectric project would pay to the IRD. In addition, the
Government would be entitled to a dividend stream associated with its free equity in the JV Company. The dividend
stream would be dependent upon (a) the profitability and (b) the dividend policy of the JV Company. Profitability would be
the difference between the revenue (i.e. the unit sale price times the number of units sold) and the project cost (return to
equity holders, debt repayment and operating costs).
The annual operation and maintenance cost is deemed to be 3.5%97 of the capital cost.
A Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), which specifies the purchase price for the hydro output, is agreed annually with the
buyer. This annual agreement of the power price implies a significant risk for a long-term (30 to 50 year) concession
arrangement.
7.12 Reporting
Joint venture partners to MOEP send monthly fiscal reports to the Budget Department of the MOF. These reports provide
information on domestic sales of the free share of electricity sold by the MEPE. In addition, each JV company is externally
audited annually, with the audit reports submitted to the Office of the Auditor General and the MOF. At the time of
completing this report (July 2014), Shweli 1 has been audited five times, whereas Tapein 1's first audit is currently being
prepared. The audited accounts for each joint venture company are confidential. Making the accounts available for an
EITI-appointed independent administrator would therefore require a legal framework developed by the MSG and
formalised and approved by the GOUM.

﻿Chapter 8: Society and the Environment
For decades, Myanmar citizens who live in project-affected areas have been subjected to large-scale natural resource
extraction and development without adequate environmental management and social protection controls in place.98 This
is slowly changing as the current administration begins to establish improved environmental legislation. The GOUM is
also developing the technical capacity to allow greater public participation in decision-making around natural resource
development. While a new environmental law is in place and rules for ESIAs are beginning to be enforced, there is little
legislation on social impacts. Additionally social impacts have conventionally received very little attention in Myanmar, as
under the previous government the freedom of speech and association necessary to gain attention for these issues did
not exist.
This chapter provides information on environmental and social matters as they relate to the extractive industries operating
in Myanmar. Firstly, a brief "snapshot" of the key social and environmental conditions or indicators will be presented to
provide context. The chapter will then outline the existing regulatory and institutional framework for environmental and
social impact assessments (ESIAs) and impact management related to the extraction of minerals and oil and gas. Finally,
some key current environmental and social impacts of the extractive industries sector will follow the discussion of the
formal legal framework to provide concrete examples of where the government's current environmental and social
safeguards practices are inadequate. Specific regulatory information related to hydropower development is found in
Chapter Seven above. Reference will be made to the controversial (and now suspended) Myitsone Dam at the end of this
section to provide an example of how social (including peace and security issues) and environmental concerns related to
its construction have been serious enough to halt the project, in all likelihood for the short, medium and perhaps even
long term.
8.1 The Policy and Legal Framework
The 2008 Constitution of Myanmar provides for the conservation of Myanmar's physical environment and enables the
passing of environmental legislation by Parliament. Informing Myanmar's environmental management framework is the
National Environment Policy of Myanmar, 1994. Based on this policy, the MOECAF developed the current Environment
Conservation Law, 2012. Since the law was promulgated, the ministry has been preparing accompanying regulations to
bring life to the principles embedded in the law, including the ESIA Procedures, which, at the time of writing have not yet
been finalised.
The National Environment Policy
The policy was proclaimed through the Gazette in accordance with Notification No. 26/94 dated 5 December 1994, of the
GOUM. A description of environmental legislation that has been developed on the basis of this policy is included in Table
20.

﻿Social Obligations
Some extractive industries sector companies are engaged in quite substantive CSR initiatives on a voluntary basis (as
outlined in section 4.11 of this report). In the absence of any kind of legal requirement or framework for community
development, such as a Community Development Agreement (CDA); an Impacts and Benefits Agreement (IBA); or a
Social and Labour Plan (SLP), companies are only required to mitigate negative impacts around the extractive industries
(as per the Environmental Conservation Law, 2012), not to contribute to development. The tendency is for companies to
contribute voluntarily to obtain a de facto "social licence to operate", especially in areas where there is conflict, competing
land uses, relocation of people or economic activities.00 Some CSO sceptics maintain that it easier for foreign owned
companies to construct schools and hospitals, than address land expropriation issues, human rights concerns and
environmental management.
Labour (Social Protection)                           Figure 31: Jade Mining in Myanmar (Thevelvetrock.com)
Labour laws in Myanmar\ are out-dated. There is no single
employment law, instead a number of laws including the
Leave and Holiday Act (1951), the Factories Act (1951),
Workman's Compensation Act (1923), Employment and
Training Act (1950) and others, are used as required. The
country is in the process of strengthening its labour laws
and has passed legislation providing worker rights
regarding organised labour. In Myanmar, strikes were
effectively banned until modern labour legislation was
enacted in October 2011, notably, the Labour Organisation
Law. Additions to the legal labour management framework
such as the Settlement of Wage Dispute Law, 2012 have
been recognised as a positive step forward but weaknesses
still exist (ILO, 2013).
In addition to the above-mentioned laws, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the GOUM have agreed to a
mechanism that gives Myanmar citizens the right to lodge complaints alleging the use of forced labour. This complaints
mechanism is designed to allow genuine victims of forced labour, with the assistance of the ILO Liaison Officer, an
opportunity to seek redress and/or remedies from the government authorities in full confidence that no retaliatory action
will be taken against them.

8.2 Institutional Arrangements for Social and Environmental Regulation
Since the development of larger scale mining, oil and gas projects require foreign investment, the institutional
arrangements most relevant to this study are included here. The overarching legislative framework for these requirements
can be found in the Foreign Investment Law and the Foreign Investment Rules, both of 2013 (and already analysed in
Chapter Two above).
Key Institutions Related to Social and Environmental Management
Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry (MOECAF)
"Responsible for environmental protection (including ESIAs/ESMPs) related to any development project and for managing
the forests of Myanmar. In terms of how decisions are made internally (within MOECAF), The National Environmental
Conservation Committee was formed in 2004 and re-formed in April 2011, and now serves as the focal organisation for
environmental matters. It is chaired by MOECAF, formerly the Ministry of Forestry; the Committee's membership includes
19 ministries. The Director General of the Department of Planning and Statistics in MOECAF serves as the secretary. In
September 2011, the name of the Ministry of Forestry was changed to Ministry of Environmental Conservation and
Forestry (MOECAF) with the aim of developing a body dedicated to environmental conservation measures. Four
institutions under MOECAF are performing their specific duties and responsibilities mainly related to environmental
conservation and forestry." (ADB, 2013).
Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development (MNPED)
The MNPED is responsible for coordinating economic development initiatives through coordinated planning across all
ministries as noted in Chapter Two. Three officials from the MNPED sit on the thirty-nine member ESIA Report Review
team which is currently assessing the draft ESIA report for the Letpadaung copper project.
Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC)
The MIC is responsible for assessing proposals for investment into all business related sectors in Myanmar; ensures that
the social and environmental responsibilities of investors are vetted through MOECAF before a permit is awarded. The
MIC has a key role in implementing the Foreign Investment Law, 2013.
Line Ministries
The line ministries are responsible for managing particular sectors (economic, social and administrative). They provide
technical input into proposals for investment, ensuring that the investor has the technical, financial and other relevant
capabilities related to the project. As noted above, the Mines Law 1994 contains provisions related to environmental
conservation and to compensation for land expropriation. The PSCs that MOGE manages and that govern the petroleum
sector (at least the model PSC) has general environmental protection provisions, but lack specificity.
Region/State Administrations
These are responsible for the administration of local governance in the regions and states of Myanmar. The sub-national
units provide comments on the social and environmental aspects of an application for investment into Myanmar.

﻿The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare
The ministry is responsible for the social security and labour relations in Myanmar; as well as for the development of
social and labour legislation and monitoring, including a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) framework."o'
8.3 Social and Environmental Issues Related to Extractive Industries Sector
Development (where the formal regulatory system has failed)
This section presents examples of social and environmental issues related to mining (various sizes) and energy related
projects. The discussion is not intended to be exhaustive, rather to illustrate the prevalence and types of problems
experienced by project-affected communities who often suffer the consequences of negative impacts, either on their air,
soil and water supply, or from dislocation, lack of compensation and loss of economically generating activities.
The examples put forward here are mostly legacy problems, resulting from years of military rule and civil war in which
communities, particularly but not exclusively in conflict areas, had little power to vocalise their dissatisfaction with the way
natural resource extraction affected their lives. Although the country is undergoing reform, mindsets, influences, and
hierarchies of power from earlier eras persist and will take years to change.
While the MOM   has been bound by a degree of      Figure 32: Armed Forces move in to stop protesters
environmental conservation application in the 1994 minerals  ploughing fields near the Letpadaung Copper Mine
legislation, the detail of these requirements has been lacking  development (EarthFirstNews.org)
and the enforcement extremely weak. In addition, the MOM
was the direct operator of many mines (with privatisation
only starting in 2011), and hence, occupied a position of
being both operator and regulator, untenable in terms of
good governance or public accountability.
The Mines Law also specifies requirements related to
labour-management matters but as the examples presented
here illustrate, there has been limited enforcement of these
requirements. Interviews with officials from the relevant
ministries during our research indicated unfamiliarity with
internationally accepted practices of mine inspection.
Tighter regulations related to ESIA/ESMP processes and
social protection through labour legislation have only
recently been introduced into the country. It is recognised
that it will take some time before there is sufficient technical
and resource capacity to implement the new regulations and
mainstream  them  across  the  relevant government
departments.
However, for the purpose of this study, it is useful to present examples of how poor environmental, social and labour
practices of the past continue to affect communities of Myanmar - those under formal government control, those under
EAG control, and those in areas where there are both formal and informal governance structures.
'0 Our team did not meet with the Ministry of Labour, therefore this report contains no substantive information on the SIA framework under that ministry.

The table below cites examples where the regulatory process failed to deal adequately with problems related to oil and
gas development in Myanmar. It is important to note that given the lead role that MOGE occupies in this sector's
operations and regulation, the PSC between MOGE and the company is the primary legal mechanism that governs
corporate behaviour, including social and environmental management. For new PSCs, the Environment Conservation
Law of 2012 specifies that before a contract is signed an ESIA must be conducted and an ESMP must be prepared
following the ESIA. The current model PSC requires that the developer initiate corporate social responsibility activities in
the contract area.

﻿Chapter 9: Implications for EITI
While this report serves as a baseline assessment of the extractive industries sector in Myanmar with a focus on
information, context and analysis rather than providing explicit recommendations, there are nonetheless aspects of the
analysis above that have clear implications for the future implementation of EITI in Myanmar. Now that Myanmar has
been recognised officially as an EITI candidate country and has until January 2016 to produce its first EITI report, what
follows are a set of broad reflections on how the findings of this report can be brought to bear on the next eighteen
months of EITI implementation in Myanmar. These "implications for EITI" will take into account the broader reform agenda
and a brief capacity assessment within the institutions that will directly implement EITI. Given the specificity of Myanmar's
history and the complex nature of its extractive industries sector (defined for the purpose of this report as oil and gas,
mining and hydropower), what is required above all else is an innovative approach to implementing EITI that takes
account of the key features of the political economy of the country. It may be, for instance, that instead of a monolithic
approach to EITI reports, the MEITI MSG decides to take a sector-by-sector route, producing separate but parallel reports
on oil and gas, mining and other sectors it decides to include in the scope of EITI.
Peace Process
There is a wealth of literature on the linkage between natural resource extraction and the long-running conflict in
Myanmar. Research for this report, particularly the field visits, highlighted this linkage. Careful consideration will need to
be given to sequencing of EITI reporting and how to incorporate extractive operations currently in conflict affected areas,
in the context of efforts to secure a national ceasefire and the ensuing political dialogue.
Contracts and Beneficial Ownership
There is no reason why new contracts and agreements in the oil and gas, mining and hydropower sectors cannot become
public documents, in line with emerging global trends towards contract transparency. The MSG may wish the scoping
study that follows this report to explore this idea in some depth.
The EITI 2013 Standard introduced the idea that beneficial ownership of extractive industries sector operations should be
considered as part of the work of EITI reporting. A publicly available register (including beneficial ownership information)
is recommended, whereas government and state-owned enterprises, as well as joint ventures not publicly listed must also
disclose their beneficial owners. This requirement may be a significant issue for MEITI, starting from the first report (for
the 2014-15 financial year). In the course of conducting research for the preparation of this report, a list of nearly 30
beneficial owners in the oil, gas and mining sectors was identified, indicating that despite sensitivities, it is possible to
obtain beneficial ownership information. A study on beneficial ownership is planned as part of the MEITI work plan, and
the MSG will need to take a holistic perspective on the issue, balancing the recommendations and requirements of the
2013 Standard against what is collectively taken to be in the realm of being feasible in Myanmar.
Access To I Quality of Information
There are a range of issues related to access to and the quality of information in circulation about the extractive industries
sector in Myanmar. The first major issue is philosophical in nature and involves an appreciation of the means by which
information and knowledge was historically produced under military rule. Wherever required, reports within government
stated the necessary context, hierarchies, relationships and patronage networks and often had no relationship with the
truth. For example, the production data reporting system upon which mining statistics are generated likely bears little
relationship to actual mining production volumes. This issue is compounded by widespread tax avoidance in the mining
sector, with revenues often up to ten times larger in reality than the figures that appear in government reports. The culture
of companies having two sets of books is endemic and will take considerable time and upgrading of enforcement
practices to wean out.
Sequencing
Information from mining in conflict-affected areas is likely to be a challenge in the first years of EITI reporting. Information
forwarded for EITI reporting may be patchy and involve under-reporting of the production volumes. In particular, this
Adam  Smith                   Institutional and Regulatory Assessment of the Extractive Industries in Myanmar  124
International


﻿applies to jade, gemstones and gold mining in Kachin State, various mineral types in Shan state, as well as gold mining in
Kayin State. A sensitive and gradualist approach to increasing the scope of EITI reporting applies to Myanmar more than
to perhaps any other EITI implementing country.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
A more technical issue is the Myanmar Accountancy Council adopting the remaining IFRS measures (9-13) in good time
ahead of the first MEITI report. The MSG may wish the scoping study to examine what would be involved in the adoption
of these measures from a legal, institutional and technical perspective.
Confidentiality clauses in existing extractive industries sector contracts and agreements will need to be reviewed, in order
to facilitate EITI reporting. Alternatively (or in addition), some form of executive order or formal notification from the
GOUM will be required to mandate the submission of audited accounts to the independent administrator. This process of
authorisation will also need to take place in advance of the scoping study.
There is a "quick win" opportunity to include a short reference to compliance with EITI reporting requirements in the draft
laws currently in parliament (for mining, petroleum and hydropower). The clause need only have words to the effect of
"Reports submitted by licence-holders must be in accordance with the requirements of the Myanmar Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative as determined by the multi-stakeholder group."
A government directive will need to be put in place in advance of any MEITI reports relating to the mining sector, to
ensure that all companies required to report, do report.
Auditing Delays
In terms of EITI reporting processes, delays in the submission of audit reports by the SEEs to the OAG will necessarily
mean delays to the production of EITI reports themselves. On present form, it will not be possible for all oil and gas
operations (whether from producing fields or acreages in exploration) as well as all large-scale mining companies to be
audited in time for an EITI report to be published within a year on the financial year in question. The MEITI MSG may
therefore decide, at least initially, for the first EITI report to be based on a previous financial year (e.g. for the 2016 MEITI
report to be based on 2013-14), or the decision may be made to include and reconcile 2014-15 data, but not on the basis
of audited reports. Alternatively, the MSG may decide to do both. The scoping study following on from this report should
recommend options in this regard. Again, the MSG (and the GOUM) may choose to solicit back-office capacity support to
the OAG specifically for the first EITI report to ensure that audit reports have been comprehensively assessed within the
time window permitted to conclude a first report by January 2016. Finally, support to the OAG should also take into
account both the Ministry of Financie's Modernization of Public Financial Management programme and the planned
support to MOGE on reporting and management processes from the US State Department.
Inclusion of Pre-Operational Companies
The MSG may wish to consider for inclusion in the first reconciliation report extractive operations currently in
planning/exploration phase that may come on stream within 18 months of July 2014 (the date MEITI became an EITI
candidate country), as significant payments such as signature bonuses will be made to government in this period.
Hydro
Hydro development in Myanmar has huge potential with billions of dollars of annual revenues possible, depending upon
the extent of the development. EITI platforms and even sub-national MSGs (developed in time) would provide the ideal
space for this dialogue to happen. More practically, in terms of EITI reporting, the MOEP informed us that they already
produce audited accounts for the power sector which could be submitted as part of the EITI process. There is therefore
no significant reason why the hydropower sector should not be considered by the MEITI MSG to be included within scope
of the first EITI report.
The Dangers of Over-Expectation
Despite the tireless outreach efforts of both MDRI and the recently formed MATA coalition, there is relatively weak
understanding of EITI even among core stakeholder groups in Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw. The risk most closely
associated with this sketchy understanding is that EITI can quickly be viewed as a panacea to the governance challenges
Adam  Smith                   Institutional and Regulatory Assessment of the Extractive Industries in Myanmar  125
International


﻿in Myanmar. The reality is, implementing EITI in Myanmar will not directly address the problem of land
appropriation/confiscation and human rights abuses, or offer solutions to pollution and other environmental damage.
***** Finally, EITI will not provide recommendations on how best to distribute natural resource wealth to promote
economic development across the country. EITI is most effectively implemented where it plays a narrow but focused role
in improving the quality of extractives information and analysis and being a platform for discussions around that
information to take place. This therefore poses a specific set of communication challenges for the MEITI MSG and the
MEITI Secretariat. MEITI therefore must design and implement a sophisticated, well-resourced and responsive
communication campaign to clearly communicate what EITI is and the specific benefits it can provide, but also to manage
expectations and communicate what EITI is not and what benefits it cannot be expected to deliver.
Role of Government Institutions
MDRI's role as the secretariat for EITI will slowly transition to government during 2015, with the MEITI Secretariat in
future residing in the Budget Department of the MOF. This will require transition planning. This will shift the question of
whether there is sufficient capacity to effectively implement EITI onto the core government institutions, the MOF, the
Auditor General and the line ministries. One risk of EITI everywhere is that the appointed independent administrator (the
firm contracted to conduct the EITI report) does not transfer analytical and methodological knowledge to the institution
that hosts EITI (and the government agencies most closely associated with EITI through MSG participation).
In addition, in the immediate aftermath of candidacy recognition, there is now an opportunity for the MSG to discuss
whether the full range of government institutions are involved in EITI. There should, for instance, be a discussion on
whether the MNPED should play a more central role. More specifically, the MSG may want to consider whether the
Central Statistical Organisation (CSO)should be involved in EITI, in particular if this organisation and its capacity is
strengthened. One option would be for EITI data to be given the CSO imprimatur. If the CSO were involved in the EITI
reporting process, EITI capacity building into the CSO would have the added benefit of improving the statistical
competence of the CSO more generally. This is however only a suggestion, not a recommendation and there may be
good reasons why EITI should be kept separate from the work of the CSO that the MSG may also wish to consider.
Civil Society
The MATA coalition has developed remarkably quickly and benefits from a disciplined informed and focused leadership.
In addition, the decentralised decision-making structure of the coalition will contribute to a diverse range of views. While
MATA may function effectively at the national level, it is likely that the sub-national coalitions are on the one hand, closer
to the real issues that communities face from extractive industries sector operations in their midst, on the other hand, less
capacitated to effectively address those challenges and advocate responses to the sub-national government. In addition,
historical legacies and the contemporary political-economy realities of state and region governments mean that local
groups often face more pressure to stay silent than those operating at national level. EITI in Myanmar is likely to be
tested by pressures to limit the free expression of civil society views at sub-national level. For Myanmar to proceed from
being a candidate country to full compliance with EITI, further legal protection for CSOs may need to be considered in
future.
The Scoping Study
The scoping study will determine which companies should be included within the first MEITI report and what payment
flows they will need to report on. It is likely (and widely expected) that the oil and gas sector will require full reporting, in
terms of disaggregated "project-by-project" reporting, as well as beneficial ownership analysis (including the most recent
bid rounds). It is also likely that the major mining projects in the country will also be included (a reasonable expectation
would be that the materiality threshold could be set to include the top twenty or thirty mining projects, any smaller number
would be too small a percentage of total mining sector contributions to the economy, any larger number might pose too
many logistical and information-based challenges to the independent administrator, although all large mining licences
may be considered). The jade and gemstones sector brings with it a unique set of challenges for EITI reporting, however,
there is in principle no issue with reconciling payments to and from the formal annual government Gems Emporium.
The MSG will have to draw up a detailed terms of reference for this scoping study and will receive advice and support in
doing this from the EITI International Secretariat. The MSG may wish to consider the following for inclusion in the scoping
study:
Recommend which companies/projects/sectors should report and when;

Institutional and regulatory assessment of the extractive industries in Myanmar
January, 2014
Analytical Context
Studies have shown that when governance is good natural resources can be an important engine for growth and
sustainable development. On the other hand, when governance is poor, countries dependent on these resources
are disproportionately susceptible to poverty, corruption and conflict. For countries with extractive industries, a
central developmental challenge is how to turn the resource curse into a resource blessing. Broad agreement
exists on the appropriate macroeconomic and technical policies and institutional mechanisms to put in place to
manage the resource paradox successfully. But it is also recognized that the key determinants of success for
countries rich in extractive industries are the overall governance framework and the political economy of rent
extraction and natural resource management. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is a
global reporting standard which promotes greater transparency and accountability in extractive industries
through reporting of government revenue collection, analysis of industry structures and facilitation of
stakeholder consultation. Thirty-nine countries are members of EITI, of these 23 are fully compliant while 16
are candidate countries. Initiated in 2001, EITI has grown in reach and importance as a measure for improving
extractive industries governance and helping countries manage the resource paradox. Several developed
economies, including Australia, Germany, and the US are piloting or working toward EITI candidacy. In 2013
the reporting requirements were expanded.
EITI and Myanmar's Reform
In less than two years, Myanmar has undergone unprecedented political and economic reforms. Elections were
held in December 2010 and a mostly civilian government took office in March 2011. The new Government has
embarked on a range of political and economic reforms aimed at attaining national reconciliation, improving
political and economic governance, re-integration of Myanmar with the global economy, and economic
development. Key reforms include agreements with non-state armed opposition groups, release of political
prisoners, free by-elections, the first ever open parliamentary discussions of the budget, near elimination of the
previously very stringent controls on media and public expression, and a general push for enhanced
transparency and accountability of government.
These changes are dramatic but there is much to be done. Myanmar has suffered from decades of authoritarian
military rule, the longest running civil wars in the world, entrenched rural poverty, and mistrustful state -
society relations. The country has among the worst social indicators in Asia, GDP per capita is between $800
and $1,000, and perceptions of corruption surveys rank the country as the second most corrupt in the world.
The reform is still fragile and has yet to translate into improved well-being for citizens, amid high expectations.
Improved economic governance will play an essential role in securing the success of the reform process,
credibility for the government, and translating reform into socio-economic gains for the majority of the
population. A critical area is Myanmar's large and growing natural resource sector, including oil, gas, mining,
and gemstones. Currently these sectors officially account for an estimated 35% of total exports, most of which
attributed to gas. With the commencement of new gas operations during 2013, the contribution from extractives
to total export is expected to exceed 50%. This does not account for large, unreported earnings from the gem
trade.

﻿Current off-shore gas production is estimated at 1,200 million cubic feet (MCF) per day, of which 900 MCF is
exported. Central Statistical Office reported total sales figures in an amount of US$ 3.5 billion in 2011-12. 2013
is expected to see new gas fields coming into production at a rate of 800 MCF per day. The bulk of earnings
come from the Yadana and Yetagun off-shore gas fields which export gas directly to Thailand. A newly
constructed gas and crude oil pipeline from near Sittwe to Yunnan was inaugurated in July, 2013, to export gas
from the Shwe fields. All operations are guided by standard Production Sharing Contracts in which government
revenue is to be collected from (a) sign-on bonus, (b) royalty, (c) production split, and (d) taxes. These
contracts are managed by Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprises, a state owned company.
Gemstone sales are considered to be the second-most important revenue stream for government although exact
figures are not available. Presently, mining activities are conducted in a limited scale with reported export
figures in 2011-12 of some US$ 70 million. Notwithstanding, the number of operators is large with an
estimated 2,500 gemstone licenses plus an additional 1,500 active mining licenses. At the same time, investor
interest indicates that a strong surge in activity can be expected over the coming years.
Although an important source of government revenue, impacts from the extractive sector on the local economy
are less notable since employment creation in the industry is limited and supply of oil and gas for the domestic
market does not meet the actual and potential demand (e.g. national electrification rate is less than 25%).
Further, oil, gas, and mining have been frequently subject of allegations of lack of transparency and
accountability, due to the lack of publicly available information about contracting arrangements, payments
made by companies, volumes of revenues received, and destination of revenues and extent to which revenues
are included in budget. In addition, joint venture companies owned by the Myanmar military have participating
interests, particularly in the mining sector. Finally, many of Myanmar's natural resources are concentrated in
the ethnic minority states and regions, home to the world's longest running civil wars, and have fuelled
generations of conflict.
Government Commitment
In December 2012, the Myanmar Government announced its intention to implement the EITI. This constitutes a
welcome step in improving governance in Myanmar. Not only will compliance with EITI provide an
unprecedented level of transparency with regard to revenues, it will provide a platform for discussion of larger
policy goals with regard to accountable development of mineral and hydrocarbon resources and the use of the
revenues earned from their extraction. As investment increases and mineral and hydrocarbon exploitation rises,
it is of great importance that the extractive industries in Myanmar are subject to an accounting process which
transparently records the licensing procedures and reports the flow of funds from companies to central or local
authorities. Such a system would help to improve Myanmar's investment climate, sustain tax collection,
support the national dialogue on development of natural resources, and enhance the credibility of the reform
process.
Since the public announcement, there has been substantial progress toward EITI candidacy, and the President
and leading Cabinet ministers continue to make strong statements of support the EITI. A cabinet-level Leading
Authority has been established to oversee the implementation of the EITI, under the leadership of U Soe Thane,
Minister in the President's Office and one of the lead reformers. The members of the Leading Authority include
(i) the President's Office, (ii) the Ministry of Finance and Revenue, (iii) the Ministry of Energy, (iv) the
Ministry of Mines, and (v) the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry. The Center for Economic
and Social Development under Myanmar Development Resources Institute (MDRI-CESD) was asked by the
President to take on the role as Coordinator to implement all the necessary tasks required to form the MSG and
accomplish other EITI-related objectives. MDRI-CESD has established a Myanmar EITI office and
appointed/recruited an EITI team. Capacity and knowledge of EITI within the MDRI team has deepened
significantly. MDRI has undertaken a continuous stream of meetings, formal and informal, with Government,

﻿civil society, and operators in order to build awareness, maintain support, and complete the steps necessary for
Myanmar to become a candidate. In addition civil society, with support from Pyoe Bin and Revenue Watch
Institute, has undertaken a wide range of outreach and awareness raising activities. EITI receives regular
attention in Myanmar's recently free and vibrant media.
It is anticipated that the MSG will hold its first meeting in early January2014. Civil society has created a
representative national structure for the purposes of selecting MSG representatives. In July 2013 Government
appointed a Working Committee of high level officials to progress EITI candidacy and it is anticipated that this
will form the basis of Government representation on the MSG. The Working Committee includes an expanded
suite of ministries, as well as the Union Attorney General's office. Deputy Minister of Finance, Dr. U Maung
Maung Thein is chair of the Working Committee. Operators have selected their representatives to the MSG.
Work has started on a TOR for the MSG. It is anticipated that Myanmar will prepare its candidacy application
to target the March or June 2014 EITI Board meeting, and that the October Board meeting will be held in
Myanmar.
The World Bank, together with DflD, is the lead source of international support to EITI in Myanmar, providing
advice on task planning, sequencing, and technical matters to MDRI, as well as coordinating overall donor
support to EITI through informal monthly donor meetings. With funding from DflD, the World Bank is also
recruiting high-level technical expertise to carry out a series of studies, including Scoping Study, Legal Review,
and technical training.
Purpose of the Assignment
It is proposed to conduct an institutional and regulatory analysis of the extractive industries in Myanmar
including hydrocarbon, mining, gemstone and hydropower. The outcome of the study is expected to be an
improved understanding of the political economy context and the value chain of moving mineral deposits to the
market, including the various drivers that stand to influence EITI implementation and extractive sector
governance in general. The analysis will be designed and conducted jointly with MDRI and draw on a recent
political economy analysis conducted by the Pyoe Bin, a civil society strengthening project funded by DflD.
The output will be a report.
1. Scope of work
The consultant will undertake a political economy analysis, focused particularly on institutional and regulatory
arrangements, of the extractive industries in Myanmar along the lines of the "Extractive Industries Value
Chain" approach and in light of the implementation of EITI. The study both build on an Options Study already
completed and will also serve as a "pre-scoping" study in anticipation of a full scoping study once the MSG has
been established and taken decisions on the scope of EITI in Myanmar, based on the Options Study.
The El value chain is focusing on:
1. Transparent, non-discretionary award of extractive contracts, including assessment of land issues related
to extractive contracts;
2. Good practices in legal, contractual, regulatory, and institutional frameworks, including continuous
capacity building for monitoring and regulatory compliance;
3. Sound and fair fiscal practices for the collection of taxes and royalties, including adequate
administrative and audit capacity, internationally accepted accounting and reporting standards, and
regular public reporting;
4. Fair and transparent allocation of revenue, including a macro/fiscal framework adapted to volatile and
finite resources and a transparent savings mechanism;

﻿5. Sustainable policies to safeguard the environment and maintain social priorities in the development of
mineral resources to ensure they were used for the public good.
. The study will focus on institutional structures, revenue flows and reporting, award of licenses, monitoring of
operations, redress and grievance mechanisms, domestic operators and ownership structures, informal as well
as formal trade in gems and minerals, regulatory structures among non-state armed groups, and interactions of
operators, government, and civil society. The study will encompass hydrocarbons, minerals, gems, and
hydropower as the areas proposed for EITI in Myanmar, and will look at the operations of Myanmar's two
military holding companies, UMEHL and MEC together with other domestic operators. For each area the
consultant will provide an institutional and a stakeholder analysis as well as identifying the entry points and the
existing reform space for an effective and fair revenue management of the sector. The consultant will work
under the guidance of the World Bank task team and the MDRI EITI team.
The consultant(s) specifically will examine:
*  Baseline description  of hydrocarbons, minerals, gems, and hydro-power sectors, with reference to
approximate number of operators/license holders and planned operations. This will also document what
the ownership structures are for operations in different sectors.
*  Institutional analysis for each of the three industries - this include the formal regulatory, licensing, and
oversight bodies within government; the 'rules of the game', both formal (laws, regulations, institutional
mandates) and informal (social norms, de facto practices), that shape the behaviour, interactions,
incentive and power of the stakeholders in the sector. The analyses must consider award (and
suspension) of licenses, negotiation and approval of contracts, monitoring and oversight of operations,
tax administration, and community/ public relations.
* The institutional analysis will document the decision-making, both official and de facto, for each sub-
sector and regulatory functions. What are the official procedures? Are they clear and known from the
different stakeholders? Is there a clear chain of responsibility between the different public institutions?
Who benefits from discretionary powers? How has sector governance changed since the start of the
reform process in 2011? In this regard the assessment will also document ownership structures of both
private sector operators and related SEEs, such as Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprises and the SEEs
under the Ministry of Mines. The assessment should also look institutional capacities and gap analysis
in light of an expected rapid increase in investor interest and sector operations.
*  Revenue flow - how do payments of taxes, fees, royalties, and production shares move from operators
to the Ministry of Finance/Treasury. This will include a review of contract arrangements, identify major
points of leakage or underpayment and who benefits from these, and identify which payments stay
within relevant ministries, authorized under which legal frameworks.

﻿*  Provide an overview of MEC and UMEHL . These are military-owned holding companies, but treated
as private enterprises by Government. This overview will include the scope of their investments in the
extractive sectors, decision-making, governance structures, use of revenues (i.e. military pension funds),
and accountabilities. Analysis will also include assessment of links formal and informal between
companies, Ministry of Defense, and key decision-makers .
Analysis of role of Ministry of Finance. Parliament, and the Office of the Auditor General and the
Accountant General, with respect to the audit function. The study will look at existing capacities for tax
administration and revenue collection. Moreover, the Consultant must assess the performance of audit,
by whom, how frequently, and how used. The study will also examine the role of Parliamentary
committees in providing oversight for extractive sectors and also interaction of voters, members of
Parliament and state politicians vis-a-vis extractive sector, including the increasing demand for
constituency services.
*  Analysis will encompass the findings of the recent political economy study conducted by Pyoe Bin and
discuss how the interests, views, and pressures brought to the EITI process by civil society will interact
with those of other stakeholders. Review governance and regulatory arrangements at sub-national level
and in the conflict affected areas. This will also include examining institutional, legal, and constitutional
issues which may affect EITI and extractive industries at the sub-national level. It will further include
how non-state armed groups have licensed, taxed, or overseen extractive industries, largely but not
exclusively mining. At a minimum this should look at how two groups, preferably including the Kachin
Independence Organization h interact with the extractive operations. This portion of the study should be
well-coordinated with the conflict analysis conducted by MDRI in conjunction with International Alert.
Based on the above, the consultants will provide an analysis of implications for EITI and selected entry points
for improved governance in the extractive sectors. This analysis will also include a review of how EITI fits into
and strengthens the overall reform agenda. The analysis will assess whether institutional structures and
regulatory agencies are in possession of sufficient capacity and information to answer the needs and questions
of the EITI. The analysis should also consider prevailing incentive structures (formal and informal) in order to
assess whether regulation and requirements are likely to be implemented.
The consultant will take into account the potential political opposition related to each entry points, and include
strategies for (i) navigating stakeholder opposition and shaping political constituencies of support; (ii)
addressing the challenges associated with weak institutional capacity, and (iii) enhancing the participation of
non-government stakeholders. The consultant will work closely with the World Bank task team and MDRI in
developing methodology and carrying out study.
In addition to the analysis and study report, the consultant must conduct two one-day seminars targeted the
members of the National EITI Committee (and possibly other representatives with strong engagement in the
Myanmar EITI). The agenda of the seminars will be agreed in consultation with MDRI and representatives
from the EITI Committee. Topics to be covered may include: 1) Natural Resource Management, 2)
Fundamentals of the EITI, 3) Regional and international experience of implementing the EITI, 4) Case stories
of outcomes from EITI implementation, 5) Good practice of EITI communication strategies. The dates of the
seminars will agreed as part of the initial planning, but tentative timing would be for the first seminar to take
place as part of the first country visit, whilst the second would be conducted immediately before or after the
workshop presenting the final report.

﻿Executive Summary
Large dams vary considerably in their adverse environmental and related social impacts. From an en-
vironmental standpoint, there are relatively good dams and bad dams. While some large dams are
relatively benign, others have caused major environmental damage. The severity of environmental
impacts from a hydroelectric project is largely determined by the dam site. While dams at good sites
can be very defensible from an environmental standpoint, those proposed at bad sites will inherently
be highly problematic, even if all feasible mitigation measures are properly implemented.
This paper provides a simple, yet robust, methodology for comparing proposed hydroelectric project
sites in terms of their expected negative environmental impacts, and relating these to power genera-
tion benefits. The paper also summarizes the environmental mitigation options for large dams. If
properly implemented, these mitigation measures can effectively prevent, minimize, or compensate
for many (though not all) of a hydroelectric project's negative impacts. Nonetheless, the most effec-
tive environmental mitigation measure is good site selection, to ensure that the proposed dam will
cause relatively little damage in the first place.
The paper presents quantitative indicators (using data that are relatively easy to obtain) for rating and
ranking proposed new hydroelectric projects in terms of their likely adverse environmental impacts.
Projects with a small reservoir surface area (relative to power generation) tend to be most desirable
from both an environmental and social standpoint, in part because they minimize natural habitat
losses as well as resettlement needs. In general, the most environmentally benign hydroelectric
dam sites are on upper tributaries, while the most problematic ones are on the large main stems
of rivers.
Power expansion planning should ensure that environmental criteria, of the type outlined in this pa-
per, are given appropriate weight in hydroelectric project site selection. Many of the more problem-
atic dam sites are best left undeveloped, because the environmental or related social impacts are likely
to be unacceptably high. In those cases, other power generation technologies are likely to be more
environmentally desirable. Conversely, hydroelectric dams at good sites (with relatively low adverse
impacts) and with effective implementation of proper mitigation measures are likely to be more at-
tractive from an environmental standpoint than the most likely power generation alternatives.

﻿Annex 8: Review of Reports by CSOs on
Myanmar's Extractives Industries Sector
Shwe Gas Movement
The Shwe Gas Movement has produced a series of reports that focus on the Shwe Gas pipeline project. The two main
reports on the pipeline the CSO has produced are "Corridors of Power: China's Trans-Burma Oil and Gas Pipelines"
(published in September 2009) and "Drawing the Line: The Case Against China's Shwe Gas Project, For Better Extractive
Industries in Burma (published in September 2013). They have also published a more general overview of extractive
industries sector governance, "Good Governance and the Extractive Industry in Burma from June 2013" (as well as
several other interesting reports on the extractive industries sector in Myanmar, including an assessment of CNPC).
Good Governance and the Extractive Industry in Burma
This report takes a critical look at the reform process and initial preparations to implement EITI. It suggests that the reform
process has been relatively superficial so far (from the perspective of human rights (and labour rights), transparency and
the environment) and will require wholesale legal reform in order to place natural resource governance on a firmer
footing. In addition, the report makes specific recommendations on GOUM signing up to the principles of full,
independent Free, Prior and Informed Consent, ESIA and Social Impact Assessment frameworks and also to ensure
there is "meaningful participation" of civil society within the EITI process. The report is also specifically highly critical of
the Shwe Gas project,
Corridors of Power
Although published nearly four years ago, Corridors of Power is still an interesting read because it was written during the
time of the planning and early construction of the pipelines and anticipated the problems that are now associated with it.
This report gives a good background on the regional politics behind the pipeline and the battle between India and China
to secure the gas from the fields and also the previous military junta's relationship to natural resource revenues (using oil
and gas money to buy weapons). The report accurately predicts many of the problems that are now associated with the
pipeline in terms of environmental hazards, use of forced labour and so on.
Drawing the Line
Drawing the Line is effectively an update on Corridors of Power, published just after gas had started flowing through the
Shwe Gas pipeline (in the last quarter of 2013). It includes detailed (and documented) reports of land confiscation,
environmental damage, labour abuses and loss of livelihood (fishing and farming). The report also points to the
relationship between the pipeline and increased conflict in Shan state:

International


﻿The report notes that the environmental and social impact assessments carried out (in 2010) for the pipeline have never
been released into the public domain. The report notes that the ESIA carried out by Environmental Resources
Management (a UK firm); whereas the SIA was carried out by International Environment Management (Canadian-owned
firm based in Thailand). The report concludes by calling for the postponement of the project until adequate compensation
has been paid, a disaster preparedness plan has been developed and there is greater CSO involvement in EITI among
other things.
Karen Human Rights Group
Losing Ground: Land Conflicts and Collective Action in Eastern Myanmar
While land issues are not core to EITI, they are a major issue at the beginning of the extractives value chain and cannot
be left out of any discussion of the history of natural resource acquisition and management in Myanmar.
The survey took place in seven geographic research areas across eastern Myanmar (Kayin, Mon, Bago and Tanintharyi),
assessing projects such as hydropower dams, infrastructure development, logging, mining and commercial plantation
agriculture undertaken or facilitated by various civil and military State authorities, foreign and domestic companies and
armed ethnic groups. The report found that the key issues across the projects were a lack of consultation (an absence of
Free, Prior and Informed Consent), land confiscation (including encroachment beyond the project site and confiscation of
land belonging to refugees and internally displaced persons), disputed compensation, displacement and resettlement,
loss of livelihood, physical security threats, environmental damage and forced labour. The report has over 600 pages of
documented testimony by 809 affected peoples (collected between January 2011 and November 2012) as an appendix.
The report also highlights attempts at collective action by project-affected people in areas of natural resource
development.
Molo Women Mining Watch Network
Lost Paradise
The Lost Paradise report examines the impact of the Mawchi Tin Mines in Pasaung Township in Kayah State. High
quality Tin and Tungsten has been mined at Mawchi since British colonial times in the 1830s. The Molo Women Mining
Watch Network was formed to research information about the mines, which are perceived to have brought no discernible
benefit to local people since the time operations began. There are plans to extend the mines into Lohkarlo village, which
may involve resettlement away from ancestral lands, with associated fears that water resources will be affected. The
report begins by making a comparison with the Heinda tin mine in Tanintharyi and the negative impacts at that operation.
Lost Paradise also provides an analysis of the beneficial ownership of Mawchi. According to the report, the mine is
operated by the Kayah State Mining Product Company (KMPC), with ownership of the company shared between UMEHL
and Mining Enterprise Number 2. The manager of KMPC is the appropriately named Ye Tun Tin, a USDP MP for
Pasaung township. The report makes the (unverified) claim that UMEHL shares 30% of the products with the Ministry of
Mining No.2. The report then provides an assessment of some of the negative impacts of mining operations at Mawchi.
It details the lung and arthritis problems for people working in the mine, the low wages for women workers (who receive
5000 kyats per day for hard labour). The report also describes the pollution from mining waste (a particular problem
being toxic run-off from tailings dams during the monsoon season). This pollution affects the Molo river (which was a
source of drinking water for the local population). The report also describes the deforestation of the area due to logs
used for mine tunnel supports and the consequent landslides. Lost Paradise concludes by making the recommendations
that there must be Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), local involvement in decision-making and no forced
resettlement in the project-affected areas.
Ta'ang Students and Youth Organisation
Pipeline Nightmare
This report provides background on the Shwe Gas pipeline project along the lines of the Shwe Gas Movement's reports.
However, the report specifically highlights the "civil war and human rights abuses" of the pipeline on the Ta'ang ethnic
107 Drawing the Line, p2.
Adam  Smith                   Institutional and Regulatory Assessment of the Extractive Industries in Myanmar  160
International


﻿group in Shan State (also known as the Palaung), focusing specifically on 6 townships and 51 villages. There are
approximately one million Ta'ang people living in the mountains mostly in north-western Shan State. The Ta'ang
customary lands have the richest ruby and sapphire mines in the world, including the well-known Mogok gemstone area
(which is now part of Mandalay Region).
The report contains strongly critical language, along the lines of the "blatant disregard for the human rights of the local
people affected by the project adds fuel to the already blazing fire of discontent in an area where many of the inhabitants
have no access any of the resources being exported.""'8
The main body of the report focuses on the many negative impacts of the Shwe Gas Pipeline. It refers to land
confiscation without prior consultation or consent, giving the example of four townships where 551 households had their
land confiscated. The report details the inadequate compensation given for land appropriation, in some cases
compensation is not paid, in others it was not paid in full, with different methods of distributing compensation payments
from village to village. The report also examines the impacts of the increased military presence during the construction of
the pipeline, with increased drug use (amphetamine and heroin), increased prostitution (attracted by the Chinese migrant
workers) and notes the impacts on local women (sexual harassment and rape being the two main negative impacts).
Pipeline Nightmare also notes the increased flooding due to poor pipeline construction, documents cases of forced
labour, health and safety violations and the confiscation of tea farms, forest areas, and paddy fields. As with the Shwe
Gas Movement's report, Pipeline Nightmare highlights the fact that the ESIAs and SIAs have not been made available.
The report also notes how the pipeline construction exacerbated conflicts between the KIA, Burmese troops and the
Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA). The TNLA sided with the KIA in fighting the Myanmar army, which lead to an
increase in internally displaced persons.
Pa-O Youth Organisation
Robbing the Future
This report is the result of a three-year (2006-9) investigation by the Pa-O Youth Organisation into the planned Pinpet
mine project. The Pa-O is an ethnic group with a population of approximately one million people, making the group the
second largest nationality in Shan State. Pinpet is Myanmar's second largest iron ore deposit (the first being in Hpakant,
Kachin State). Pinpet means "Pine Tree Mountain" and is known as "Pinngo" in the Pa-O language (and Pangpek in the
Shan language). The mountain is seven miles South East of Taunggyi, the capital of Shan State. Pinpet mountain is
also rich in copper, limestone, wolfram and tin, with uranium deposits suspected by some to be present on the mountain
also. There are an estimated 10 million tons with 56.4% iron reserves of hematite and reserves of 70 million tons of
limonite at with 42.6% iron (the best grades of iron in the world contain 60% iron). In addition, the mountain also has a
deposit of an estimated 30 million tons of limestone.
Exploration of the mining prospectivity of Pinpet began in 1951 and started again in 1961 after a decade of unrest in the
area.
Robbing the Future provides details on the 11,000 acre Pinpet project itself, the companies involved as well as the likely
social and environmental impacts. The report suggests that the project will involve 7,000 homes displaced and 25
villages destroyed. While there has been a ceasefire since 1991 in the area, the Myanmar military has set up three
battalion camps nearby.
The report provides information on how the iron process plant, the cement plant and the mine itself will be powered.
Construction of a natural gas pipeline from Magwe in central Myanmar, to Mount Pinpet is complete, with the capacity to
transport 8 million cubic feet of natural gas, producing 20 MW of electricity. In addition, a small hydro power plant and a
65MW coal-powered facility are apparently being planned. The companies involved in the project include:
Tyazhpromexport - a Russian Company
MEC
Kyaw Tha Company Limited
Kanbawza Development Co. Ltd.(owned by U Aung Ko Win)
Danieli & C. Spa - An Italian company
108 Pipeline Nightmare, page 6
Adam  Smith                   Institutional and Regulatory Assessment of the Extractive Industries in Myanmar  161
International


﻿Tyazhpromexport has apparently already invested $150m into the Pinpet Iron Processing Plant, Cement Factory,
whereas Kanbawza has invested 60m US already into the cement factory.
In terms of the rumours of uranium being present in the mountain, the report states,
"Burma's Ministry of Energy has officially announced five uranium deposits in the country, but there have been no public
reports of these deposits being mined as of yet. While the five sites do not included Pinpet, several sources have
indicated the presence of uranium near Taunggyi and there is persistent speculation of uranium on Mount Pinpet."
According to local villagers, uranium is located southwest of the village of Leng Ngock on the mountain. The area is called
"Kong Tyu" or "Sharp Mountain." A military camp has been set up on the mountain, and villagers are prohibited from
entering the vicinity, even to collect firewood."109
The report also provides details on the potentially negative social and environmental impacts of the Pinpet project.
Potentially 35,000 people rely on the water from the Thabet river (which flows into the Pawn River, which itself is a
tributary of the Salween). There is therefore a risk of pollution if the tailings dams carrying mine waste overflows in
monsoon season. Meanwhile, there has been no community consultation, there is evidence of land confiscation, lack of
compensation, forced relocation, destruction of property, loss of livelihood (farming), as well as an influx of migrant
workers leading to vulnerability of local women to sexual harassment and rape and prostitution. Again, the report
documents increasing food insecurity, lack of shelter and fuel, as well as restricted access to herbal medicine due to
forest areas being sectioned off. Finally, the report notes the destruction of culture in the area through to damage and
knocking-down of pagodas and other places of spiritual significance. The report notes that the entire Pinpet mountain will
be excavated for the project, which in itself reduces the natural beauty of the area.
Kachin Development Networking Group
Valley of Darkness
The Valley of Darkness report dates back to 2007, well before the reform period started. It is nonetheless interesting to
compare with the more recent reports reviewed above to see if there is any difference or change between seven years
ago and more recently.
Rather than jade, which is mostly commonly associated with Kachin, the study assesses gold mining in the Hugawng
Valley in Kachin State (close to the Indian border in the West of the state). This valley is home to the world's largest tiger
reserve and is an area of high biodiversity. The report was based on stakeholder research conducted from 2004 to 2006.
It is instructive for the outside analyst to learn from the report that "the Kachin" is not in fact a singular ethnic group but
rather a collection of groups, the major ones being the Rawang, Zaiwa (Azi), Lowao (Maru), Lachik (Lashi), Lisu, and the
Jinghpaw.
Commercial gold mining increased dramatically in the valley following on from the 1994 ceasefire agreement between the
KIO and the SPDC. Eight concessions were sold in the Hugawng Valley in 2002, with gold mining operations increasing
from 14 sites in 1994 to 31 sites in 2006. During this time, the nature of the mining transformed from artisanal riverine
panhandling to mechanised forms of mining.
Among other things, the report gives an interesting insight into traditional forms of mining prior to
mechanisation/commercialisation:
"When it [stone or jade] is discovered, favourable omens are anxiously awaited before the discovery is announced to the
Kachin community. A meeting is then convened by the chief and again sacrifice and other methods of divination are
resorted to in order to ascertain if the mine should be worked at once or be allowed to remain undisturbed for a period of
years. If indications are favourable, the land is marked out by ropes into small plots a few feet square, which are then
appropriated among all the Kachins present. No Kachin belonging to the same family is refused a share, no matter how
far away he may live."10
The report gives an interesting breakdown of the fiscal structure of mining during that period, with the Ministry of Mines
collecting between 35-50% profit tax, with additional payments due to the military command in the region and also to the
KIO (where the KIO maintained a local administrative role).

﻿In terms of the strength of governance over gold mining in the valley at the time, the report points to a wholesale lack of
regulation, with deforestation, destruction of river banks, poor health and safety protection for workers, as well as mercury
and cyanide contamination in water systems being common. The report highlights the fact that the 1994 mining law and
the 1995 mining rules do not provide guidance on the use of chemicals and that there are no formal requirements for an
ESIA/SIA. The report notes however that the most negative impact of the growth in gold mining in the areas is the influx
of migrant workers, which has led to the expansion of drugs, sex and gambling in the area. The report notes that in one
mining area, 80% of inhabitants in one mining area addicted to opium. The report concludes that people in affected areas
in Hugawng Valley have not benefited from the expansion in gold mining in the area, with revenues from gold sales going
to the SPDC authorities and a handful of businessmen and companies.
Earth Rights International
The Washington-based Earth Rights International (ERI) has had a longstanding focus on Myanmar, most closely
following the Yadana pipeline project and more recently the Shwe Gas project.' ERI has published several in-depth
reports on the Yadana pipeline, taking a critical stance against Total and Chevron in reports such as "Getting It Wrong"
and "Total Impact". It should be noted that both reports were written prior to the reform period.

﻿Annex 9: The Development of Myanmar' s Power
Sector
The installed generating capacity by fuel source on the Myanmar Grid112 system as of July 2013 is listed in table 24.11
There are a total of 31 grid-connected power stations with a combined nameplate capacity of 3,831MW. Due to
maintenance and operational limitations the firm capacity is 1,655MW114 which is below the peak demand of 1,930MW.
This capacity shortfall results in rolling power cuts. The available hydro capacity is 1,552MW in the rainy season and
1,315MW during the summer season.
The MOEP plans to construct the gas fired power plants at the following locations:

﻿The Power Sector Master Plan
The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is currently funding a Master Plan (least cost expansion plan) for
Myanmar"". The final Master Plan report should have been completed by August 2014 and delivered to the NEMC for
review. The forecast demand growth in the Master Plan is 13% per annum.
The objective of a least cost plan is to establish the long term generation and transmission plan that meets the forecast
national electricity demand at the lowest economic cost while at the same time meeting a specified reliability of supply
standard. The plan should thus establish the mix of additional generation capacity and the associated transmission
reinforcement that results in the lowest cost (i.e. in present valued, real terms) that will reliably meet the forecast demand
subject to the National Energy Policy.
The Master Plan should establish any differences between the optimal expansion of the hydro sector in Myanmar for
meeting the needs within Myanmar and what is currently proposed in the various joint ventures that are under discussion
with developers. It is not known at this stage whether the master plan will include any reporting requirements that may
have implications for EITI.
Exploiting Myanmar's hydro resources for the purposes of a source of revenue from exports is a perfectly legitimate
objective so long as (i) it takes due account of environmental and societal issues and (ii) that the economic benefits are
shared on a fair and reasonable basis.
