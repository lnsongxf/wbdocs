engagement between the organization and
its stakeholders. Through its governance
practice, BGEO seeks to create an
environment in which transparency,
honesty, integrity and fairness are valued

 The Impact of our

                 Regional Programs for the Development of Financial Reporting Systems

The World Bank’s Centre for Financial
Reporting Reform (CFRR) implements two
regional programs, both of which are aimed
at promoting sustainable private and
financial sector development through
establishing     robust    frameworks      for
corporate     financial     reporting,    and
developing the capacity of accounting
professionals, financial and audit regulators,
and academics so that these frameworks can
be implemented effectively.

The programs offer knowledge, analytical
and advisory services and capacity
development support to partner countries.
In this regard, they deliver targeted learning
at face-to-face workshops and through
virtual seminars. Peer sharing and learning is
an important element of the program,
bringing together contemporaries to share
good practice and learn from others’
experiences. CFRR also offers the convening
power to bring leading experts from all over
the world to share their expertise with          To complement the regional activities,       EU-REPARIS (The Road to Europe: Program

In the Africa region, commendable progress
has been made toward strengthening the
accounting profession. Indeed, a number of
Professional Accountancy Organizations
(PAOs) are making positive contributions to
their respective country’s economic
development. However, analysis of the

Codes, Accounting and Auditing (ROSC A&A)
conducted in Africa indicates that there are
still a number of challenges to be addressed
in order for the profession to increase its
contribution to improving the lives of
Africans. Improvements could also help to
address the World Bank twin goals of ending
extreme poverty and boosting shared
prosperity. Firstly, there is a need to increase

            Closing the IFRS Gap at the Electricity Vietnam Company

The Impetus for Reform

There were a number of driving forces for
reform at the Electricity Vietnam Company
(EVN). First, EVN’s ability to produce high
quality, transparent and comparable
financial information in full compliance with
IFRS had strong linkages to EVN’s Financial
Recovery Plan, which included focusing on
improved corporate governance and
financial reporting. In addition, there were
important      implications      for   EVN’s
Restructuring and Divestiture Strategy,
including the ability to raise finance and
attract investors.

Furthermore, external factors such as the
signing of the Trans-Pacific Agreement (a
trade agreement among twelve Pacific Rim
countries signed in February 2016) have
meant that more attention is now being
placed on the need adopt international good
practice in terms of governance,                  reasons. First, the financial statements were            and accountability structures, human

that they did not want to continue to

What this demonstrates is that this work has
broader significance for Vietnam’s SOE
sector. The Ministry of Finance has agreed
that the EVN pilot will be used to inform the
planning for the transition of the other major
SOE groups to the IFRS as well.

Lessons learned

EVN’s work on IFRS compliance began as part
of a review of fiduciary compliance with the
lending covenants of donor financing
agreements. However, EVN came to
recognize that transitioning to full
compliance with IFRS is a major medium-
term undertaking that has broad
implications for the way in which it manages      general, and to EVN in particular. Indeed, the   with IFRS need to be recognized in terms of

remedial legislative work would be required,
including:

   Provide greater detail: The EU
    Directives are in some cases quite
    general. Further detail was needed to
    enhance their implementation. For
    example, the duties and role of a public
    oversight body for the audit profession
    were not defined in detail;

   Enhance clarity: In some cases, EU
    legislation allowed for differing
    interpretations. For example, it was
    uncertain what aspects of auditor
    certification were subject to approval
    by the POB;

      Serbia to Implement a €3.4 million Technical Assistance Project
Switzerland’s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) has generously agreed to
provide €3.4 million for a four-year technical assistance project to reform corporate
financial reporting in Serbia. The project will be implemented by the World Bank
Centre for Financial Reporting Reform (CFRR) in Vienna, Austria and by the Serbian
Ministry of Finance. Oversight will be provided by a steering committee with
representation from key stakeholders.
The project will take a multi-pronged approach to improve formal rules and standards,
as well as actual practices in corporate accounting and auditing. It will also support
Serbia’s efforts to seek accession to the European Union (EU). Project work begins in
April 2016. Among the contemplated activities are the following:
          Identification of any remaining areas in Serbian law governing accounting
           and auditing that need revisions to align with the EU acquis communautaire;
          Training for accounting and auditing practitioners and regulators to ensure
           better understanding of the application of international standards governing
           accounting and auditing;
          Assistance in strengthening accounting and auditing curricula, teaching
           materials and training for instructors at the university level and in professional education;
          Support to improve monitoring and enforcement and ensure reliable financial reporting, including quality assurance and discipline for
           statutory auditors; and
          Capacity enhancement for officials charged with monitoring and responding to reported financial information for state-owned
           enterprises.



                The Public Accounting Certification Training (PACT)
                Project in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
The objective of the Public Accounting Certification Training Project is to assist the Government of the FYR Macedonia to strengthen the
professional public sector accounting capacity through the completion of a two-level international certification program.
This project is being financed through a Trust Fund related to the Strengthening Accountability and the Fiduciary Environment (SAFE) program
financed by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and the European Union.
The training material has been developed by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accounting (CIPFA). It has been adapted and translated
into the local language, including helping local trainers to support the sustainability of the program through the Center of Excellence in Finance
(CEF). The project is being implemented by Macedonia’s Ministry of Finance. It is currently offering the certification level after successful
completion and approval of the final examination by 29 public officials.

Overview

There is a broad consensus that financial
statements produced under a recognized
financial reporting framework and designed
to provide relevant and reliable information
to users, allow those users to make more
informed decisions concerning the entity. A
sound financial reporting framework
reduces information risk and promotes more
constructive engagement.            Financial
reporting standards have been developed
with a focus on the financial information
produced by public interest entities (PIEs),
which are often defined as listed companies,
banks or other companies with public              burden on small entities so that the cost of        both a Simplified System and Minimal

have traditionally been viewed as a
challenge by commercial banks. Banks face
higher costs in assessing and monitoring
investments by SMEs and servicing their
smaller        transactions.        Regulatory
requirements with respect to loans to SMEs
also present challenges. Some bankers even
argue that SMEs themselves show
insufficient interest in obtaining bank loans.

How the Governance Global Practice adds value to state-owned entities

At the government and policy level:

                Assessing the legislative framework and practices applicable to the operation, governance and state monitoring of SOEs;


                Performing a gap analysis of the existing governance mechanisms and structure in managing SOEs against international good
                practices, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Guidelines on Corporate Governance
                of SOEs;

                Providing policy advice and technical assistance to governments aimed at strengthening SOEs governance, increasing
                transparency and accountability, and improving fiscal risk management and operational performance for the public good;

                Conducting an effectiveness assessment of processes and oversight functions carried out by state bodies charged with SOE
                governance/ supervision, and developing methodologies and tools enabling them to carry out their functions effectively;

                Performing a skills set assessment and developing the capacity of SOEs’ supervisory staff in order to improve their ability t o
                scrutinize/ monitor financial and other information of SOEs.


At the enterprise level:

                  Assessing SOEs’ corporate governance structure focusing on financial reporting hierarchy and existing financial reporting
                  practices;


                  Improving internal policies and procedures in financial management and accounting through hands-on assistance to address
                  identified gaps;

                  Reviewing and designing accounting policies in line with good international practice, such as International Financial Reporting
                  Standards (IFRS);

                  Developing an internal control system for accounting and financial reporting based on the framework of the Committee of
                  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO);

                  Raising entities’ accountability through timely independent audits and publication of financial statements \;


                  Establishing an effective and sustainable financial reporting function with a proper segregation of duties;
                   Strengthening the capacity of key financial personnel by improving their knowledge and practical skills in using IFRS and
                   preparing financial statements;

                   Educating management and boards on the importance of correct and transparent financial information to ensure proper
                   governance of SOEs;

                   Training Audit Committee members to empower them to proactively monitor SOEs’ financial reporting, as well as properly
                   engage with SOEs’ independent auditors.




SOE-FACT
To better understand the landscape of state-owned companies across Europe and Central Asia, and to enhance
the World Bank’s assistance to partner countries in improving SOEs’ governance, the Centre for Financial Reporting
Reform (CFRR), part of the Governance Global Practice, is conducting a survey “State-Owned Enterprises Financial
Accountability, Controls and Transparency” (SOE FACT). This survey assesses transparency and the control
environment faced by SOEs in Europe and Central Asia, which will provide valuable insights and benchmarks
comparing SOE practices and accountability requirements across the region. If your government has not taken
part and you are interested in participating, please reach out to our CFRR team.

South Asia Electricity Transmission and
Trade Project (CASA 1000) seeks to create
conditions for sustainable electricity trade
between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan,
the Kyrgyz Republic, the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan and the Republic of Tajikistan. It
supports the construction of transmission
infrastructure and trading mechanisms to
enable the sale of 1,300 megawatts of
electricity between Central Asia and South
Asia.




The objectives of CASA-1000 are aligned with
the World Bank’s twin goals of ending
extreme poverty and boosting shared
prosperity. As energy importers, Afghanistan
and Pakistan will be able to alleviate chronic
power shortages suffered by households and
businesses during the summer months. The

Why “learning outcomes” are at the core of
the revised International Education
Standards

The main theme of the revised International
Education Standards (IES) is the focus on a
“learning outcomes approach” when
developing Initial Professional Development
(IPD) education programs, Continuing
Professional Development (CPD) programs,
as well as the development of professional
competence through practical experience.
The International Accounting Education
Standards Board (IAESB) has emphasized
that highly effective learning can only be
achieved if the learning process is based on
an individual’s demonstrated achievement
of learning and development experiences,
rather than focusing on the learning process
itself.
There are many benefits to adopting a
learning outcomes approach, including
promoting individual capabilities. Indeed,
there is a direct link between education and
on-the-job capability.
Transitioning to a learning outcomes

Some high level results are now available from the Western Balkan Accountancy Education Study. A few of the results are highlighted as follows:
        On average, the university segment at both the undergraduate and master levels aligns better to the learning outcomes prescribed by
         the revised IES 2 – Content of Professional Accounting Educational Programs (as compared to the professional accounting and auditing
         qualification programs of the PAOs).
        Learning outcomes prescribed by the revised IES 4 - Professional values, ethics and attitudes is a common area in both segments (that
         is, for the university and PAO) where curricula will need to be strengthened.
        On average, the least amount of coverage is in the area of public sector financial reporting.

On 28 September 2015, Governor Ewald
Nowotny of the Austrian National Bank
opened a high-level conference for over 100
of Europe’s banking supervisors and external
auditors at the bank’s prestigious
headquarters in Vienna. The main objective
of the conference, which was organized by
the World Bank Centre for Financial
Reporting Reform (CFRR), was to promote
cooperation between these practitioners in
order to enhance the quality of supervision
and auditing and to contribute further to the
resilience of the banking system. The             of the relationship between regulators and

the World Bank?
Even after 33 years, I continue to find
the World Bank an incredibly interesting
place to work. The staff are truly dedicated
to the goal of reducing poverty in the world,
and many give up a great deal of their
personal time to pursue this mission. I was

                          Professional accountants recognize that achieving and maintaining the highest levels of professional competence can
                          help them win business and retain clients. Professional Accountancy Organizations (PAOs) have an important role to
                          play in encouraging, facilitating and monitoring life-long learning. With the support of participating PAOs involved in
                          the EU-REPARIS Audit Training of Trainers program, the World Bank Centre for Financial Reporting Reform has
                          produced a short practical guide on Continuing Professional Development (CPD). It offers tips and suggestions on good
                          CPD practices to help PAOs and their members meet international standards and keep pace with accountancy changes
                          and innovations. The full version of the guide can be found at:

                          Banking Supervisors and External Auditors: Building a Constructive
                          Relationship (2015)
                           This publication presents key findings from the World Bank CFRR survey that was conducted during the second half of
                           2014, as well as discussions with regulators conducted in 2015.
                           Responses from 35 supervisory authorities from the European Union and other countries in Eastern Europe, South
                           Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus suggest that stronger two-way interaction between external auditors and
                           supervisors can improve the quality of external audits and enhance banking supervision.
                           This report highlights some actionable insights based on reported good practices that can be helpful to banking
                           supervisors in managing their relationships with bank auditors. The report can be used to define the necessary policies
                           and guidelines toward building enhanced collaboration between auditors and supervisors, thereby contributing to
                           better auditing and supervisory practices.

                          This Guide outlines the European Union (EU) legislative framework governing corporate sector accounting and auditing.
                          It is primarily intended for policy makers, regulators, and other stakeholders in EU Member States, enlargement
                          countries, countries within the "European Neighborhood" and others interested in understanding the EU regulatory
                          model. This third edition of the Guide, published in May 2015, provides an overview of the relevant provisions of the
                          acquis communautaire, including significant recent changes in EU corporate financial reporting following the adoption
                          of a new Accounting Directive in June 2013, a “new Statutory Audit Directive” of April 2014, and a new Audit Regulation

                          Financial Reporting in Austria: The Views of SMEs and Local Banks (2013)
                           Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a particularly important role in the Austrian economy, with
                           commercial banks acting as their main source of external finance. As SMEs are also very important in the Road to
                           Europe: Program of Accounting Reform and Institutional Strengthening (REPARIS) countries (participating
                           countries/entities included Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, the Former Yugoslav Republic of
                           Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, and Serbia), analyzing how SMEs and their banks view the operation of financial
                           reporting in Austria could produce some useful guidance for the design of financial reporting frameworks in the
                           REPARIS countries.
                           In cooperation with the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber and the Austrian Institute for SME Research, the CFRR
                           conducted two surveys in late 2012 collecting information on SME experience with corporate financial reporting, as
                           well as Austrian bank requirements for financial information from SMEs applying for credit. The surveys found that
financial statements, both audited and unaudited, play a valued role for Austrian SMEs; this is the case not only for tax purposes, but also in
terms of helping SMEs to improve the financial management of their businesses. In addition, due to their important role in bank decisions about
whether to extend a loan, financial statements facilitated SME access to bank financing.
However, the potential benefits for Austrian SMEs from financial reporting very much depend on: (i) the system striking an appropriate balance
between promoting improved financial information and reducing the regulatory burden on reporting firms; and (ii) the accounting and auditing
profession’s ability to provide reasonable assurance regarding the data accuracy of the financial information provided in a SME credit application.
In this respect, the surveys found that the Austrian audit profession has a generally good reputation for providing reasonable quality assurance
for financial decision making among Austrian credit institutes.
