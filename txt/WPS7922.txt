1     Introduction
This paper asks whether we should expect to ﬁnd the sharp polarization of labor markets
found in high-income countries to emerge in the developing world, and then employs global
census data to see whether we do.


    For the United States, Katz et al. (2006); Autor (2010); Autor and Dorn (2013) docu-
ment expanding job opportunities in both high-skill, high-wage occupations and low-skill,
low-wage occupations, coupled with contracting opportunities in middle-wage, middle-skill
white collar and blue-collar jobs. In particular, job opportunities are declining in middle-skill
white collar clerical, administrative and sales occupations and in middle-skill, blue-collar pro-
duction, craft and operative occupations. This especially hits the earnings and labor force
participation rates of workers without college education and particularly men. Goos et al.
(2014) document that this phenomenon has appeared in each of 16 European countries from
1993 to 2006: middle wage occupations decline as a share of employment in all 16 countries
with an unweighted average of 8 percentage points while high wage and low wage occupa-
tions increased in the vast majority. Beaudry et al. (2013) show that the collapse of middle
level paying jobs has now spread to the high-skill labor market. Even growth optimists, such
as Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) predict major shifts in the composition of labor and the
need for compensatory social policies to oﬀset the resulting inequality.


    From the prevalence of polarization across the advanced countries, Autor concludes that a
common set of forces are at work. Of these, a leading explanation is the ongoing automation
and oﬀ-shoring of middle-skilled “routine” tasks that were formerly performed by workers
with moderate education. Routine tasks as described by Autor et al. (2003) are suﬃciently
deﬁned that they can be carried out by a computer executing a program or alternatively,
by a comparatively less-educated worker in a developing country who carries out the task
with minimal discretion. These would include book keeping, clerical work and repetitive
production tasks. Acemoglu and Autor (2011) oﬀer a model where technological progress

                                               1
does not necessarily raise earnings in all sectors as in the standard models, but where ma-
chines substitute for tasks previously performed by labor leading to polarization and real
earnings falls. Generally, the literature has emphasized such technological change over trade
forces.Michaels et al. (2014), for instance, ﬁnd for 11 advanced countries that industries with
high ICT growth shifted demand from middle to highly educated workers. Autor argues
that the general wisdom by the end of the 1990s was that trade ﬂows were simply too small
to explain the vast changes in skill demands and wage structures and Acemoglu and Autor
(2011) suggest this empirically as well. David et al. (2013)for instance, speciﬁcally measure
the impact of the rise of China and ﬁnd that, while not negligible, it accounts for only 25%
of the fall in manufacturing employment in the United States. However, recent work (Autor
et al., 2016) suggests that the impact of China on US manufacturing may well have been
larger than previously thought.


   The demise of labor at the hands of automation hence again emerges as a preoccupation
in the United States and Europe, much as Autor (2015) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2015)
note it was for luminaries such as Keynes, Heilbroner and Leontieﬀ in earlier eras, and the
US government in the 1960s. They oﬀer a more optimistic view. Automation indeed dis-
places existing tasks, but then there is another type of technological change enabling the
creation of new, more complex versions of existing tasks, in which labor has a comparative
advantage. Initially, these tasks will go to higher skilled workers, but over the medium term,
they will be standardized and passed to less skilled workers. In their model, the displacement
eﬀects of automation auto-correct and the distribution of income remains stable over time.
Indeed, Autor (2015) argues in Why Are There Still So Many Jobs? The History and Future
of Workplace Automation that journalists and even expert commentators tend to overstate
the extent of machine substitution for human labor and ignore the strong complementari-
ties between automation and labor that increase productivity, raise earnings, and augment
demand for labor” and that over the longer term, polarization is unlikely to continue. Over
the short to medium term, however, we are left with a disturbing set of empirical regularities.

2     Should We Expect to See Polarization in Developing
      Countries as Well?
    Clearly the question is vitally relevant to developing countries as well. However, the way
in which automation and globalization play out in emerging economies may diﬀer from their
advanced counterparts:


Diﬀering initial occupational distributions: Potential polarization dynamics are layered on
very diﬀerent initial occupational structures and positions in the demographic transition.
Most mechanically, in many developing countries, the sector of middle income workers en-
gaged in codiﬁed tasks is small in the ﬁrst place- in Ghana, for instance, 90% of the workforce
is informal and engaged in low skilled services and artisanal production (see, for example
Falco et al. (2015) and this is representative of many low-income countries. Hence, we would
expect to see little in the way of displacement of these types of jobs. In addition, many
developing countries still have large shares of the labor force in agriculture and ﬁsheries and
are experiencing manifold forces pushing them toward urbanization.


The net impact of oﬀ-shored jobs: Oﬀ-shored jobs from advanced countries are precisely
moving to developing countries and hence we would expect to see a complementary ex-
pansion of the middle- a “de-polarization” of the wage distribution in at least some host
countries. That said, to the degree that newer arrivals to oﬀ-shoring, such as China or Viet-
nam, compete with established destinations such as Mexico, the net eﬀect of diversion vs.
increased total oﬀ-shoring is unclear. Hanson and Robertson (2008) ﬁnd that for Hungary,
Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and
Turkey, China’s impact has been negative, but relatively small. Lederman et al. (2009) ﬁnds
similarly modest eﬀects for Latin America. Hence, the diversion eﬀects, to date, seem muted


                                              3
and we may ﬁnd overall, that trade generates the reverse of, or at least milder, polarization
eﬀects.


Removal of barriers to entry : New technologies may also give new leverage to citizens to
break down existing barriers to entry and eﬃciency growth (think Uber), facilitate informa-
tion ﬂows on markets and opportunities, potential products, inputs, and production tech-
nologies to make possible entire new industries: Travel agents, ﬁnance, tourism, international
marketing of local products etc.


The impact of ICT: The impact of technological progress in LDCs is also not clear. Michaels
et al. (2014) identify a strong correlation of ICT adoption and polarization. However, as
Eden and Gaggl (2015) argue, ICT related capital stocks are lower in LDCs as they prob-
ably should be given the lower capital-labor ratios, the higher cost of ICT capital, and the
structure of their economies. Hence the displacement eﬀects on jobs directly aﬀected by ICT
adoption may be lower.


Automation related productivity growth in small open economies: The employment impact
of technological progress in larger countries depends on the relative product elasticity- if
the fall in price arising from the labor savings more than proportionately increases demand,
we will see an expansion of employment. Since, more open developing countries are often
assumed to be price takers, we should therefore see any domestic innovations in productivity
rewarded massively with huge expansion in employment. Rodrik (2015) argues, however,
that both the fall in prices arising from the global adoption of technology as well as opening
up to trade and the preexistence of far better producers have oﬀset this eﬀect. In fact,
with the exception of some Asian countries, he argues that LDCs may be suﬀering a kind
of premature de-industrialization where their nascent industrialization has been truncated
earlier in their development than has been historically the case.




                                              4
More limited feasibility of automation? : The degree to which automation is adopted depends
heavily on a country’s technological absorptive capacity, the skill of the workforce, ability
to mobilize resources for large capital investments, capacity for maintenance, and attention
to tolerances which may make it less easy to substitute away from labor in many poorer
countries.


Skills for emerging complementary tasks? : To the degree the automation does occur, the
likelihood of developing the kinds of upgraded jobs to complement the automation would
seem lower in countries with weak educational bases in the ﬁrst place. Or put diﬀerently,
if a country had to raise workforce cognitive and non cognitive skills to be attractive to
MNC assembly operations, this task would seem more challenging as the oﬀered jobs are the
upgraded complements to assembly operations.


        The ﬁrst set of estimates of the combination of these eﬀects is modestly pessimistic.
Broadly following Goos et al. (2014), WorldBank (2016), using labor force surveys argues
that middle skilled occupations intensive in routine cognitive and manual skills have de-
creased across the developing world as well, with the exception of China, Ethiopia, Argentina
and Nicaragua.



3         Data
We pursue the approach of Autor (2010) of tracking job categories across time for 21 de-
veloping countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia. We use the Integrated Public Use
Microdata Series (IPUMS) developed by the Minnesota Population Center which harmo-
nizes census micro-data from around the world. The project has collected the world’s largest
archive of publicly available census samples. The data are coded and documented consis-
tently across countries and over time to facilitate comparative research.1
    1
        See https://international.ipums.org/international/.



                                                 5
      We use OCCISCO variable which records the person’s primary occupation2 coded ac-
cording to the major categories in the International Standard Classiﬁcation of Occupations
(ISCO) scheme for 1988 and have 11 categories: Legislators, Senior Oﬃcials and Managers;
Professionals; Technicians and Associated Professionals; Clerks, Skilled Agricultural and
Fishery Workers; Crafts and Related Trades Workers; Plant and Machine Operators and
Assemblers; Service Workers and Shop and Market Sales; Elementary Occupations; Armed
Forces and other occupations and no identiﬁed occupations. Table 1 lays out the categories
we include in more detail.


      Autor (2010) and Autor and Dorn (2013) map these 3-digit categories into a distinct
set of skill sets listed in ﬁgure 1 to better capture “routine” tasks. Hence, in the original
ISCO categorization, operators of machines in manufacturing appear in “Plant and Machine
Operators, and Assemblers” (category 8) but manufacturing workers who do not operate
machinery appear in “ elementary occupations” (category 9). Both may be more routine
than, for instance, food preparation or personal care, also found in category 9, which require
potentially less skill, but which are also less easy to automate. As we are working with
numerous countries with varying degrees of disaggregation and sometimes inconsistent or
ambiguous categorizations across time that have been standardized by the census categories,
we work directly with those. As we show, for the United States, this does not change the
conclusions appreciably.


      The available census data for developing countries for which we can follow employment
in a substantive way before and after 1990 are limited, but not unrepresentative. From Latin
America we have Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua,
Panama, and Peru, most of which have had a manufacturing tradition. From Asia we have
India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Fiji. From the Middle East: Arab Republic of Egypt, Mo-

    For someone with more than one job, the primary occupation is typically the one in which the person
had spent the most time or earned the most money.

rocco and West Bank and Gaza. From Africa: Ghana, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, South Africa,
and Zambia. Other countries are available, but may have limited time series. For instance,
China and Germany are represented in the IPUMS but their series end at the 1990s and
hence we exclude them.


    The number of Advanced Countries (AC) and Developing Countries (DC) which we use
to pool in regression analysis is greater:


AC includes Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portu-
gal, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States.


DC includes Argentina, Armenia, Belarus, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon,
Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Sal-
vador, Ethiopia, Fiji, Ghana, Guinea, Haiti, Hungary, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic
of Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Kyrgyz Republic, Liberia, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali,
Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay,
Peru, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Romania, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, South
Africa, South Sudan, St. Lucia, Sudan, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, Uruguay,
Venezuela, Vietnam, West Bank and Gaza, Vietnam and Zambia.




4     Results
To ensure that categorization diﬀerences are not aﬀecting our results, Figure 1 presents
Autor’s (2015) graph for the United States and Figure 2 replicates it using our data and
categories which are available for all our sample. The results are consistent. Operators and
assemblers, and crafts and related show a decline across the last decade compared to the
elementary occupations and the more skilled categories. Figure 2 also documents the same


                                             7
for France. These two countries support the ﬁndings of the existing literature.


      The graphs from the developing world (Figures 2-8), however, are far less clear. First,
the operators and assemblers category rarely shows a decline. Indonesia perhaps shows the
most convincing case over the last decade.3 For most of the sample, however, the operators
and assemblers category is expanding in absolute terms and generally in relative terms. Viet-
nam serves as perhaps the archetypal oﬀ-shoring destination that hosts Samsung, Intel and
others. Here we see that operators and assemblers have increased relative to every category
with the exception of professionals. India, up to 2004, tells a similar story. Operators and
assemblers show some of the highest growth rates and increasing over time while, again,
elementary occupations show an absolute decline. These two important cases do not appear
to show much evidence of polarization with the data available. Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador,
Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Morocco, Nicaragua, Peru, and South Africa, all suggest broadly sim-
ilar patterns.


      Mexico and Brazil similarly show absolute gains in these categories, both quite rapidly
up to 2000. However, growth has slowed over the 2000s and relative growth indeed does
suggest potential polarization. The literature cited above argues for only modest impact
of the emergence of China and India on Latin America. Further, the rise in global trade
largely driven by outsourcing occurred in the ’“long 90’s,” 1988 the early 2000s, the period
of greatest expansion of the operators category in these countries. It may be that these
countries have been more integrated in the automation wave than others. Panama shows a
broadly similar pattern. Liberia over 1974 to 2008 shows positive absolute but relative falls
as well although the brutal civil war there complicates inference.


      Overall, the category of crafts and related follows the broad tendencies in operators and
assemblers in Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mexico, Panama, South
  3
    The West Bank and Gaza, the only available economy not shown, exhibits a reduction, but then it does
in virtually all categories and the the fall in elementary occupations is far greater.


                                                   8
Africa, Zambia and perhaps Morocco. In Mexico, for example, the evolution is almost iden-
tical. This may reﬂect that, while not routine tasks, nonetheless electrical and electronic
trades workers, metal machinery, and building workers are inputs into industries that are.
That said, we might expect that automating plants would require these skills as much as
traditional.


   Finally, Figure 8 aggregates across our broader sample of countries and plots the average
growth rate by sector post-1990 relative to pre-1900. It is clear that the patterns are very
diﬀerent between the two samples. In the advanced countries, both skilled agricultural and
operators show absolute declines while more advanced and elementary tasks increase. In the
developing countries, operators, professionals and elementary occupations grow at approxi-
mately the same rate.


   These graphical ﬁndings are conﬁrmed by regression analysis with the broader panel of
countries. Speciﬁcally, we estimate the equation:


                 Lc
                  it = β1 I [t ≥ 2000 ∧ AC ]it + β2 I [t ≥ 2000 ∧ DC ]it + γi + εit            (1)

where Lc
       it is the log-level (or the share) of each of the major categories in the International

Standard Classiﬁcation of Occupations (ISCO) scheme for country i in year t and c represent
the job category. I [.] is a dummy variable equal to one if [.] condition is satisﬁed, 0 otherwise;
γi captures individual country ﬁxed eﬀects. The time dummies capture diﬀerential changes
by job category after the break point between advanced (DC)and developing country (LDC)
groups relative to the pre-breakpoint period. We two way cluster for standard errors by
country and year level as suggested by Bertrand et al. (2004).


   Table 2 presents the results for the log of absolute employment as the dependent variable
and table 3, the share of employment. Preliminary regressions allowing the break point to
change from 1995-2005 suggest 2001 as having the most explanatory power (R2 ), very close

                                                 9
to the break point discussed by Autor and this informs the deﬁnition of the dummies above.


   The presence of country ﬁxed eﬀects means that the dummies are measuring the aver-
age of country log level changes in employment (shares) by group relative to their pre-2000
levels and not relative to some third category. These broadly approximate the growth rate
of the second period relative to the ﬁrst. We ﬁrst notice little diﬀerence between the two
groups in legislators or professionals and only modestly faster growth of technicians in de-
veloping countries. Second, both clerks and service workers show growth rates roughly three
times higher in the developing countries. Third, skilled agricultural and ﬁshery workers
show insigniﬁcant change in developing countries, but a substantial fall in advanced coun-
tries suggesting a more rapid emptying out of the rural areas there. Fourth, among the key
categories of the craft and operators categories, we ﬁnd insigniﬁcant growth/decline among
the advanced countries broadly consistent with Autor, while developing countries continue
strong growth equal to any other sector except technicians. Elementary occupations main-
tain a similar level of growth as well, despite, somewhat in contrast with Autor’s ﬁndings,
stagnation in advanced countries. In sum, in the advanced countries, we do see stagnation
in the categories associated with the displacement of codiﬁable tasks in the “center” of the
occupational distribution, but in developing countries, job growth is broadly similar across
categories with the exception of skilled agricultural and forestry sectors, consistent with ex-
pected demographic shifts across the development process.


   Table 3 showing employment shares conﬁrms this diﬀerence in the polarization process.
For the advanced countries, craft workers show a 3.6 lp fall, and operators an 4.5 lp fall
(although statistically insigniﬁcant) while legislators grew 2.9 lp, professionals 4.4 lp, and
technicians 6.3 lp. Again, elementary occupations do not show strong growth weakening
the conclusion of polarization. But the point estimates suggest a loss of the codiﬁable type
job class. This is not replicated for the developing countries. Professionals, technicians and
service workers shows signiﬁcant gains 1.4, 2.3, 5.6 lp respectively. This is virtually entirely


                                              10
oﬀset by the fall in skilled agriculture and ﬁshery workers show which show a 11.4 lp fall,
again, expected structural change. Crafts, operators and elementary occupations show much
smaller point estimates and are never signiﬁcant reﬂecting the conﬂicting tendencies revealed
in the graphical analysis. Again, however, there is no evidence of polarization.




5     Looking Forward: Latent Polarization, Grounded
      Geese?
    The results above suggest that overall, we are not seeing the polarization found in the
advanced countries. Yet. Indonesia shows an absolute fall in the operators category while
technicians and service and elementary occupations rise. Both Mexico and Brazil show rela-
tively slow growth of the operators category which, while not showing the absolute hollowing
out found in the United States, is consistent with polarization.


    Further, press accounts suggest the emergence of the same automation dynamic in im-
portant follower countries. In China, there are signs that robotization is proceeding rapidly.
Perhaps the most pessimistic observer, Martin Ford, argues that from 1995-2002 roughly
15% or 16 million of the manufacturing workforce has been displaced by automation and
some iconic ﬁrms, like Foxconn, intend to have their million-worker factories 70% automated
by 2018. Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdon Province in the heart of China’s
manufacturing zone, aims to have 80% of its ﬁrms automated by 2020. The International
Federation of Robotics predicts that China will have more installed robots than any other
country by 2017. Part of this may reﬂect the dramatic fall in robot prices. The payback
period for a welding robot in the Chinese automotive industry, for instance, dropped from
5.3 years to 1.7 years between 2010 and 2015, and by 2017 is forecast to shrink to just 1.3
years.



                                             11
       In addition, both the Chinese and Korean governments now subsidize the introduction
of robots. The reasons vary. The Korean government is re-shoring to ensure adequate in-
dustrial capacity at home. China seeks both to raise the quality of its exports as an eﬀort to
brand Chinese products and this is easier with robots than the slower process of upgrading
the workforce. In addition, it seeks a share of a rapidly expanding robotics market.45


       This raises two concerns related to internal and international equity. As in the advanced
countries, we may not yet see the new more complex labor tasks described by Acemoglu
and Restrepo (2015) emerging as automation proceeds. While China has complemented au-
tomation with investment in training for more complex jobs, recent college graduates report
having problems ﬁnding employment and 43% consider themselves over-educated for their
                                                                                                       6
positions, much as Beaudry et al. (2013) suggest is happening in the United States.


       Perhaps the largest concern is that as automation eliminates routine manufacturing type
jobs, we may see a short circuiting of the traditional forces generating the “ﬂying geese”
pattern where stages of the value chain are passed down from advancing to lagging coun-

      “According to the International Federation of Robotics, an association of academic and business robotics
organizations, China bought approximately 56,000 of the 227,000 industrial robots purchased worldwide in
2014 – a 54 percent increase on 2013. And in all likelihood, China is just getting started. Late last month, the
government of Guangdong Province, the heart of China’s manufacturing behemoth, announced a three-year
program to subsidize the purchase of robots at nearly 2,000 of the provinces – and thus, the world’s – largest
manufacturers. Guangzhou, the provincial capital, aims to have 80 percent of its factories automated by
2020. China’s central government, always keen to avoid the disgruntlement of its working class, has made
eﬀorts of its own. It has committed to expanding vocational education so Chinas low skill workers will not
be left behind in an automated economy.” See http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-04-09/

      “That might not be a problem if the Chinese economy were generating plenty of higher-skill jobs for more
educated workers. The solution, then, would simply be to oﬀer more training and education to displaced
blue-collar workers. The reality, however, is that China has struggled to create enough white-collar jobs for
its soaring population of college graduates. In mid-2013, the Chinese government revealed that only about
half of the country’s current crop of college graduates had been able to ﬁnd jobs, while more than 20 percent
of the previous years graduates remained unemployed. According to one analysis, fully 43 percent of Chinese
workers already consider themselves to be over educated for their current positions. As software automation
and artiﬁcial intelligence increasingly aﬀect knowledge-based occupations, especially at the entry level, it may
well become even more diﬃcult for the Chinese economy to absorb workers who seek to climb the skills lad-
der”. See http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/11/opinion/chinas-troubling-robot-revolution.html.

tries. Even if Chinese workers, building on the learning by doing of the workforce over
the last 20 years, are able to move into complementary higher paying jobs, where will au-
tomation leave the follower countries with very unskilled labor that in the past might have
expected to inherit the routine jobs that China is now shedding, but which are now in fact,
disappearing altogether? Vietnam, which has beneﬁted from redirection of oﬀ-shoring as
China’s wages have risen, also has seen substantial automation of, for instance, the textile
industry over the last decade.7 The worry, then, is that there remains a large global popu-
lation with relatively weak cognitive and non-cognitive skills who will not be writing code
and programming robot routines anytime soon, but who will not inherit unskilled jobs either.



6         Conclusion
This paper has used census data to explore to what degree ﬁndings of polarization in the
advanced world can be found in the developing world. We ﬁrst oﬀer several reasons why we
might not expect to see the same tendencies found in the advanced world, or at least not
yet. It is also possible that between being destinations for oﬀ-shoring, and the fact that new
technologies may enable LDC citizens to overcome myriad structural and political economy
obstacles that form barriers to creating better jobs, the net impact might be expected to be
positive in the medium term. We then conﬁrm previous ﬁndings of polarization graphically
for the US and France. However, we do not ﬁnd strong evidence for polarization in LDCs.
The key category- plant and machine operators and assemblers, does not show absolute or
relative decrease in most developing countries across the last decades. Regression analysis
supports the graphical ﬁndings that on average, we do not ﬁnd evidence of polarization in
LDCs.


        This does not imply much about the future. We ﬁnd that Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico
do show relative decline in the operators category which could suggest potential polarizing

forces. Also of concern is that the moves toward robotization in China and other manu-
facturing centers that could exacerbate internal inequality and short circuit the pattern of
progressive handing down of routine manufacturing tasks to follower countries. Hence it
may be the non-appearance of the Vietnam pattern of expanding assembly and operators in
Africa, for example, that will be the important story.
