1.     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Overview

Established in 1988, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA or “the Agency”) is a member
of the World Bank Group (WBG)1 and is a legal entity separate and distinct from the other WBG entities
with its own charter as amended (the “Convention”), share capital, financial structure, management, and
staff. Membership in the Agency, which currently stands at 181 countries, is open to all members of IBRD.

MIGA contributes to the WBG’s two goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity by
facilitating foreign direct investments (FDI) into developing countries to support economic growth, reduce
poverty, and improve people’s lives. To this end, the Agency acts as a risk mitigator, providing investors
and lenders in the international investment community with the level of comfort necessary to invest in
developing countries by providing political risk insurance (PRI) and credit enhancement products. In
addition, as part of its mandate, the Agency may carry out complementary activities such as dispute
resolution in support of FDI, as well as research and knowledge services.

MIGA is committed to promoting projects that are economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable,
and that promise a strong development impact. Since its inception, MIGA has issued $36 billion of
guarantees, in support of 791 projects in 109 of its member countries. The Agency has also supported
multiple programs at regional and global levels in member countries.

MIGA’s business revenue base is represented by net premium income from its guarantee portfolio which
is comprised of gross premium income less, premiums ceded to its reinsurers net of ceding commission,
and less brokerage costs. Operating income, which is one of the Agency’s measures of financial
sustainability, represents the coverage of operating expenses by the net premium income. Operating income
combined with earnings from its investment portfolio, and after providing for expected losses and a
prudential level of unexpected losses on its guarantee portfolio, enables MIGA to retain capital resources
in the form of retained earnings and insurance portfolio reserves to strengthen its ability to support existing
guarantee exposures and new business (See Figure 1).

The inherent volatility in the Agency’s net income is driven primarily by the provision for guarantee claims
(of which the increase in the insurance portfolio reserve is a key component), and the performance of its
investment portfolio. Being a component of MIGA’s operating capital, any increase in the insurance
portfolio reserve by way of a charge through the Statement of Operations, and consequently retained
earnings, has no effect on the overall operating capital. MIGA manages its investment portfolio with the
objective of providing liquidity to pay for claims and to contribute to the long term capital growth.

In addition to operating income, Management believes that operating capital and capital
adequacy position, represented by the operating capital utilization, are the Agency’s key
measures of financial sustainability.

The following is a graphical illustration of MIGA’s financial model.

MIGA’s Outlook and Strategic Focus

During the FY15-17 period, working in collaboration with the other WBG entities and optimizing the
opportunities presented by its expanded product line (PRI and credit enhancing products) and broader
client base, MIGA plans to focus primarily on high risk countries (IDA and fragile and conflict-affected
states), and supporting innovative projects. While demand for PRI and credit enhancing products can
fluctuate from year to year, MIGA’s strategy focuses on growth with the goal of achieving 50% increase
in annual volume by FY17 compared to the new business issued in FY13.

Basis of Reporting

MIGA prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP) as well as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
MIGA FY15 Management’s Discussion and Analysis                                                                               4



Financial Results

New Business
During FY15, new guarantee commitments totaled $2.8 billion, compared to $3.2 billion in FY14. Of the
total new issuance in FY15, $0.8 billion (27% of total) was ceded to reinsurers compared to $1.5 billion
(46%) in FY14, with the decline in ceded exposure primarily due to 64% of the FY15 new business
written as smaller sized traditional PRI guarantees requiring less or no reinsurance in some cases.
Coupled with an overall portfolio run-off of $2.7 billion, as of June 30, 2015, MIGA’s gross and net
guarantee exposures stood at $12.5 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively, and reflected a continued
upward trend in these measures.

Operating Income
The Agency’s operating income was $34.1 million during FY15 compared to $26.9 million in the prior
fiscal year, an increase of $7.2 million or 27%. The increase was primarily due to the higher net premium
income resulting from a higher average gross exposure and a higher effective portfolio premium rate.

Net Loss
MIGA recorded a net loss of $10.8 million during FY15 compared to a net income $70.0 million in the
prior year, mainly due to the significantly higher provision for claims and lower investment income.

Operating Capital
Operating capital increased by $50 million to $1,312 million as of June 30, 2015. This primarily reflects
the impact of the operating income ($34.1 million) and investment income ($24.1 million).

Capital and Financial Risk Management

MIGA is financially self-sustaining, and its activities are supported by a strong capital base and a
comprehensive risk management framework. To this end, MIGA uses an Economic Capital-based
framework to assess its capital adequacy and risk-bearing capacity on an ongoing basis. A key component
of this is the capital utilization ratio, defined as Total Economic Capital/Operating Capital which stood at
54% as of June 30, 2015, well below the 70%-80% target range viewed by management as acceptable.


2.     DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
Business Segments

MIGA plays a critical role in supporting private investment flows to developing member countries by
offering PRI and credit enhancement products, investment dispute resolution, and research and knowledge
services.

Non-Commercial Risk Insurance
MIGA provides investment guarantees against certain non-commercial risks to eligible foreign investors
for qualified investments in developing member countries and offers coverage against the risks of: 1)
transfer restriction and inconvertibility, 2) expropriation, 3) breach of contract, 4) war and civil disturbance,
5) the non-honoring of a sovereign financial obligation, and 6) the non-honoring of financial obligation by
a state-owned enterprise. Investors may choose any combination of these covers2 (see Box 2). MIGA

2 Smaller guarantees may be underwritten through the MIGA’s Small Investment Program (SIP), but SIP coverage is limited to

the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.
MIGA FY15 Management’s Discussion and Analysis                                                                              5



insures new and existing cross-border investments originating in any MIGA member country, destined for
any developing member country. Types of investments that can be covered include equity, shareholder and
non-shareholder loans, and loan guarantees (provided the loans have a minimum maturity of more than one
year). Other forms of investments—such as technical assistance and management contracts, or franchising
and licensing agreements—may also be eligible.

Box 2. MIGA’s Product Line Up


   Traditional Political Risk Insurance
    Transfer restriction and inconvertibility – provides coverage for the risk of inconvertibility of local currency
      into foreign exchange for transfer outside the host country. Currency depreciation is not covered.
    Expropriation – covers the risk of partial or total loss of the insured investment as a result of acts by the host
      government that may reduce or eliminate ownership of, control over, or rights to the insured investment.
    War and civil disturbance – covers the risk of damage to, or the destruction or disappearance of, tangible
      covered assets caused by politically motivated acts of war or civil disturbance in the host country, including
      revolution, insurrection, coups d’état, sabotage and terrorism.
    Breach of contract – covers the risk of being unable to obtain or enforce an arbitral or judicial decision
      recognizing the breach of an obligation by the host government or a state-owned enterprise.
   Non-Honoring of Financial Obligations
    Non-honoring of a sovereign financial obligation (NHSFO) – covers the risk that a sovereign fails to honor an
     unconditional financial payment obligation or guarantee, where the underlying project meets all of MIGA’s
     eligibility requirements. Unlike MIGA’s breach of contract coverage, this credit enhancement coverage does not
     require a final arbitral award or court decision as a condition of payment of a claim. Sub-sovereign entities can
     also be covered.
    Non-honoring of financial obligation by a state-owned enterprise (NHFO-SOE)– covers the risk that a state-
     owned enterprise fails to honor an unconditional financial payment obligation or guarantee, where the underlying
     project meets all of MIGA’s eligibility requirements. This coverage does not require a final arbitral award or
     court decision as a condition of payment of a claim.



During FY15, MIGA issued guarantees for a total of $2.8 billion in support of 40 projects, which resulted
in cumulative guarantees issued of $36 billion, from MIGA’s inception in 1988, through June 30, 2015.
Table 1 contains a summary of cumulative guarantees issued in member countries.

* Includes amounts from Cooperative Underwriting Program issued prior to FY11.

Of the new guarantees issued, 24 projects were in one or more priority areas under the Agency’s current
three-year business strategy. This includes guarantees issued in support of 17 projects in IDA-eligible
countries, six projects in fragile and conflict-affected countries, and six projects considered to be
innovative3, collectively representing 60% of the 40 projects supported in FY15. Table 2 details the
issuance of guarantees in priority areas over each of the past three fiscal years.



3 Innovative projects include public-private blend financing, state owned enterprises, sub-sovereign guarantees and new

industries.

As of June 30, 2015, the total gross and net exposures amounted to $12.5 billion and $7.7 billion compared
to $12.4 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2014. Figure 2 below indicates the growth in the
guarantee portfolio over the last five fiscal years. Reinsurance on the overall portfolio declined to $4.8
billion (38%) as of June 30, 2015, compared to $5.3 billion (43%) as of June 30, 2014, and is primarily a
result of the lower reinsurance on new business written in FY15 coupled with the FY15 runoff on guarantees
carrying higher ceded percentages.

With Europe & Central Asia accounting for more than half of the FY15 new issuances, the region remains
the highest concentration of MIGA’s guarantee portfolio, and reflects the burgeoning demand for non-
honoring products and other financial sector related guarantees. The recent surge in the Agency’s exposure
to Latin America and the Caribbean also reflects its increasing support to infrastructure projects in the
region. Table 3 details the regional distribution of MIGA’s gross and net guarantee exposures at the end of
each of the past three fiscal years.

Infrastructure remains a key sector of focus with the highest portfolio concentration as of June 30, 2015,
followed by the financial sector. Table 4 shows the sector distribution of MIGA’s gross and net guarantee
exposures at the end of each of the past three fiscal years.

Investment Dispute Resolution
Consistent with Article 23 of the MIGA Convention, the Agency seeks both to remove impediments to the
flow of investment to developing member countries and to encourage the settlement of disputes between
investors and host governments. MIGA actively pursues the resolution of disputes affecting MIGA-
supported projects. In some cases, these efforts focus on situations in which either a claim has been or may
be filed. During FY15, MIGA engaged with investors or governments in relation to projects located in
Albania, Argentina, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Cote d’Ivoire, Djibouti, Lebanon,
Libya, Mali, Niger, Russian Federation, Rwanda, and Uganda. These discussions do not necessarily imply
that a claim was imminent.

3.       FUNDING SOURCES
Capital Stock
MIGA derives its financial strength primarily from the capital backing it receives from its shareholders and
its retained earnings.

MIGA’s Convention initially established its authorized capital stock (membership shares) at 100,000
shares—equivalent to $1,082 million—with a provision that the authorized capital stock shall
automatically increase upon the admission of a new member to the extent that the total number of
authorized shares are sufficient to allow subscription by the new member. During FY15, the total
authorized shares increased to 186,587 as of June 30, 2015, equivalent to $2,018.9 million. Bhutan
completed its membership requirements during FY15, bringing the total number of member countries to
181 as of June 30, 2015. Table 5 provides a summary of the capital stock as of June 30, 2015.

Table 5. Capital Stock ($M) – June 30, 2015

                                        Initial Capital          Capital Increase                    Total
Subscribed Capital                               1,169                        750                    1,919
Of which:
 Paid in Capital                                   234                        132                      366
 Callable Capital                                  935                        618                    1,553


Of the initial membership shares subscribed, 20 percent had been paid-in and the remaining 80 percent was
subject to call when needed by MIGA to meet its obligations. As of June 30, 2015, $109.9 million of paid-
in capital is in the form of nonnegotiable, non-interest bearing demand obligations (promissory notes). The
notes are denominated in freely convertible currencies and are due on demand to meet MIGA’s obligations.
Since inception, MIGA has not encashed any of the promissory notes.

Any calls on unpaid subscriptions are uniform on all shares. If the amount received by MIGA on a call is
insufficient to meet the obligations which necessitated the call, MIGA may make further calls until the
amounts received are sufficient to meet such obligations. The liability of a member on a call or calls is
limited to the unpaid balance of its capital subscription. Since its inception, no call has been made on
MIGA’s callable capital.

Equity
Total shareholders’ equity as of June 30, 2015 was $971.2 million compared with $974.2 million as of June
30, 2014. The decrease of $3.2 million primarily reflects the $10.8 million FY15 net loss, partially offset
by the $7.6 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss on account of reduction in actuarial
losses on the pension and post-retirement benefit plans.

4.        CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Underwriting Capacity
MIGA’s equity base ensures the financial sustainability of the Agency over both the short-term and long-
term. The subscribed capital and retained earnings determine the Agency’s statutory underwriting capacity.
The Council of Governors and the Board of Directors have set the maximum amount of contingent liability
that may be assumed by MIGA as 350 percent of the sum of its unimpaired subscribed capital and reserves
and retained earnings, and 100 percent of the ceded exposure. In other words, the maximum amount of net
guarantee exposure is determined by the amount of available capital, and the statutory underwriting capacity
is expressed on a gross exposure basis by adding the current amount of portfolio reinsurance. As of June
30, 2015, MIGA’s underwriting capacity was $14,853 million, as detailed in Table 6 below.

As of June 30, 2015, MIGA’s gross exposure was $12,538 million, representing 84 percent of MIGA’s
statutory underwriting capacity.

Capital Adequacy
Under its Economic Capital-based capital adequacy framework, MIGA’s measures of capital adequacy and
risk-bearing capacity include economic capital consumed by the guarantee portfolio. It provides an
analytically rigorous measure for assessing the consumption of risk capital by the core guarantee business,
and incorporates the effects from portfolio diversification and concentration. In addition, MIGA estimates
the minimum amount of capital that should be held against operational risk in the Agency and the risk of
loss in the investment portfolio.

Total economic capital, defined as capital consumption from the guarantee portfolio and estimated capital
required for operational risk5 and investment risk, represents a broader measure of MIGA’s capital
adequacy. As of June 30, 2015, the economic capital consumed by the guarantee portfolio amounted to
$644 million and the total economic capital for the Agency amounted to $705 million, compared to $561
million and $620 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2014. The $83 million increase in guarantee economic
capital primarily reflects (i) the volume growth and changes in the composition of MIGA’s guarantee
portfolio with increasing focus on complex transactions in strategic priority areas and non-honoring
business, and (ii) host country rating downgrades recognized during the year.

  For the purposes of calculation of the underwriting capacity, exposure ceded excludes adjustments relating to the exposure
exchange agreement with IBRD, which as of June 30, 2015 stood at $4.6 million.
5
  Operational risk capital is based on the Basel II methodology for calculating operational risk capital as a percentage of gross
revenues and amounted to $41 million as of June 30, 2015.
MIGA FY15 Management’s Discussion and Analysis                                                                10



In addition to gauging the capital adequacy position by comparing the current amount of economic capital
consumed by MIGA’s activities and available operating capital through an annual exercise, MIGA assesses
how much economic capital is projected to be utilized in the future under various scenarios of growth and
development of the guarantee portfolio. These stress-test scenarios estimate the economic capital consumed
under assumptions of continued growth in MIGA’s portfolio over four years, in combination with increased
concentration of exposures, country rating downgrades, regional and global contagion effects, and changes
to the product mix.

MIGA’s management monitors the level and utilization of available operating capital, which is comprised
of paid-in-capital, retained earnings, and the insurance portfolio reserve, net of the corresponding
reinsurance recoverable. MIGA management’s objective is to have sufficient operating capital to sustain
losses associated with claims and to support the ongoing business without facing a significant risk of having
to avail itself of the callable capital. As measures of the current utilization of this capital, by the guarantee
portfolio and by the Agency as a whole, Table 7 shows the ratios of guarantee portfolio and total economic
capital to operating capital over the past three years. These ratios stood at 49.1 percent and 53.7 percent,
respectively, as of June 30, 2015 compared with 44.5 percent and 49.1 percent as of June 30, 2014. The
June 30, 2015 ratios are well below the 70-80 percent range which management considers acceptable.

As a gauge of year-on-year changes to the relative risk-level of the guarantee portfolio, Table 7 also shows
the ratio of guarantee portfolio economic capital to portfolio net exposure. As of June 30, 2015, this ratio
stood at 8.4 percent compared to 7.9 percent at end-FY14. The above ratios indicate a strong and stable
capital position for the Agency at the end of FY15.

5.      INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
MIGA’s investment policy sets the objectives and constraints for managing MIGA’s investment assets. As
claims arise, MIGA’s invested assets will be liquidated to pay claims on a pre-recovery basis. The portfolio
consists of two tranches. Tranche 1 is managed with target duration between 1 to 2 years to support
potential claims, and consists of investments in cash, treasury securities, agency securities, mortgage-
backed securities (MBS), asset-backed securities (ABS) and sovereign securities. Tranche 2 (Long-Term
Investment Portfolio or LTIP) supports long-term capital growth, by investing in assets such as global
equities. Portfolio management activities for MIGA’s fixed income assets, as well as trading, risk analytics
and reporting, are provided by IBRD’s Treasury Investment Management Department.

In response to the sustained volatility in global equity markets, in March 2015, MIGA de-risked the
remaining global equity portfolio holdings, thereby locking in the related mark-to-market gains.
Consequently, as of June 30, 2015, MIGA had no Tranche 2 investment holdings. MIGA is considering
various alternatives to reinstate the Tranche 2 investment holdings.

As of June 30, 2015, the net investment portfolio totaled $1,323 million comprised of cash, treasury
securities, agency securities, MBS, ABS, sovereign and government guaranteed securities, and derivatives

6.       RISK MANAGEMENT
The responsibility for approving MIGA’s risk management policies lies with the Board of Directors. The
Audit Committee of the Board deals with risk management issues. While the Executive Vice President and
Chief Executive Officer assumes the responsibility for overall risk management with the support of the senior
management team, the responsibility for the design and operational implementation of the risk management
framework lies with the Finance and Risk Management Group with input from the Legal Affairs and Claims
Group, the Operations Group and the Economics and Sustainability Group.

Risk Categories

MIGA is exposed to a variety of risks and uses risk management programs such as an Economic Capital
Framework, and reinsurance arrangements to manage its risk. Below is a description of risk management
systems of the important risks for MIGA.

 Insurance Risk
Assessment of non–commercial risk forms an integral part of MIGA’s underwriting process, and includes the
analysis of both country-related and project-related risks. Insurance risk arises from MIGA’s core business
of issuing investment guarantees. MIGA’s earnings depend upon the extent to which claims experience is
consistent with assumptions used in setting prices for products and establishing technical provisions and
liabilities for claims. If actual claims experience of the Agency is less favorable than underlying assumptions,
then income would be reduced. MIGA monitors claim activities and provisions for pending claims. In
addition, claims reserves for the guarantee portfolio are calculated, using MIGA’s Economic Capital Model.

Portfolio Risk
For portfolio risk management purposes, MIGA currently utilizes an Economic Capital (EC) 6 Model, based
on best practices applied in risk modeling. Under the EC Model, MIGA defines its economic capital as the
99.99th percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a one year horizon, minus the mean of the loss
distribution, which is in line with industry practice. The model helps evaluate concentration risk in the

6
  The Economic Capital concept is a widely recognized risk management tool in the banking and insurance industries, defining
the minimum amount of capital an organization needs to hold in order to withstand larger than expected losses with a high degree
of confidence, over a defined time horizon and given the risk exposure and defined risk tolerance.
MIGA FY15 Management’s Discussion and Analysis                                                                   13



guarantee portfolio and facilitates active, risk-based exposure management by allocating the Economic
Capital to particular regions, countries, sectors, covers, or individual contracts, based on their respective risk
contribution. Additionally, in order to prevent excessive risk concentration, MIGA uses the EC model to set
maximum net guarantee exposure limits per country and per project, which as of June 30, 2015 stood at $820
million and $250 million, respectively.

As of June 30, 2015, the top ten largest exposure countries are shown below in Table 9, and accounted for
46% of the total net guarantee portfolio.

Liquidity Risk
Adequate liquidity resources need to be maintained to sustain the Agency over prolonged periods of cash
payouts due to claims. MIGA assesses and monitors the availability of its liquid assets on a periodic basis
and analyzes the impact on its finances (capital and liquidity) under stress scenarios where claims situations
propagate through contagion across countries and regions. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, the
Agency paid three claims, bringing the cumulative number of claims paid since inception to eight, excluding
trust fund related claim payments.

Operational Risk
Operational risk is intrinsic to financial institutions and is an important component of the agency-wide risk
management framework. The most important types of operational risk involve breakdowns in internal
controls, processes, systems and corporate governance.

MIGA mitigates operational risks by maintaining a sound internal control system based on the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)’s 2013 Integrated Internal Control
framework. A key component of this, pertaining to the effectiveness of key controls over external financial
reporting, is assessed and validated annually.
MIGA FY15 Management’s Discussion and Analysis                                                                                      14



Legal Risk
Legal risks arise primarily from changes in the legal parameters of MIGA’s member countries as a result of
legislation or court decisions that may affect MIGA’s activities. There are also legal risks associated with
MIGA being involved in legal disputes and arbitration proceedings, especially in the context of claim
resolution or settlement.

MIGA manages these risks by monitoring current and prospective developments by way of ongoing
discussions with member countries’ representatives on the Board of Directors and Council of Governors.
MIGA also shares information and analyses with other members of the World Bank Group, the IMF and the
United Nations. In addition, MIGA actively participates as a member of the Berne Union in discussions and
analyses of the changes in the operating investment environment in its member countries.


7.          CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The notes to MIGA’s financial statements contain a detailed summary of MIGA’s accounting policies.
Described below are those accounting policies which involve significant management judgment and
estimates when preparing the Agency’s financial statements and accompanying notes to conform to both
U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Accounting estimates generally involve the establishment of parameters by
management based on judgments about the probable outcome of future conditions, transactions, or events.
Because these are projections, actual results may differ from those estimates in a variety of areas. The area
which management deems most critical with respect to the application of estimates and assumptions is the
establishment of MIGA’s loss reserves.

Reserve for Claims
MIGA’s provisioning methodology builds on portfolio risk quantification models that use both individually
assessed loss probabilities for projects at risk and rating-based loss probabilities that are applied to the entire
guarantee portfolio. Under this methodology, for the purpose of presentation in the financial statements,
MIGA’s reserve consists of two primary components, the Specific Reserve and the Insurance Portfolio
Reserve.7

Reserves are presented on a gross basis on the liability side of the balance sheet, and the associated
reinsurance assets on the asset side, since reinsurance does not relieve MIGA of its primary liability to the
insured. A detailed summary of MIGA’s provisioning policy can be found in the Notes to Financial
Statements – Note A, Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
Along with IBRD and IFC, MIGA participates in pension and post-retirement benefit plans that cover almost
all of their staff members. All costs, assets, and liabilities associated with these plans are allocated among
IBRD, IFC, and MIGA based upon their employees’ respective participation in the plans. The underlying
actuarial assumptions, fair value of plan assets, and funded status associated with these plans are based on
financial market interest rates, past experience, and management’s best estimate of future benefit changes
and economic conditions. For further details, please refer to the Notes to Financial Statements – Note F,
Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits.




7   The Insurance Portfolio Reserve is calculated as the 95th percentile loss less the mean loss from the Economic Capital Model.
MIGA FY15 Management’s Discussion and Analysis                                                                  15



Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair values of financial instruments are based on a three-level hierarchy. For financial instruments
classified as Levels 1 and 2, inputs are based on observable market data, with less judgment applied in
arriving at fair values. For financial instruments classified as Level 3, where applicable, unobservable inputs
are used. These require Management to make significant assumptions and judgments in determining fair
value measures.

All of MIGA’s financial instruments are classified as Levels 1 and 2, as the inputs are based on observable
market data, with less judgment applied in arriving at fair value measures. The methodology, inputs, and
assumptions are reviewed, on a quarterly basis, to assess the appropriateness of the fair value hierarchy
classification of each financial instrument.

In cases where Management relies on instrument valuations supplied by external pricing vendors, procedures
are in place to validate the appropriateness of the models used, as well as the inputs applied in determining
those values.


8.      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
MIGA’s operating income is defined as the excess of net premium income over the administrative expenses
and pension and post-retirement benefit plan expenses incurred over the fiscal year while the net income is
arrived at after considering the investment earnings and the provisions of claims and any translation gains
and losses.

While operating income is a more predictable measure of financial performance, the Agency’s net income
is inherently volatile, primarily due to the impact of claims loss provisioning, of which the changes in the
estimate of the insurance portfolio reserve is a key component. An increase in the insurance portfolio reserve
is a charge against income translating into a reduction in retained earnings. Since both the insurance portfolio
reserve and the retained earnings are components of the operating capital, the latter remains unaffected by
any changes in the estimate of the insurance portfolio reserve. As can be seen below in Figure 4, operating
capital has continued to grow, unaffected by the volatility in the net income (loss) over the last five fiscal
years. This is primarily due to the inverse relationship shared with the increase in the claims provisioning
effect on the Statement of Operations.

FY15 versus FY14
The factors contributing to the higher operating income and net loss in FY15 are discussed further below.

Operating Income

MIGA had an operating income of $34.1 million in FY15 compared to $26.9 million in FY14, an increase
of $7.2 million or 27%. The key drivers for the growth are the increase in net premium income and the
lower administrative expenses.

Net Premium Income

The Agency’s net premium income in FY15 was $79.0 million compared to $72.5 million in FY14, an
increase of $6.5 million or 9%, attributable to the following:

        Average Gross Exposure: The average gross exposure has increased to $12.2 billion in FY15
         compared to $11.3 billion in FY14, an increase of $0.9 billion or 8%.
        Effective Premium Rate: The effective premium rate on the overall portfolio increased to 1.05% as
         of June 30, 2015 from 1.02% as of June 30, 2014. This was largely driven by the increased
         proportion of the non-honoring product in the overall portfolio which earns on average a higher
         premium rate than traditional PRI products. The effective rate for the non-honoring product
         increased from 1.26% as of June 30, 2015 compared to 1.23% as of June 30, 2014 while the
         effective rate on traditional PRI increased marginally to 0.97% as of June 30, 2015 from 0.96% as
         of June 30, 2014.

Administrative Expenses (including Pension and Post Retirement Benefit Plan Expenses)

MIGA’s administrative expenses, on a combined basis, decreased in FY15 to $44.9 million compared to
$45.5 million in FY14. The decrease was primarily due to lower fixed costs associated with vacancies in
senior staff positions and return of field based senior staff to headquarters. In addition, lower travel
expenses and delays in contractual services contributed to the overall decrease in the FY15 administrative
expenses.

Net Loss / Income

FY15 net loss of $10.8 million represented a significant decrease of $80.8 million compared to net income
of $70.0 million in FY14 and is primarily due to the following:

Income from Investments
MIGA’s investment portfolio generated $24.1 million of investment income in FY15, compared with $53.4
million in FY14. The yield was 2.0 percent in FY15 compared with 4.4 percent in FY14, with the returns
from global equities significantly contributing to the investment income in both years. As noted in Section
5, Investment Management, MIGA fully de-risked its Global Equity holdings in March 2015.

Provision for Claims
MIGA recorded an increase in net reserves for claims of $50.9 million in FY15 compared to $13.1 million
in FY14. The higher charge in FY15 primarily reflects the effect of changes in the portfolio size and
composition, and net country risk rating downgrades compared to net upgrades in the prior year.


9.      CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND CONTROL
General Governance
Board Membership
MIGA’s Board of Directors consists of 25 members. In accordance with the Convention establishing
MIGA, all members of the Board are elected every two years by their member governments. Directors are
neither officers, nor staff of MIGA. The President serves as the presiding officer, is the only management
member of the Board of Directors, and ordinarily has no vote except a deciding vote in the case of an equal
division. The Board has established five standing committees which are each chaired by a Director: (i)
Committee on Development Effectiveness or CODE, (ii) Audit Committee or AC, (iii) Budget Committee
or BC, (iv) Human Resources Committee or HRC, and (v) Committee on Governance and Administrative
Matters or COGAM. The Directors maintain an Ethics Committee to consider matters relating to the
interpretation or application of the Code of Conduct for Board Officials.
The Directors and their committees operate in continuous session at the principal offices of the World Bank
Group, and meet in accordance with the Agency’s business needs. Each committee’s terms of reference
establishes its respective roles and responsibilities. Their role is primarily to help the full Board of Directors
discharge its oversight responsibilities through in-depth examination of policies and practices.

Senior Management Changes
Effective March 1, 2015, Mr. Santiago Assalini was appointed Director, Corporate Risk.
Subsequent to the reporting date, effective July 1, 2015, Ms. Karin Finkelston was appointed as Vice
President and Chief Operating Officer.

Audit Committee
Membership
The Audit Committee consists of eight members of the Board of Directors. Membership on the Committee
is determined by the Board of Directors, based upon nominations by the Chairman of the Board, following
informal consultation with the Directors. In addition, the composition of the Committee is expected to
reflect the economic and geographic diversity of MIGA’s member countries. Other relevant selection
criteria include seniority, continuity, and relevant experience. Some or all of the responsibilities of
individual Committee members are performed by their alternates or advisors. Generally, Committee
members are appointed for a two-year term; reappointment to a second term, when possible, is desirable
for continuity. Audit Committee meetings are generally open to any member of the Board who wishes to
attend, and non-Committee members of the Board may participate in the discussion but cannot vote. In
addition, the Chairman of the Audit Committee may speak in that capacity at meetings of the Board of
Directors, with respect to discussions held at the Audit Committee.

Key Responsibilities
The Audit Committee has a mandate to assist the Board of Directors in overseeing MIGA’s finances,
accounting, risk management, and internal controls. This mandate includes the review and oversight of
MIGA’s financial statements and financial reporting related to trust funds. The Audit Committee is also
responsible for recommending to the Board of Directors the appointment of the external auditor, as well as
monitoring the performance and independence of the external auditor. The Audit Committee oversees the
internal audit function, including reviewing the responsibilities, staffing, annual internal audit plan, and
effectiveness of internal audit. In the execution of its role, the Committee discusses with management, the
external auditors, and internal auditors, financial issues and policies which have an impact on the Agency’s
financial position and risk-bearing capacity. The Committee also reviews with the external auditor the
financial statements prior to their publication and recommends the annual audited financial statements for
approval to the Directors. The Audit Committee monitors the evolution of developments in corporate
governance and encourages continuous improvement of, and adherence to MIGA’s policies, procedures,
and practices.


Communications
The Audit Committee communicates regularly with the full Board of Directors through distribution of the
following documents:
   The minutes of its meetings.
   Reports of the Audit Committee prepared by the Chairman, which document discussions held. These
    reports are distributed to the Directors, Alternates Directors, World Bank Group Senior Management,
    and MIGA Senior Management.
   “Statement(s) of the Chairman” and statements issued by other members of the Audit Committee.
   The Annual Report to the Board of Directors, which provides an overview of the main issues addressed
    by the committee over the year.

The Audit Committee’s communications with the external auditor are described in the Auditor
Independence section.
MIGA FY15 Management’s Discussion and Analysis                                                             20



Executive Sessions
Under the Audit Committee’s Terms of Reference, members of the Audit Committee shall meet periodically
in separate executive or, where specifically required, closed sessions with management, the Auditor
General, the External Auditor, and the Vice President for Institutional Integrity, to discuss any matters that
the Committee or any of the foregoing believes should be discussed privately.

Access to Resources and to Management
Throughout the year, the Audit Committee receives a large volume of information, with respect to the
financial position, financial statement presentations, risk assessment, and risk management, as well as
matters regarding governance and controls. The Audit Committee meets both formally and informally
throughout the year to discuss finance, accounting, risk management, and internal controls matters. The
Directors have unrestricted access to management. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with
management the quarterly and annual financial statements. The committee also reviews with the external
auditor the financial statements prior to their publication and recommends these for approval to the Board
of Directors.

The Audit Committee has the authority to seek advice and assistance from outside legal, accounting, or
other advisors as it deems necessary.

Code of Conduct and Business Conduct Framework
Staff members’ ethical obligations to the institution are embodied in its Core Values and Principles of Staff
Employment. As a member organization, MIGA has adopted the updated World Bank Group Code of
Conduct, Living our Values (the Code), which is a practical guide to assist staff in making the Bank Group’s
Core Values a part of what staff does every day. The Code applies to all staff worldwide and is available
on IBRD’s website, www.worldbank.org.

In addition to the Code, the business conduct obligations of staff are articulated in the Staff Manual
(Principles of Staff Employment, Staff Rules), Administrative Manual, and other guidelines. The Principles
and Staff Rules require that all staff avoid or properly manage conflicts of interest. To protect individual
staff in MIGA from apparent and real (potential or actual) conflicts of interest, senior managers are required
to complete an annual financial disclosure statement with the Office of Ethics and Business Conduct.

Guidance for staff is also provided through programs, training materials, and other resources. Managers are
responsible for ensuring that internal systems, policies, and procedures are consistently aligned with
MIGA's business conduct framework. The following World Bank Group units assist in communicating
business conduct expectations to staff:
   The Office of Ethics and Business Conduct (EBC) provides leadership, management and oversight for
    MIGA’s ethics infrastructure including the Ethics HelpLine, a consolidated conflicts of interest
    disclosure/resolution system, financial disclosure, ongoing training to both internal and external audi-
    ences, and communication resources. This office has the mandate to review and assist in the resolution
    of allegations of staff misconduct.
   The Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) is charged with investigating allegations of fraud and corruption
    in projects benefiting from World Bank Group funding or guarantees. It also trains and educates staff
    and clients in detecting and reporting fraud and corruption.
Both EBC and INT report directly to the President and each is composed of professionals from a range of
disciplines including financial analysts, researchers, investigators, lawyers, prosecutors, forensic
accountants, and staff with operational experience across the World Bank Group. These units maintain
comprehensive websites to provide guidance on how to handle concerns.

Auditor Independence
The appointment of the external auditor of MIGA is governed by a set of Board-approved principles. Key
features of those principles include:
    Prohibition of the external auditor from the provision of any non-audit related services
    All audit-related services must be pre-approved on a case-by-case basis by the Board of Directors, upon
     recommendation by the Audit Committee
    Mandatory rebidding of the external audit contract every five years, with a limitation of two consecutive
     terms and mandatory rotation thereafter, provided however that the committee may exceptionally
     recommend that the incumbent audit firm should be allowed to participate in the re-bidding
    An evaluation of the performance of the external auditor at the mid-point of the five year term.
The external auditor is appointed to a five-year term of service. This is subject to annual reappointment
based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee and approval of a resolution by the Directors.

As standard practice, the external auditor is invited as an observer to attend all Audit Committee meetings
and is frequently asked to present its perspective on issues. In addition, the Audit Committee meets
periodically with the external auditor in private sessions without the presence of management.
Communication between the external auditor and the Audit Committee is ongoing, as frequently as is
deemed necessary by either party. MIGA’s external auditors follow the communication requirements with
audit committees set out under US Generally Accepted Auditing Standards and International Standards on
Auditing. In keeping with these standards, significant formal communications include:
    Quarterly and annual financial statement reporting
    Annual appointment of the external auditors
    Presentation of the external audit plan
    Presentation of control recommendations and discussion of the Internal Control over Financial
     Reporting (ICFR) attestation and report
    Presentation of a statement regarding independence
In addition to committee meetings, individual members of the Audit Committee have independent access
to the external auditor.
Internal Control
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management makes an annual assertion whether, as of June 30 of each fiscal year, the organization’s system
of internal control over its external financial reporting has met the criteria for effective internal control over
external financial reporting as described in the 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework recently
issued by The Committee of the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)8 on May
14, 2013. The 2013 Framework supersedes the 1992 Framework and clarifies internal control concepts
simplifying their use and application.
Concurrently, MIGA’s external auditor provides an attestation report on whether Management’s assertion
regarding the effectiveness of internal control over external financial reporting is fairly stated in all material
respects.


8COSO was formed in 1985 to sponsor the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting, an independent private-
sector initiative which studied the casual factors that can lead to fraudulent financial reporting. In 1992, COSO issued its Internal
Control-Integrated Framework, which provided a common definition of internal control and guidance on judging its
effectiveness. Revisions to the original framework were subsequently effected in May 2013 and will be effective for
MIGA from FY15.

President and Board of Directors
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency:

We have examined management’s assertion, included in the accompanying Management’s Report Regarding
Effectiveness of Internal Control Over External Financial Reporting, that the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015,
based on criteria established in the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). MIGA’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assertion on the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report Regarding
Effectiveness of Internal Control Over External Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assertion based on our examination.

We conducted our examination in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our examination included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our examination also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

An entity’s internal control over financial reporting is a process effected by those charged with governance,
management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation of
reliable financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board. An entity’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and International Financial Reporting
Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and that receipts and expenditures of
the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and those charged with
governance; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention, or timely detection and correction
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent, or detect and
correct misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

                                KPMG LLP is a Delaware limited liability partnership,
                                the U.S. member firm of KPMG International Cooperative
                                (“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity.
                                                                                                             25



In our opinion, management’s assertion that MIGA maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2015 is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in the
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America and International Standards on Auditing, the financial statements of MIGA, which comprise the
balance sheets as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of operations, comprehensive income,
changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and our report dated August 6,
2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

President and Board of Directors
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency:

Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA), which comprise the balance sheets as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of
operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended,
and the related notes to the financial statements.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and International
Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board; this includes the
design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material
misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those
risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.

Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of MIGA as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

Other Matters
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. The
statement of subscriptions to capital stock and voting power and the statement of guarantees outstanding as
of June 30, 2015 are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the financial
statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly
to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has
been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain
additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying
accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements
themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America and International Standards on Auditing. In our opinion, the information is fairly
stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements as a whole.

We also have examined in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, management’s assertion, included in the accompanying Management’s Report
Regarding Effectiveness of Internal Control Over External Financial Reporting, that MIGA maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015, based on criteria established in the
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated August 6, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion
on management’s assertion.

Notes to Financial Statements
Purpose
       The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), established on April 12, 1988 and located in
       Washington D.C., is a member of the World Bank Group which also includes the International Bank
       for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the
       International Development Association (IDA), and the International Center for Settlement of
       Investment Disputes (ICSID). MIGA’s activities are closely coordinated with and complement the
       overall development objectives of the other World Bank Group institutions. MIGA is designed to help
       developing countries attract productive foreign investment by both private investors and commercially
       operated public sector companies. Its facilities include guarantees or insurance against noncommercial
       risks and a program of advisory services and technical assistance to support member countries’ efforts
       to attract and retain foreign direct investment.

       MIGA is immune from taxation pursuant to Chapter VII, Article 47, of the Convention establishing the
       Agency.

Note A: Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies

      Basis of Preparation
      MIGA's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
      Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The policy adopted is that
      considered most appropriate to the circumstances of MIGA having regard to its legal requirements and
      to the practices of other international insurance entities.

       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS and U.S. GAAP requires
       management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
       statements. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could
       differ from these estimates. Significant judgments have been made in areas which management views
       as most critical with respect to the establishment of the loss reserves, and valuation of pension and
       post-retirement benefits-related liabilities and the related net periodic cost of such benefit plans.

       Certain reclassifications of the prior year’s information have been made to conform with the current
       year’s presentation. In particular, effective July 1, 2014, Translation (losses) gains – Investments and
       other assets line item, that was previously included under Income on the Statement of Operations has
       been reclassified and is now disclosed separately below Expenses.

       On August 6, 2015, the Directors approved these financial statements for issue, which was also the
       date through which MIGA’s management evaluated subsequent events.

       The significant accounting policies employed by MIGA are summarized below.

       Investments
       MIGA manages its investment portfolio both for the purpose of providing liquidity for potential
       claims and for capital growth. MIGA invests in global equity securities, time deposits, mortgage
       /asset-backed securities (ABS) and government and agency obligations based on its investment
       authorization approved by the Board. Government and agency obligations include highly rated fixed-
       rate bonds, notes, bills and other obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of
       countries or other official entities, including government agencies or by multilateral organizations.
MIGA Financial Statements                                                                                 39
Notes to Financial Statements
      MIGA makes use of derivative contracts such as exchange traded futures, options and covered
      forward contracts to manage its investment portfolio. The purposes of these transactions are to
      enhance the return and manage the overall duration of the portfolio. With respect to futures and
      options, MIGA generally closes out most open positions prior to expiration. Futures are settled on a
      daily basis.

      MIGA has classified and accounted for all its investment securities as trading securities. Investments
      classified as trading securities are reported at fair value using trade-date accounting. Securities
      purchased or sold may have a settlement date that is different from the trade-date. A liability is
      recorded for securities purchased but not settled before the reporting dates. Similarly, a receivable
      (Other Assets) is recorded for securities sold but not settled before the reporting dates.

      For trading securities, unrealized net gains and losses are recognized in earnings. Income from
      investments includes net gains and losses, dividend income and interest income.

      Nonnegotiable, Noninterest-bearing Demand Obligations on Account of Subscribed Capital
      Payments on these instruments are due to MIGA upon demand and are held in bank accounts which
      bear MIGA’s name. Accordingly, these instruments are carried and reported at face value as assets
      on the Balance Sheet.

      Impairment of Reinsurance Assets
      MIGA assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that the reinsurance
      asset is impaired, and makes a provision for such impairment, where necessary. Objective evidence
      may be in the form of observable data that comes to MIGA’s attention periodically. If impairment
      is determined, the carrying amount of the reinsurance asset is reduced through the use of an
      allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the Statement of Operations.

      Reserve for Claims
      MIGA’s reserve for claims consists of two primary components, the Specific Reserve and the
      Insurance Portfolio Reserve. These components are comprehensive and mutually exclusive with
      respect to risk of losses that may develop from each guarantee contract, and from the contingent
      liability for the portfolio as a whole.

      The Specific Reserve is calculated based on contract-specific parameters that are reviewed every
      quarter by MIGA’s management for contracts that have known difficulties. The Insurance Portfolio
      Reserve is calculated based on the long-term historical experiences of the non-commercial risk
      insurance industry.

      Assumptions and parameters used in the calculations are intended to serve as the basis for an
      objective reserve for probable claims. Key assumptions, including frequency of claim, severity, and
      expected recovery have been quantitatively derived from the non-commercial risk insurance
      industry’s historical claims data. The principal sources of data used as inputs for the assumptions
      include the Berne Union and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). The historical
      analysis of the data from those sources is further augmented by an internal econometric scoring
      analysis in order to derive risk-differentiated parameters with term structure effects over time. The
      historical and econometric analyses cover periods that are over 30 years, and the derived
      parameters are considered stable in the short term; however the parameters are reviewed
      periodically. Short-term risk changes are captured by changes in internal risk ratings for countries
      and contracts on a quarterly basis. For the purpose of claims provisioning, MIGA factors in the
      time value of money of potential cash flows, using representative risk-free interest rates as the
      discount rates.
MIGA Financial Statements                                                                                    40
Notes to Financial Statements
      For the purpose of the presentation of the financial statements, insurance liabilities (or reserves) are
      presented on a gross basis and not net of reinsurance. Therefore, MIGA’s reserves are shown on a
      gross basis on the liability side of the balance sheet, while establishing reinsurance recoverable assets
      on the asset side. Reinsurance does not relieve MIGA of its primary liability to the insured.

      Currency Translation
      Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at market exchange rates in
      effect at the end of the reporting period. Income and expenses are translated at either the market
      exchange rates in effect on the dates on which they are recognized or at an average of the market
      exchange rates in effect during each month. Translation adjustments are reflected in the Statement
      of Operations.

      MIGA has in place a system for active management of exposures to foreign currencies, under
      which the amounts of non-U.S. dollar assets are matched to non-U.S. dollar insurance portfolio
      reserve components. The objective is to align the currency compositions of MIGA’s assets and
      liabilities to minimize the sensitivity of MIGA’s net income to movements in foreign currency
      exchange rates.

      Valuation of Capital Stock
      Under the MIGA Convention, all payments from members subscribing to the capital stock of MIGA
      shall be settled on the basis of the average value of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) introduced by
      the International Monetary Fund, as valued in terms of United States dollars for the period January 1,
      1981 to June 30, 1985, such value being equal to $1.082 for one SDR.

      Revenue Recognition
      Premium amounts received on direct insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts assumed can be
      upfront, annual, semi-annual or quarterly and are recorded as unearned premium. Premiums are
      recognized as earned on a pro rata basis over the contract period. A receivable for premium is
      recorded when a contract has been issued or renewed and coverage amounts have been specified.

      MIGA cedes to reinsurers in the normal course of business by obtaining treaty and facultative
      reinsurance to augment its underwriting capacity and to mitigate its risk by protecting portions of its
      insurance portfolio. Premiums ceded follow the same approach as for direct insurance contracts and
      are recognized as expenses on a pro rata basis over the contract period.

      Fee and commission income for MIGA primarily consists of administrative fees, arrangement fees,
      facility fees, renewal fees, commitment (offer) fees, and ceding commissions. Fees and commissions
      received upon contract issuance or renewal are recognized as income on a pro rata basis over the
      contract period.

      Financial Guarantees
      Financial guarantees are commitments issued by MIGA to guarantee payment performance to a third
      party. Financial guarantees are regarded as outstanding when the underlying financial obligation of
      the debtor is incurred, and called when a guaranteed party demands payment under the guarantee.
      MIGA would be required to perform under its financial guarantees if the payments guaranteed were
      not made by the debtor and the guaranteed party called the guarantee by demanding payment from
      MIGA in accordance with the terms of the guarantee.

      Where applicable, MIGA records the fair value of the obligation to stand ready, and a corresponding
      asset in the financial statements. Guarantee fee income, is deferred and amortized over the life of the

Notes to Financial Statements
      guarantee. MIGA also records a contingent liability for the probable losses related to guarantees
      outstanding.

      Statement of Cash Flows
      For the purpose of MIGA’s Statement of Cash Flows, cash is defined as the amounts of unrestricted
      currencies due from Banks.

      Fair Value Measurements
      FASB’s ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures and IFRS 7, Financial
      Instruments: Disclosures, define fair value, establish a consistent framework for measuring fair
      value, establish a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and
      expand disclosure requirements about fair value measurements.

      MIGA has an established process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted
      market prices, where available. Examples include exchange-traded equity securities, futures
      contracts, and most government and agency securities.

      For financial instruments for which quoted market prices are not readily available, fair values are
      determined using model-based valuation techniques, whether internally generated or vendor
      supplied, that include the standard discounted cash flow method using market observable inputs
      such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, constant prepayment rates; and credit spreads. Where
      applicable, unobservable inputs such as constant prepayment rates, probability of default, and loss
      severity are used. Unless quoted prices are available, time deposits are valued at face value, which
      approximates fair value.

      Fair Value Hierarchy
      ASC 820-10 and IFRS 7 establish a three-level fair value hierarchy under which financial
      instruments are categorized based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair
      value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
      liabilities (Level 1), the next highest priority to observable market-based inputs or inputs that are
      corroborated by market data (Level 2) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that are not
      corroborated by market data (Level 3). When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within
      different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which fair value measurement is categorized is
      based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
      Thus, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable and unobservable.
      Additionally, ASC 820-10 requires that the valuation techniques used to measure fair value
      maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

      Financial assets and liabilities at fair value are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation
      techniques as follows:

      Level 1: Financial assets whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets
      or liabilities in active markets.

      Level 2: Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices for similar assets
      or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-
      active markets; or pricing models for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or
      indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

      Level 3: Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques
      that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.

      In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards
      Update (ASU) 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions,
      Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures. The ASU requires repurchase-to-maturity transactions and
      some repurchase financing arrangements to be accounted for as secured borrowings. It also requires
      additional disclosures about certain transactions accounted for as sales and about the nature of
      collateral pledged for transactions accounted for as secured borrowings. For MIGA, the ASU became
      effective from the quarter ended March 31, 2015 but did not have any impact on MIGA’s financial
      statements since all repurchase agreements are already accounted for as secured borrowings.
      Additional disclosures required by the ASU have been included in the financial statements for the
      year ending June 30, 2015 under Note B, Investments.

      In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements (Subtopic 205-
      40): Going Concern – Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s ability to Continue as a Going
      Concern. The ASU provides guidance on management’s responsibilities in evaluating the entity’s
      ability to continue as a going concern and for the related financial statement disclosures. Until now
      guidance related to this topic was provided under U.S. auditing standards, which do not govern
      management’s disclosures. Under this ASU, for each reporting period, management would be
      required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the
      entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date in which the financial
      statements are issued. For MIGA, the ASU will be effective beginning with the fiscal year ending
      June 30, 2017. MIGA is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements but
      does not expect the ASU to have a significant impact.

      In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the
      Consolidation Analysis. This ASU makes amendments to the current consolidation guidance focusing
      on targeted areas for certain types of entities. For non-public entities, the ASU will become effective
      for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods within fiscal years
      beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. MIGA is currently evaluating the
      impact of this ASU on its financial statements.

      In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) – Disclosures for
      Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). The
      ASU eliminates the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments for which
      fair values are measured at net asset value (NAV) using the practical expedient included in the
      guidance for fair value measurements of Topic 820. For non-public business entities, the ASU is
      effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal
      years. MIGA has elected to early adopt the ASU for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, as permitted
      by the ASU. As permitted by the ASU, MIGA has excluded from the fair value hierarchy investments
      measured using NAV in Note F – Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits.

      In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-09, Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944):
      Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts. The ASU makes certain improvements to the disclosure
      requirements on short-duration insurance contracts and focuses on providing users of financial
      statements with more transparent information about an insurance entity's (1) initial claim estimates
      and subsequent adjustments to those estimates, (2) methodologies and judgments in estimating claims,
      and (3) timing, frequency and uncertainty of future cash flows related to the insurance liabilities. For
      non-public entities, the ASU will become effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
      2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. MIGA is
      currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements.

Notes to Financial Statements
      Differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS

      MIGA’s accounting policy on pension accounting is to follow The Compensation Retirement Benefits
      Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 715-30, which requires employers to
      recognize on their balance sheets the funded status of their defined benefit postretirement plans,
      measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit
      obligation. Actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period are
      recognized as part of Other Comprehensive Income to the extent they are not recognized as
      components of the net periodic benefit cost. Additionally, ASC 715-30 requires unrecognized net
      actuarial gains or losses and unrecognized prior service costs to be recognized in the ending balance
      of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. These amounts are adjusted as they are subsequently
      recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.

      MIGA’s accounting policy under IAS 19, Employee Benefits, is to immediately recognize all actuarial
      gains and losses “in a statement of changes in shareholder’s equity” through Other Comprehensive
      Income in the period in which they occur.

      The salient differences between ASC 715-30 (MIGA policy) and IAS 19 as applied by MIGA pertain
      to the following: (a) Unrecognized actuarial gains (losses): ASC 715-30 requires that unrecognized
      actuarial gains (losses) in Equity be amortized through the income statement while IAS 19 prohibits
      recycling; (b) Recognition of prior service cost: IAS 19 requires immediate recognition of prior
      service cost while ASC 715-30 requires straight-line basis recognition over the remaining vesting
      period; (c) Net interest cost (income) computation: Computation under ASC 715-30 is based on
      separate computation of interest cost and expected return on plan assets, while under IAS 19 it is
      based on the plan funded status and the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligations;
      and (d) Funded status recognition: ASC 715-30 and IAS 19 primarily differ on the basis of net asset
      recognized relating to the post-retirement plans. MIGA does not believe the differences are material.

     Note B: Investments
      The investment securities held by MIGA are carried and reported at fair value, or at face value which
      approximates fair value. As of June 30, 2015, the majority of the Investments – Trading is comprised
      of government and agency obligations and time deposits (39.9% and 33.5%, respectively), with all
      instruments being classified as Level 1 and Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

           Inter-Level Transfers:
           MIGA’s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out of levels as of the end of the reporting
           period in which they occur.

           There were no inter-level transfers during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014.

           Securities Lending:
           MIGA may engage in securities lending and repurchases against adequate collateral, as well as
           securities borrowing and reverse repurchases (resale) of government and agency obligations and
           asset-backed securities. These transactions are conducted under legally enforceable master netting
           arrangements, which allow MIGA to reduce its gross credit exposure related to these transactions.
           For Balance Sheet presentation purposes, MIGA presents its securities lending and repurchases, as
           well as re-sales, on a gross basis. As of June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, there were no amounts
           which could potentially be offset as a result of legally enforceable master netting arrangements.

           Transfers of securities by MIGA to counterparties are not accounted for as sales as the accounting
           criteria for the treatment as sale have not been met. Counterparties are permitted to re-pledge these
           securities until the repurchase date.

Notes to Financial Statements
      The following is a summary of the carrying amount of the securities transferred under repurchase
      agreements, and the related liabilities:

      Liabilities relating to securities transferred under
        repurchase agreements                                                      $         27,825       $          66,379


      As of June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, there were no liabilities relating to securities transferred
      under repurchase or securities lending agreements that had not settled at that date.

      Securities lending and repurchase agreements expose MIGA to several risks, including
      counterparty risk, reinvestment risk, and risk of a collateral gap (increase or decrease in the fair
      value of collateral pledged). MIGA has procedures in place to ensure that all repurchase agreement
      trading activity and balances are always below predefined counterparty and maturity limits, and to
      actively monitor all net counterparty exposure, after collateral, through daily mark-to-market.
      Whenever the collateral pledged by MIGA related to its borrowings under repurchase agreements
      and securities lending agreements declines in value, the transaction is re-priced as appropriate by
      pledging additional collateral.

      The following tables present the disaggregation of the gross obligation by class of collateral
      pledged and the remaining contractual maturities for repurchase agreements that are accounted for
      as secured borrowings as of June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014:

      a. Excludes $594K relating to payable for cash collateral received.

      In the case of resale agreements, MIGA receives collateral in the form of liquid securities and is
      permitted to re-pledge these securities. While these transactions are legally considered to be true
      purchases and sales, the securities received are not recorded as Investments on MIGA’s Balance
      Sheet as the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale have not been met. As of June 30, 2015,
      MIGA had not received any securities under resale agreements ($Nil - June 30, 2014).

      Credit Exposure:
      The maximum credit exposure of investments closely approximates the fair values of the financial
      instruments.

      Asset backed securities (ABS) are diversified among credit cards, student loans, home equity loans
      and mortgage backed securities. Since these holdings are investment grade, neither concentration risk
      nor credit risk represents a significant risk to MIGA as of June 30, 2015. However, market
      deterioration could cause this to change in future periods.

      Derivative Instruments:
      MIGA uses currency forward contracts to enhance the returns from and manage the currency risk in
      the investment portfolio.

      a. Exchange traded instruments are generally subject to daily margin requirements and or deemed
      to have no material credit risk. All options and futures contracts are interest contracts.
      b. These relate to TBA securities.


      Offsetting Assets and Liabilities

      MIGA enters into master netting agreements with substantially all of its derivative counterparties.
      These legally enforceable master netting agreements give MIGA the right to liquidate securities held
      as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty, in the event of default
      by the counterparty.

      The presentation of derivative instruments is consistent with the manner in which these instruments
      are settled; currency forward contracts are settled on a gross basis.

Notes to Financial Statements
      The following tables summarize information on derivative receivables and payables (before and after
      netting adjustments) that are reflected on MIGA’s Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2015 and June 30,
      2014. Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into

     Note C: Capital Stock
      The MIGA Convention established MIGA’s authorized capital stock at 100,000 shares with a
      provision that the authorized capital stock shall automatically increase on the admission of a new
      member to the extent that the then authorized shares are insufficient to provide the shares to be
      subscribed by such member. The Convention further states that 10 percent of the members’ initial
      subscription be paid in cash, in freely convertible currencies, except that developing member
      countries may pay up to a quarter of the 10 percent in their own currencies. An additional 10
      percent of the initial subscription shall be paid in the form of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing
      promissory notes. The notes are denominated in freely convertible currencies and are due on
      demand to meet MIGA’s obligations. The remaining 80 percent is subject to call when required by
      MIGA to meet its obligations.

      On March 29, 1999, the Council of Governors approved a General Capital Increase (GCI)
      resolution increasing the authorized capital stock of MIGA by 78,559 shares to be subscribed by
      members during the subscription period ending March 28, 2002. Of the additional capital, 17.65
      percent is to be paid in cash, in freely usable currency. The remaining 82.35 percent is subject to
      call when required by MIGA to meet its obligations. On May 6, 2002, the Council of Governors
      adopted a resolution to extend the GCI subscription period to March 28, 2003. On March 17, 2003,
      the Council of Governors approved an amendment to the GCI resolution allowing eligible countries
      to subscribe to the GCI shares allocated to them by submitting an Instrument of Contribution before
      the GCI deadline of March 28, 2003, and requesting such countries to pay for their GCI shares as

      At June 30, 2015, MIGA’s authorized capital stock comprised 186,587 (186,537 – June 30, 2014)
      shares, of which 177,331 (177,281 – June 30, 2014) shares had been subscribed. Each share has a
      par value of SDR10,000, valued at the rate of $1.082 per SDR. Of the subscribed capital as of June
      30, 2015, $366,122,000 ($366,014,000 – June 30, 2014) has been paid in; and the remaining
      $1,552,599,000 ($1,552,166,000 - June 30, 2014) is subject to call. At June 30, 2015, MIGA had

      Note D: Guarantees
      Guarantee Program
      MIGA offers guarantees or insurance against loss caused by non-commercial risks to eligible
      investors on qualified investments in developing member countries. MIGA insures investments for
      up to 20 years against six different categories of risk: currency inconvertibility and transfer
      restriction, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, breach of contract, non-honoring of a sovereign
      financial obligation, and non-honoring of financial obligation by a state-owned enterprise.

      Premium rates applicable are set forth in the contracts. Payments against all claims under a guarantee
      may not exceed the maximum amount of coverage issued under the guarantee. Under breach of
      contract coverage, payments against claims may not exceed the lesser of the amount of guarantee and
      the arbitration award.

      Contingent Liability
      The maximum amount of contingent liability (gross exposure) of MIGA under guarantees issued and
      outstanding at June 30, 2015 totaled $12,538,328,000 ($12,408,770,000 – June 30, 2014). A contract
      of guarantee issued by MIGA may permit the guarantee holder, at the start of each contract period, to
      elect coverage and place amounts both on current and standby. MIGA is currently at risk for amounts
      placed on current. The maximum amount of contingent liability is MIGA's maximum exposure to
      insurance claims, which includes "standby" coverage for which MIGA is committed but not currently
      at risk. At June 30, 2015, MIGA's actual exposure to insurance claims, exclusive of standby coverage
      is $9,394,398,000 ($9,727,068,000 – June 30, 2014).

      Trust Fund Activities
      MIGA also acts as administrator of some investment guarantee trust funds. MIGA, on behalf of the
      trust funds, issues guarantees against loss caused by non-commercial risks to eligible investors on
      qualified investments in the countries specified in the trust fund agreements. Under the trust fund
      agreements, MIGA, as administrator of the trust funds, is not liable on its own account for payment
      of any claims under contracts of guarantees issued by MIGA on behalf of such trust funds. Contract of
      guarantees issued by MIGA on behalf of trust funds as of June 30, 2015, totaled $21,209,800
      ($20,259,400 – June 30, 2014).

      In addition, MIGA administers the Conflict Affected and Fragile Economies Facility (CAFEF), a
      donor partner-funded trust fund established in April 2013. Under the CAFEF reinsurance structure,
      MIGA issues guarantees and cedes to the CAFEF an initial loss layer of which MIGA shares a
      portion, for eligible projects. As of June 30, 2015, amounts ceded to CAFEF under this type of
      structure, totaled $20,886,000 ($5,250,000 – June 30, 2014).

      Reinsurance
      MIGA obtains treaty and facultative reinsurance (both public and private) to augment its
      underwriting capacity and to mitigate its risk by protecting portions of its insurance portfolio, and
      not for speculative reasons. All reinsurance contracts are ceded on a proportionate basis. However,
      MIGA is exposed to reinsurance non-performance risk in the event that reinsurers fail to pay their
      proportionate share of the loss in case of a claim. MIGA manages this risk by requiring that
      private sector reinsurers be rated by at least two of the four major rating agencies (Standard &
      Poor’s, A.M. Best, Moody’s and Fitch), and that such ratings be above a minimum threshold. In
MIGA Financial Statements                                                                                 55
Notes to Financial Statements
      addition, MIGA may also place reinsurance with public insurers of member countries that operate
      under and benefit from the full faith and credit of their governments and with multilateral agencies
      that represent an acceptable counterparty risk. MIGA has established limits, at both the project and
      portfolio levels, which restrict the amount of reinsurance that may be ceded. The project limit
      states that MIGA may cede no more than 90 percent of any individual project. The portfolio limit
      states that MIGA may not reinsure more than 50 percent of its aggregate gross exposure.

      Of the $12,538,328,000 outstanding contingent liability (gross exposure) as at June 30, 2015
      ($12,408,770,000– June 30, 2014), $4,804,973,000 ($5,290,855,000 – June 30, 2014) was ceded
      through contracts of reinsurance and $20,886,000 ($5,250,000 – June 30, 2014) was ceded to
      CAFEF. After adjusting for the impact of the Exposure Exchange Agreement with IBRD (See
      Note G, Transactions with Affiliated Organizations) of $4,574,000 ($Nil – June 30, 2014), the net
      exposure amounted to $7,707,895,000 as at June 30, 2015 ($7,112,665,000 – June 30, 2014).

      MIGA can also provide both public (official) and private insurers with facultative reinsurance. As
      of June 30, 2015, total insurance assumed by MIGA, primarily with official investment insurers,

Notes to Financial Statements
      Portfolio Risk Management
      Prudent acceptance of non-commercial risk in developing countries is MIGA’s core business. The
      underwriting of such risk requires a comprehensive risk management framework to analyze,
      measure, mitigate and control risk exposures.

      Claims risk, the largest risk for MIGA, is the risk of incurring a financial loss as a result of a
      claimable non-commercial risk event in developing countries. Non-commercial risk assessment
      forms an integral part of MIGA's underwriting process and includes the analysis of both country-
      related and project-related risks.

      Country risk assessment is a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis. Ratings are
      assigned individually to each risk for which MIGA provides insurance coverage in a country.
      Country ratings are reviewed and updated every quarter. Country risk assessment forms the basis
      of the underwriting of insurance contracts, setting of premium levels, capital adequacy assessment
      and provisioning for claims.

      Project-specific risk assessment is performed by a cross-functional team. Based on the analysis of
      project-specific risk factors within the country context, the final project risk ratings can be higher
      or lower than the country ratings of a specific coverage. The decision to issue an insurance
      contract is subject to approval by MIGA’s senior management and concurrence or approval by the
      Board of Directors. For insurance contracts that are issued under the Small Investment Program
      (SIP), the Board has delegated approval to MIGA’s senior management. In order to avoid
      excessive risk concentration, MIGA sets exposure limits per country and per project. As of June
      30, 2015, the maximum net exposure which may be assumed by MIGA is $820 million ($720
      million – June 30, 2014) in each host country and $250 million ($220 million – June 30, 2014) for
      each project.

      As approved by the Board of Directors and the Council of Governors, the maximum aggregate
      amount of contingent liabilities that may be assumed by MIGA is 350 percent of the sum of
      MIGA's unimpaired subscribed capital, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive
      income (loss) and insurance portfolio reserve plus 100 percent of gross exposure ceded by MIGA
      through contracts of reinsurance. Accordingly, at June 30, 2015, the maximum level of guarantees
      outstanding (including reinsurance) may not exceed $14,852,701,000 ($15,145,581,000 – June 30,
      2014).

Notes to Financial Statements
      Portfolio Diversification
      MIGA aims to diversify its guarantee portfolio so as to limit the concentration of exposure to loss
      in a host country, region, or sector. The portfolio shares of the top five and top ten largest
      exposure countries provide an indicator of concentration risk. The gross and net exposures of the
      top five and top ten countries at June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014 are as follows:

      A regionally diversified portfolio is desirable for MIGA as an insurer, because correlations of
      claims occurrences are typically higher within a region than between regions. When a correlation
      is higher, the probability of simultaneous occurrences of claims will be higher.

        Specific reserve for claims                                             (2,800)               (7,800)

      The foreign currency translation adjustment reflects the impact on MIGA's claim reserve arising
      from the revaluation of guarantee contracts denominated in currencies other than US dollar. The
      foreign currency translation impact on claim reserve is effectively managed through MIGA's
      system for managing exposures to foreign currencies by holding equivalent amounts in the
      Investment portfolio. The amount by which the reserve increases (decreases) as a result of
      translation adjustment is offset by the translation gains (losses) on MIGA's investment portfolio
      and other assets, reported on the Statement of Operations.

      Specific Reserve for Claims

      The specific reserve for claims is composed of reserves for pending claims and reserves for
      contracts where a claimable event, or events that may give rise to a claimable event, may have
      occurred, but in relation to which no claim has been filed, but where a loss is probable. The
      parameters used in calculating the specific reserves, i.e., claims probability, severity and expected
      recovery, are assessed on a quarterly basis for each contract for which a reserve is created or
      maintained. At June 30, 2015, the specific reserves amounted to $Nil ($9,700,000 – June 30, 2014)
      on a gross basis and $Nil ($7,400,000 – June 30, 2014), net of reinsurance.

During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, MIGA received two new claims relating to War and Civil
Disturbance in Burkina Faso and in Libya. The claim arising in Burkina Faso has been paid. The claim arising in
Libya is pending, and based on management’s assessment as of June 30, 2015, no reserve has been set for this
claim. In addition, during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, MIGA paid claims relating to investment in Mali
and the Central African Republic that were pending at the beginning of the fiscal year.

Notes to Financial Statements
     Note F: Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits

      MIGA, IBRD and IFC participate in a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff
      Benefits Plan (RSBP) and a Post-Employment Benefits Plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of
      their staff members.

      The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The regular pension
      benefit component provides a final salary guaranteed benefit or equivalent annuity, while the cash
      balance plan provides benefits equal to the amounts contributed by both the employer and the
      employee plus investment returns, or equivalent annuity. The RSBP provides certain health and
      life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. The PEBP provides certain pension benefits
      administered outside the SRP.

      Responsibility for governance of the plans, including overseeing all aspects of the plans including
      investment decisions and contribution rates, lies with the IBRD’s Pension Financial Committee.

      MIGA uses a June 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

      All costs, assets and liabilities associated with these pension plans are allocated between MIGA,
      IBRD, and IFC based upon their employees’ respective participation in the plans. Cost allocated to
      IBRD are then shared between IBRD and IDA based on an agreed cost sharing ratio. MIGA and
      IFC reimburse IBRD for their proportionate share of any contributions made to these plans by
      IBRD. Contributions to these plans are calculated as a percentage of salary.

      The amounts presented below reflect MIGA’s respective share of the costs, assets, and liabilities of
      the plans.

      The following table summarizes MIGA’s respective share of the costs associated with the SRP,
      RSBP, and PEBP for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014:

Notes to Financial Statements
      The following table summarizes the projected benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and
      funded status associated with the SRP, RSBP and PEBP for MIGA for the fiscal years ended June
      30, 2015 and June 30, 2014. While contributions made to SRP and RSBP are irrevocable,
      contributions made to PEBP are revocable. As a result, the assets for PEBP do not qualify for off-
      balance sheet accounting and are included in IBRD’s investment portfolio, with MIGA’s portion
      reflected in receivable from IBRD under Note G (Transactions with Affiliated Organizations). The
      assets of the PEBP are invested in fixed- income and equity instruments.

       Actuarial Assumptions
       The actuarial assumptions used are based on financial market interest rates, inflation expectations, past
       experience, and management’s best estimate of future benefit changes and economic conditions. Changes
       in these assumptions will impact future benefit costs and obligations.

       The expected long-term rate of return for the SRP assets is a weighted average of the expected long term
       (10 years or more) returns for the various asset classes, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class
       returns are developed using a forward-looking building block approach. Equity returns are generally
       developed as the sum of expected inflation, expected real earnings growth and expected long-term dividend
       yield. Bond returns are generally developed as the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk
       premium/spread (as appropriate). Other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to equity and
       bond markets. The expected long-term rate of return for the RSBP is computed using procedures similar to
       those used for the SRP. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference
       to the year-end yields of AA corporate bonds.

       Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual results are different from expected results. Amortization of
       these unrecognized gains and losses will be included in income if, at the beginning of the fiscal year, they
       exceed 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan
       assets. If required, the unrecognized gains and losses are amortized over the expected average remaining
       service lives of the employee group.

       The following tables present the weighted-average assumptions used in determining the projected benefit
       obligations and the net periodic pension costs for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014:

Each sensitivity analysis disclosed in this note is based on changing one assumption while holding all other
assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be
correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the projected benefit obligations to variations in significant
actuarial assumptions, the same method has been applied as for calculating the liability recognized in the
statement of financial position.

         Investment Strategy
         The investment policies establishes the framework for investment of the plan assets based on long-
         term investment objectives and the trade-offs inherent in seeking adequate investment returns
         within acceptable risk parameters. A key component of the investment policy is to establish a
         Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) representing the policy portfolio (i.e., policy mix of assets)
         around which the plans are invested. The SAA for the plans are reviewed in detail and reset about
         every three years, with more frequent reviews and changes if and as needed based on market
         conditions.
         The key long-term objective is to seek to generate asset performance that is reasonable in relation
         to the growth rate of the underlying liabilities and the assumed sponsor contribution rates without
         taking undue risks. Given the relatively long investment horizons of the SRP and RSBP, and the
         relatively modest liquidity needs over the short-term to pay benefits and meet other cash
         requirements, the focus of the investment strategy is on generating sustainable long-term
         investment returns through a globally diversified set of strategies including equity, private equity
         and real estate.
         The SAA is derived using a mix of quantitative analysis that incorporates expected returns and
         volatilities by asset class as well as correlations across the asset classes, and qualitative
         considerations such as the desired liquidity needs of the plans. The strategic asset allocation is
         comprised of a diversified portfolio drawn from among fixed- income, equity, real assets and
         absolute return strategies.

      Significant Concentrations of Risk in Plan Assets
      The assets of the SRP and RSBP are diversified across a variety of asset classes. Investments in
      these asset classes are further diversified across funds, managers, strategies, geographies and
      sectors to limit the impact of any individual investment. In spite of such level of diversification,
      equity market risk remains the primary source of the overall return volatility of the Plans.


      Risk management practices
      Managing investment risk is an integral part of managing the assets of the Plans. Asset
      diversification and consideration of the characteristics of the liabilities are central to the overall
      investment strategy and risk management approach for the SRP. Absolute risk indicators such as
      the overall return volatility and drawdown of the Plans are the primary measures used to define the
      risk tolerance level and establish the overall level of investment risk. In addition, the level of active
      risk (defined as the annualized standard deviation of portfolio returns relative to those of the policy
      portfolio) is closely monitored and managed on ongoing basis.
      Market risk is regularly monitored at the absolute level, as well as at the relative levels with respect
      to the investment policy, manager benchmarks, and liabilities of the Plans. Stress tests are
      performed periodically using relevant market scenarios to assess the impact of extreme market
      events.
      Monitoring of performance (at both manager and asset class levels) against benchmarks, and
      compliance with investment guidelines, is carried out on a regular basis as part of the risk
      monitoring process. Risk management for different asset classes is tailored to their specific
      characteristics and is an integral part of the external managers’ due diligence and monitoring
      processes.

Notes to Financial Statements
            Credit risk is monitored on a regular basis and assessed for possible credit event impacts. The
            liquidity position of the Plans is analyzed at regular intervals and periodically tested using various
            stress scenarios to ensure that the Plans have sufficient liquidity to meet all cash flow
            requirements. In addition, the long-term cash flow needs of the Plans are considered during the
            SAA exercise and are one of the main drivers in determining maximum allocation to the illiquid
            investment vehicles.
            The Plans mitigate operational risk by maintaining a system of internal control along with other
            checks and balances at various levels.

            Valuation methods and assumptions
            The following are general descriptions of asset categories, as well as the valuation methodologies
            and inputs used to determine the fair value of each major category of Plan assets. It is important to
            note that the investment amounts in the asset categories shown in the table above are different from
            the asset category allocation shown in the Investment Strategy section of the notes. Asset classes in
            the table above are grouped by the characteristics of the investments held. The asset class break-
            down in the Investment Strategy section is based on management’s view of the economic exposures
            after considering the impact of derivatives and certain trading strategies.

Notes to Financial Statements
      Debt securities
      Debt securities include time deposits, U.S. treasuries and agencies, debt obligations of foreign
      governments and debt obligations in corporations of domestic and foreign issuers. Fixed- income
      also includes investments in asset backed securities such as collateralized mortgage obligations and
      mortgage- backed securities. These securities are valued by independent pricing vendors at quoted
      market prices for the same or similar securities, where available. If quoted market prices are not
      available, fair values are based on discounted cash flow models using market-based parameters such
      as yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Some debt
      securities are valued using techniques which require significant unobservable inputs.

      The selection of these inputs may involve some judgment. Management believes its estimates of fair
      value are reasonable given its processes for obtaining securities prices from multiple independent
      third-party vendors, ensuring that valuation models are reviewed and validated, and applying its
      approach consistently from period to period. Unless quoted prices are available, money market
      instruments and securities purchased under resale agreements are reported at face value which
      approximates fair value.

      Equity securities
      Equity securities (including REITs) are invested in companies in various industries and countries.
      Investments in public equity listed on securities exchanges are valued at the last reported sale price
      on the last business day of the fiscal year.

      Commingled funds
      Commingled funds are typically common or collective trusts reported at NAV as provided by the
      investment manager or sponsor of the fund based on valuation of underlying investments, and
      reviewed by management.

      Private equity
      Private equity includes investments primarily in leveraged buyouts, distressed investments and
      venture capital funds across North America, Europe and Asia in a variety of sectors. A large number
      of these funds are in the investment phase of their life cycle. Private equity investments do not have
      a readily determinable fair market value and are reported at NAV provided by the fund managers,
      and reviewed by management, taking into consideration the latest audited financial statements of the
      funds. The underlying investments are valued using inputs such as cost, operating results,
      discounted future cash flows and trading multiples of comparable public securities.

      Real estate
      Real estate includes several funds which invest in core real estate as well as non-core types of real
      estate investments such as debt, value add, and opportunistic equity investments. Real estate
      investments do not have a readily determinable fair market value and are reported at NAV provided
      by the fund managers, and reviewed by management, taking into consideration the latest audited
      financial statements of the funds. The valuations of underlying investments are based on income
      and/or cost approaches or comparable sales approach, and taking into account discount and
      capitalization rates, financial conditions, local market conditions among others.

      Hedge fund investments
      Hedge fund investments include those seeking to maximize absolute returns using a broad range of
      strategies to enhance returns and provide additional diversification. Hedge Funds include
      investments in equity, event driven, fixed income, multi strategy and macro relative value strategies.
      These investments do not have a readily determinable fair market value and are reported at NAVs
      provided by external managers or fund administrators (based on the valuations of underlying

Notes to Financial Statements
      investments) on a monthly basis, and reviewed by management, taking into consideration the latest
      audited financial statements of the funds.

      Investments in hedge funds and commingled funds can typically be redeemed at NAV within the
      near term while investments in private equity and most real estate are inherently long term and
      illiquid in nature with a quarter lag in reporting by the fund managers. For the reporting of those
      asset classes with a reporting lag, management estimates are based on the latest available
      information taking into account underlying market fundamentals and significant events through the
      balance sheet date.

      Investment in derivatives
      Investment in derivatives such as equity or bond futures, to-be-announced (TBA) securities, swaps,
      options and currency forwards are used to achieve a variety of objectives that include hedging
      interest rates and currency risks, gaining desired market exposure of a security, an index or currency
      exposure and rebalancing the portfolio. Over-the-counter derivatives are reported using valuations
      based on discounted cash flow methods incorporating market observable input.

      Estimated Future Benefits Payments

      The following table shows the benefit payments expected to be paid in each of the next five years
      and subsequent five years. The expected benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used
      to measure the benefit obligation at June 30, 2015:

      Expected Contributions

      MIGA’s contribution to the SRP and RSBP varies from year to year, as determined by the Pension
      Finance Committee, which bases its judgment on the results of annual actuarial valuations of the
      assets and liabilities of the SRP and RSBP. The best estimate of the amount of contributions
      expected to be paid to the SRP and RSBP for MIGA during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015
      is $2,952,000 and $1,005,000, respectively.

      Exposure Exchange with IBRD

      During FY14, MIGA entered into an exposure exchange agreement with IBRD under which MIGA
      and IBRD agreed to exchange $120 million each of notional amount of exposures on their
      respective balance sheets with one another. Under the agreement, IBRD provided a guarantee on
      principal and interest pertaining to MIGA’s guarantee exposure under its Non-Honoring of
      Sovereign’s Financial Obligation in exchange for MIGA’s guarantee on IBRD's loan principal and
      interest exposure. As of June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, the outstanding off-balance sheet

      Note I: Fair Value Measurement

      Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a
      financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
      MIGA uses observable market data, when available, and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs
      when determining fair value. The fair values of MIGA's cash and non-negotiable, non-interest-
      bearing demand obligations, receivables for investment securities sold, payables for investment
      securities purchased, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their carrying values.
      The fair values of government obligations are based on quoted market prices and the fair values of
      asset-backed securities are based on pricing models for which market observable inputs are used.
      The degree to which management judgment is involved in determining the fair value of a financial
      instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market
      parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or
      observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value.
      Substantially all of MIGA’s financial instruments use either of the foregoing methodologies to
      determine fair values that are recorded on its financial statements.

      Note J: Risk Management

      The responsibility for approving MIGA’s risk management policies lies with the Board of
      Directors. The Audit Committee of the Board deals with risk management issues. While the
      Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer assumes the responsibility for overall risk
      management with the support of the senior management team, the responsibility for the design and
      operational implementation of the risk management framework lies with the Finance and Risk
      Management Group with input from the Legal Affairs and Claims Group, the Operations Group
      and the Economics and Sustainability Group.

Notes to Financial Statements
     The description below provides information on the various risks to which MIGA is exposed,
     including a discussion on the related risk mitigants.

      Risk Categories

      • Credit Risk – Reinsurance Counterparts
      Counter-party credit risk in MIGA’s portfolio is the risk that reinsurers would fail to pay their
      share of a claim. MIGA requires that private sector reinsurers, with which it conducts business, be
      rated by at least two of the four major rating agencies (Standard & Poor’s, A.M. Best, Moody’s and
      Fitch), and that the ratings be above a minimum threshold. Also, MIGA has established limits at
      both the project and portfolio levels, which restrict the amount of reinsurance.

      The following table summarizes the ceded exposure by counter-party rating as of June 30, 2015
      and June 30, 2014:

      • Credit Risk – Investment Portfolio
      MIGA’s investment portfolio does not have material credit risk exposure as the portfolio is
      currently invested in fixed-income securities with high credit quality. The Board’s Investment
      Authorization stipulates that government or agency sponsored debt securities be AA-rated or
      above, time deposits be A-rated or above, and corporate debt securities be AAA-rated.

      • Interest Rate Risk
      Interest rate changes affect the market values of MIGA’s invested assets. A need to liquidate assets
      to pay for claims in an unfavorable interest rate environment may generate trading losses and
      reduce investment income. Changes in interest rates will also affect prepayment speeds of
      mortgage and asset backed security holdings, which may affect the duration of the asset portfolio.
      A 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve would impact the net income for the fiscal year
      ended June 30, 2015, by approximately $18.8 million ($15.9 million – June 30, 2014). This interest
      rate sensitivity is illustrative only and is based on simplified scenarios. The impact of a parallel
      shift in interest rates is determined using market value weighted portfolio duration applied to
      invested asset balance at year end.

Notes to Financial Statements
      • Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
      The majority of MIGA’s assets and contingent liabilities are denominated in USD, but some
      guarantee contracts are issued in other currencies such as EUR. To the extent that a claim is made
      in a non-USD currency and requires payment in excess of MIGA’s holdings of that currency,
      MIGA may face a foreign exchange related loss in converting to the needed currency to pay for a
      claim. A 10% change in the USD/Euro year end exchange rate would impact net income for the
      fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, by approximately $15.5 million ($16.6 million – fiscal year end
      June 30, 2014) and net guarantee exposure by approximately $275.6 million ($281.8 million –
      fiscal year end June 30, 2014). The impact on the net income is mitigated by an offsetting effect
      due to exchange rate movement on investment portfolio and other assets. This foreign exchange
      rate sensitivity is illustrative only and is based on simplified scenarios.
