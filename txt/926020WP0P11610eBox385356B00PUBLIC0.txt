     turn to productive civilian life of former members of the      modalities and develop actionable lessons to inform and

     3.6	 Project Phases
     The project was implemented in three phases. As seen in the following diagram, the service delivery components
     were broken into two to allow for additional flexibility to assess mid-way through the project and incorporate those
     lessons into the remaining programming. Although entirely unintended, this break between phases was scheduled for
     December 15, 2013 and thus the devastating civil unrest did not impact delivery in Phase 1. Phase 2 was postponed
     due to security and services resumed starting April 2014. Implementing Partner Service delivery was finalized by the
     end of July 2014.

     Phase 3 of the pilot was established to ensure that the pilot achieved the learning objectives by imbedding an external
     evaluation and a period of knowledge consolidation and transfer.

                                6         Changing Dynamics
                                        	 in South Sudan DDR



     I
        n addition to the learnings found from the pilot itself, it is important to note the changed situation in South Sudan
        as of December 2013, and the implications on DDR in South Sudan. As of the start of the pilot programme in April
        2013, South Sudan DDR was a programme with beneficiaries coming from the military and the NOF. The need for
     this programme was outlined clearly in DDR policy to professionalize, right-size, and streamline the NOF. This would
     both 1) reduce the potential for idle or underutilized members reigniting conflict by assisting them in establishing
     sustainable alterative livelihoods, and 2) reduce the weight of these salaries on the national fiscus which could in turn
     be used for developmental priorities as outlined in the South Sudan National Development Plan.

     The current events in South Sudan underscore the importance of DDR to the country and its connection to the nation’s
     overall development. At the same time, the conflict also changes the dynamics of DDR in South Sudan by introducing
     additional groups to the potential pool of DDR participants.

     Looking forward, South Sudan DDR programming must now reflect:

     •	   The programmatic and operational learnings of the piloting process;
     •	   Realities of financial costs of the initial strategy design; and
     •	   Recent events in South Sudan which require that the current approach to DDR in South Sudan be assessed.

                 7	       Strategic Recommendations for
                          Future Programming


Matching the findings above with the realities of the recent events, the priority areas requiring attention for a renewed
strategy include:

•	   Increased clarity on categorization of DDR beneficiary groups and numbers of beneficiaries;
•	   Reduced cost;
•	   Increased harmonization of programming in reinsertion and reintegration;
•	   Full national government implementation; and
•	   Continued momentum

Increased clarity on categorization of DDR beneficiary groups and numbers of beneficiaries is necessary given the
recent events in South Sudan. The individuals that may now qualify for DDR programming fall into the following
categories:

•	   Current SPLA & other national organized forces
•	   Former SPLA & other national organized forces (SPLA-IO)
•	   Rebel groups (non-SPLA origin)
•	   Civilians that joined recent fighting (ie. White Army of largely youth, dinka youth who are recruited, etc)
•	   Wounded Heroes / Veterans (loyalties irrelevant)
•	   Women Associated with Armed Forces or Groups (WAAF)
•	   Children Associated with Armed Forces or Groups (CAAF)
•	   South Sudanese Combatants in Foreign Armed Groups

This represents a broad spectrum of experiences and needs and the service delivery modalities for the various groups
may differ to best respond to those needs. For example those with a long military history that are being demobilized
from the SPLA will be in need of an SSR approach while children would be in need of a separate special programme
and the mobilized civilian youth may benefit most from a community based approach. In light of the new actors it
would behoove the people of South Sudan to structure the South Sudan DDR programme to provide appropriate DDR
programming for the varying groups. What had been a programme limited to only former members of SPLA and na-
tional organized forces must now look at attending to a greater variety of groups.

Additionally, recent events will require a reassessment of the numbers of beneficiaries to undergo the DDR process.
Initial estimates for the National DDR Programme suggested the need to process 150,000 ex-combatants. As the
Government of South Sudan has improved internal systems to give more accurate numbers, updated estimates from
late 2013 suggested a significant decrease of the overall initial caseload. Following the events of December 2013 the
numbers will need to be updated.

This situation may require the implementation of DDR at a faster pace or in greater numbers than formerly anticipated
and thus now is the appropriate time to use the knowledge learned to date to assess the reintegration approach through
a highly realistic lens.

The need to reduce costs from the initial design is a second area for attention. While costs of the pilot would be



                                                                                  Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                                               Pilot Reintegration Project - TDRP Key Learning Report   33
     expected to reduce with scale, one of the main findings of the pilot was that the approach as implemented was cost
     prohibitive and required further tailoring to be realistic. The programme will achieve the scale and impact desired by
     the Republic of South Sudan only by addressing the financial realities and therein encourages stability and reallocates
     resources as needed.

     The need to more effectively align the reinsertion and reintegration work of the DDR programme is a third area of
     focus which correlates closely with cost. Looking more holistically at the programme allows the government to find
     additional efficiencies in the programme while also providing a stronger programme to beneficiaries.

     The continued development and establishment of full national government implementation of the DDR programme
     is the fourth priority area to be addressed. The initial DDR policy and strategy documents call for national ownership
     which can have programmatic benefits including full national ownership and contextual understanding in programme
     planning, service continuity, and cost efficiencies.

     Finally, it is clear that momentum and motivation are key factors in success. At this time, there is a positive mo-
     mentum on this programme which is an even greater testament to NDDRC and the implementing partners given the
     tense environment they are facing. It is recommended that a transitional pilot project be implemented to harness the
     current momentum and immediately incorporate the lessons learned in this pilot. The Transitional Pilot would segue
     in a paced manner up to the full scale programme.

     In summary, the current events in South Sudan underscore the importance to the country of DDR and its connection to
     the nation’s overall development. As such, it is critical that the country continue and invigorate its work in developing
     a nationally-led well-designed and well-implemented DDR programme. The learnings from this pilot as well as the
     tools developed are relevant and timely as these can significantly contribute to the development of an effective and
     realistic full National DDR Programme.

     I Executive Summary
     Project Background
     1.       The Republic of South Sudan (RoSS) DDR Pilot Reintegration Project (Phases 1 and 2)
     was implemented between April 20131 and August 2014. On December 19th 2013 the Project was
     suspended in response to the deteriorated security environment in RoSS. Livelihood Project
     activities restarted on 15th May 2014 (with works on the Community Support Projects already
     having recommenced during late February 2014). A follow-up learning session to this evaluation
     is planned for November 2014 in Juba, South Sudan.

     2.      The Project was implemented in a complex context including the local political economy,
     the programme history (which was dominated by the legacy of the preceding CPA DDR process),
     a very unstable security situation, the wider policy environment of the national DDR strategy and
     supporting national DDR Council decrees and NDDRC strategic plan, and the immediate
     implementation environment where the DDR Pilot Reintegration Project need to align with the
     wider NDDR Pilot Programme hosted at Mapel Transition Facility.

     3.       Due to the ongoing conflict between the SPLA and opposition forces, increased rebel
     militia activity as well as inter-communal clashes in various regions of South Sudan the Project
     was implemented in a very unstable security context (though the Greater Bahr el Ghazal States
     were less conflict affected than others). The Project environment deteriorated drastically during
     Phase 2 with the country facing massive IDP and refugee movements, closure or destruction of
     essential basic services such as medical facilities and schools, increased mobilization of civilians,
     a shift from development assistance towards emergency relief and disruption of agricultural
     activities due to the fighting which has led to a major food crisis with at least one third of the
     population in need of urgent food aid.

     4.       The original Development Objectives of the Project are as follows: (i) socio-economic
     pilot objectives, and (ii) reintegration programme, systems and learning objectives.

     5.         The socio-economic objectives of the pilot are:

               (a) To provide ex-combatants with skills enabling and enhancing their livelihood
                   opportunities in communities of return;

               (b) To facilitate the social reintegration of ex-combatants.

     6.         The reintegration programme, systems and learning objectives are as follows:

               (a) Develop lessons learned that can be applied to future South Sudan DDR
                   programming;

               (b) Develop and instil a system of DDR Reintegration Management in South Sudan that
                   can live beyond the life of the pilot project.




     1
         IPs were hired in June 2013 and ICRS activities on registration and the baseline started in April 2013.

7.      The first tranche of the pilot DDR programme was anticipated to include 500 individuals
from the SPLA and other national organised forces. However, the final caseload of DDR
participants selected by GoSS to go through the DDR process included only 292 individuals from
SPLA’s Wounded Heroes, which is currently a designation not necessarily based on injury, but
rather on assignment to the DDR programme. Out of this group 290 ex-combatants graduated
from the vocational, life skills & literacy/numeracy training in Mapel Transition Facility (TF) (the
wider NDDR Pilot Programme with which the Project aligned) and received reintegration support
through the Project. Besides the ex-combatants the main Project beneficiaries were community
members in the communities of return where training was delivered in cooperative working and
community members in sites where seventeen (originally planned as ten2) DDR Community
Support Projects (borehole installations & rehabilitation and one Payam building rehabilitation)
were implemented. According to estimates by the IA (IOM) the Community Support Projects
benefited approximately 7,500 people. As five ex-combatants died during the reintegration period
the caseload at Project closure is 285 individual ex-combatants.

8.      The Project was implemented over two phases between June 2013 and September 2014.
Phase 1 of the Project had four official components: (i) Livelihood Support which had two sub-
components (Start-Up Kits, and Training); (ii) Institutional Capacity Building, (iii) M&E, and
(iv) DDR Community Support Projects. Phase 2 of the Project had three sub-components: It
continued and innovated the Livelihood Support subcomponent, it implemented and further
developed the M&E component including through South-South exchange and it implemented the
DDR Community Support Projects. In both Phase 1 and Phase 2 while not identified as such the
Project also had a fourth component: Project Management and NDDRC Support (US$ 120,000 in
Phase 1 and US$ 120,000 in Phase 2) which finances the reintegration participation costs to the
NDDRC3 and included the Technical Assistance (TA) provided by the TDRP (World Bank) to
the NDDRC which was not a direct cost to the Project. All administrative costs were absorbed by
the TDRP.

9.      The final evaluation of the Project was conducted in August and September 2014. The
evaluation included a comprehensive review of Project documentation, datasets and IA outputs,
consultations with 75 individuals, and a field mission to Juba and Wau in Western Bahr el Ghazal
State (WBGS) where qualitative key informant interviews and qualitative focus group discussions
with community members and ex-combatants were conducted. The first community consultation
in Nykiejo, Achot Boma, Rochdog Payam, Jur River Country, WBEG consulted 14 men and 12
women as well as separate key informant interviews (KIIs) with the village leader. The second
community consultation in Nyinalel, Kuom Boma, Marial Bal Payam, Jur River Country, WBEG
consulted 13 men and 1 woman including the village leader.

Summary of Findings
10.       The final evaluation finds that the following outcomes (outcomes can be understood as
short to medium term changes resulting from Project activities and outputs) have resulted from
the Project. These fall into three broad categories: (i) knowledge transfer and behaviour change
(institutionally and in project design, management and implementation of DDR programming
activities); (ii) short to medium term changes in the lives of main Project beneficiaries (ex-

     combatants and their communities); (iii) any shift in Project conceptualisation and planning based
     for any future DDR programming in South Sudan.

     11.      In the Livelihoods Component the main outcomes are as follows: (i) learning regarding
     how an IA can effectively operate in the complex environment of South Sudan in all aspects of
     programme design and procurement, transportation and distribution of start-up kits; (ii) learning
     regarding how the IA can better manage knowledge transfer and acquisition and quality control
     reporting from the field; (iii) inclusion of other national stakeholders on State level in the
     implementation of the livelihoods sub-component (iv); an increased collaboration with local
     service providers in delivering livelihoods assistance to ex-combatants; (v) continuous utilisation
     of toolkits for livelihood activities by a majority of ex-combatants; (vi) increased vocational and
     entrepreneurial knowledge of the Project participants (that is used by many ex-combatants to
     initiate livelihood opportunities), and (vii) increased engagement of ex-combatants and
     community members in group livelihood activities (associations/cooperatives).

     12.      The results of the Participant Satisfaction Survey4 carried out in July/August 2014 show
     that there have been observable gains made in livelihoods for some ex-combatants through
     activities in the livelihoods sub-component. The majority of respondents (61.4 percent) are
     frequently or sometimes using their tool kits, with the agriculture and carpentry group making
     most frequent use of the tools in direct comparison to other vocational tracks. Regarding the
     vocational skills training the XCs received in Mapel most respondents report that the training
     taught them something new and that they have utilised the training skills in their daily lives (an
     exception are those XCs though that received an auto mechanic training). Almost three quarters
     of the interviewed ex-combatants report to currently work in the same vocation they were taught
     in Mapel (particularly those respondents that attended carpentry and agriculture classes).

     13.     The comparison of the livelihood activities of XCs before and after the DDR programme
     shows an increased engagement in cooperative work (while only a minority of the programme
     participants indicated to have worked in a cooperative before joining the DDR Pilot, 18.0 percent
     of the satisfaction survey respondents report to participate in a cooperative after DDR). This
     increase in group livelihood activity most likely results from the trainings around cooperative
     business.

     14.      However, despite these positive trends these findings should not be overestimated. As the
     satisfaction survey data does not give clear indication about the success and shape of the newly
     established cooperatives and associations, the final evaluation cannot make any judgment about
     their effectiveness and sustainability. Other indicators also convey a rather mixed picture of the
     socio-economic situation of pilot programme beneficiaries at the end of the DDR pilot; for
     example, more than 37.9 percent report that they usually have to borrow in order to meet their
     household expenses at the end of the month. On the other hand 42.6 percent indicate that their
     income has increased because of the vocational trainings, 37.3 percent see no change in income
     while 20.1 percent of the interviewees even notice a decrease in earning. Due to these mixed
     results and the extremely short-time lag between the implementation of reintegration assistance
     and the final evaluation, definitive and detailed comments on the sustainability of the livelihood
     activities cannot be made.



     4
      In July/August 2014, in order to gain knowledge of the ex-combatants livelihood situation TDRP
     conducted a ex-combatant satisfaction survey of the those who were enrolled in the Pilot programme.




42
15.      By design the Institutional Capacity Building Component resulted in more numerous
knowledge outcomes and altered institutional behaviour. The main outcomes include: (i)
increased awareness in management and key staff of the reality of leading Reintegration
programming in DDR; (ii) a greater understanding of the need to action learning from the CPA
and from this first Pilot; (iii) a positive shift in confidence in the NDDRC regarding the capacity
for project implementation; and (iv) important breakthroughs in the States particularly in working
with line ministries in order to support the IGAs of ex-combatants.

16.      The evaluation reviewed the conclusion of the MTR that at the time of the MTR it was
unclear how outcomes achieved by the close of Phase 1 would fit together to have a longer-term
outcome on either the NDDRC (institutionally or systems) or on Project design and
implementation. The MTR found that that staff churn, imbalance in the organisational structure,
lack of institutional support from the GoSS and apparent reliance on external TA were all factors
negatively influencing the sustainability of Project outcomes. The final evaluation finds that these
factors persist and are compounded by the hiatus on DDR programming resulting from the
deteriorated security situation and by the removal of DDR from the mandate of UN Mission in
South Sudan (UNMISS). The final evaluation makes specific recommendations regarding these
issues.

17.     The Community Component has mixed outcomes. While significant learning took place
regarding how an IA can effectively implement DDR Community Support Projects in areas with
a concentration of ex-combatants and the water interventions have improved access to clean
water for target communities, the effectiveness of the Community Projects with regard to (i)
promoting peace building in the four States where ex-combatants will reintegrate and (ii)
promoting community engagement and ownership and reducing tensions between communities
and XCs, remains ambiguous.

18.       The Project’s objectives and design are relevant to: (i) RoSS DDR strategies and plan;
(ii) national ownership as a pillar of DDR; (iii) the learning principles of pilot programming, (iv)
German donor strategy; and (v) the WB MDTF-SS5 and current Interim Strategy Note (2013-
2014).

19.     The Project aligned with the RoSS National DDR strategies and papers particularly the
Republic of South Sudan Policy Paper on Demobilization, Disarmament and Reintegration
(23rdSeptember, 2011) and the South Sudan National DDR Strategic Plan 2012-2020 (11th March,
2012).

20.     Apparent weaknesses in Phase 1 of the Project whereby line ministries were not involved
in implementation were addressed in Phase 2.

21.     The design of the Pilot particularly supports engendering national ownership in DDR,
both by facilitating the NDDRC to assume the decision-making and management role for South
Sudan DDR and by focusing on building the capacity of the NDDRC.

22.     The Project is closely related to and benefited from the MDTF-SS that during its
operation phase 2006 to 2012 supported nationwide the CPA implementation with 21 projects.

    The MDTF-SS was operationally closed on December 31, 2012, and financially closed at the end of June 2013.




                                                                                                   Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                    Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    43
     MDTF-SS had five Strategic Priorities of which two were crosscutting: (i) build the capacity of
     the GoSS and (ii) coordinate and align international assistance.

     23.     The Project efficiency in progress made towards achieving its PDO is upgraded from
     moderately satisfactory (MTR) to satisfactory because: (i) disbursement has been prompt; (ii)
     extra unplanned outputs under the Community Supports component enabled by cost savings by
     IOM, and (iii) the continued high unit cost per ex-combatant.

     24.     In Phase 1 the Project did not compare favourably with other DDR processes when the
     cost per ex-combatant is looked into. In phase 1 the cost per ex-combatant of all livelihood
     support was US$2,759. 6 In Phase 2 of the 290 ex-combatants in the NDDRC Pilot DDR
     programme 285 were targeted with Project activities (5 had died over the course of the Project).
     Of the 285 targeted, 269 received services. Basing the overall Project cost on the 290 ex-
     combatant intake as set against the costs of the Livelihoods Support component then the full
     Phase 1 and Phase 2 cost per ex-combatant remain high at US$ 3,750.

     25.     Effectiveness is the extent to which the Project achieved its planned-for outputs. The
     Project has been effective in achieving project outputs as outlined in the Project documentation.

     26.      The Livelihoods Support component (Phases 1 and 2) successfully distributed start-up
     kits to the majority of ex-combatants well within the target time of two months. In Phase 1 the
     Project also delivered a package of trainings designed to suit the literacy and numeracy skills of
     ex-combatants and capitalize on the potential outcomes of their vocational training. In Phase 2 the
     Project delivered the planned-for package of additional and supplementary trainings and
     livelihood technical supports successfully reaching 269 of 285 ex-combatants targeted in Phase 2.

     27.      The Institutional Capacity Building component (Phase 1) has been effective and
     produced the planned outputs as well as less tangible (but not less important) outcomes on
     institutional knowledge, understanding and behaviour. In Phase 2 the IA from the Livelihood
     Support component implemented the remaining activities (M&E through South-South exchange
     and logistical support around the ex-combatant Satisfaction Survey). These activities produced
     their planned-for outputs.

     28.     The Community Support component was effective and exceeded the planned-for outputs.
     Originally there were 10 planned and the IA installed 16 and rehabilitated one Payam building.
     The additional outputs were secured as originally the IA budgeted for a more sustainable solar
     water pump however communities opted for manual water pumps.7

     29.      The Pilot Reintegration Project was meant to be a test-run of the programme design’s
     effectiveness in order to learn lessons and modify it prior to replication country-wide. While
     social activities were tested, they have been minimized in the current tranche in favour of finding
     the correct economic reintegration models that can be replicated. Against this background the
     Project has listed the following components to be replicated and scaled in future programming:




     6 Costs discussed in this section are direct costs (including IP management and staffing costs) and do not include WB
     or NDDRC related management or administration costs.
     7
      The cost of borehole and solar pump averages US$ 25,000 when compared to US$ 11,000 average for
     manual boreholes and pumps.




44
       (a) An independently functional management team as well as a management and
           reporting system at HQ and inter-organizationally with the State level;
       (b) A functional ICRS system with trained staff;
       (c) A functional M&E system with trained staff;
       (d) Livelihood support services including individual and group livelihood activities;
       (e) Community support projects (but with provisios about design, size and whether or not
           they should be managed through the NDDRC or DDR).

30.      The final evaluation made the following specific findings and recommendations (that are
related to (i) achievement of objectives; (ii) the context of the Project and the wider strategic
environment and (iii) the Project design and outcomes of each Component.

Project Context and Strategic Environment
31.      The evaluation finds that the Project has satisfactorily provided ex-combatants with
skills thus enhancing their livelihood opportunities in communities of return (first socio-economic
objective). Whether it has facilitated social reintegration is not clear (second socio-economic
objective).

32.     The evaluation finds that the Project has performed highly satisfactorily generating
lessons learned that can be applied to future South Sudan DDR programming (first reintegration
programme, systems and learning objective). It has performed moderately satisfactorily to
develop and instil a system of DDR Reintegration Management in South Sudan that can live
beyond the life of the project (second reintegration programme, systems and learning objective).

Project Context and Strategic Environment
33.     Conclusion 1. The success of the Project as a pilot, testing the systems and institutional
arrangements which are required to implement Reintegration programming, is overshadowed by
the wider political, security and donor environment.

34.      High-level macro-level issues such as the current security situation in the country and the
ongoing talks aimed at resolving the conflict and finding a path to stabilise the situation throw
into doubt the future of DDR and SSR in South Sudan. Through the CPA DDR and through the
NDDRC Pilot DDR programme (with which the Project has been aligned) there has been a
substantial resource allocation to DDR, however, on the macro-level the outcomes of such
activity and resource allocation are unclear.

35.     Until there is clear buy-in from all relevant stakeholders into both DDR and SSR the
NDDRC and other stakeholders are critically hamstrung with progressing the objectives of DDR
programming (understood as either the beneficiary-focused outcomes of the Project or the macro
objectives of a full DDR programme).

36.     From the perspective of the Project objectives, the MTR noted that the ability to keep up
the momentum of the gains made during the Project, particularly in institutional performance and
capacity building was critical. It observed that the suspension of the Project would likely result in
a dissipation of capacity built and a loss of momentum. It is clear from the evaluation that this
conclusion from the MTR has been realised and momentum is being lost; however, in the wider
scenario it is critical that the NDDRC, its partners and the donor community engage around the
importance of DDR and SSR and strategize effectively around future DDR programming in
South Sudan.




                                                                                        Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                         Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    45
     37.     It should be noted that the MTR concluded it is critical that any future DDR
     programming is linked on a strategic level to wider SSR so that project achievements are not lost
     due to lack of progress elsewhere in the broader strategic environment, and so that the DDR
     programme can align and have currency with SSR. This conclusion is supported by the final
     evaluation.

     38.     Timing will be essential for any future DDR programming. The past shows that the CPA
     DDR programme was significantly delayed due to several factors, amongst them limited buy-in
     of the military and political leadership, and, crucially, a lack of internal consensus on, what DDR
     in South Sudan ideally should look like. DDR was perceived more as a risk to security than a
     factor contributing to stability. Partly, this limited support of SSR processes and the very
     cumbersome reform of the security sector have played a part in creating the current situation in
     South Sudan. If it does not seriously attend to DDR-related issues early enough in the peace talks
     in Addis Ababa, the GoSS risks replicating the mistakes of the CPA DDR programme.

     39.      Recommendation 1a. The NDDRC and relevant key stakeholders work with the donor
     community to engage the GoSS and the parties to the Addis negotiations, when possible, around
     the importance of DDR and SSR to future stabilization programming in South Sudan. The
     NDDRC has and is engaging government however the onus to engage must be shared by the
     international donor community and based on a coherent, realisable vision of DDR and SSR.
     Donors must engage the GoSS to engender clear, evidenced support of DDR and SSR in order for
     any future programming to succeed.

     40.     Recommendation 1b. The NDDRC be supported in the current modality to lead with the
     convening of ‘inclusive enough coalitions’ of key stakeholders (which could include stakeholders
     such as the leadership of the SPLA and other organised forces as well as forces in opposition, the
     UN and other partner institutions experiences with DDR/SSR processes in South Sudan,
     representatives of civil society), to participate in the range of steps necessary to create a
     comprehensive and coherent DDR architecture in South Sudan and to advocate with GoSS for
     such architecture to be enabled.

     41.     DDR architectures are informed by bringing diverse aspects of stabilisation (including
     SSR) and development programmes and principles together into a common understanding and
     approach. Furthermore DDR architectures are processes: they change over time depending on the
     stage of design and implementation. Critically, in order to put design into practice DDR
     architectures must be suited to the fluid but specific circumstances of national and local
     conditions.

     42.      Despite the progress being made through the Project, DDR still appears to exist in an
     isolated area of programming and this isolation must be bridged. The first step is alignment with
     agreed SSR programming and the second is to align DDR though dialogue with other
     development programming particularly around community driven development, institution
     building or infrastructure projects. In the long term the DDR programme has to ensure that there
     is a national forum in place, like for instance, the National DDR Council, to continue strategizing
     on DDR programming on highest political level. The DDR Council, if it is to be replicated in
     future, has to be more functional than in the past and provide the necessary political and strategic
     guidance that is needed to align DDR with other development programmes. GoSS should also
     consider having members of the international community at the Council for advice and
     transparency.




46
43.     Recommendation 1c. In the short to medium term specifically, the NDDRC must draw
together an inclusive-enough coalition of thought partners to conceptualise the DDR process
including reintegration. This coalition must reach out to all parties to the Addis negotiations and
acknowledge that the current situation in South Sudan requires fundamental changes in DDR and
SSR programming. It should be supported by an adequate technical secretariat which has
outstanding experience with DDR and SSR processes and should be flexible enough to evolve
when and if DDR shifts from strategy and design to actual programming with clear, measurable
outcomes. !

44.     Recommendation 1d. In the interim and during negotiations the NDDRC should not be
allowed to stagnate: the donor community and technical partners should work to address the
issues highlighted through the Project (particularly dissipation of institutional capacity and the
imbalance in organisational structure) thus ensuring readiness for future programme
implementation. The NDDRC and its partners should take a highly strategic approach to the
development of a comprehensive DDR strategy, fully conscious of Do No Harm approaches and
with realisable programmatic dynamics.

45.    Conclusion 2. The wider donor environment and the UN mandate do not appear
conducive to DDR and SSR.

46.     Recommendation 2. While there has been parallel work on SSR the current donor focus
and that of the UN is largely on the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan. It is critical that the
NDDRC and its partners work to sensitise the donor community regarding the importance of
DDR – SSR in future development in South Sudan and the significance of integrating these
themes into the peace talks in Addis Ababa. A prerequisite for this kind of sensitisation is strong
government and military buy-in into the DDR programme at the highest levels of leadership.8

47.      Conclusion 3. UNESCO has completed an impact assessment of its activities in Mapel
TF in October 2013 9 but due to the outbreak of the crisis in December 2013 and the
reprioritisation of the UNMISS mandate the final and overall evaluation of the Mapel TF pilot
was cancelled.

48.     Recommendation 3.The overall evaluation is important and so some formal and
independent review should be conducted in order to capture lessons learned10 which will inform
reorientation of potential future DDR phases.

49.     Conclusion 4. The MTR recommended that future programming should be designed in
such a way so that the GoSS should be required to commit to increased financing of the NDDRC
and the NDDRC to commit to appropriately resourcing itself in material and in human resources.

50.     Recommendation 4. The final evaluation reinforces the recommendation of the MTR
and restates that GoSS commitment to DDR must be underscored by material support of the

  The lack of buy-in of the SPLA, other organised forces and the government into the DDR programme has
been frequently criticised by donors in the past.

     NDDRC and openness to institutional reform of the organisation in line with the findings of the
     Project.

     Project Design and Outcomes
     51.     Conclusion 5. The Project is a pilot and as such learning from the pilot is relevant to
     stakeholders and partners outside the NDDRC and to the staff of the Commission.

     52.      Recommendation 5. The NDDRC should disseminate a summary document of the final
     evaluation to relevant stakeholders and partners and critically, to NDDRC staff. NDDRC staff
     should also be provided with other materials that have been developed throughout the Pilot
     Project.

     53.    Conclusion 6. Reinsertion and reintegration were largely treated as two distinct
     programme components in the alignment between the Project and the wider pilot in Mapel TF.

     54.    Recommendation 6. In reality reinsertion and reintegration are intertwined. They should
     hence be dealt with in a more comprehensive manner in future programme iterations.

     55.     Conclusion 7. The MTR concluded that in Phase 1 regarding M&E of the Project, many
     of the Project objectives are over ambitious and/or vague. This remained the case in Phase 2 so at
     the time of the final evaluation this conclusion remains valid.

     56.      Recommendation 7. The MTR recommended that in future programming the M&E
     Framework utilised by the Bank should be revised based on the learning from implementing the
     Project. Particularly, the ambition of indicators should be aligned with more realistic expectations
     of activities under the various Project Components and all ambiguous language should be avoided.
     This was not actioned in Phase 2 and so should be actioned in future programming.

     57.     Conclusion 8. The MTR concluded that regarding M&E of the Project the M&E
     Framework does not contain indicators specific to the nature of the Pilot as a learning process
     orientated towards trialling, documenting, learning and innovation. This remained the case
     through Phase 2 and so at the time of the final evaluation this conclusion remains valid.

     58.      Recommendation 8. The MTR recommended that in future pilot programming this must
     be addressed so as to properly monitor the performance of the Project and its stakeholders and in
     order to maximize any gains from Project learning. At the time of final evaluation this remains a
     valid recommendation.

     59.      Conclusion 9. The MTR concluded that the Project design has aligned with all relevant
     safeguards including: (i) the Conflict Sensitivity Principle of the South Sudan National DDR
     programme; (ii) principles of Do No Harm, and (iii) World Bank approach to Conflict and
     Fragility as contained in the WDR 2011. This remained the case through Phase 2. At the time of
     final evaluation this remains a valid conclusion.

     60.      Recommendation 9. The MTR recommended that this good practice should be
     replicated in all future programming and this recommendation remains valid. Furthermore it
     should inform centrally any future DDR programme strategising by the NDDRC particularly as it
     considers the heterogeneity of the ex-combatant population that will likely need to be considered
     for DDR in the future.




48
61.      Conclusion 10. The Project has been efficient however, efficiency is compromised by the
cost per beneficiary which exceeds that in other national DDR programmes.

62.     Recommendation 10. When estimating the impact on future programming, economies of
scale should considered and where possible the cost per beneficiary reduced. Efficiency should be
a core principle brought to bear when assessing the wider DDR architecture and modalities
including the use of transition facilities

63.     Conclusion 11. By design and during implementation the Project sought to engage the
wider stakeholders in DDR in South Sudan including those in the UN family.

64.     Recommendation 11. In future programming this approach should be built upon with
particular emphasis on engaging Line Ministries (particularly as they pertain to assisting in
community-based reintegration or support of Income Generating Activities (IGAs)/economic
cooperatives), and assisting the NDDRC and UN family to greater share expertise and resources
particularly those within the DDR unit in UNMISS. The UN should be included in any ‘inclusive
enough coalition’ strategizing about the future of DDR in South Sudan and inputting into future
programme design.

65.     Conclusion 12. The Project did not address Public Information, Procurement, Gender or
Disability management capacity at the NDDRC.

66.    Recommendation 12. In any future programming these functions must be
comprehensively audited and addressed.

67.      Conclusion 13. The MTR noted that the Project and the NDDRC itself was constrained
by a lack of human resources. This continued for Phase 2 and was exacerbated by staff churn/loss
of staff. The evaluation concludes that until this human resource factor and the drivers of staff
churn are addressed they will restrict the ability of the NDDRC to function and to capitalize on
the outcomes of the Project or any future Project.

68.     Recommendation 13. The NDDRC should address the organisational weaknesses
highlighted in Phase 1 by ASI and should engage GoSS when possible around the punctual
payment of staff salaries. It should not exacerbate organisational imbalance if employing PMUs
or SPMUs in the future. When addressing stability and skills in the organisation the NDDRC
should pay particular attention to the situation with the M&E department throughout the Project
which because of a lack of staff seriously undermined any outcome from any M&E capacity
building activities (Phase 1 or Phase 2).

69.      Conclusion 14. The MTR concluded that in Component 1: Livelihood Supports Sub-
Component 1 (Start-up Kits) the Project largely delivered its required outputs by providing high
quality start-up kits to nearly all ex-combatants in Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Western Bahr el
Ghazal, Warrap and Lakes (with some remaining in Lakes State NDDRC offices). It did so in a
timely fashion and the performance far exceeded that recorded in the CPA DDR. At the time of
the final evaluation this conclusion remains valid.

70.      Recommendation 14. In future programming the modalities utilized by the IA and the
market intelligence in their reporting as well as the suggested improvements through lessons
learned should be fully utilized by the NDDRC when designing and managing the procurement of
start-up kits. At the time of the final evaluation this recommendation remains valid.




                                                                                      Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                       Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    49
     71.     Conclusion 15. The MTR found that the participative methodology of the IA delivering
     Component 2 in Phase 1 suited the culture of the NDDRC. At the time of final evaluation this
     conclusion remains valid.

     72.      Recommendation 15. The MTR recommended that any future programming or Phase 2
     activities delivering capacity building should utilise a similar approach of embedded mentoring
     rather than formal training. Furthermore this methodology should be correctly timed and matched
     with sufficient resources (including human resources, that is, staff) by the NDDRC so as to
     maximize outcomes from such programme. At the time of final evaluation this recommendation
     remains valid.

     73.      Conclusion 16. As a result of the flexible design of Phase 2 as well as the infrequent
     meeting schedule of the DDR Council which was meant to link the NDDRC and the line
     Ministries around DDR, the commission’s cooperation with the Ministries, particularly on State
     level, has not been adequately formalised.

     74.     Recommendation 16. In order to avoid reputational risks for NDDRC it will be essential
     in future DDR programming to further formalise implementation arrangements with the State
     Line Ministries (especially around the formation of cooperatives and distribution of land to ex-
     combatants).

     75.     Conclusion 17.The training of trainers (TOT) that were provided to agricultural
     extension workers and ICRS staff (on entrepreneurship and financial literacy) have increased the
     pool of domestic trainers that is available to train ex-combatants. The focus on the ICRS
     caseworkers, however, further aggravates the institutional imbalance within NDDRC.

     76.     Recommendation 17. Future TOTs should be sensitive to the institutional imbalance
     within and should base the selection of trainers on a thorough skills assessment.

     77.      Conclusion 18. A great number of ex-combatants is still utilising their toolkits. A point
     of critique was that the toolkits in parts did not match to the tools used during the trainings in
     Mapel.

     78.      Recommendation 18. In future iterations of the DDR Programme the procuring agency
     for the toolkits should consult with the trainers delivering the vocational trainings concerning the
     content of the toolkits prior to the start of the trainings. Ex-combatant representatives should be
     involved in identifying the content of toolkits. The same toolkits that will be provided to ex-
     combatants should also be utilised in the vocational trainings.

     79.     Conclusion 19. A majority of ex-combatants is seemingly still working in the same
     vocation they were taught in Mapel (especially those in agriculture) but success rates greatly vary
     from vocation to vocation.

     Recommendation 19. In future programming vocational trainings have to be more closely linked
     to the market realities in South Sudan.

     Conclusion 20. A number of lessons from the CPA DDR programme were not learned (or
     applied in the wider pilot Project) thus influencing sustainability and impact of some Project
     activities.




50
Recommendation 20. Future programming needs to base its approaches and modalities on the
lessons learned that have been collected in the frame of the Project and the CPA DDR
Programme.

Conclusion 21. Given the increased involvement of ex-combatants in cooperative work, the
business, financial literacy and cooperative trainings appear to have been effective in promoting
group livelihood activities and imparting knowledge on the formation of cooperatives and
associations. Despite these positive trends the concept of cooperative/associations seems to be
ambiguous and requires clarification (e.g. in some instances groups that were registered as
cooperatives and received benefits did not match the official definition of a cooperative)

80.     Recommendation 21. For future DDR programming clearer guidelines on cooperative
work must be in place, agreed upon and implemented by all national stakeholders involved in
order to ensure an equal distribution of benefits. While less formalised groups should continue to
be encouraged, the programme has to clearly spell out the criteria groups need to fulfil in order to
receive certain cooperative benefits. Against this background the NDDRC should engage the line
ministries around what constitutes an association vs. cooperative, and initiate discussions around
which groups can be registered as cooperatives (and whether line ministries accept lower
numbers for certain vocations) and who is eligible for extra materials or assets from the GoSS via
the NDDRC.

81.     Conclusion 22. Although the community projects have brought a positive change for the
target communities, the potential impact of this sub-component was overestimated in all project
documentation and M&E frameworks. It appears that the communities concerned are only to
some degree able to draw a connection between the implemented community project and the
assimilation of returning ex-combatants and the work of NDDRC.

82.     Recommendation 22. In future programming involving community-based reintegration
serious consideration should be given to increasing the resources available for community support
projects in order to achieve relevant impacts with regard to peace building and bringing a peace
dividend However, given the fact that the costs per ex-combatant are already quite high future
programme iterations should consider to focus reintegration assistance on individual support
measures (that also benefit the community) while closely aligning the project to other CDD or
CBR-type projects separate from DDR which could have equivalent impacts to that originally
envisioned for the community support sub-component.

Conclusion 23. The Project’s aspiration to strengthen community empowerment and self-reliance
was compromised by design because of the restricted number of Project types.

Recommendation 23. Should the community Support Component be replicated in future, the
Programme should consider increasing the number of Project types the community can choose
from to enhance ownership. The selection process, however, needs to be closely guided and
monitored to ensure democratic and inclusive decision making processes in the community.
However, recommendation 22 should have priority over this recommendation.

     1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
     1.1Project Context
     83.      The DDR Pilot Reintegration Project 11 has a complex context consisting of: (i) the
     external political economy and country context; (ii) the programme context, principally the
     preceding national DDR process implemented by UN Agencies on behalf of the NDDRC 12; (iii)
     the policy context (South Sudan National DDR Strategy 2012 - 2020); (iv) the implementation
     environment where the DDR Pilot Reintegration Project must relate to the wider NDDR Pilot
     Programme housed at Mapel Transition Facility; (v) since 27 th May 2014 a revised UN mandate
     removing DDR from the purview of the agency 13; (vi) limited operational budget in the NDDRC,
     and (vi) the highly unstable security environment in the Republic of South Sudan (RoSS).

     84.     RoSS became an independent country on the 9th July, 2011 on foot of a peaceful
     referendum earlier that year held between the 9th and 15th January. The referendum followed the
     2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the Government of National Unity
     (GoNU) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM).

     85.      During December 2013 RoSS succumbed to a serious deterioration in the security and
     political situation in the country. Over the weekend of 15th December fighting broke out between
     elements of the SPLA barracked in Juba. The conflict rapidly escalated, spreading throughout the
     capital Juba, to Jonglei and several other States in South Sudan resulting in unconfirmed civilian
     and military casualties.

     86.      Peace negotiations led by the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD)
     started in January 2014 in Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa but have been adjourned numerous
     times with no significant progress made up to date. They re-started on September 15th, 2014. A
     succession of cessation of hostilities agreements signed by GoSS and SPLA in Opposition
     (SPLA-IO) have been repeatedly violated or ignored on the ground in some parts of South Sudan.

     87.     According to the UNHCR assessment of the situation in South Sudan as of August 2014,
     the continuous breach of ceasefire agreements and the unstable security situation has severely
     affected the humanitarian situation in the country creating anything between 500,000 and 1.3
     million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and more 447,000 refugees.
             !
     88.     RoSS is a new country without a history of formal institutions and public administrations
     and so it is building national institutions, administrative bodies and practices for the first time.
     The institutions of the State that began to emerge in the previous years include those to guide the
     economic development of the country and to provide services to the general population.
     However, this process of creating effective and legitimate state structures and practices has been
     severely impaired by the current conflict. Since most of the country’s public funds continue to be
     channelled towards the military and the country has been in a state of emergency for more than
     ten months, most government institutions face severe difficulties in fulfilling their core functions.

89.     Additionally, most donors have reviewed their development support in response to the
ongoing crisis shifting funds towards the mitigation of humanitarian consequences of the conflict
while suspending or redesigning a number of long term development programmes "#$

90.     South Sudan’s economy is relatively undeveloped, largely undiversified and highly oil
dependent. The greatest part of the population depends on subsistence agriculture for survival.
RoSS has been hampered by austerity as a result of temporary oil flow stoppages, high inflation
following independence, currency depreciation and high reliance on imported food and
commodities as well as the economic consequences of the current conflict.

91.     Despite slight achievements in the past years South Sudan’s development indicators are
very poor. The country has very low literacy, particularly outside urban areas, high infant and
maternal mortality rates and low life expectancy.15 Very little infrastructural development has
occurred outside of Juba and transport links including those between RoSS and neighbouring
countries, particularly those upon which RoSS is reliant for imports, for example, Uganda and
Kenya. The situation has led to a breakdown of agricultural production and resulting severe food
insecurity.

92.      Consequently, the external environment within which the Project has been implemented
is characterised by limited economic opportunities, severe development challenges, conflict
stressors and famine all of which can mitigate against the achievement of development objectives
in a DDR project.

93.      The immediate implementation environment for the Project consists of the wider NDDR
Pilot Programme.16 The NDDR Pilot Programme consists of all elements in the DDR pilot as it is
focused on the time spent in the Transition Facility at Mapel including: registration, verification,
processing, accommodating, reinsertion activities, vocational training, life skills, and
literacy/numeracy training delivered to ex-combatants. In Phase 2 the Project sought to
compensate for poor quality training in auto-mechanic and driving provided to ex-combatants in
the Mapel TF.

In Project documentation it is identified that the Project is intended to work towards the strategic
objectives of the NDDR Pilot Programme.17 It is, however, also stressed that the Project does not
address CAAF/G and WAAF/G, since these groups were intended to be addressed by separate
special programmes. While capacity building of the DDR system and NDDRC staff was stated as

individuals; Objective 2: To assist ex-combatants to reintegrate socially into communities of return; Objective 3: To
increase employability and livelihood opportunities for ex-combatants in communities of return; Objective 4: To
facilitate the release, return and reintegration of Children Associated with Armed Forces and Groups (CAAF/G) to their
families and communities of return; Objective 5: To support social and economic reintegration of Women Associated
with Armed Forces and Groups (WAAF/G) through community-based programmes; Objective 6: To strengthen the
capabilities of the NDDRC, associated Line Ministries, South Sudanese civil society and the local private sector to
effectively support service delivery to the people of South Sudan. NDDRC, [project doc]: 6.

                                                                    Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    53
     a direct objective, the Project did not aim at directly building capacity of the line ministries, civil
     society or private sector. The Project aligned (in design and implementation) with the NDDR
     Pilot Programme, particularly around the purchase and distribution of start-up kits and the
     development and delivery of the training curriculum. The Project World Bank task team (TT),
     consultants hired by the Project and IAs sought to work in varying degrees in conjunction with
     implementers of the reinsertion component of the NDDR Pilot Programme, mainly UNMISS and
     UNESCO. However, the collaboration was hampered by an insufficient flow of information
     between the involved stakeholders especially in the planning stages. The at times weak
     information exchange seemed to be a stumbling block for closely linking reinsertion and
     reintegration activities. In future programme iterations it will hence be all the more crucial to
     have the necessary coordination structures in place to coordinate between various DDR partners.

     94.     As a result of the outbreak of hostilities in RoSS in December 2013 the Security Council
     adopted resolution 2155 (2014) in March 2014 that temporarily shifted the UN mission’s main
     focus from peacebuilding activities to the protection of civilians, human rights monitoring and
     support for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. With this reprioritization DDR was removed
     from the UNMISS mandate. Most UNMISS DDR staff has consequently been transferred to other
     mission sections. At the time of the final evaluation there appears to be a renewed determination
     in the NDDRC to build relationships with the UN and lobby GoSS to press for the UN to
     reincorporate DDR in the next UNMISS mandate.

     95.      This final evaluation examines the pilot reintegration activities and does not look into the
     pilot reinsertion component that was funded by UNMISS. The final assessment of the wider pilot
     at Mapel TF pilot was planned by the UN and NDDRC to be conducted separately and in addition
     to an evaluation of the training sub-component (impact assessment) that was carried out by
     UNESCO (consultants for the final evaluation of the reinsertion phase had been identified in
     December 2013). Due to the outbreak of the crisis and the reprioritization of the UNMISS
     mandate the final evaluation of the Mapel TF pilot was put on hold. All involved stakeholders as
     crucial regard an independent evaluation for capturing lessons learned which will inform
     reorientation of potential future DDR phases.18

     96.      At the time of the final evaluation discussions were ongoing within UNMISS to at least
     maintain a small core DDR unit for planning purposes. The NDDRC appeared to be determined
     to seek technical assistance from such a group which could be part of a broader consortium of
     international stakeholders to reach out to all conflict parties and to support and monitor strategy
     processes evolving around DDR in the course of the Addis Ababa negotiations.

     97.     It should be noted that the MTR concluded that the Project had begun to positively
     influence the reconfiguration of relationships between the NDDRC and the involved UN agencies
     and that this was likely to be critical to the sustainability of the outcomes of Phase 2. The
     evaluation reaffirms this conclusion and recognises in terms of principles of cooperation the
     NDDRC has shown in Phase 2 a progressive shift in how it wishes to engage with the UN family
     in the future and this is informing their lobbying of the GoSS and UN regarding re-including
     DDR in the mandate.




     18
      Although the JOC started to collect lessons learned in an internal process, the final document produced by the JOC in
     December 2013 lacks completeness (e.g. it contains very little details about costing).




54
The Project is conceptualised first and foremost as a pilot in order to capture learning about
implementation, project design, and institutional capacity and to test the institutional systems
necessary to implement and upscale reintegration programming to a national DDR programme.
Consequently the performance of the Project can be measured against: (i) the achievements of the
Project Development Objectives; (ii) the degree to which learning is being acquired, has been or
is likely to be utilised including evidence that Project design and implementation in Phase 2 was
adjusted to account for learning in Phase 1 including as documented in the MTR; and; (iii)
emerging evidence of outcomes for targeted beneficiary populations.

1.2. Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators
98.      In the Project documentation the original Project Development Objectives are identified
as: (i) socio-economic pilot objectives, and (ii) reintegration programme, systems and learning
objectives.

99.      The socio-economic objectives of the Project are:

           (a) To provide ex-combatants with skills enabling and enhancing their livelihood
               opportunities in communities of return;
           (b) To facilitate the social reintegration of ex-combatants.

100.     The reintegration programme, systems and learning objectives are as follows:

           (a) Develop lessons learned that can be applied to future South Sudan DDR
               programming;
           (b) Develop and instil a system of DDR Reintegration Management in South Sudan
               that can live beyond the life of the pilot project.

101.     The Project does not have prescribed Key Performance Indicators at Project level.

1.3 Intended Main Beneficiaries
102.     Originally the intended direct ex-combatant beneficiaries of the Project were a pre-
selected group of 500. The NDDR Pilot Programme failed to secure the target caseload of 500 ex-
combatants or to secure the target caseload as it was originally profiled for the NDDR Pilot
Programme: the profile of the final main beneficiaries was not as specific as originally anticipated
and the number not as high as planned. At the time of final evaluation the direct beneficiaries are
as follows. The Project benefited the 290 ex-combatants who were targeted by a variety of
Reintegration supports during Phase 1. Of the 290 ex-combatants who were benefited during
Phase 1, 270 directly benefited from Reintegration supports during Phase 2. According to data
provided by the IA a total of 284 community members received the business/cooperative training
in addition to 253 ex-combatants in Phase 1 and in Phase 2, 129 community members benefited
from activities in the Livelihood Supports component. Additionally, an IA-estimated 7,500
people directly benefited from activities in Project Component: Community Support Projects.19

103.    In addition to ex-combatants and community members the Project targeted the NDDRC
staff during activities in Project Component: Institutional Capacity Building (Phase 1) and

     Demobilisation and Reintegration Commission (RDRC) during Phase 2. Also in Phase 2 16 ICRS
     Case-workers at the Commission benefited from activities in Project Component: Livelihood
     Supports through Training the Trainers (TOT) training in Business and Cooperatives and partially
     through attending two days of a seven day training module for Agricultural Extension Workers
     from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. It was intended that 11 Agricultural Extension
     Workers would directly benefit from TOT training in Agriculture and Business/Cooperatives but
     due to logistical challenges 7 received the TOT input.

     1.4 Original Project Components and Outputs
     104.    The original project components are outlined in the Project Documentation and along
     with Project outputs are discussed below.

     Project Component: Livelihood Support (US$ 1,087,482 Implemented by UNICON)20
     105.     In Phase 1 the Livelihood Support Component consisted of procurement and distribution
     of start-up kits (Subcomponent 1), the design and delivery of training to ex-combatants in Mapel
     Transition Facility and follow-up support delivered to ex-combatants and community members
     simultaneously to increase financial literacy and entrepreneurial knowledge and support the
     formation of economic cooperatives at community level. This follow-up training continued in
     Phase 2. At that stage the livelihood assistance moreover entailed agricultural extension work and
     training in improved agricultural methods, best practices and small farm business skills for the
     ex-combatants choosing agriculture. As alterations to the original project components 21 the
     Project additionally implemented targeted vocational trainings that were provided to ex-
     combatants via vocational training centres and facilitated a vocational expert visit to deliver
     support to interested ex-combatants in vocational skills not covered through the targeted
     vocational trainings or agriculture.

     106.     For overall management of the component and the start-up kits sub-component UNICON
     deployed a Project Lead, a Project Manager, a Livelihoods Training Specialist, a Start-Up Kit
     Manager, a Procurement Specialist, two Agricultural Training Specialists as well as one State
     Manager in each of the four pilot States. To deliver the training sub-component in Phase 1
     UNICON deployed 10 trainers to conduct training in Mapel TF and the 4 state managers and 8
     state trainers to conduct the training in communities of return. In Phase 2 business/cooperative
     training teams were deployed in each State to conduct follow-up visits to interested ex-
     combatants. The agricultural trainings were implemented by 7 extension workers of the State
     Ministry of Agriculture (3 in WBGS, 1 in Warrap State, 1 in Lakes State, 2 in NBGS).
     Supplementary vocational trainings were conducted in close collaboration with the Wau
     Vocational Training Centre and the Aweil driving school.

     Project Component: Livelihood Support Subcomponent 1: Start-Up Kits (US$ 323,100)
     (costs only occurred in Phase 1)
     107.    UNICON in alignment with the NDDRC provided eight start-up kits all of which were
     prepared with the engagement of The Ministry of Labour and the Ministry’s Multipurpose
     Training Centre in Juba (MTC) and FAO and with on the ground consultation with Mapel TF

        Total costs for livelihoods support component. Due to the lesser number of participants than initially expected (290 vs.
     500) it was agreed to spend less than the initial livelihood support budget (US$ 1.200.000).

UNESCO Vocational Trainers.22 UNICON followed a clear and comprehensive bid process with
an 18-day turn-around between issuing Request for Quotations (RFQ) and opening of bids on
September 30th 2013.23The NDDRC was present at the opening of bids. Contracts with successful
suppliers were signed on 1st October 2013 and goods were planned to arrive in Juba
approximately on 14th October 2013 with distribution to the State offices by the end of October
2013. To a large extent this timeline was met with only a seven-day delay period resulting from
flooding which hampered the roll out in some of the States. At the time of the final evaluation
distribution of start-up kits from State offices is as follows:24

Project Component: Livelihood Support Sub-Component 2: Training (US$ 764,38225)
108.    As outlined in the Project document Livelihood Support through Training was to be
delivered in four themes:

             (a)   Cooperatives/associations;
             (b)   Small farm or rural enterprise training;
             (c)   Individual micro-enterprise business training, and
             (d)   Adult or formal education.26

109.     Training in Mapel TF (Phase 1) (US$ 164,500): The curriculum as developed by the IA
largely home based and adjusted while on the ground in Mapel Transition Facility delivered 15
modules and split the training between the modules delivered in the Transition Facility and
further training in situ in communities of return (delivered to both ex-combatants and community
members working together in IGAs or in preparation to work as a cooperative).27

   UNICON reports that the MTCs provided a list of tools for Carpentry, Masonry, Electrician, Plumber, Car Mechanic
and Welder. FAO provided inputs for Agriculture and Animal Husbandry.

   Kits remaining to be distributed are in the possession of NDDRC State offices.
25
   Costs incurred for the following components: i) Mapel Financial literacy, entrepreneurship and cooperatives trainings;
ii) State-based Financial literacy, entrepreneurship and cooperatives trainings; iii) Technical Skills Extension-
Agricultural extension visits; iv) Technical Skills Extension- Vocational expert visits; v) Technical Skills Extension -
Targeted Vocational Trainings; vi) Assistance in accessing available government services.
26
   All ex-combatants were asked whether they would be interested to receive assistance with education or
livelihood toolkits but none chose the education path.
27
  Modules 1 to15 were: (i) Introduction to Micro-Lab; (ii) Financial Literacy; (iii) Business and Market; (iv) Financial
Aspects of Business and Cooperatives; (v) Selecting a Business and Cooperative Format; (vi) Steps in Starting a
Business; (vii) Business Skills Development in Cooperatives; (viii) Behavioural Skills in Entrepreneurship and
Cooperatives; (ix) Team Building and Management of Cooperatives; (x) Business Plan for Setting –up a Cooperative;
(xi) Enterprise Management: Sales and Marketing; (xii) Enterprise Management: Purchasing; (xiii) Enterprise
Management: Work Place Management; (xiv) Enterprise Management: Book-keeping; (xv) Concluding and Action
Plan for Setting-up Cooperatives.

                                                                     Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    57
     110.     The outputs for this sub-component are:

                   (a) Training Curriculum;
                   (b) Training Manual;
                   (c) Training of Trainers methodology (and resulting cohort of 10 trainers).

     111.    As conceived in the Project Document the expected outcomes of the activities in this
     Sub-Component are simultaneously highly ambitious and overly difficult to measure. Training of
     290 ex-combatants in the 15 modules of the curriculum took place over 10 days and in a total of
     60 hours commencing 2nd September 2013 and ending 11th September 2013.

     112.    Follow-Up Entrepreneurship, Financial Literacy and Association/Cooperatives
     Training (Phase 1) (US$ 312,600). Dynamics of training in the States after graduation in Mapel
     TF is more difficult to verify because of limitations on record keeping and differences between
     testimony collected and data provided to the IA by the Trainers. The IA reports that training in
     the States after graduation (in Phase 1) was delivered to 253 ex-combatants (87 percent of the
     total 290) and to 284 community members as follows (table 2). This has not been possible to
     independently verify for the final evaluation.

     113.    Follow-Up Entrepreneurship, Financial Literacy and Association/Cooperatives
     Training (Phase 2) (US$ 146,433): In Phase 2 the supplementary follow-up trainings aimed to
     build on the foundation of trainings received by ex-combatants in Phase 1. The trainings were
     intended to provide successful ex-combatants with the knowledge to enhance their business
     performance while those ex-combatants that face difficulties receive additional input and
     assistance in problem solving. The follow up during phase 1 indicated that ex-combatants were at
     different levels of progress regarding start-up and management of their enterprises.

     114.     The outputs for this sub-component are:

             (a)   Training Curriculum;
             (b)   Training Plan & Schedule;
             (c)   Training of Trainers and resulting cohort of trainers;
             (d)   State-based follow-up trainings.

     115.     A TOT was conducted for ten days from 16th to 26th May 2014 producing a cohort of 20
     trainers (16 trainers plus 4 IA hired State managers). The curriculum entailed 13 training modules

that link up with the training content delivered in Phase 1.28 A participant satisfaction survey
conducted by the TDRP shows that the level of participants’ understanding of the materials is
very high (even though somewhat lower than that of Phase 1) but it was not possible to
independently verify these findings for the final evaluation.29

116.    Following the TOT the trainers delivered the modules to the ex-combatants on State level.
Similar to previous State based trainings it is difficult to verify whether the trainings were
implemented in a satisfactory manner and to what degree the training objectives were met.
According to data provided by the IA 269 ex-combatants (94 percent of the current caseload30)
received supplementary training (see table 3).

According to data from the satisfaction survey 61.8% of the respondents were very satisfied with
the State based training, the majority being most satisfied with the way in which trainers taught
them (91.8%) and the contents of the training (90.7%).31

117.    Agricultural extension visits (Phase 2) (US$ 48,417): According to the Project
Document ex-combatants are to receive assistance in farming and further appropriate agricultural
extension training, which is supplemented with small business training. In line with these
objectives the agricultural sub-component was introduced in Phase 2. The agricultural extension
work targeted those ex-combatants that opted to pursue a career in agriculture and who had
received the agriculture toolkit in phase 1 (129 ex-combatants in total).

118.     The outputs for this sub-component are:

        (a)   Curriculum design;
        (b)   Training plan & schedule;
        (c)   Training of Trainers for Agriculture Extension workers;
        (d)   Agricultural Extension field trainings.

                                                                  Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    59
     119.    A 7-day agricultural TOT focusing on small farm business skills and improved
     agricultural methods 32 was conducted from 28th May to 3rd June 2014. An international
     agriculture specialist facilitated the training with the assistance of a local agriculture trainer
     contracted by the IA. The main participants of the TOT were seven extension workers of the State
     Ministry of Agriculture of Greater Bahr el Ghazal who already had a foundation in training
     agriculture. A self-assessment of the TOT participants conducted by the IA revealed that the level
     of understanding and confidence in delivering the modules was moderate/high. The agronomy
     knowledge amongst the participant group was inconsistent which seemed to challenge the
     knowledge transfer.33

     120.     Based on their previous expertise and the knowledge acquired in the TOT the extension
     workers, in close collaboration with staff from the NDDRC State offices who had joined the TOT
     training, delivered the subsequent agriculture trainings to the targeted ex-combatants in the pilot
     States. The objectives of this State based follow-up training in agriculture were, amongst others34:

             (a) To further support the ex-combatants to utilise the Agricultural trainings gained at
                 Mapel Transition Facility toward productive livelihoods in their communities of
                 return;
             (b) To train the ex-combatants on agriculture improved methods, best practices and small
                 farm business skills;
             (c) To train the ex-combatants on small farm business skills with an emphasis on
                 livelihood success.

     121.     The agricultural extension training was delivered to 119 ex-combatants out of the original
     129 people who chose agriculture as their field of reintegration. In addition, because the extension
     workers were travelling together with the Phase 2 training teams, the agricultural extension
     training was available for the ex-combatants of other reintegration fields to attend, provided that
     it did not interfere with their core training following a non-objection of the UNICON state
     manager. The number of additionally trained ex-combatants was not recorded as no separate
     attendance sheet policy was introduced for them.35

     122.     To what degree these trainings helped to support the beneficiaries to improve their
     agriculture livelihoods in their communities of return is difficult to assess. Due to challenging
     logistics and limited financial means of the Project the ex-combatants were not visited by the
     extension workers in their communities of origin but were trained in central locations. Given the
     lack of field visits to the ex-combatants’ homes and the relatively limited training time it can be
     assumed that more extension work on a one-on-one basis would be needed to have a lasting
     impact on the individual XC. However, the evaluation does not have the adequate data to gauge
     the training impact and to substantiate this argument.

     123.    A total of 399 people benefited directly from training in Phase 2 (follow-up training in
     business skills/financial literacy/business motivation and training in agricultural
     business/agronomy practices). This includes 270 ex-combatants (out of which one ex-combatant


     32
        The modules covered during the training were: i) Introduction; ii) Numeracy and Literacy; iii) Why
     establish a seed business? iv) Business Planning; v) Agricultural Topics; vi) Agricultural Cooperatives.

died) and 129 community members. During phase 1 a total of 284 community members received
the business/cooperative training in addition to 253 ex-combatants. Thus the percentage of
community members included in State trainings is well within the Project Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) of twenty percent.

Project Component: Institutional Capacity Building (US$ 519,506 Implemented by ASI with
IR) 36 (Phase 1 only) and South-South Capacity Building and M&E (US$ 247,525
Implemented by UNICON) (Phase 2 only)
124.     During Phase 1 only Institutional Capacity Building was implemented by Adam Smith
International (ASI) with Integrity Research (IR) providing services for capacity building on M&E
systems. In total ASI and IR deployed seven team members in the area of capacity building
including the Team Leader who doubled as the Principle Capacity Building Mentor. The total
time spent in field directly engaging with the NDDRC in HQ and in the State offices in greater
Bahr el Ghazal (Aweil, Kuajok, Rumbek, Wau) was 35 working days by each of the four State
mentors and 66 days by the TL/Principle Mentor. As per the TOR to the Implementing Partner
(IP) the outputs from ASI/IR for the period of the consultancy have been:

               (a) Inception Report;
               (b) PIP;
               (c) Draft PIM in collaboration with NDDRC and other IAs (see 2.4 below);
               (d) Draft Final Report;
               (e) Regular weekly/monthly written reports to the NDDRC;
               (f) SWOT analysis for State Offices;
               (g) Draft M&E manual;
               (h) Two four day training workshops (joint presentation ASI and NDDRC);37
               (i) Intensive on-the-job mentoring of key staff in NDDRC HQ PMU and staff in State
                   offices in Bahr el Ghazal;
               (j) Baseline and Community Dynamics Surveys and Reports;
               (k) Survey quantitative data (stored in NDDRC ICRS).

125.    The M&E activities of Project Component 1 included M&E capacity building to the
NDDRC and conducting Baseline and Community Dynamics surveys utilizing the human
capacity of the NDDRC (ICRS case-workers as enumerators).

126.    During Phase 2 direct Institutional Capacity Building took the form of a South-South
exchange with the RDRC. This activity was planned in response to the poor quality M&E manual
produced by the IA in Phase 1 and in recognition that the staffing configuration in the NDDRC
during Phase 1 was not such that a stable M&E unit existed. However, the staffing issue persisted
during Phase 2. The outputs of the exchange have been as follows:

           (a) An M&E manual (in draft form as of the time of final Project evaluation);
           (b) A MSPPT presentation to NDDRC HQ.

127.   The chief non-Project financed activity increasing capacity in the NDDRC was the
completion of the ICRS, itself an important information management system for the Commission.

     128.  At the time of evaluation the following are the outputs of activities associated with the
     ICRS:

             (a) Final version (3.0) of the ICRS installed on the HQ ICRS server;
             (b) Source code and draft user manuals (ICRS User Manual V2.0 and ICRS Administrator
                 Manual V1.0) at the time of evaluation all of which is with the TDRP for final sign-off
                 before transfer to NDDRC;
             (c) Completed Administrator Training of the NDDRC IT Unit on installation,
                 configuration and troubleshooting;
             (d) Completed ICRS User Training of ICRS Caseworkers.


     Project Component: DDR Community Support Projects (USD 450,000 Implemented by
     IOM) (Phase 1 and Phase 2)
     129.    The stated goal of the Project Component is “to promote peace building in the four States
     where ex-combatants will reintegrate through a focus on community empowerment and self-
     reliance.”38 It is also intended to “test the direct community support mechanism” for future DDR
     tranches.39 In addition to its goal this Project Component has two objectives:

                  (a) From a macro perspective at a State level: demonstrate both the NDDRC’s
                      commitment to the larger community through the delivery of these 12 construction
                      or rehabilitation of infrastructure projects (three in each State) and accountability
                      among all parties;
                  (b) From a micro-perspective: strengthen trust and cooperation between all parties

     130.      At time of final evaluation the outputs of this Component have been:

                  (a)   PIP;
                  (b)   Selection of Communities (based on criteria agreed with NDDRC);
                  (c)   Selection of Contractors through the Tendering Process;
                  (d)   Engagement of State PMUs and local government;
                  (e)   Community orientation to the CDD/R; facilitation of community meetings;
                  (f)   Training of management committees;
                  (g)   Project implementation;
                  (h)   Final report.

     131.     Prior to the Project start NDDRC opted to prioritise water interventions and
     improvements of local market places. Interventions targeted counties in the four-state target area
     with the highest number of ex-combatants registered in the programme. Based on location
     selection criteria40 drafted by the IA (taking into account the number of ex-combatants registered
     in the ICRS database and a needs analysis) a matrix was drafted outlining potential target Payams.
     Based on the matrix the sites were selected by the local authorities in close collaboration with
     NDDRC and IOM. NDDRC State Coordinators and IOM field staff then liaised with community

62
members and ex-combatants to identify the priority improvement projects that were of highest
priority in their communities within the available budget.41

132.    According to the IA’s final report it was originally proposed to implement up to 10
community projects but in the end IOM finalised 17 projects (15 boreholes with hand pumps, one
Payam building rehabilitation, and one borehole with solar pumping system42). All 16 water
projects were coordinated with the Rural Water Departments in each State. The community
projects were implemented in the following locations:

              (a)   Western Bahr el Ghazal State (9 Projects);
              (b)   Lakes States (5 Projects);
              (c)   Warrap State (2 Projects);
              (d)   Northern Bahr el Ghazal State (1 Project – Payam Building rehabilitation).

133.      Initially it was planned for WBGS to only drill four boreholes but due to the competitive
bidding process and cheaper pump installations than originally envisioned (more hand pumps
than solar pumps), a surplus of operational funds remained in the budget which was utilized to
drill five additional boreholes in the State.

134.    A series of community meetings (39 in total) were held with the target communities in
each project site. In these meetings IOM staff explained the role of the community in managing
the investment after project completion. 1285 participants (895 males and 390 females) attended
the meetings. Ex-combatant engagement in these meetings was reported only in three
communities. The breakdown according to States is as follows

        (a)   Western Bahr el Ghazal State (16 meetings);
        (b)   Lakes States (13 meetings);
        (c)   Warrap State (4 meetings);
        (d)   Northern Bahr el Ghazal State (6 meetings).

135.     Due to the outbreak of the conflict in mid-December 2013, activities were temporarily
suspended and a no cost time extension was issued by the World Bank until 30th May 2014.
Works on the community support projects recommenced in late February 2014 when the World
Bank lifted the temporary suspension of the programme. The final Project report was submitted
on 30th June 2014. This final Project evaluation did not include a technical assessment of
infrastructure outputs.

Project Component: Project Management and NDDRC Support (US$ 240,000)
136.     While not described as a Project Component in the Project documentation the Project has
an envisaged management structure comprising: (i) Reintegration Project Steering Committee
(SC); (ii) HQ PMU, and (iii) State Level PMUs (SPMUs) and the Project should interact with the
Technical Coordination Committee (TCC) for the overall work in NDDRC Pilot DDR project.

137.    The NDDRC with the assistance of the TDRP has established the HQ PMU which
comprises the representative staff from all units within the NDDRC. While the PMU met
regularly in Phase 1, meetings were less frequent in Phase 2. According to the Project Document


41
  See IOM Final Report
42
   The original plan was to upgrade and convert an existing borehole into a water yard. However due to the low yield
from the existing borehole, a new borehole was drilled and solar pumping system installed.




                                                                                                 Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                  Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    63
     the PMU is responsible for overarching management and coordination of reintegration pilot
     activities. While the PMU has turned out to be an important body to align the activities of various
     NDDRC departments and to share information amongst the national management level, it did not
     entirely fulfil its role as the ‘backbone’ of the reintegration process. Although all departments
     were requested to continuously engage and input through their participation in the PMU, the
     active involvement of some NDDRC units in the PMU remained marginal. At time of final
     evaluation the SPMUs were not operative first and foremost due to lack of staffing in the State
     offices. The SC met several times during the course of the Pilot Project and the TCC in the form
     of the Joint Operations Committee (JOC) while not part of the overall support of the Project to
     the NDDRC has brought together the major stakeholders including the UN family (in Phase 1).

     1.5 Alterations to Original Project Components and Outputs and Justification
     138.     The Project was designed to be implemented in three Phases with the design and
     implementation of Phase 2 Project Components being flexible enough to allow the Project to
     react to learning from Phase 1 and to the changing situation on the ground. Phase 3 was to consist
     largely of evaluation and learning.

     139.    As per the Project documentation the original Project Phase 1 was designed as a start-up
     phase running for three months (15thApril to 31st November 2013) with the aim to “establish a
     HQ PMU institutional framework, mechanisms, systems and procedures and to contract
     Implementing Partners who will provide technical assistance and execute programme activities
     including setting up of economic activities falling under Component 2 [Livelihoods
     Support].43Phase 1 largely ran to schedule until the suspension of the Project on 19th December
     2013.

     140.     In the original Project documentation Phase 2 was designed as a follow-up and
     consolidation phase running for four months (1stDecember2013 to 31st March 2014) with the aim
     of reinforcing outcomes from Phase 1 through follow-up reintegration services “either in the form
     of cooperatives, entrepreneurship around small farm activities or small enterprise training, or
     continued education and opportunities to ex-combatants and community members at their place
     of reintegration.”44 As a result of the suspension of the Project Phase 2 ran from 15thMay 2014
     until 31stJuly2014.

     141.     The project documentation identifies a third phase which was designed as the evaluation
     and knowledge transfer phase set to run between 1stApril and 15th June 2014. This phase was
     intended to complete “M&E activities with a beneficiary assessment and community dynamics
     study, as well as an overall evaluation of the processes, systems and outcomes of the Pilot. The
     knowledge transfer process will be completed during this phase.”45 In reality Phase 3 has not been
     a distinct phase and of those planned-for activities that have been implemented they have come
     towards the close of the Project: XC satisfaction survey conducted in July/August 2013, end
     evaluation in August and September 2014 with a follow-up learning session planed for October
     2014.

     142.    Aside from minor scheduling changes Phase 1 was implemented as planned however as
     noted above the Project was suspended on 19thDecember, 2014 due to the deteriorating security

situation. The major implementation challenge arising from the suspension was that no progress
had been made on activities in Component: DDR Community Support Projects. Activities were
rescheduled to Phase 2 when the IA exceeded planned Project outcomes. The IA exceeded the
planned-for number of outputs due to cost savings on construction that were subsequently put to
use in an additional 5 sites.

143.   . Phase 2 was very lightly designed in order to allow the Project to adjust to learnings
from Phase 1 and from the MTR. At design Phase 2 had the following aims:

          (a) Visit all livelihood projects, that is where ex-combatants have formed working groups
              (partnerships, associations or cooperatives) once;
          (b) Ensure at least three follow-up counselling sessions with ex-combatants during their
              month-end visits to the NDDRC offices when they collect their monthly salaries; and
          (c) If necessary visit enterprises that are reported to be failing and as feasible, provide
              additional mentoring assistance to address challenges.46

144.     Phase 2 encountered a rapidly deteriorating security situation and so implementation was
postponed until 15thMay, 2013. In the interim period partners in the Project design engaged
around potential activities for Phase 2. Based on learning from Phase 1 and the MTR the
originally planned-for activities were largely overhauled. Regarding the intended aims of Phase 2
the original quantitative indicators (numbers of visits to ex-combatants, number of counselling
sessions) were discarded and replaced with the following activities and justifications. More
detailed exploration of outputs and outcomes from Phase two is included in Section 2 and 3
below.

145.        Component: Livelihoods Support:

          (a) Shift of emphasis from training external IA-recruited trainers through TOT in
              Financial Literacy, Entrepreneurship and Cooperatives to training NDDRC ICRS
              workers. The justification for this shift is to retain expertise in the NDDRC and
              increase the capacity of ICRS workers to deliver technical counselling to ex-
              combatants. This design element was initiated by the NDDRC SC and implemented
              by UNICON.

          (b) Shift of emphasis from training external IA-recruited trainers through TOT in
              Agriculture (which included modules on numeracy and literacy, establishing a seed
              business, business planning and cooperatives) to including Agricultural Extension
              Workers from the State Ministry of Agriculture. The justification for this shift is: (i) to
              foster better cooperation with line ministries in the States, and (ii) to maximise
              delivery to ex-combatants and civilians as Agricultural Extension Workers work with
              both groups to dispense guidance of agricultural practices.

          (c) Inclusion of Technical Skills Extension: additional training mainly in auto mechanic
              and driving but also in carpentry, masonry and plumbing to ex-combatants. The
              justification for including these activities was the ex-combatant identified poor quality
              of training in Mapel TF in auto mechanic and driving as well as challenges faced by
              some ex-combatants obtaining their driving license and making use of the toolkit

                   received as part of this component in Phase 1. These activities were led by the
                   NDDRC in cooperation with local training institutions in the State. A total of 52
                   individual participated in the driving classes whereas two ex-combatants received
                   supplementary auto mechanics training.47

               (d) Inclusion of planned expert mentoring visits by skilled trades people. This was
                   intended to supplement vocational training received in Mapel TF however in reality
                   this was a minor activity. The expert visits were limited to one welding expert, who
                   visited the states of Western Bahr el-Ghazal, Warrap and Lakes and mentored some
                   ex-combatants who were trained in welding and now resided in those states.48

     146.       Component: Institutional Capacity Building:

               (a) Inclusion of South-South exchange in M&E. Phase 1 saw the completion of the
                   Institutional Capacity Building component however activities focusing on M&E
                   capacity building were not completed to the required standard and staffing challenges
                   in the NDDRC compromised the effectiveness of those same activities. The Project
                   included a South-South exchange with the RDRC in order to deliver M&E capacity
                   building to the NDDRC and to draft the M&E manual for the Commission.

     147.    The Project documentation identifies that activities in Phase 3 were to contain a
     Beneficiary Impact Assessment (BIA) and Community Dynamics (CD) survey. As a result of the
     changed circumstance on the ground a decision was made by the NDDRC and TDRP to cancel
     the surveys and replace them with a Beneficiary Satisfaction Survey (BSS). This survey was
     implemented by ICRS caseworkers between June and August 2014 with a final report due to be
     completed in September 2014, authored by the Bank TT.

     148.    In summary these changes to the Project largely have been driven by the deteriorated
     security situation and by the in-built Project flexibility to react to learning.

2. Project Outcomes
149.     Following is an examination of Project outcome sat the time of the final evaluation of the
Project. Outcomes differ from outputs in so far as they are the short to medium term changes that
follow on from Project activities and the production of outputs. Implicitly the Project is designed
so that Project outcomes fall into three broad categories:

          (a) The knowledge transferred and so behaviour changed (institutionally and in project
              design, management and implementation of DDR programming activities);
          (b) The short to medium term changes in the lives of main Project beneficiaries; that is,
              in the lives of ex-combatants and their communities as per the Project aims;
          (c) The shift in Project conceptualisation and planning based for any future DDR
              programming in South Sudan.

150.     The Project logic model is such that at the time of final evaluation the Project should
have achieved the short-term outcomes of a positive shift in capacity in the NDDRC and
acquisition by the Commission of systems or institutional arrangements that should enable it to
implement knowledge and skills acquired during the Project, thus positively changing its
institutional performance both incrementally during the Project and in any future DDR
programming.

151.     The final evaluation finds that there have been behavioural shifts and knowledge shifts in
the NDDRC in line with the aims of activities carried out in the Institutional Capacity Building
component and also generally as a result successfully implementing reintegration programming in
the Pilot.

152.     Behavioural shifts and knowledge have resulted from activities in the Capacity Building
Component in Phase 1 and in Phase 2. They have also resulted from the sum total of activities in
the Pilot for example, where in some State offices staff have shown initiative and determination
to maximise outcomes for ex-combatants and to proactively involve line ministries in supporting
the Pilot programme (Section 2.1 below).

153.    While without a Tracer and community survey it is difficult to measure the outcomes for
beneficiaries of the project, certainly there have been observable gains made in livelihoods for
some ex-combatants through activities in the Livelihoods Support component. Also there are
reported positive outcomes for community members through the Community Supports Project as
a result of having localised access to clean water. In all cases for ex-combatants and for
community members the sustainability of outcomes is unclear and as discussed below (Section
2.1 and 2.3) there are mitigating factors negatively affecting some outcomes.

154.      The MTR concluded that at the time of the review was unclear how outcomes achieved
by the close of Phase 1 would fit together to have a longer-term outcome on either the NDDRC
(institutionally or systems) or on Project design and implementation. The MTR found that that
staff churn, imbalance in the organisational structure, lack of institutional support from the GoSS
and apparent reliance on external TA were all factors negatively influencing the sustainability of
Project outcomes. The final evaluation finds that these factors persist and are compounded by the
hiatus on DDR programming resulting from the deteriorated security situation and by the removal
of DDR from the mandate of UN in South Sudan.

155.   As is discussed below (Section 2.2 and Section 3) the hiatus in DDR programming will
have a major negative effect on the outcomes of the Project unless managed effectively by the




                                                                                       Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot

     NDDRC with the support of the GoSS and the external partners to the Commission including not
     just BICC and TDRP but also UMMISS and donors. This is particularly the case regarding
     outcomes from the Institutional Capacity Building component and from the creation of an ICRS.

     156.   The loss of DDR from the UNMISS mandate is a major challenge to the NDDRC and the
     GoSS. For the NDDRC it constitutes the loss of a logistical support however it also represents an
     opportunity to re-engage the UN in a changed external and programmatic environment. The
     Commission are being proactive in seeking the re-incorporation of DDR in the UN mandate if
     renewed in November 2014 and it is imperative that this re-engagement is highly strategic and
     done with a view to maximising the input from the UN both as a thought-partner in the ‘good-
     enough coalitions’ that design and implement DDR programming and also as a logistical partner.

     2.1. Livelihood Supports
     157.    At the time of final evaluation the outcomes of the Livelihood Supports component are:

            (a) Learning regarding how an IA can effectively operate in the complex environment of
                South Sudan in all aspects of programme design and procurement, transportation and
                distribution of start-up kits;
            (b) Learning regarding how the IA can better manage knowledge transfer and acquisition
                and quality control reporting from the field;
            (c) Nascent involvement of other national stakeholders on State level in the
                implementation of the livelihoods sub-component;
            (d) Increased collaboration with local service providers in delivering livelihoods
                assistance to ex-combatants;
            (e) A majority of Project participants has started utilising the toolkits for livelihood
                activities;
            (f) Project participants have acquired additional vocational and entrepreneurial
                knowledge which many of them utilise to initiate livelihood opportunities;
            (g) Increased engagement of ex-combatants and community members in group livelihood
                activities (associations/cooperatives).

     158.    In the case of the Start-up Kits sub-component UNICON has delivered high quality
     reporting that details the steps in design, procurement, transportation and distribution, and that
     profiles successful and unsuccessful bidders and other external Partners involved in the
     implementation of the sub-component. Effectively this reporting constitutes a mini-procurement
     and distribution manual with market intelligence for the NDDRC to implement future similar
     sub-components.

     159.    Regarding learning how an IA can better manage knowledge acquisition, transfer and
     quality control reporting from the field, in Phase 1 UNICON worked with overly and
     unnecessarily complicated implementation arrangements, contracting CRADA, a South Sudanese
     NGO to deliver the training sub-component and encountering significant personnel, quality, and
     contracting issues with the NGO. Contracting CRADA appeared to be a way of replicating
     UNICON’s operating model in other countries. However, the approach put a poorly performing
     organisation and poorly performing CEO between UNICON and the independent trainers who
     were contracted to deliver training to ex-combatants and the communities. Consequently
     communications with the key personnel on the ground were mediated by a poorly performing
     organisation, which it was incorrectly assumed would employ its own staff to deliver training.
     Consequently intelligence from the field as to the effectiveness of training and dynamics in the
     delivery of outputs on the ground was interrupted and reporting from the field not to the standard




68
expected by UNICON. In Phase 2 recommendations regarding this issue were considered by the
IA leading to improved reporting and less complicated implementation structures to deliver the
training sub-component.

160.     As mentioned above in Phase 1 all livelihood activities (training and start-up kit
subcomponent) were implemented by the IA and sub-contracted service providers with no direct
involvement of the Line Ministries on State level. In line with the National DDR Strategic Plan
(2012-2020), the collaboration with the line ministries was significantly strengthened in Phase 2.
In WBGS, for instance, the NDDRC State Office closely coordinated pilot reintegration activities
with various Ministries on State level to maximize gains for ex-combatants. As a result of this
collaboration selected groups of ex-combatants received additional reintegration benefits such as
plots of land, timber and seeds.

161.     Although these developments are still early stage, these are signs of a growing albeit
loose relationship between the NDDRC and the State Ministries. Even though the above
mentioned activities may have been more a result of a strong initiative of the respective NDDRC
State office rather than a structured approach towards engaging State Ministries and it is uncertain
to what extent this proactive involvement of the Ministries has been replicated in other States, the
given example indicates that the DDR Programme can succeed in harmonizing its activities with
other national stakeholders. The cooperation with the Ministries leads to greater alignment of the
Pilot Project with the National DDR Strategic Plan that stipulates national institutions and local
service providers to play a role in implementing the reintegration component.

162.    As of now the collaboration between the NDDRC and the State Ministries on
reintegration related issues appears to be loose and is at times characterized by ad hoc
engagement and individual initiative. Consequentially, the related operational procedures and
processes are – in parts - still unstructured and lack a holistic approach. It is, for instance, still
unclear on what grounds groups of ex-combatants have received additional livelihood benefits
(most importantly the level of formalisation of an association/cooperative) or what will be the
impact on acquired land titles should a cooperative cease to persist. In order to avoid reputational
risks for NDDRC it will be essential in future DDR programming to further formalise such
implementation arrangements. There is a risk that due to the imminent halt in the DDR
Programme the emerging ties between NDDRC and other national stakeholders will stagnate
thereby negatively affecting the sustainability of the achieved Project outcomes.

163.     Whereas in Phase 1 external trainers hired by the IA delivered training, in Phase 2
technical skills training was implemented in close collaboration with a variety of public and
private and well-established local service providers. For instance, the IA coordinated its
agricultural extension work with the State Ministry of Agriculture. In the agriculture context the
IA trained extension workers in best practices and appropriate farming techniques. In addition
targeted vocational trainings were provided to ex-combatants via existing vocational training
institutions (e.g. ex-combatants enrolled in driving and mechanic courses with the Wau
Vocational Training Centre; in Aweil and Rumbek ex-combatants joined classes at a
driving/auto-mechanic school). This localised approach towards training not only helps to build
the capacity of South Sudanese institutions and organisations but also is likely to be more cost-
efficient than implementation arrangements involving external or international training
institutions. With regard to future programming it remains to be seen whether the same approach
can be applied. Especially when the programme is massively up scaled it is uncertain whether the
existing local service providers have enough technical and human resources to handle large
numbers of ex-combatants. As much it is feasible to utilise them in DDR operations, it will be




                                                                                         Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot

     necessary to carefully assess their capacities prior to the Project start and scope the programmatic
     options for aligning with institution building work in the States.

     164.     The training of trainers that were provided to agricultural extension workers and ICRS
     staff (on entrepreneurship and financial literacy) has increased the pool of domestic trainers that
     is available to train ex-combatants. It is, however, not clear in how far the trainers were able to
     utilise the skills and knowledge they acquired in the TOT in the delivery of trainings to the ex-
     combatants. In light of the reported varying skills levels of extension workers and ICRS staff (in
     terms of technical but also literacy/numeracy skills) it is difficult to draw conclusions concerning
     short to medium term outcomes of the extension trainings.

     165.    According to Project documentation on the entrepreneurship TOT in Phase 2 the trainers
     were empowered to influence the ex-combatants and instil in them a positive attitude toward their
     resettlement with their communities through setting up cooperative based business enterprises. At
     time of the final evaluation it is clear that trainers can articulate the concepts of entrepreneurship
     and cooperatives and apply the training process. The trainers can also assist ex-combatants in
     taking key decisions concerning business start-ups.49

     166.     Despite these positive gains a general critique about the TOT is that the training was
     relatively short given the amount of knowledge (on the training process and methods) that had to
     be imparted to the ICRS staff. The trained were granted limited time to develop certain key
     competencies and to absorb the training materials. Since the group of trainers changed from
     Phase 1 to Phase 2 the Project could also not build on the previous training and fieldwork, but had
     to start afresh thereby not being able to utilize the capabilities that had been built earlier in the
     Project.

     167.     The MTR identified that the Project assumed that reintegration programming, if
     implemented well, would increase confidence in the effectiveness of the DDR programme, and as
     a consequence, confidence in the NDDRC. The MTR noted that at the time of writing there was
     no evidence for this outcome. The final evaluation re-emphasizes these findings. Given the
     outbreak of hostilities in December 2013, the fragile security situation and ongoing mobilisation
     in the country there is generally little to no confidence in DDR as part of or linked to wider SSR.
     Regarding shifts that may occur in the perceptions and confidence held by ex-combatants and
     community members, relevant questions were not included in the Baseline surveys and so should
     be in future iterations. Increase in confidence in DDR, Reintegration programming and the
     NDDRC are critical to the future role of the NDDRC and future DDR programming in
     partnership with of SSR.

     168.     The expert visits that were introduced as a supplementary sub-component in Phase 2 had
     limited outcomes. While it was planned that a majority of ex-combatants of non-agriculture
     reintegration tracks receive a visit by an experienced professional with proven skills in their
     respective field, the expert visits were only offered by one welding expert. The limited reach of
     this activity was, according to the IA, due to lack of availability of experts in locations close to
     those of the corresponding ex-combatants, and the involvement of ex-combatants in agricultural
     work. The scaling-up of this sub-component in future programme iterations will be challenging as
     it is questionable whether there will be enough local experts available to carry out training on the
     job. Moreover, the amount of individual attention needed for each ex-combatant is very high and
     potentially not scalable.

169.     As mentioned above, the final evaluation faces challenges in measuring the outcomes for
individual beneficiaries because of the missing tracer survey and constraining environmental
factors. However, based on data of a Satisfaction Survey that was conducted in July/August 2014
by TDRP in close collaboration with NDDRC, it is nevertheless possible to at least identify broad
trends.

170.     The Satisfaction Survey aimed to find out: (i) the extent to which DDR participants are
satisfied with the Pilot Programme; (ii) how well ex-combatants were reintegrated into the
society; (iii) how they were faring in the host communities since being demobilized, and (iv) what
were their subsequent embankments on the reintegrating process.50 In total the survey had a
sample size of 204 ex-combatants (70.3 percent of the current caseload) including 192 males and
12 females.51

171.     The results of the Satisfaction Survey show that there have been observable gains made
in livelihoods for some ex-combatants through activities in the livelihoods sub-component. The
available data though, especially around the establishment of cooperatives and associations has to
be analysed with some degree of caution because there appears to be some conflict around the
concept of cooperatives in the South Sudanese context (especially the clear distinction between
cooperatives, associations and working groups). For future DDR programming clear-cut
guidelines on cooperative work have to be in place, agreed upon and implemented by all national
stakeholders involved including line ministries.

172.     According to the Satisfaction Survey results the overwhelming majority of respondents
(70 percent) indicate to be very or somewhat satisfied with the toolkit they received and most
(89.1 percent) remarked that they know how to utilise the tools. Those respondents that had
attended the animal husbandry, masonry and auto mechanic/driving classes in Mapel reported
lowest levels of satisfaction with the toolkit. The respondents that express dissatisfaction with the
toolkit mostly criticise that the tools were of low quality and easy to break and that parts of the
tools were missing upon delivery. Another point of concern was raised regarding the types of
toolkits. The study finds that 46.5 percent of the respondents mention that the toolkits they had
received did not match to what was used at the vocational trainings at Mapel which obviously is a
crucial point to consider in future DDR programming. Concerning the short to medium term
livelihood impact of the toolkits the survey results show that the majority of respondents still
make use of the materials they have received. The study finds that 61.4 percent indicate to
frequently or sometimes use the kit, with the agriculture and carpentry group making most
frequent use of the tools in direct comparison to other vocational tracks. !

173.     Regarding the vocational skills training in Mapel most respondents report that the
training taught them something new and that they have utilised the training skills in their daily
lives (an exception are those ex-combatants that received an auto mechanic training). The study
finds that 71.3 percent of those respondents that indicate to utilise the vocational training skills
mention they taught other family or community members the skills they acquired in Mapel, 57.3
percent state to make use of what they were taught to solve things in the household whereas more
than half (51.3 percent) indicate to use the acquired skills to improve their own business. The
respondents who report not to have used the vocational skills give as reasons that access to capital

                                                                         Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    71
     was lacking (69.8 percent), that they did not have the right tools (51.2 percent) and that the
     training was not sufficient/they did not learn enough (39.5 percent). !
     !
     174.     Almost three quarters of the interviewed ex-combatants (74.5 percent of the sample)
     report to currently work in the same vocation they were taught in Mapel (particularly those
     respondents that attended carpentry and agriculture classes). Amongst the respondents that
     attended the carpentry course the overwhelming majority (93.3 percent) is still working in the
     same vocation, followed by the group of respondents that attended agriculture lessons (91.8
     percent are still active in agriculture). For the other vocational tracks these figures are slightly or
     much lower. The study finds that 69.2 percent of respondents that attended the electrician course
     still work in that vocation, for auto mechanics this figure is 62.3 percent (which is an somewhat
     surprising result given the low level of satisfaction with the training course), welding 57.1 percent
     and animal husbandry 46.7 percent. The interviewees that attended the masonry and plumbing
     course are least successful in this respect. !

     175.     These results show that some of the vocational trainings have not been thoroughly linked
     to marketable skills and knowledge was not always imparted in line with the market realities.
     Some vocations were simply not beneficial for starting relevant business in the communities of
     return. This is in part resulting from the lack of counselling on what technical skills would be
     useful in relation to the market opportunities in the ex-combatants’ respective locations.52 The
     lack of thorough market analysis has already been a point of criticism in the CPA DDR
     programme - these lessons learned have obviously not been adequately mirrored in the National
     DDR pilot Project.
     !
     176.     Out of the sample of 204 ex-combatants only 3 respondents did not take part in the
     entrepreneurship, financial literacy and cooperative training in Mapel. The overwhelming
     majority of the respondents who participated in the course affirmed that they acquired new
     knowledge, with 59.9 percent indicating to have learned a lot and 31.2 percent to have gathered
     some new knowledge. The greater majority of participants (73.5 percent) claimed to have used
     some or a lot of that knowledge and skills in their daily lives whereas 6.4 percent only used very
     little of what was learned. Only 13.7 percent of respondents mentioned not to utilise the
     entrepreneurship skills. Amongst this group most respondents (79.2 percent) gave as a reason that
     there is no opportunity to apply the knowledge. This hints at the lack of economic opportunities
     and limited absorption capacity of the market in South Sudan which is a major stumbling block
     for many ex-combatants.

     177.     Those survey participants that reported using the entrepreneurship skills utilise them
     when working with other people (83.4 percent). Another 67.5 percent within that group also notes
     that they had formed a cooperative or that they were in the process of forming one (31.1 percent).
     This correlates with data received by the NDDRC on the formation of cooperatives in the Pilot
     Project. In total 17 livelihood groups 53 were set up across Greater Bahr el Gahazal of which most
     are not registered cooperatives as such but in the process of registering. These findings confirm
     that the training was effective in promoting group livelihood activities and imparting knowledge
     on the formation of cooperatives and associations. This, however, does not mean that ex-
     combatants solely focus on such livelihood forms. When asked how the entrepreneurship skills
     were utilized more than half (57.0 percent) of the respondents claim that they managed to

establish a business. More than a third (34.4 percent) says they utilized the skills to improve on an
existing business while a slight less number of the respondents (29.1 percent) mention to have
found an employment opportunity because of the entrepreneurship training they received.

178.     Out of the 204 respondents that took part in the survey 203 participated in a follow-up
business or cooperative training after leaving Mapel, with most of them (80.5 percent) receiving
training for two full days or more. Similar to the results of the Mapel training, the overwhelming
majority of respondents indicate that the supplementary training on entrepreneurship and
financial literacy taught them a lot or some additional knowledge (93.6 percent) and more than
three quarters (80.5 percent) still make use of the training to a large or some degree. These results
clearly indicate a positive impact of the State level training.

179.    Other indicators convey a rather mixed picture of the economic situation of pilot
programme beneficiaries. In order to meet their household expenses at the end of each month,
more than one third of the respondents (37.9 percent) report that they usually have to borrow
from someone else, another 25.6 percent on the other hand mentions that they usually break-even
and another 23.6 percent states that they usually have money left over. Equally mixed findings
came out of the survey when respondents were asked whether their income changed because of
the vocational training they received. 42.6 percent report that their income increased, 37.3 percent
see no change in income while 20.1 percent of the interviewees even notice a decrease in earning.

180.    When comparing the livelihood activities of the respondents before and after going
through the DDR programme, there are some slight changes visible. The most striking change is
the increased participation in registered cooperatives (of more than 21 people). While only 0.7
percent of the sample indicates to have worked in a cooperative before joining the DDR Pilot,
18.0 percent of the respondents report to participate in a cooperative after DDR. This figure of
18.0 percent is high and must be interpreted with caution. There is a high likelihood that this
increase in-group livelihood activities results from the trainings and counselling around
cooperative business.

181.    The final evaluation finds that this result is a positive outcome of the livelihood support
component that should, however, not be over-interpreted. As the satisfaction survey data does not
give clear indication about the success of the newly established cooperatives and associations, the
final evaluation cannot make any judgment about their effectiveness and value in terms of
creating sustainable livelihood opportunities for ex-combatants. As helpful as cooperatives are in
creating a supportive environment for ex-combatants and the communities involved, cooperatives
need to be understood in the broader market context and its absorption capacity. Not every
vocation is equally suited for cooperative business and not every cooperative has a potential to
succeed which is a point that needs to be taken into consideration more thoroughly in future DDR
programming.

182.    Socially, most interviewed ex-combatants (79.8 percent) mention not to face any
challenges back in their home communities. The overwhelming majority report that their
communities were accepting them after their return from Mapel and that they did not face any
hostile or jealous reactions from other community members because of the reintegration
assistance they received or their salaries. When asked about their expectations with regard to their
military status upon completion of the DDR programme, 85.2 percent of the respondents
indicated that they regard themselves as civilian whereas only 14.8 percent expected that they
would continue to be a Wounded Hero. Although not every DDR participant hence seems to have
understood or accepted that they cease to be part of the military, the overwhelming majority of




                                                                                        Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot

     participants do acknowledge the transition process from soldier to civilian. In this respect the
     programme’s outcomes have been moderately positive.


     2.2. Institutional Capacity Building
     183.     The main Institutional Capacity Building component was implemented in Phase 1 of the
     Project and assessed at the time of the MTR (at the close of Phase 1). At the time of the MTR the
     outcomes of the activities in this component had focused on knowledge acquisition, knowledge
     and skills transfer (from the consultants to the NDDRC) and the seeding of new systems and
     ways of working in the NDDRC. The component was intended to produce difficult to measure
     but critical shifts in the institutional behaviour of the NDDRC. The MTR identified that at the key
     knowledge, skills and behavioural outcomes of the Component had been:

                (a) Aggregate knowledge products which while listed above as outputs in aggregate
                    form a greater knowledge bank;
                (b) Increased awareness in management and key staff of the institutional challenges
                    facing the Commission and some strategies to begin addressing same;
                (c) A greater understanding of the need to action learning from the CPA and from this
                    Project;
                (d) Positive shift in confidence in the NDDRC regarding the capacity for project
                    implementation;
                (e) Nascent understanding of key systems required for successful operation
                    particularly internal (within HQ and between HQ and State offices) such as
                    communications; operational planning; human capacity, and monitoring and
                    evaluation;
                (f) Reconstituted M&E department in NDDRC.

     184.     The MTR noted that at the close of Phase 1 the main outcomes from the Project
     components had been: (i) organizational shift in the NDDRC M&E unit; (ii) mapping of
     institutional barriers to improving the performance of the NDDRC; (iii) capacity changes
     throughout the NDDRC in key areas such as operational planning, the work of the PMUs, and
     formalization of job roles and descriptions; (iv) nascent improvements in connectivity and
     information flow between HQ and State Offices, and (v) recommendations pertaining to the way
     forward for capacity building the NDDRC and critical areas that need to be addressed including
     relationships with external partners including UN agencies (UNMISS, UNDP and UNESCO).

     185.     As seen above (Section 1.5) Phase 2 supplementary activities under this Component were
     the M&E capacity building delivered as a South-South exchange with the RDRC. Supplementary
     capacity building activities implemented outside the component were: (i) the technical capacity
     building of the IT unit and ICRS workers around the ICRS; (ii) the programming and installation
     of the ICRS itself; (iii) training of ICRS case workers in Financial Literacy, Entrepreneurship and
     Cooperatives; (iv) training of ICRS in delivering a PDA-based survey (the satisfaction survey).
     Both the ICRS and the satisfaction survey are not financed under the Project but are
     complementary activities implemented by the Word Bank TT.

     186.    At the time of the final evaluation the medium term outcomes of these supplementary
     trainings are hard to predict. Certainly in the short term and depending on the individual
     concerned some of the ICRS workers will have increased understanding and skills in the basics of
     the financial literacy, entrepreneurship and cooperatives, as well as increased skills in delivering a
     PDA-based survey.




74
187.    The NDDRC IT has experienced an increase in technical skills around working with the
ICRS as a result of the training and technology transfer however as flagged by the Bank TT itself
and by the IT unit there is a need for additional support and some technical functions cannot be
actioned by the unit without the direct support of the Bank TT’s IT consultant.

188.     Similarly ICRS case-workers may have received a variety of training inputs but how
these inputs can or will influence performance in the field is not clear. This Project evaluation
does not constitute an institutional assessment and did not take a scientific approach to examine
how the NDDRC works in the field however, though observation it is clear that the innovation
and achievements evident in those State offices visited by the evaluation arise largely from the
initiative and capability of the staff there. In such situations then the training may have a more-
than-short-term impact.

189.     Performance is influenced by many factors and at the State level where the group of
NDDRC staff (ICRS workers) who have been most highly targeted by capacity building during
the Project work, performance is severely negatively influenced by the critical lack of
infrastructure and resources. Negative impacts of poor resource allocations resulting from the
austerity budget (from delays in payment of salaries to basic budgeting items) have been
exacerbated by the loss of critical infrastructure as a result of UNMISS withdrawing support
(generators, power, transport) and the effects of the ongoing deterioration in security. These
factors affect HQ but are far more striking at State level. The factors influencing performance are
augmented by the pause in activity by some parts of the NDDRC as it waits to see where DDR
will be situated and the wider SSR environment that emerges from the Addis negotiations and the
current instability (Section 4).

190.    In summary, all these factors contribute to a continuous erosion of ‘institutional capacity’.
Apart from the shape of the ICRS unit, much of the nascent systems and positive ways of
working that emerged during Phase 1 have all but disappeared. Arguably the ICRS unit itself
while functioning is indicative of what the IA identified as the problematic institutional
arrangements and organisational structure in the NDDRC54: it is evidence of an organisation
imbalance both in terms of activity and in terms of information flow which will need to be
addressed in any future programming and through the proactive leadership of the NDDRC itself.

191.     The MTR identified that M&E capacity building in Phase 1 was impeded by a lack of
staffing in the NDDRC. Despite the implementation of M&E capacity building activities in Phase
2 a similar situation exists now in the Commission and so M&E capabilities appear at best,
rudimentary.

192.     The Project did not engage in capacity building activities around public information
partly because this field was covered by other partner institutions to the NDDRC such as
UNMISS and BICC. Therefore the public information and communications agenda was
technically outside the scope of the reintegration pilot. The NDDRC and UNMISS PI
departments though faced crucial funding challenges that significantly aggravated sensitisation
efforts and outreach. Although the NDDRC in collaboration with its partners carried out
sensitisation events in the assembly areas prior to the start of the DDR programme, not all
potential DDR candidates could be reached (partly because of lack of cooperation on the side of

     the SPLA commanders, difficult access to the XCs’ home communities and wounded heroes
     communication channels being by word of mouth, discrepancy between profiled caseload and
     actual programme beneficiaries). Due to this gap in sensitisation ex-combatants had different and
     sometimes overly high expectations for their reinsertion training. Although the DDR trainers
     were providing orientation to the XCs upon their arrival and additional sensitisation sessions in
     Mapel were carried out during the reinsertion period to counter lack of sensitisation, the
     information provided to XCs was incomplete and lacked coherence. General information about
     the DDR programme during reintegration was provided by the ICRS caseworkers but not in a
     structured manner (i.e. following the PI strategy). For future programme iterations it will
     therefore be crucial to better integrate sensitisation activities throughout reinsertion and
     reintegration programming (e.g. information dissemination about the DDR process should be
     closely linked to the vocational and life skills modules). Moreover, sufficient funding needs to be
     availed to cover the sensitisation campaigns for the targeted recipient needs.55 !

     2.3 DDR Community Support Projects
     193.       At the time of final evaluation the outcomes of the DDR Community Support component
     are:

               (a) Learning regarding how an IA can effectively implement DDR Community Support
                   Projects in areas with high concentration of ex-combatants;
               (b) Improved access to clean water for target communities where water projects were
                   implemented;
               (c) Learning       regarding      the     effectiveness    of   Community    Driven
                   Development/Reconstruction (CDD/R) Projects in the DDR context.

     194.     At the time of the MTR no project outcomes from the DDR Community Supports
     Projects were reported due to implementation delays stemming from disruption of transport links
     as a result of the rains and the suspension of the Project on December 19th, 2013. The timing for
     the community projects turned out to be a major factor influencing Project implementation. Due
     to the rainy season most selected sites were completely inaccessible for several months that not
     only negatively affected the pace of construction works but also hindered the IA from travelling
     to the communities to carry out community mobilizations. Seasonal changes in South Sudan thus
     have to be taken into account more thoroughly in planning future DDR phases.

     195.    Despite the mentioned implementation challenges the IA none the less managed to
     deliver the required outputs after a no cost extension was issued by the WB until end of May
     2014. The Project highly benefited from the IA’s experience with similar types of community
     based Projects.

     196.    The evaluation finds that there seems to be an increased understanding within NDDRC of
     what is necessary to facilitate implementation of CDD/R projects. Through collaboration with
     IOM on the community sub-component the NDDRC State offices engaged in varying degrees
     with the communities of return although the individual livelihood support was more in the centre
     of NDDRC’s attention. Confusion only arose with regard to the bidding process as the NDDRC
     seemed not be aware that the Project had to follow IOM’s procurement procedures and therefore
     suggested utilising the GoSS procurement policy. Through a very transparent bid analysis
     involving the relevant NDDRC departments this issue could be solved. However, future projects


     55
          See also NDDRC’s internal lessons learned paper (December 2013).




76
should ensure that all actors are aware of the partners’ respective policies and that knowledge
about procurement procedures is widely spread within the organisations.

197.    The community projects have brought a positive change for target communities.
Although the final evaluation did not have a chance to appraise all 17 projects and only 2 sites
were visited in WBGS (water interventions/boreholes)56, the evaluation find that the interventions
that were assessed are providing direct and clear benefits to the communities and appear to meet
local needs and priorities. For example, one water Project in WBGS provided more than 1050
people with clean water which exemplifies the strong impact the Project has on local health and
development.

198.     The objectives of the community support projects, in particularly the overall aim to
promote peacebuilding in the pilot States and the goal to demonstrate NDDRC’s commitment to
the larger community, are overly ambitious given the relatively small size of the sub-component.
Concluding from the field visits completed in the frame of the final evaluation it appears that the
communities concerned were only to some degree able to draw a connection between the
implemented community project and the assimilation of returning ex-combatants and the work of
NDDRC. The lack of understanding in the community of the link between DDR and local
development might be partly due to the small caseload with only some few ex-combatants
resettling in certain areas, it puts into question the Project’s aspiration to demonstrate NDDRC’s
commitment to the larger community. In future one possible way to go would be to increase the
scale of the community interventions to ensure visibility and to distinguish the DDR Community
Support Projects from other Projects implemented by different organizations in the same
community. Instead of linking the community projects to the work of DDR Commission the
Project would rather emphasise its peace dividend aspect and the fact that through the
assimilation of ex-combatants the community receives additional benefits. Alternatively a
coherent sister CDD programme separate from DDR could replace activities.

199.     The final evaluation finds that the Project’s aspiration to strengthen community
empowerment and self-reliance was compromised by design because of the restricted number of
Project types. The focus on water interventions and market rehabilitation, which originated from
the belief that these interventions are simple to implement, restricted the options that were
presented to the communities hence minimizing their level of engagement. An exception was the
completion of the Payam building in NBGS that followed a purely community driven approach
(the community requested the completion of the unfinished Payam office which was of high
priority but outside the preferred project categories of water and marketplace improvements). The
building was completed using local skilled and unskilled labourers from the community, an
approach that reinforced the community’s ownership of the project.

200.     The design of the component has an emphasis on sustainability through the formation of
community water management committees. However, as the MTR found, both the experience of
IOM in previous projects in South Sudan (outside DDR which identified that there were
difficulties maintaining and charging for the water services) and the model of borehole/water
pumps being used (manual compared to solar power) point to the high risks to the sustainability
of the water infrastructure post-completion. The final evaluation re-emphasizes these risks.

 Sites that were visited in the frame of final evaluation: 1.) Nyikejo Village (Jur River County, Rochdog
Payam, WBGS); 2.) Nyinalel (Jur River County, Marial Bai Payam, WBGS)




                                                                                           Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                            Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    77
     201.     Although the evaluation did not use an impact evaluation to assess the impact of the DDR
     community projects on the target population, there is anecdotal evidence that the communities
     have little capacity to manage newly constructed infrastructural resources in the medium and long
     term. Although the IA delivered trainings to members of the water management committees and
     consequentially knowledge on infrastructure maintenance was imparted to the community, it
     remains questionable whether these skills will be utilised in future. Ideally, follow-up training or
     refresher courses in repair and maintenance would be needed to ensure sustainability of the
     training impact, as would access to spare parts.

     202.   The community members interviewed for this study all expressed concern that in case the
     water borehole breaks down the community will lack the necessary financial resources to
     purchase the needed spare parts. Instead of seeking sustainable and self-reliant solutions to this
     problem (such as structured savings for the pump installation), most interviewees stressed that
     they would rather look for assistance from the NDDRC or other government institutions. This
     exemplifies a strong aid dependency that puts the CDD/R projects at risk and also aggravates the
     implementation of any future community project of that kind.

     2.4 Performance of the Project as a pilot: learning and knowledge acquisition
     203.    As a pilot the Project must be orientated towards trialling systems and institutional
     capability, documenting learning and auctioning relevant learning.

     204.    The MTR found that by design the Project is clearly orientated towards capturing and
     disseminating learning. The MTR identified that throughout design and implementation that the
     Bank TT had worked progressively with the NDDRC, the IAs and with key external stakeholders
     to emphasis the learning-orientation of the Project. The final evaluation finds that the Bank TT
     and IAs were consistent in their orientation towards learning as evidenced by the volume of
     learning content in IA reporting to the Bank identifying pertinent issues and tracking challenges
     and recommendations for future programming including in areas outside the purview of particular
     IAs but within their scope of operation.

     205.    Also the MTR identified that the NDDRC was eager to learn by doing but that logistical
     challenges and human capacity were limiting factors on the ability of the Commission to fully
     engage and implement learning. The MTR found that the challenge to the NDDRC is to action
     the learning it is acquiring: in other words, learning should be reflexive and should practically
     inform the next phase of the Project and subsequent programme design. Critically, the NDDRC
     and the Project architects should reflect fully on the recommendations and reporting of all IAs
     including those further down the delivery chain particularly the Training Professional Dr. Guatam
     Raj Jain and the Trainers who worked during Phase 1 of the Livelihoods Support Component. In
     place of the now-cancelled evaluation of the Mapel TF and the programme implemented there the
     NDDRC should engage UN thought partners in a full review of the both the programmatic
     learning and strategic learning from the Project interrogating all assumptions of the wider NDDR
     Pilot Programme hosted at Mapel Transition Facility including that the appropriate way to design
     DDR in South Sudan is using the Transition Facility Approach. Any Phase 3 learning sessions
     should incorporate stakeholders from the wider South Sudan DDR programming environment.

     206.    Observing programmatic learning pertaining to activities, the final evaluation finds that
     the learning orientation of the Project persisted into Phase 2. IAs successfully improved field
     M&E to accurately track outputs and short-term outcomes and the NDDRC worked to collate and
     manage data from the field. It should be noted that data collection in such complex, fragile and
     insecure areas as those presented by the Project is highly challenging and often problematic. That




78
said at a programme level the data-collection by IAs and that of the NDDRC has some limitations.
For both the IAs and the NDDRC data pertaining to outcomes particularly numbers of functional
cooperatives/associations is not reliable. For the NDDRC data sharing and learning sharing
within the NDDRC is limited. This appears partly to be a result of institutional imbalance and
partly a result of disconnection between human systems in the Commission (which is perpetuated
by resource challenges and lack of connectivity between HQ and State offices).

207.     As identified in the MTR for learning to be useful it must be actioned. The Project has
demonstrated how the NDDRC can implement a pilot reintegration project and it has tracked
consistently the opportunities and challenges of the implementation. The question is how the
NDDRC and the Project Architects will systematically reflect on programmatic learning; on
strategic learning and on how the two interrelate. Critically the learning from the Project while
largely programmatic also has relevance to the wider strategic context including the design of any
future DDR programming, the necessity of aligning DDR and SSR, and critically ensuring
transparent GoSS buy-in to that same DDR and SSR.

                                                        Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    79
     3. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
     208.     The evaluation finds that the Project has satisfactorily provided ex-combatants with
     skills enabling and enhancing their livelihood opportunities in communities of return (first socio-
     economic objective). Whether it has facilitated social reintegration is not clear (second socio-
     economic objective).

     209.    The evaluation finds that the Project has performed highly satisfactorily generating
     lessons learned that can be applied to future South Sudan DDR programming (first reintegration
     programme, systems and learning objective). It has performed moderately satisfactorily to
     develop and instil a system of DDR Reintegration Management in South Sudan that can live
     beyond the life of the project (second reintegration programme, systems and learning objective).

     210.    The Project does not have prescribed Key Performance Indicators at Project level.

     211.    At the time of final evaluation (end of Phase 2 of 3) the Project has made good progress
     towards meeting of its Project objectives and appears on course to meet its remaining objectives.
     The MTR documented how the project despite early implementation challenges had recovered to
     successfully implement the majority of activities in Phase 1 except those negatively affected by
     factors outside the control of the Project: activities in the Component Community Support
     Projects were affected by environmental issues and activities in the Component Institutional
     Capacity Building were affected by human capacity in the NDDRC.

     212.    The factors affecting the implementation and outcomes of the Pilot can be classified as:
     (i) those directly related to the Project design; (ii) those related to institutional capacity and
     arrangements, and (iii) those related to the external environment including the security, policy
     and donor environment

     213.     In summary, the challenges that are directly related to Project design and implementation
     and which have affected the overall implementation of the Project or which are affecting or likely
     to affect the Project outcomes are as follows.

     214.   The factors negatively affecting the Project outcomes since the beginning of the pilot,
     some of which (as outlined below) have been addressed by the Project implementers are:

               (a) Limited institutional capacity of the NDDRC;
               (b) The external environment;
               (c) The external market for skills imparted to ex-combatants;
               (d) Data management regarding outcomes of Components Design limitations
                   including internal coherence, timing and use of delivery chains (addressed since
                   the MTR);
               (e) Delays arising with IAs becoming effective and/or beginning implementation
                   (addressed since the MTR);
               (f) Quality of some outputs (addressed since the MTR).

     215.    The factors positively affecting the Project outcomes are:

               (a) Fit with the NDDRC Pilot DDR Programme (as per MTR);
               (b) Positive relationships between the TDRP and UN agencies (as per MTR);




80
          (c) Close project management and operational involvement of the TDRP (as per
              MTR) in cooperation with BICC;
          (d) Responsiveness and ability of IAs to become operational for Phase 2 in a short
              notice period;
          (e) Flexibility of IAs in reacting to a somewhat iterative project design (see point a
              previous paragraph);
          (f) Cooperation with line Ministries in the States.

216.    Design limitations such as internal coherence, timing and the use of delivery chains.
The MTR found that in Phase 1 the implementation of the Project during the season when ex-
combatants would normally tend their land negatively impacted on the achievement of outcomes
relating to sustainable livelihoods by ex-combatants. However the timeframe for the Project
implementation was largely outside the control of the key stakeholders other than the NDDRC as
the Project was required to align with the wider NDDRC Pilot DDR Project that itself was poorly
timed.

217.     The external security environment heavily influenced the timing of Phase 2. The MTR
found that the Project appeared to lack some internal coherence with a wide spread of activities
matched in the Project documentation with a too-ambitious set of objectives. Similarly the MTR
found that the use of delivery chains, particularly in the Component: Livelihood Supports
compromised quality control and contributed to unnecessary challenges implementing training
activities.

218.     Some Phase 2 activities such as training under Component Livelihood Supports do not
present a coherent ‘flow’ or logic from the Phase 1 activities. The decision to capacity build ICRS
caseworkers through TOT went against the advice of the lead trainer and designer of the training
curriculum and missed the opportunity to capitalise on progress made with independent
consultants in the States in Phase 1. The decision to use Phase 2 to compensate for shortcomings
in the training given by UNESCO in the Mapel TF (training that is programmatically
unconnected to the Project) appears out of sync with the intention of a Pilot and rather appears to
be compensating for the performance of other agencies in Phase 1. However that the
supplementary training was delivered through local vocational institutions rather than through
trainers in a Transition Facility is an important point proving that the capacity to train ex-
combatants exists in the vocational training sector.

219.    In Phase 2 the IA (UNICON) successfully addressed issues relating to the use of delivery
chains to deliver training to ex-combatants experienced during Phase 1. In Phase 2 the IA showed
a much better understood the environment and the challenges to implementation and expertly
dealt with challenges encountered during implementation.

220.    Delays arising with IAs becoming effective and/or beginning implementation. The
IAs addressed all effectiveness and implementation delays experienced in Phase 1 and
documented in the MTR (effective were lack of experience, lack of institutional presence in
South Sudan and limited knowledge of operating in South Sudan or of the operational context
there). UNICON did not experience any of the effectiveness and implementation challenges it
encountered in Phase 1. The IOM exceeded its delivery targets and completed all activities on
time.

221.     The external market for skills imparted to ex-combatants. The Project documentation
identifies that along with testing delivery systems the Livelihood Support component will




                                                                                        Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                         Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    81
     “provide livelihood support services to ex-combatants in their communities of return to facilitate
     long-term livelihood success.” 57 This outcome of ‘long-term livelihood success’ is greatly
     influenced by the external environment but also by the reality of the local markets into which ex-
     combatants are integrated.

     222.      The training given to ex-combatants by the Project is closely tied to the skills imparted
     during the wider NDDRC Pilot DDR Project in Mapel. While the Project can train ex-combatants
     in cooperatives and entrepreneurship any outcome from that training is limited by the vocation in
     which the ex-combatant was trained, the quality of that training and the demand for those newly
     acquired vocational skills in the market place. With some vocational training it is clear that there
     is little obvious demand for cooperatives: for example, welding. In the case of welding the Wau
     ex-combatant welders’ cooperative that was formed during Phase 1 (and had land granted to it
     from the Ministry of Land and Physical Infrastructure via the NDDRC State office and was given
     a generator and plasma torch); at the time of the final evaluation this cooperative of six ex-
     combatants had dissolved. One ex-combatant remained in an unpaid apprenticeship with a local
     civilian welder. The fate of the Wau ex-combatant welders cooperative illustrates a clear
     underlying weakness in the wider NDDRC Pilot DDR Project which negatively impacts on the
     outcomes of the Project: the vocational training given to ex-combatants is based on a very general
     and macro-level UN-led assessment of market opportunities.

     223.     Unfortunately the UN has not conducted a final evaluation of the NDDRC Pilot DDR
     Project so the effectiveness of the vocational training programme has not been measured
     however; from the observable evidence the main form of cooperative or associative working that
     is yielding returns for ex-combatants appears to be for those trained in agriculture, not the other
     vocational skills. This reflects a critical challenge that is universal in vocational training
     programmes in DDR: how the vocational training aligns with the absorptive capacity of the
     market.

     224.    Activities in the Institutional Capacity Building component encouraging the formation of
     cooperatives have faced other challenges. One such challenge has been the lack of clarity around
     the officially acceptable definition of a cooperative. In South Sudan the required number of
     members to register as a cooperative is 21 people: which even within the agriculture sector is a
     limiting factor. In reality the line ministry at the State accepts a lower number of members when
     recognising a cooperative but there is no set definition. Consequently the line ministry in Western
     Bahr al Ghazal accepted six members to register the Wau ex-combatant welding cooperative but
     such decisions appear to be taken on a case-by-case basis. Consequently a lack of clarity exists
     around how to advise ex-combatants and community members to form cooperatives.

     225.     The lack of standardisation and systems at ministerial level and in the NDDRC
     presents a risk factor to the NDDRC. In the case of the Wau ex-combatant welders cooperatives
     the NDDRC state office managed to secure a grant of a parcel of land from the line ministry to
     enable the cooperative develop a premises or site for trading. However as with the granting of
     timber to the Wau carpentry cooperative (a cooperative which at the time of the final evaluation
     was one person as the others were reported by the remaining members as absent tending their
     lands) the granting of land has been on a case-by-case basis and highly reliant on the industry of
     the NDDRC staff thus leading to the possibility of the NDDRC being accused of bias when one
     cooperative gets a grant of an asset and another does not.

226.     With the dissolution of the Wau ex-combatant welders cooperative the NDDRC is faced
with the unusual situation of a land title granted to a non-existent cooperative without any clear
systematic way of managing that land or the grant of land itself. In such a situation the NDDRC is
faced with a reputation risk where state offices can be perceived as acquiring land for itself.
Regardless of such reputational risk, purely for the harmonization of systems and to accurately
gauge how to scale such important support from the line ministries it is imperative that the
NDDRC formalises all the relevant definitions and procedures around cooperatives and granting
of assets or resources by line ministries.

227.     Quality of outputs. As documented in the MTR, at the end of Phase 1 in the Component
Institutional Capacity Building the Project encountered poor quality baseline reporting and M&E
manual from ASI/IR. The MTR noted how the M&E manual produced by ASI/IR was not
completed to the highest standard so during Phase 2 and the Project employed South-South
exchanges to address short fallings in the M&E activities of the Phase 1 Institutional Capacity
Building component. The outputs of the Phase 2 activities have included a good quality draft
M&E manual however the NDDRC still does not have an M&E unit or the capacity to manage
high quality M&E so there is no evidence of outcomes from the M&E activities.

228.     The institutional limitations encountered by the M&E activities reflect a larger
challenge encountered by the Project and which faces any future DDR programming. As
documented during Phase 1 by the IA for the Institutional Capacity Building component the
NDDRC is hamstrung by an unbalanced organisational structure and staffing challenges. Despite
the creation of the PMU by the Project as an attempt to balance information sharing and engender
engagement of staff in the NDDRC by the close of Phase 2, a limited number of staff have been
involved in the implementation. The IA for the Institutional Capacity Building component
warned that the creation of the PMU is a useful mechanism to ensure project implementation but
it avoids the greater need to reform the organisational structure of the NDDRC and ensure that
staff of all levels is engaged. The final evaluation finds that this finding remains salient.
Furthermore the tendency to concentrate capacity building in the ICRS unit is likely to have
further imbalanced the organisational structure of the NDDRC.

229.     The negative impacts of the lopsided organizational structure are exacerbated by staff
churn and the difficulties faced by the NDDRC to meet basic operational costs and salaries under
austerity budgets and in the current security environment. A further exacerbating factor is the loss
of logistical support as a result of the UN removing DDR from the current mandate of the
organisation: in the States UN-supplied generators are locked and the NDDRC can no longer
work through the UN to travel from Juba to the State offices.

230.    The factors in the external environment negatively influencing the outcomes of the
Project were as follows:

       (a)   Breakdown in security and postponement of the beginning of Phase 2 until May 2014;
       (b)   Loss of DDR in the UN mandate;
       (c)   Refocusing of donor strategy on humanitarian response;
       (d)   Continued lack of active support of the GoSS for DDR.

231.   All of these factors are highly relevant to the design of any future DDR programming in
South Sudan.




                                                                                        Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                         Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    83
     232.    The breakdown in the security environment in December 2013 and the resulting
     postponement of Phase 2 had the potential to derail the remaining Phases of the Project. Arguably
     the most observable negative impact of the postponement has been on internal systems and
     capacity in the NDDRC as built during the Phase 1 Institutional Capacity Building component
     and as created by the Project implementation structures (PMU, SPMU, SC).

     233.     In Phase 2 much of the nascent systems and ways of working that emerged from
     activities in the Institutional Capacity Building component have disappeared. This is both at HQ
     and at State level where mentors worked with the NDDRC to build capacity. Structures such as
     the PMU and SPMUs have not been functional during Phase 2 and so as outlined above, work to
     implement the Project has become concentrated in a small number of staff in the NDDRC.

     234.     Despite this it is clear that some cumulative outcomes of the experience of the Project
     remain. There is an increased sense of empowerment that, if offered the opportunity, the NDDRC
     can lead DDR programming. Some state-level staff show a clear increase in capacity, drive and
     innovation but the evaluation cannot conclude that this is pervasive as only one State was visited
     by the team.

     235.    The MTR found that prior to the deterioration of the security and political situation there
     were risks pertaining to the sustainability of Project outcomes as a result of the legacy of the CPA
     and limited buy-in from the SPLA. The final evaluation finds that as the Project draws to a close
     the external environment is highly challenging to securing many of the outcomes from the Project.

     236.     Clearly the ongoing conflict in the country is dynamic however it is unclear how or
     where DDR fits in any future scenario. It can be argued that the failure of the NDDRC Pilot DDR
     Project in Mapel to secure the appropriate caseload of ex-combatants for DDR reflected a lack of
     buy-in by the GoSS and the SPLA. While progress was made to secure the outward support of the
     GoSS such as through ministerial visits to Mapel during graduation it remains the case that South
     Sudan is in conflict with widespread recruitment into all factions of the SPLA and in that context
     the real outcome of the Project: to show national leadership by the NDDRC and to visibly build
     the capacity of the NDDRC to lead future DDR programming is threatened. Without highest-level
     buy-in to both DDR and SSR any capacity built in the NDDRC will gradually dissipate as it
     ‘waits’ for direction to come from GoSS on DDR or SSR. Consequently it is critical that the
     NDDRC appropriately strategies about future DDR and that other stakeholders in particularly the
     donor community engage the parties in the Addis talks on DDR and SSR.

     237.     This last point is critical: engagement on future DDR and SSR programming must come
     at all levels in order to create any possibility on future DDR programming. Furthermore, the
     NDDRC must not sit idle, waiting for any decision but rather should be supported by donors and
     the GoSS at the least to prepare a properly designed, considered and strategized DDR/SSR
     programme that takes full cognisance of the heterogeneity of groups that may undergo DDR. The
     NDDRC and its critical thought partners (including the UN, ideally with a renewed DDR
     mandate even if only in limited fashion) should consider all aspects not just of the Project but also
     of the NDDRC Pilot DDR Project in Mapel and fully interrogate the assumptions, modalities and
     efficiencies of what has been implemented.

     238.    Urgently the NDDRC, its donors and the GoSS must strategize around the wholesale
     refocusing of the donor community on the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan and find space for
     the preparatory strategic and programmatic work for further DDR-SSR programming. Critically




84
there must be highest level buy-in in all parties to the Addis talks to the relevance and potential of
DDR-SSR in South Sudan.

239.     While there were challenges arising from the kind of vocational training given to ex-
combatants in Mapel overall the implementation and outcomes of the Project were positively
influenced by the fit with the NDDRC Pilot DDR Reintegration programme. As noted in the
MTR in Phase 1 the design strengths of the Project, particularly its alignment with the NDDRC
Pilot DDR Programme and the national DDR strategy have enhanced the implementation of the
Project.

240.     The strong relationship between the Bank TT and the UN family, particularly UNMISS
and UNESCO helped the Bank TT approach the Project in a holistic manner, understanding the
complexity of the overall NDDRC Pilot DDR Programme and ensuring a design fit with the
wider vocational training and literacy/numeracy training delivered by UNESCO to ex-combatants
at the Mapel Transition Facility. In Phase 2 this is less relevant as the Project was attempting to
build on its own outputs from Phase 1.

241.    Throughout Phase 1 and Phase 2 a critical factor influencing Pilot implementation and
the achievement of outcomes has been the intensive support of the Bank TT and BICC and the
project management applied not only to the Pilot but also to the development of the ICRS. The
Bank’s presence on the ground in Phase 1 and 2, and BICC’s presence on the ground in Phase 1
has been critical to implementation and ensuring the coordination of IAs and NDDRC.

242.    The ability of IAs in Phase 2: UNICON and IOM, to become effective in the field at
short notice have proven crucial to the implementation of the Project. For UNICON overcoming
and learning from implementation delays in Phase 1 greatly improved their performance and the
IA had significant work to manage to redesign training curriculum for Phase 2. For IOM,
familiarity with the activities and with the environment proved instrumental in the timely
implementation of activities.

243.    As noted above cooperation with line ministries has yielded results at State level
including granting land and materials (teak and seeds for example) to some cooperatives. The
project targeted line ministries by including agricultural extension workers in training
implemented as part of the Livelihood Support component. In the case of the involvement of line
ministries granting land and materials it is important that the NDDRC in cooperation with the
various ministries develop guidelines and criteria for such assistance. At the time of the final
evaluation it is not clear how including agricultural extension workers in livelihoods training
affects how they in turn work with ex-combatants and the communities particularly given the
extreme resource challenges for workers in the line ministry. However it is clear that this
inclusion is an important step to building positive working relationships with the ministries that
could yield good outcomes in the future.

3.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
244.    Project preparation and design were responsive to the emerging policy frameworks and
aligned with GoSS strategy in DDR. Project documentation was drafted on time but was not
available in final draft until around the time of the MTR. It is noted that at the time of the final
evaluation project documentation is being redrafted to align with the learning from Phase 1 and
the MTR. The available project documentation had the basic weakness of over-estimating the
impact of the Pilot (for example, as captured in the project objectives) but this has not negatively




                                                                                         Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                          Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    85
     affected implementation or achievement of outputs. Overall, for both Phase 1 and 2 the Project
     Management and M&E of the Project has been of good quality and intensive.

     3.2 Risks and Risk Mitigation
     245.     Overall, the identification of risks has been satisfactory however the risk management
     strategy as mapped out in Project documentation is unsatisfactory and not in sufficient detail. In
     reality when expected and unexpected risks have been encountered the Bank TT has performed
     well and approached the implementation of the Project with patience and in a solutions-orientated
     and problem-solving manner.

     246.     Critically the project underestimated the risk of deteriorating security and political
     situation (rated as ‘Substantial’, lower than the rating ‘High’ as per project documentation) but
     this risk, which is out of the control of the Project has been realized and has stopped
     implementation. Also, the MTR notes that the Project did not identify lack of political buy-in as a
     risk to success or how the lack of progress in SSR might impact on the Project. Phase 3 of the
     Project should clearly orientate itself to actioning two distinct categories of learning: (i) learning
     pertaining to project design and implementation and (ii) learning pertaining to strategic
     engagement in SSR and DDR for the future.

     3.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) by Bank
     247.    As per the MTR the final evaluation finds that the Project M&E framework is a high-
     level design with both Scorecard and ‘Substantive’ indicators relating to progress towards
     achieving the objectives of the Pilot. The indicators are clustered around three outputs:

                (a) State-level operational and technical support: the provision of operational support
                    focused on Greater Bahr el Ghazal to the NDDRC, enabling it to work with line
                    ministries and other partners to facilitate and support project planning,
                    development and implementation processes ensuring that lessons learnt on both
                    process and delivery are identified and captured.
                (b) Agricultural livelihoods: development and implementation of agricultural
                    livelihoods support to ex-combatants that have returned.
                (c) Urban livelihoods: development and implementation of non-agricultural
                    livelihoods support through entrepreneurship, financial literacy and cooperatives
                    training for ex-combatants choosing urban settlement in skills such as carpentry,
                    mechanics, electrical engineering, metal fabrication and construction.

     248.     The MTR findings around the efficacy of the Scorecard indicators, the over-ambitious
     nature of project objectives and the lack of indicators specific to the nature of the Project as a
     pilot project: that is, one orientated towards trialling, learning and innovation were not acted upon.
     Rather Bank M&E consisted of BTOR/AM, improved IA reporting and close monitoring of
     activities on the ground. Practical day-to-day monitoring of Project activities has been strong. The
     Bank TT has reported concisely and effectively and has combined monitoring of Project progress
     with close, effective, on –the-ground implementation support, particularly in the early stages of
     project when delays were being encountered.

     249.    The evaluation re-affirms the finding of the MTR that the project management of the
     Project and the work of the IAs have firmly focused on learning methodologies.




86
3.4 Safeguards including Environmental and Fiduciary Compliance
250.    By incorporating a focus on community-inclusive approaches in its design (Livelihoods
component and dedicated Community Support component) the Project has aligned with the
Conflict Sensitivity guiding principle of the South Sudan National DDR programme:

       (a) It is recognized that the legacy of conflict in South Sudan is such that the entire
           population faces multiple needs and challenges in terms of their recovery and
           development. It is therefore intended that overall DDR programme implementation
           will adopt a community-based approach targeting a number of activities aimed at the
           supporting communities, particularly in areas where high numbers of demobilized
           soldiers will be returning.

251.    The Project aligns with principles of Do No Harm/Conflict Sensitivity and consciously
looks for opportunities to mitigate potential negative effects of the Project. The Project has been
compliant with the 10 Fragile States Principles subscribed to by OECD/DAC donors particularly
Principal 1 (take context as the starting point) in so far as the Project is embedded in the NDDRC
and supports national ownership, and principal 4 (prioritize prevention) and principal 5
(recognize the links between political, security and development objectives) through supporting
reintegration and micro-economic development. Principal 10 (avoid pockets of exclusion) is
implemented through the ex-combatant and community inclusive approach. The Project aligns
with the World Bank approach to fragility and conflict as contained in WDR 2011.

252.     In project documentation the Project identified the need for Environmental Analysis as
the first activity in the Community Support Component. During implementation the IA (IOM)
identified that the component would align with its own UN procedures for ensuring
environmental safeguards and so the Bank TT identified that a full Environmental Analysis was
not necessary.

253.     The principles of Do No Harm/Conflict Sensitivity should be front and centre in any
strategizing by the NDDRC regarding future programming. They should guide thinking that
explicitly addressed the heterogeneity of the ex-combatants that may be targeted in any future
DDR programme. Specifically, the logic that there is one army (SPLM) and that that army is an
army of returned victorious heroes must be deconstructed as plainly that is not the current reality.
The risks of the GoSS strategy of incorporating rebel groups into the national army as a modality
of SSR-DDR must by fully interrogated.

                                                         Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    87
     4. Assessment of Outcomes at time of MTR

     4.1 Relevance of Objectives and Design
     254.    The Project’s objectives and design are relevant to: (i) RoSS DDR strategies and plan; (ii)
     national ownership as a pillar of DDR; (iii) the learning principles of pilot programming, (iv)
     German donor strategy; and (v) the WB MDTF-SS (now closed) and ISN FY 13-14.

     255.   The Project aligned with the RoSS National DDR strategies and papers particularly the
     Republic of South Sudan Policy Paper on Demobilization, Disarmament and Reintegration (23rd
     September, 2011) and the South Sudan National DDR Strategic Plan 2012-2020 (11th March,
     2012).

     256.    Apparent weaknesses in Phase 1 of the Project whereby line ministries were not involved
     in implementation were addressed in Phase 2.

     257.    The design of the Pilot particularly supports engendering national ownership in DDR,
     both by facilitating the NDDRC to assume the decision-making and management role for South
     Sudan DDR and by focusing on building the capacity of the NDDRC.

     258.    The Project is closely related to and benefited from the MDTF-SS that during its
     operation phase 2006 to 2012 supported nationwide the CPA implementation with 21 projects.
     MDTF-SS had five Strategic Priorities of which two were crosscutting: (i) build the capacity of
     the GoSS and (ii) coordinate and align international assistance.

     259.    The Project was interlinked with the MDTF-SS in three ways:

            (a) The Project’s focus on capacity building is in the same spirit of the MDTF-SS that had
                a capacity building element to strengthen state institutions in their governance,
                management, planning and service delivery functions in most of its 21 projects.
            (b) Within its Priority Areas 2 and 3, the MDTF-SS’s funded projects directly supported
                ex-combatants as beneficiaries of training programmes for example the Education
                Rehabilitation Project. Also, the UNDP implemented CPA DDR was co-funded out of
                the MDTF-SS with US$ 36.4 million.
            (c) The Project likely benefits from MDTF-SS support to the general development of
                South Sudan as the economic reintegration of ex-combatants will only be successful if
                they can be absorbed by the local economy. Within its Priority Area 4, the following
                measures were financed: supportive government policy, a legislative framework and
                extension services for a modernized agriculture as well as private sector development.
                This should be especially beneficial for the Projects activities within the Livelihood
                Support Sub-Component.

     4.2 Efficiency
     260.     The Project efficiency in progress made towards achieving its PDO is upgraded from
     moderately satisfactory to satisfactory because of: (i) disbursement has been prompt; (ii) extra
     unplanned outputs under the Community Supports component enabled by cost savings by IOM,
     and (iii) the continued high unit cost per ex-combatant.




88
261.     Disbursement to IPs has been as scheduled. In Phase 1 ASI received all six payments as
per schedule totally US$519,506. UNICON received four of five payments with the fifth pending
contract extension leaving US$162,140 to be paid out of a total contract of US$920,200. The
World Bank disbursed the fifth payment on 24th March 2014 on acceptance of final Phase 1
report. In total at the time of final evaluation eight of nine payments have been disbursed on time
(US$ 1,482,057 of scheduled US$1,531,564). The final payment of US$49,507 is due on
approval of final report that was submitted in draft form during the week ending 5th September
2014. In Phase 1 IOM had two of five payments made with three pending Phase 2 leaving
US$408,563 to be paid on completion of Phase 2 (out of a total contract value of US$450,000).
All payments were disbursed on time in Phase 2. At the time of the final evaluation the total
disbursements to IAs has been US$2,501,070 of US$2,451,563.

262.    The MTR noted that while recognizing that if the Project leads to future programming
there are likely to be economies of scale which reduce the cost per ex-combatant, in Phase 1 the
Project did not compare favourably with other DDR processes when the cost per ex-combatant is
compared. In phase 1 the cost per ex-combatant of all livelihood support was US$2,759.58In
Phase 2 of the 290 ex-combatants in the NDDRC Pilot DDR programme 285 were target with
Project activities (5 had died in the interim period between Phase 1 and Phase 2). Of the 285
targeted 269 received services from the Project. Basing the overall Project cost on the 290 ex-
combatant intake as set against the costs of the Livelihoods Support component then the full
Phase 1 and Phase 2 cost per ex-combatant is US$ 3,750.

263.    The only regional comparisons are with full national DDR programmes so this distorts
the comparative analysis somewhat however the differences with neighbouring DDR costs is still
relevant: the PNDDR (DRC) cost per beneficiary was US$1,817 59 ; the cost of the RDRP
(Rwanda) was US$2,06560 and Burundi $2,77561. The question to the NDDRC is whether the
costs can be reduced should the modalities and focus of the Pilot be brought to scale and where
can savings be made?

4.3 Effectiveness
264.    Effectiveness is the extent to which the Project achieved its planned-for outputs. The
Project has been effective in achieving project outputs as outlined in the Project documentation
and fully examined in Section 2 above.

265.     The Livelihoods Support component (Phases 1 and 2) successfully distributed start-up
kits to the majority of ex-combatants well within the target time of two months. In Phase 1 the
Project also delivered a package of trainings designed to suit the literacy and numeracy skills of
ex-combatants and capitalize on the potential outcomes of their vocational training. In Phase 2 the
Project delivered the planned-for package of additional and supplementary trainings and
livelihood technical supports successfully reaching 269 of 285 ex-combatants targeted in Phase 2.

266.     The Institutional Capacity Building component (Phase 1) has been effective and
produced the planned outputs as well as less tangible (but not less important) outcomes on
institutional knowledge, understanding and behaviour. In Phase 2 the IA from the Livelihood

                                                                   Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    89
     Support component implemented the remaining activities (M&E through South-South exchange
     and logistical support around the ex-combatant Satisfaction Survey). These activities produced
     their planned-for outputs.

     267.    The Community Support Programme was effective and exceeded the planned-for outputs.
     Originally there were 10 planned and the IA installed 16 and rehabilitated one Payam building.
     The additional outputs were secured as originally the IA budgeted for a more sustainable solar
     water pump however communities opted for manual water pumps.62

     4.4 Potential to Grow to Scale and Sustainability
     268.    The Pilot reintegration Project was meant to be a test-run of the programme design’s
     effectiveness in order to learn lessons and modify it prior to replication country-wide. While
     social activities were tested, they have been minimized in the current tranche in favour of finding
     the correct economic reintegration models that can be replicated. Against this background the
     Project has listed the following components to be replicated and scaled in future programming:

            (a) An independently functional management team as well as a management and
                reporting system on HQ and State level;
            (b) A functional ICRS system with trained staff;
            (c) A functional M&E system with trained staff;
            (d) Livelihood support services including individual and group livelihood activities
            (e) Community support projects.

     269.     The final evaluation concludes that all components have the potential to be replicated and
     scaled up (at least in part) in future DDR programming. However, in order to be sustainable and
     effective some will require some additional inputs (like the M&E system) and/or more substantial
     revision.

     270.    The design of the Project emphasized sustainability by approaching the unstated but
     overall purpose of the Project, (that is, to build the capacity of the NDDRC through learning by
     doing and concurrently enhance the capital of the NDDRC to implement an effective and relevant
     reintegration programme) of placing the NDDRC front and centre and emphasising national
     ownership. The Project was designed as a first step on re-enabling the NDDRC post-CPA DDR to
     take that leadership role and so eventually develop and implement a strategic, effective, efficient
     and relevant national DDR programme. Put simply, the point of the Pilot has been to begin
     enabling the NDDRC to assume its role in Reintegration programming in DDR.

     271.    The NDDRC has significantly strengthened its leadership position in the course of the
     Pilot Programme and has assumed a critical role in coordination and project management. Since
     the beginning of the NDDRP the Commission has been actively involved in the strategic
     development of the Programme and its sub-components. Together with the UN, the SPLA, line
     ministries and other DDR stakeholders the Commission has drafted and finalized a National DDR
     Policy, Strategic Plan and National Programme Document that gave critical guidance for the
     implementation of the reinsertion and reintegration sub-component. A Joint Operations
     Coordination Committee that has been chaired by the Commission was set up to control,
     coordinate and monitor reinsertion activities in the transition facility in Mapel which indicates the



     62
       The cost of borehole and solar pump averages US$ 25,000 when compared to US$ 11,000 average for manual
     boreholes and pumps.




90
high level of national ownership. Although the UN took a lead in the implementation of
reinsertion activities, the Commission clearly benefited from its active involvement, was able to
build its capacity and played a key role in oversight. The final evaluation finds similar trends for
the reintegration sub-component. The Project Management Unit (PMU) put the Commission in
the centre of the project and through the ICRS department the NDDRC gained significant
experience on state level in managing livelihood assistance. Important lessons have been learned
that will allow modification of the DDR programme prior to replication country-wide.

272.     Despite these positive trends and a visible and growing involvement of many NDDRC
departments in implementation and oversight there were a range of factors that negatively
influenced the extent to which the NDDRC was capacitated to assume its leadership role thereby
negatively affecting the sustainability of the Project. Due to financial constraints of NDDRC
some of the key positions on national and state level were not filled and as a consequence certain
systems and departments that the Project had planned to leave at its closure (like the State PMUs
and the M&E department). Due to the imbalance in NDDRC’s organisational structure (already
outlined in chapter 2.2) some departments were side-lined resulting in difficulties for the IA to
leave an independently functional management team that is able to run reintegration
programming in future DDR tranches. Not least the lack of support from the GoSS (e.g. the delay
in the establishment of the National DDR Council, lack of interest in DDR on the side of the line
ministries) has exacerbated the Commission’s efforts to guide and implement the Project in a fast
and efficient manner.

273.    Furthermore, a critical challenge to the NDDRC (and so the Project) was how to increase
donor interest to ensure a second round of programming with a view to gradually growing a
national DDR process. At the time of the MTR it was assumed that any successes thus far would
hopefully contribute to donor confidence and interest in aligning behind a next iteration of
Reintegration programming, however, with the outbreak of hostilities mid-December 2013 and
the changes in the internal security environment any progress made on persuading donors to
contribute to future programming was damaged.

274.     At the level of Components, the Project has had dynamics of sustainability. The design of
the Training sub-component in the Livelihoods Support window emphasizes TDRP learning on
supporting ex-combatants to obtain sustainable livelihoods through the provision of generic
business and cooperative working skills that capitalize on already-acquired vocational training.
The unplanned strategy of utilizing TOT methodology had the potential to create a network of
domestic trainers who themselves are capacitated to build a cooperative and do business in South
Sudan. The TOT of the agricultural extension workers in Phase 2 is a positive example that
illustrates how the DDR Programme can build on domestic human resources and utilize them for
training ex-combatants.

275.    The principle of including community members in training has the potential not only to
contribute to social inclusion and mitigate tensions but also has the potential to create more
sustainable units of diverse background and approaches to cooperative working practices. Due to
lack of a Community Tracer Survey the final evaluation cannot assess whether the inclusion of
community members into the trainings supported social inclusion and mitigation of conflicts but
what can be noted is that there is a strong community involvement in livelihood activities
involving ex-combatants (for instance, the 17 working groups that have been listed so far involve
68 ex-combatants and 442 community members).




                                                                                        Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                         Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    91
     276.     The Institutional Capacity Building component focused on creating a baseline for
     sustainable institutional development within the NDDRC to best enable it to assume the role of
     leading on Reintegration programming in DDR and by employing mentoring rather than formal
     training the component approached skills transfer and capacity building in a more gradual,
     collaborative manner which suits the learning style of the Commission. Through the chosen
     approach the Pilot Project has triggered some learning on the side of the Commission especially
     in the field of project management and oversight. Partly stemming from external factors such as
     the outbreak of the conflict the capacity building stopped at a time when the Commission was just
     about to utilise the acquired skills in actual programming. Due to the imminent halt in DDR
     activities after closure of the Project the nascent capacities can most likely not be sustained over
     time.

     277.    The ICRS System that is one element of the Capacity Building component is currently
     inactive. Since the system is only as useful as the data it contains, the ICRS will require
     continuous updates otherwise its sustainability will be highly questionable. In terms of
     replicability the ICRS system would be ready to be utilised in future programming but would
     require some data adjustments.

     278.     By design the Community Supports Project component has emphasized the sustainability
     of the infrastructure to be provided through working with communities to create community
     water committees and if possible generate income through water charges in order to finance the
     servicing of boreholes and pumps. However, the final evaluation finds that the infrastructural
     installations are unlikely to be as sustainable due to quality of outputs. Experience not only from
     South Sudan but also other countries shows that success rates of maintaining hand pumps are
     generally low. Solar powered higher volume water pumps, for instance, would have a longer
     lifespan then the infrastructure that were installed in the Pilot thus mitigating the reluctance of
     communities to charge for water and the difficulties obtaining spare parts.

     279.     Although the Project attempted to enable some community members to independently
     manage and maintain the water installations, it is uncertain to what extent the communities indeed
     follow the suggested approach (this might vary from community to community). According to the
     IA this is not only a particular problem for Projects in South Sudan but also in other countries. As
     a way out and in order to ensure sustainability of water installations, future water community
     projects should ensure that the community agrees to generate income e.g. through water charges
     prior to the Project start. To ensure that this conditionality does not compromise on ownership the
     Project has to grant enough time for community sensitisations.

     280.    In view of the lack of a community tracer study it is also not clear whether the
     Community Projects have helped to foster trust between the ex-combatants and the rest of their
     communities (as stated in the Project objectives). Given the small number of returning ex-
     combatants, their limited engagement in the IA’s community mobilizations and the relatively
     small scale of the Projects the impact will most likely be much lower than expected.

     281.    Further complicating factors negatively impacting on the sustainability of the DDR
     community projects are the manifold social problems within the communities concerned.
     Particularly alcohol abuse appears to be a challenge in the rural areas as it erodes the social fabric
     and significantly hinders the development of coping strategies of the community. For any CDD/R
     project such negative social influences are a significant risk that can jeopardise project success
     and should hence be thoroughly considered in project design and implementation.




92
4.5 Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
282.    The risk to development outcomes is substantial. As has been outlined above the key risk
to the outcomes of the Project has been the security situation in South Sudan that deteriorated to
such an extent that the Pilot was suspended on December 19th 2013. Peace negotiations are
scheduled to recommence in Addis, Ethiopia on September 15th, 2014 but the security situation
remains highly unstable and a humanitarian crisis is unfolding.

283.     During the MTR it was identified that it in order for the NDDRC to build capacity and
improve its reputation it would be critical to maintain the momentum of implementation achieved
during the Project. Given the ongoing mobilization of civilians and violent conflict in the country
it seems inappropriate to initiate any planning for subsequent DDR phases without radically
revising the current DDR approach (and here especially a closer alignment with other SSR
activities). Since most donors, as a reaction to the crisis, have channelled their funding and efforts
to mitigate the humanitarian consequences of the conflict, there appears to be very little openness
to consider any short to medium term funding for DDR/SSR activities. For the Project this is a
severe backlash as the momentum is likely to be lost. There will be a gap in programming which
puts at risk the progress that has been made so far. Especially with regard to the capacity building
that has been done a lot of investment will most likely vanish.




                                                                                         Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                          Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    93
     5. Assessment of Stakeholder Performance
     5.1 Bank Performance
     The performance of the TDRP is assessed here in relation to how it performed as per its
     agreement with the KfW and the NDDRC as providers of Technical Assistance to the NDDRC.
     The Pilot Reintegration Programme does not constitute formal lending from the Bank. The
     Bank’s role is limited to Trust Fund management and provision of Technical Assistance as
     outlined in the agreement.63

     (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
     Rating: Satisfactory
     284.    Quality at Entry pertains to the design of the Project and the performance of the TDRP
     throughout the period of design and implementation. The TDRP performed satisfactorily because:
     (1) by design the project took consideration of the capacity of the NDDRC; (2) it executed its role
     in a manner that was conscious of wider stakeholder roles in the great SSR-DDR environment
     including those of the Line Ministries and the UN family; (3) built on learning from the CPA
     DDR programme; (4) emphasized national ownership.

     285.     By design the Project was simple with straightforward components and sub-components
     and so constituted a measured starting point to assess and gradually build the capacity of the
     NDDRC while concurrently implementing a pilot reintegration programme that was intended to
     benefit the 290 ex-combatants that underwent reintegration assistance. The components
     emphasized procurement, and management and facilitation of external implementing Partners as
     well as assisting the NDDRC to critically reflect on its own internal workings and competencies
     rather than being overly complex.

     286.     Interaction with the wider stakeholder community was carried out in a collaborative
     manner but always with the focus on enabling the NDDRC to lead the Pilot Reintegration project.
     The TDRP often with the assistance of the NDDRC, facilitated networking the IAs (UNICON,
     ASI and IOM) with the key stakeholders in the wider NDDR Pilot Programme such as UNESCO
     and UNMISSS. The TDRP’s own involvement sought to learn from the UN agencies in particular
     and tried to positively guide the NDDRC’s interaction with those same agencies.

     287.   The TDRP’s role in the Project was informed by a good understanding on the history of
     DDR in South Sudan and cognizance of the learning from the CPA DDR. The TDRP’s
     knowledge was assisted by the NDDRC’s self-reflection and own learning from the CPA DDR




     63
        The Project Management here is a combination of the management of the Project by the TDRP, and the work of the
     PMU as a unit constituted within the NDDRC as part of the institutional arrangements to implement the Project.
     The relevant TDRP activities identified in the invitation from the NDDRC to engage around the Project are limited to
     establishing a Technical Support Unit and Project Management Teams and instituting M&E. The agreement between
     the donors (KfW) and the Trust Fund Administrators (TDRP) is more detailed when outlining eligible expenditure and
     identifying the role of the TDRP. Bank-executed Activities consisting of: (1) analyses and studies on regional aspects
     of demobilization and reintegration focusing on such aspects as alien ex-combatants as well as cross-border and cross-
     cutting activities, such as capacity development, research, and evaluation; (2) technical assistance and enhanced
     supervision activities designed to improve quality and knowledge management for demobilization and reintegration;
     and (3) analyses and studies on regional aspects of demobilization and reintegration focusing on gender. Trust Fund
     Management and Administration: establishment and operation of the Trust Fund Technical Team; management of
     the Trust Fund; and supervision as well as monitoring and evaluation of Projects.




94
and from the knowledge shared with the TDRP by the stakeholders in the NDDR Pilot
Programme.

288.     The Bank was appropriately reactive to the deteriorating security situation that forced the
postponement of Phase 2 of the Project. However, the re-start of the Project in May 2014 was at
very short notice affecting the preparation by IAs to implement altered project activities such as
changing the livelihoods training from building on the capacity built with independent trainers in
Phase 1 to focusing on the ICRS team in the NDDRC. Similarly the Bank-led ex-combatant
satisfaction survey (in place of Tracer and Community Dynamics surveys originally planned) was
designed with limited preparatory time.

289.     While the IA and the Bank implemented these activities effectively there should be more
time to reflect on changed design of activities and the reasons for this. Also, the Bank should
afford itself more time to plan such M&E activities as the ex-combatant satisfaction survey. Often
in programming in FCS it is generally accepted that in emergency contexts (such as that in South
Sudan) and because of the context, responsive projects (such as this Project) cannot be afforded
adequate preparation time or space for reflection. This does not have to be the case. Given that
Phase 2 was re-started in a hurried fashion it is important for the Bank with the NDDRC to give
adequate space to Phase 3 (learning) and laying the foundation for effective and efficient
strategizing about potential future SSR-DDR programming in South Sudan.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
290.     Bank supervision in the form of TF management and Project management is rated
satisfactory because: (i) the Bank satisfactorily identified most safeguard issues; (ii) the Project
management by the Bank was responsive to the needs of the NDDRC and the implementation of
the Project, and (iii) the Bank facilitated additional TA and project implementation assistance
although as emphasized above, at times this assistance was operational and not technical
assistance.

291.      The Bank satisfactorily identified safeguard issues and the NDDRC project
documentation clearly identifies the same. In collaboration with the IOM practical and efficient
alternatives to ERM were identified however due to the suspension of the Project these were not
implemented. The Bank closely managed financial risks and where issues emerged between IAs
that were external to the Bank’s own purview the Bank TT worked to support the NDDRC to
facilitate resolving the issues.

292.    Bank supervision was responsive to the needs of the Project, the capacity-issues of the
NDDRC and sought to address implementation delays including those emanating from all IAs.
The Bank TT were closely involved in assisting IAs to become effective when faced with
implementation challenges and throughout the duration of the Pilot Project they were closely
involved with monitoring the progress of IAs.

293.   The final evaluation notes that recommendations around Bank project M&E have not
been implemented and recommends that in future pilot interventions the recommendations of the
MTR on project M&E are given due consideration.

5.2 NDDRC Performance
294.   The NDDRC’s role in the Project was to lead the Project with TA from the TDRP.
Throughout the implementation of the Project the NDDRC engaged positively with the TDRP




                                                                                        Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                         Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    95
     and did so with an emphasis on learning by doing. The NDDRC engaged positively around
     resolving implementation challenges such as those faced around M&E and some IAs becoming
     effective. In the case of the latter the NDDRC facilitated IAs at HQ and State level and where
     particular benefit was identified the Commission sought to capitalize on progress made.

     295.     Throughout the Project the NDDRC was hamstrung by resource challenges and
     challenges from its own institutional arrangements (the latter point being identified by ASI)
     which itself it identified as being unable to alter. Resource challenges were felt across the
     NDDRC but most critically in the States. In HQ very fundamental challenges such as losing
     power when the generator switched off had severe impact on the infrastructure supporting the
     work of the Commission, such as IT and communications. Simply put, no power means little
     work can be undertaken on site. Most critical deprivations have been the lack of human and
     financial capital in the State offices. NDDRC staff in the States performs multiple roles so the
     ability of the NDDRC to capitalize on the activities in Institutional Capacity Building Component
     has been limited. Material resources such as transport, the state of repair of vehicles and
     communications were all severely restricted at State level. This situation has been further
     aggravated by the change in the UNMISS mandate and the consequent withdrawal of the mission
     from any DDR related activities. The NDDRC State offices that were formerly provided with fuel
     and communication systems through UNMISS are now largely inactive due to lack of electricity
     and internet services.

     296.     ASI identified challenges in the institutional arrangements that in the analysis of the IA
     were negatively affecting the ability of the NDDRC to implement learning from the CPA DDR
     and to build capacity and expertise to effectively implement the Project (and future iterations of
     same). From the perspective of the NDDRC institutional arrangements are fixed as a result of the
     Commissions alignment under its respective GoSS ministry. The reality is that challenges to the
     effectiveness of the NDDRC to implement the project resulting from institutional arrangements
     were navigated in part through the creation the PMU. This approach of finding practical
     workaround significantly helped NDDRC to coordinate between its respective departments and to
     take the lead in implementation of reintegration activities in close collaboration with the IAs. The
     PMU, however, also created a parallel structure to the existing institutional arrangements thereby
     unintentionally marginalizing some NDDRC staff during the Project. The marginalization
     occurred both at strategic and at operational levels. In order to avoid such imbalances in future
     iterations it is incumbent on the NDDRC to balance ways of navigating institutional challenges
     with ensuring that staff members are included in the various stages of the Project and future
     iterations.

     297.     The ICRS department has strongly benefited from the Capacity Development activities
     throughout the Pilot Project and has played an outstanding role in the implementation of the
     reintegration sub-component. Taking into account that the ICRS department has been built from
     scratch the achievements are substantial. The ICRS caseworkers have gained significant
     experience in the support of ex-combatants which enables them to attend to programme
     beneficiaries throughout the whole DDR process (registration, data capture, follow-up and
     referral). Because of the involvement of the ICRS unit in extension work and training in Phase 2
     the caseworkers are now also better capacitated to advice ex-combatants on socio-economic
     opportunities than at the Project start. As the database itself is not operative due to lack of
     connectivity on State level, and the financial restrictions and withdrawal of material support
     through UNMISS took effect before the system could be fully rolled out, ICRS has not been
     tested in its final version in day-to-day operations.




96
298.     Over the course of the pilot NDDRC closely engaged with various donors to attract
interest and to ensure funding for subsequent pilot phases. It was assumed that through the gains
made for ex-combatants in Mapel one would also be able to start DDR operations in two more
locations (Torit and Bor). From the beginning donor dialogue turned out to be very challenging
due to the negative perceptions of DDR in South Sudan resulting from the CPA-DDR programme.
Moreover donors were unclear about how the DDR pilot in Mapel would be replicated in other
locations given that NDDRC envisioned different institutional setups for the implementation of
pilot activities in Greater Equatoria and Greater Upper Nile.

299.     NDDRC had a productive collaboration with the involved UN agencies. Particularly
around operations in Mapel NDDRC closely liaised with UNMISS and UNESCO on national and
State level. Through the interaction with the UN the Commission sought to learn and build its
own capacities while ensuring that the programme followed a national strategic vision. As a result
of NDDRC’s challenging financial situation the focus of the interaction with UNMISS often
shifted towards logistical support which was provided by the mission to NDDRC. Against this
background the Commission did not always fully capitalize on the mission’s DDR planning
capacity. At the time of the final evaluation, however, the NDDRC positively acknowledges the
strong technical, logistical and financial support that was provided by the UN in the pilot process
and appears to be determined to continue the collaboration despite the fact that DDR has been
removed from the UNMISS mandate.

300.     Over the course of the Pilot Programme the NDDRC has assumed a strong leadership
role which allowed the Commission to give strategic guidance and to coordinate the various
stakeholders involved. However, the Commission would have been even more effective in taking
the lead on DDR if it had received more political backing from GoSS. For instance, the delay in
government contribution to the programme retarded activities and procurement of items needed to
run operations Mapel. The DDR Council, which was supposed to provide political guidance was
established late and did not meet as often as required. It hence did not give sufficient strategic
guidance and also did not succeed in harmonizing between different national stakeholders in
DDR issues. Because of this lack of harmonization on DDR Council level the NDDRC faced
severe challenges in aligning its Project activities with other national programmes as envisioned
in the National DDR Strategic Plan. Although the line ministries were requested by the DDR
Council to provide a comprehensive and casted programme indicating how each Ministry would
support implementation of the wider DDR Programme, the alignment process turned out to be
very slow and cumbersome.

301.     NDDRC’s cooperation with the Ministry of Defence (MOD), particularly the Directorate
of Veterans Affairs, and the SPLA intensified throughout the pilot process leading to close
interactions between the institutions. However, due to inadequate political guidance through the
DDR Council and the seemingly limited confidence and buy-in of the MOD and the SPLA into
the programme, NDDRC’s efforts to implement the DDR pilot were significantly undermined, as
evidenced by the limited number of DDR candidates that were assigned to go through the DDR
pilot process (only 290 candidates were selected instead of the targeted number of 500 people).

5.3 Performance of Implementing Partners
302.    The Pilot Project had three IAs: ASI, UNICON and IOM.

5.3.1 Adam Smith International and Integrity Research
303.    ASI and IR implemented the Institutional Capacity Building component with IR taking
responsibility for the M&E focus including conducting the Baseline and Community Dynamics




                                                                                       Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                        Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    97
     surveys. At Project start-up ASI and particularly IR showed a lack of preparedness regarding
     project documentation, background and modalities. Despite this ASI implemented the Component
     in an effective manner, adapting to challenges and opportunities as they arose during their
     engagement by the NDDRC. As identified above the ASI methodology was participative,
     inclusive and effective in involving the NDDRC in learning by doing. The mentoring of NDDRC
     staff was context specific and delivered in a manner that was cognizant of the fundamental task of
     the NDDRC: reintegrating ex-combatants in line with the South Sudan National DDR Strategy
     (2012 – 2020). ASI also undertook the mentoring process with a strong orientation towards
     programmatic and institutional learning in line with the Project’s overall rationale as a pilot
     project. ASI’s reporting was consistent and succinct during the Project and added to the value of
     the Project as a learning process.

     304.    Initially, deliverables from IR were of poor quality. While implemented effectively on the
     ground the Baseline report from IR lacked analysis and was not confident in its own methodology,
     tools or approach – something that fundamentally undermined the validity of the findings. The
     Baseline report repeatedly applied conditionality to its analysis and undermined any conclusions
     that might be drawn from the work. IR recovered from this poor start somewhat with an improved
     report for the Community Dynamics study but the report still lacked sufficient quality analysis
     and quality. As noted above the M&E manual was also of poor quality.

     305.    Overall the potential institutional impact of implementing Baseline and Community
     Dynamics studies was undermined by the absence of an M&E unit during the initial stages of the
     Project. This similarly prevented the IA delivering capacity development in M&E. This
     essentially null level capacity prevented the principle of integrating the study of impact to create a
     feedback loop for future programming or program delivery taking root in any significant way in
     the NDDRC. This presents a missed opportunity.

     5.3.2. UNICON
     306.     Initially in Phase 1UNICON displayed poor project preparation. As discussed above the
     IA encountered barriers to effectiveness such as lack of institutional presence in South Sudan and
     limited knowledge of operating in South Sudan or of the operational context there. Despite a poor
     start to the Project UNICON through its perseverance and allocation of extra resources to the
     Project successfully addressed the barriers to implementation.

     307.    In Phase 1 UNICON’s reporting displayed strong M&E and an orientation towards the
     Project as a learning process. By the suspension of the Project UNICON had successfully
     delivered its project outputs but due firstly to issues with the delivery chain involving CRADA
     and second due to challenges receiving quality reporting from the field the delivery of training in
     the community was not possible to verify or correctly assess. In response to this UNICON has
     documented challenges obtaining accurate in field reporting from implementers of sub-
     components.

     308.    In Phase 2 UNICON actioned its own institutional learning from Phase 1 from all aspects
     of Component design and implementation as well as learning on general operational issues in
     South Sudan. The IA improved on already strong M&E emphasising actionable learning for both
     the current Project and future DDR programming in South Sudan.

     309.   Throughout the Project communications from UNICON have been succinct and
     comprehensive.




98
5.3.3. IOM
310.     Generally, IOM engaged well with the Project and exceed delivery.

311.     In Phase 1 IOM faced significant implementation challenges mostly because of access
restrictions to the selected Project sites because of the rainy season and the challenging road
network in South Sudan. Despite these delays in construction and the Project suspension due to
the outbreak of hostilities IOM in the end delivered the component in an effective manner and
was able to successfully deliver (and even exceed) the project outputs within the agreed
timeframe.

312.     Monitoring and reporting on activities and outputs were concise, intelligible and on time.
The collaboration with the NDDRC on national and State level was described by the involved
stakeholders as constructive but was at times hampered by NDDRC’s challenging recourse
situation which aggravated joint supervision of the community projects.64




64
  Although the Project provided funds in the IOM budget for allocation to the DDR Commission for supervision of
community support projects and other project related expenses, these funds were only transferred to the NDDRC at a
very late stage of the Project. In the beginning IOM was not provided with sufficient information on how to administer
the funds to the Commission (see 2014. IOM Final Project Report).




                                                                                                  Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                   Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    99
      6. Conclusions and Recommendations
      313.     Findings and recommendations are presented below and as follows: (i) as they relate to
      the context of the Project and the wider strategic environment and (ii) as they relate to the Project
      design and outcomes of each Component. Where relevant mention is made of whether or to what
      extent recommendations from the MTR have been acted upon.

      6.1 Project Context and Strategic Environment
      314.    Conclusion 1. The success of the Project as a pilot testing the systems and institutional
      arrangements which are required to implement Reintegration programming, is overshadowed by
      the wider political, security and donor environment.

      315.     High-level macro-level issues such as the current security situation in the country and the
      ongoing talks aimed at resolving the conflict and finding a path to stabilise the situation throw
      into doubt the future of DDR and SSR in South Sudan. Through the CPA DDR and through the
      NDDRC Pilot DDR programme (with which the Project has been aligned) there has been a
      substantial resource allocation to DDR, however, on the macro-level the outcomes of such
      activity and resource allocation are unclear.

      316.    Until there is clear buy-in from all relevant stakeholders into both DDR and SSR the
      NDDRC and other stakeholders are critically hamstrung with progressing the objectives of DDR
      programming (understood as either the beneficiary-focused outcomes of the Project or the macro
      objectives of a full DDR programme).

      317.    From the perspective of the Project objectives, the MTR noted that the ability to keep up
      the momentum of the gains made during the Project, particularly in institutional performance and
      capacity building was critical to the success of the Project. It observed that the suspension of the
      project would likely result in a dissipation of capacity built and a loss of momentum. It is clear
      from the evaluation that this conclusion from the MTR has been realised and momentum has been
      lost however, in the wider scenario it is critical that the NDDRC, its partners and the donor
      community engage around the importance of DDR and SSR and strategize effectively around
      future DDR programming in South Sudan.

      318.    It should be noted that the MTR concluded it is critical that any future DDR
      programming is linked on a strategic level to wider SSR so that project achievements are not lost
      due to lack of progress elsewhere in the broader strategic environment and so that the DDR
      programme can align and have currency with SSR. This conclusion is supported by the final
      evaluation.

      319.     Timing will be essential for future DDR programming: The past shows that the CPA
      DDR programme was significantly delayed due to several factors, amongst them limited buy-in
      of the military and political leadership, and, crucially, a lack of internal consensus on, what DDR
      in South Sudan ideally should look like. DDR was perceived more as a risk to security than a
      factor contributing to stability. Partly, this limited support of SSR processes and the very
      cumbersome reform of the security sector have played a part in creating the current situation in
      South Sudan. If it does not seriously attending to DDR-related issues early enough in the peace
      talks in Addis Ababa, the GoSS risks replicating the mistakes of the CPA DDR programme.

      320.  Recommendation 1a.The NDDRC and relevant key stakeholders work with the donor
      community to engage the GoSS and the parties to the Addis negotiations, when possible, around




100
the importance of DDR and SSR to future stabilization programming in South Sudan. The
NDDRC has and is engaging government however the onus to engage must be shared by the
international donor community and based on a coherent, realisable vision of DDR and SSR.
Donors must engage the GoSS to engender clear, evidenced support of DDR and SSR in order for
any future programming to succeed.

321.    Recommendation 1b. The NDDRC is supported in the current modality to lead with the
convening of ‘inclusive enough coalitions’ of key stakeholders (including stakeholders such as
the leadership of the SPLA and other organised forces as well as forces in opposition, the UN and
other partner institutions experiences with DDR/SSR processes in South Sudan, and civil society
representatives) to participate in the range of steps necessary to create a comprehensive and
coherent DDR architecture in South Sudan and to advocate with GoSS for such architecture to be
enabled.

322.    DDR architectures are informed by bringing diverse aspects of stabilisation (including
SSR) and development programmes and principles together into a common understanding and
approach. Furthermore DDR architectures are processes: they change over time depending on the
stage of design and implementation. Critically, in order to put design into practice DDR
architectures must be suited to the fluid but specific circumstances of national and local
conditions.

323.     Despite the progress being made through the Project DDR still appears to exist in an
isolated area of programming and this isolation must be bridged. The first step is alignment with
agreed SSR programming and the second is to align DDR though dialogue with other
development programming particularly around community driven development or infrastructure
projects in communities. In the long term the DDR programme has to ensure that there is a
national forum in place, like for instance, the National DDR Council, to continue strategizing on
DDR programming on highest political level. The DDR Council, if it is to be replicated in future,
has to be more functional than in the past and provide the necessary political and strategic
guidance that is needed to align DDR with other development programmes. GoSS should also
consider having members of the international community at the Council for advice and
transparency.

324.    Recommendation 1c. In the short to medium term specifically the NDDRC must draw
together an inclusive-enough coalition of thought partners to conceptualise the DDR process
including reintegration. This coalition must reach out to all parties to the Addis negotiations and
acknowledge that the current situation in South Sudan requires fundamental changes in DDR and
SSR programming. It should be supported by an adequate technical secretariat that has
outstanding experience with DDR and SSR processes and should be flexible enough to evolve
when and if DDR shifts from strategy and design to actual programming with clear, measurable
outcomes. !

325.    Recommendation 1d. In the interim and during negotiations the NDDRC should not be
allowed to stagnate: the donor community and technical partners should work to address the
issues highlighted through the Project (particularly dissipation of institutional capacity and the
imbalance in organisational structure) thus ensuring readiness for future programme
implementation. The NDDRC and its partners should take a highly strategic approach to the
development of a comprehensive DDR strategy, fully conscious of Do No Harm approaches and
with realisable programmatic dynamics.




                                                                                        Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                         Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    101
      326.   Conclusion 2. The wider donor environment and the UN mandate do not appear
      conducive to DDR and SSR.

      327.    Recommendation 2. While there has been parallel work on SSR the current donor focus
      and that of the UN is largely on the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan. It is critical that the
      NDDRC and its partners work to sensitise the donor community regarding the importance of
      DDR – SSR in future development in South Sudan and the significance of integrating these
      themes into the peace talks in Addis Ababa. A prerequisite for this kind of sensitisation is strong
      government and military buy-in into the DDR programme at the highest levels of leadership.65

      328.     Conclusion 3. UNESCO has completed an impact assessment of its activities in Mapel
      TF in October 2013 66 but due to the outbreak of the crisis in December 2013 and the
      reprioritisation of the UNMISS mandate the final and overall evaluation of the Mapel TF pilot
      was put on hold.

      329.    Recommendation 3. The overall evaluation is important and so some formal and
      independent review should be conducted in order to capture lessons learned67 which will inform
      reorientation of potential future DDR phases.

      330.    Conclusion 4. The MTR recommended that future programming should be designed in
      such a way so that the GoSS should be required to commit to increased financing of the NDDRC
      and the NDDRC to commit to appropriately resourcing itself in material and in human resources.

      331.    Recommendation 4. The final evaluation reinforces the recommendation of the MTR
      (above, conclusion 4) and restates that GoSS commitment to DDR must be underscored by
      material support of the NDDRC and openness to institutional reform of the organisation in line
      with the findings of the Project.

      6.2 Project Design and Outcomes
      332.    Conclusion 5. The Project is a pilot and as such learning from the pilot is relevant to
      stakeholders and partners outside the NDDRC and to the staff of the Commission.

      333.     Recommendation 5. The NDDRC should disseminate a summary document of the final
      evaluation to relevant stakeholders and partners and critically, to NDDRC staff. NDDRC staff
      should also be provided with other materials that have been developed throughout the Pilot
      Project.

      334.   Conclusion 6. Reinsertion and reintegration were largely treated as two distinct
      programme components in the alignment between the Project and the wider pilot in Mapel TF.

      335.   Recommendation 6. In reality reinsertion and reintegration programming are intertwined.
      They should hence be dealt with in a more comprehensive manner in future programme iterations.




      65
         The lack of buy-in of the SPLA, other organised forces and the government into the DDR programme has been
      frequently criticised by donors in the past.
      66
         See Impact Evaluation: Integrated Literacy & Life Skills Development Mapel, Western Bahr el Ghazal, October 2013.
      67
         An internal draft lessons learned document has been produced by the NDDRC and its partners but was not finalised
      due to the outbreak of the crisis.




102
336.    Conclusion 7. The MTR concluded that in Phase 1 regarding M&E of the Project, many
of the Project objectives are over ambitious and/or vague. This remained the case in Phase 2 so at
the time of the final evaluation this conclusion remains valid.

337.     Recommendation 7. The MTR recommended that in future programming the M&E
Framework utilised by the Bank should be revised based on the learning from implementing the
Project. Particularly, the ambition of indicators should be aligned with more realistic expectations
of activities under the various Project Components and all ambiguous language should be avoided.
This was not actioned in Phase 2 and so should be actioned in future programming.

338.    Conclusion 8. The MTR concluded that regarding M&E of the Project the M&E
Framework does not contain indicators specific to the nature of the Pilot as a learning process
orientated towards trialling, documenting, learning and innovation. This remained the case
through Phase 2 and so at the time of the final evaluation this conclusion remains valid.

339.     Recommendation 8. The MTR recommended that in future pilot programming this must
be addressed so as to properly monitor the performance of the Project and its stakeholders and in
order to maximize any gains from Project learning. At the time of final evaluation this remains a
valid recommendation.

340.     Conclusion 9. The MTR concluded that the Project design has aligned with all relevant
safeguards including: (i) the Conflict Sensitivity Principle of the South Sudan National DDR
programme; (ii) principles of Do No Harm, and (iii) World Bank approach to Conflict and
Fragility as contained in the WDR 2011. This remained the case through Phase 2. At the time of
final evaluation this remains a valid conclusion.

341.     Recommendation 9. The MTR recommended that this good practice should be
replicated in all future programming and this recommendation remains valid. Furthermore it
should inform centrally any future DDR programme strategising by the NDDRC particularly as it
considers the heterogeneity of the ex-combatant population that will likely need to be considered
for DDR in the future.

342.     Conclusion 10. The Project has been efficient however, efficiency is compromised by the
cost per beneficiary which exceeds that in other national DDR programmes.

343.    Recommendation 10. When estimating the impact on future programming economies of
scale should considered and where possible the cost per beneficiary reduced. Efficiency should be
a core principle brought to bear when assessing the wider DDR architecture and modalities
including the use of transition facilities

344.    Conclusion 11. By design and during implementation the Project sought to engage the
wider stakeholders in DDR in South Sudan including those in the UN family.

345.    Recommendation 11. In future programming this approach should be built upon with
particular emphasis on re-engaging Line Ministries (particularly as they pertain to assisting in
community-based reintegration or support of Income Generating Activities (IGAs)/economic
cooperatives), and assisting the NDDRC and UN family to greater share expertise and resources
particularly those within the DDR unit in UNMISS. The UN should be included in any ‘inclusive
enough coalition’ strategizing about the future of DDR in South Sudan and inputting into future
programme design.

                                                         Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    103
      346.    Conclusion 12. The Project did not address Public Information, Procurement, Gender or
      Disability management capacity at the NDDRC.

      347.   Recommendation 12. In any future programming these functions must be
      comprehensively audited and addressed.

      348.     Conclusion 13. The MTR noted that the Project and the NDDRC itself was constrained
      by a lack of human resources. This continued for Phase 2 and was exacerbated by staff churn/loss
      of staff. The evaluation concludes that until this human resource factor and the drivers of staff
      churn are addressed they will restrict the ability of the NDDRC to function and to capitalize on
      the outcomes of the Project or any future Project.

      349.    Recommendation 13. The NDDRC should address the organisational weaknesses
      highlighted in Phase 1 by ASI and should engage GoSS when possible around the punctual
      payment of staff salaries. It should not exacerbate organisational imbalance if employing PMUs
      or SPMUs in the future. When addressing stability and skills in the organisation the NDDRC
      should pay particular attention to the situation with the M&E department throughout the Project
      which because of a lack of staff seriously undermined any outcome from any M&E capacity
      building activities (Phase 1 or Phase 2).

      350.     Conclusion 14. The MTR concluded that in Component 1: Livelihood Supports Sub-
      Component 1 (Start-up Kits) the Project largely delivered its required outputs by providing high
      quality start-up kits to nearly all ex-combatants in Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Western Bahr el
      Ghazal, Warrap and Lakes (with some remaining in Lakes State NDDRC offices). It did so in a
      timely fashion and the performance far exceeded that recorded in the CPA DDR. At the time of
      the final evaluation this conclusion remains valid.

      351.     Recommendation 14. In future programming the modalities utilized by the IA and the
      market intelligence in their reporting as well as the suggested improvements through lessons
      learned should be fully utilized by the NDDRC when designing and managing the procurement of
      start-up kits. At the time of the final evaluation this recommendation remains valid.

      352.    Conclusion 15. The MTR found that the participative methodology of the IA delivering
      Component 2 in Phase 1 suited the culture of the NDDRC. At the time of final evaluation this
      conclusion remains valid.

      353.     Recommendation 15. The MTR recommended that any future programming or Phase 2
      activities delivering capacity building should utilise a similar approach of embedded mentoring
      rather than formal training. Furthermore this methodology should be correctly timed and matched
      with sufficient resources (including human resources, that is, staff) by the NDDRC so as to
      maximize outcomes from such programme. At the time of final evaluation this recommendation
      remains valid.

      354.     Conclusion 16. As a result of the fairly loose design of Phase 2 as well as the infrequent
      meeting schedule of the DDR Council which was meant to link the NDDRC and the line
      Ministries around DDR, the commission’s cooperation with the Ministries, particularly on State
      level, has not been adequately formalised.

      355.    Recommendation 16. In order to avoid reputational risks for NDDRC it will be essential
      in future DDR programming to further formalise implementation arrangements with the State




104
Line Ministries (especially around the formation of cooperatives and distribution of land to ex-
combatants).

356.   Conclusion 17. The training of trainers that were provided to agricultural extension
workers and ICRS staff (on entrepreneurship and financial literacy) has increased the pool of
domestic trainers that is available to train ex-combatants. The focus on the ICRS caseworkers,
however, further aggravates the institutional imbalance within NDDRC.

357.    Recommendation 17. Future TOTs should be sensitive to the institutional imbalance
within and should base the selection of trainers on a thorough skills assessment.

358.     Conclusion 18. A great number of ex-combatants is still utilising their toolkits. A point
of critique was that the toolkits in parts did not match to the tools used during the trainings in
Mapel.

359.     Recommendation 18. In future iterations of the DDR Programme the procuring agency
for the toolkits should consult with the trainers delivering the vocational trainings concerning the
content of the toolkits prior to the start of the trainings. The same toolkits that will be provided to
XCs should also be utilised in the vocational trainings.

360.    Conclusion 19. A majority of ex-combatants is seemingly still working in the same
vocation they were taught in Mapel (especially those in agriculture) but success rates greatly vary
from vocation to vocation.

361.     Recommendation 19. In future programming vocational trainings have to be more
closely linked to the market realities in South Sudan.


362.     Conclusion 20. A number of lessons from the CPA DDR programme were not learned
(or applied in the pilot) including e.g. the lack of proper market analysis for the vocational skills
training.


363.    Recommendation 20. Future programming needs to base its approaches and modalities
on the lessons learned that have been collected in the frame of the Project and the CPA DDR
Programme.


364.    Conclusion 21. Given the increased involvement of ex-combatants in cooperative work,
the business, financial literacy and cooperative trainings appear to have been effective in
promoting group livelihood activities and imparting knowledge on the formation of cooperatives
and associations. Despite these positive trends the concept of cooperative/associations seems to
be ambiguous and requires clarification (e.g. in some instances groups that were registered as
cooperatives and received benefits did not match the official definition of a cooperative)

365.    Recommendation 21. For future DDR programming clearer guidelines on cooperative
work have to be in place, agreed upon and implemented by all national stakeholders involved in
order to ensure an equal distribution of benefits. While less formalised groups should continue to
be encouraged, the programme has to clearly spell out the criteria groups need to fulfil in order to




                                                                                          Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot

      receive certain cooperative benefits. Against this background the NDDRC should engage the line
      ministries around what constitutes an association vs. cooperative and initiate discussions around
      which groups can be registered as cooperatives (and whether line ministries accept lower
      numbers for certain vocations) and who is eligible for extra materials or assets from the GoSS via
      the NDDRC.

      366.    Conclusion 22. Although the community projects have brought a positive change for the
      target communities, the potential impact of this sub-component was overestimated in all project
      documentation and M&E frameworks. It appears that the communities concerned are only to
      some degree able to draw a connection between the implemented community project and the
      assimilation of returning ex-combatants and the work of NDDRC.

      367.    Recommendation 22. In future programming involving community-based reintegration
      serious consideration should be given to increasing the resources available for community support
      projects in order to achieve relevant impacts with regard to peace building and bringing a peace
      dividend However, given the fact that the costs per ex-combatant are already quite high future
      programme iterations should consider to focus reintegration assistance on individual support
      measures (that also benefit the community) while closely aligning the project to other CDD or
      CBR-type projects separate from DDR which could have equivalent impacts to that originally
      envisioned for the community support sub-component.

      368.     Conclusion 23. The Project’s aspiration to strengthen community empowerment and
      self-reliance was compromised by design because of the restricted number of Project types.

      369.   Recommendation 23. Should the community Support Component be replicated in future,
      the Programme should consider increasing the number of Project types the community can
      choose from to enhance ownership. The selection process, however, needs to be closely guided
      and monitored to ensure democratic and inclusive decision making processes in the community.
      However, recommendation 22 should have priority over this recommendation.

                                                      Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic of South Sudan New NDDR Programme    117
      Annex 4: Methodological Note
      The external final evaluation used a standard methodology of: (i) comprehensive document
      review; (ii) qualitative key informant interviews (KIIs); (iii) qualitative focus group discussions
      with community members and ex-combatants (FGDs) as well as with some staff of the NDDRC,
      (iv) ongoing data triangulation with emerging reporting from the NDDRC, the TDRP and the IAs
      involved in implementation.

      Fieldwork for the evaluation took place between 11thAugust and 29thAugust 2014 with site visits
      to Juba (Central Equatoria State) and Wau (Western Bahr el Ghazal State) South Sudan. In Jur
      River County two community projects were visited in Roch Rochdog Payam and Marial Bai
      Payam where FGDs were held with community members and KIIs with community leaders.
      Installation of hand pumps and drilled boreholes were visually confirmed in both locations but an
      expert technical assessment of the infrastructure was not undertaken.

      The evaluation is built upon the MTR (November 2013 to February 2014). The MTR provides
      one pillar of the analytical framework informing consultations and analysis with project
      documentation (original and revised and including the ex-combatant satisfaction survey) and IA
      reporting constituting the other pillar. Triangulation of the analytical framework with data
      compiled during the field phase and in subsequent KIIs was completed by 11thSeptember, 2014.
      The format of the MTR report provides the format for the final evaluation. The final evaluation
      should be read in conjunction with the MTR.

      Limitations encountered during the inception phase of the evaluation were as follows:

          (a) Logistical: the lack of availability of UN flights due to how the UN mandate no longer
              includes DDR and consequently that the Commission is no longer able to access flights
              through the UN;
          (b) Availability of some key informants, mainly the IOM where the two informants are
              currently on leave;
          (c) Unclear security situation in Western Bahr el Ghazal and Lakes State: although the
              situation in and around Wau town (risk level 3) appears to be stable the GIZ risk
              management office (RMO) advised the consultants to minimize road movements and to
              restrict the planned consultations to Wau town. Regarding the security situation in
              Rumbek and its surrounding Payams the consultants received contradictory information
              from various sources. Due to the higher risk level in the State (level 4) the GIZ RMO
              likewise advised to limit activities to Rumbek centre. Since the situation in Lakes State
              remains unstable, further and sudden outbreaks of violence are possible which might
              endanger the planned mission to Rumbek. The consultants will continue to monitor the
              situation by closely liaising with the UNMISS field security coordination office and GIZ
              RMO. During field work the security situation in Rumbek deteriorated and in
              consultation with the relevant parties the team decided not to travel there.

      Executive Summary
      Project Background
      1.      The DDR Pilot Reintegration Project was implemented between June 2013 and
      December 19th 2013 the latter date marking the Project suspension in response to the deteriorated
      security environment in RoSS. Originally the Project was intended to run for 1 year until June
      2014. The Project was implemented in a complex context including the local political economy,
      the programme history (which was dominated by the legacy of the preceding CPA DDR process),
      the wider policy environment of the national DDR strategy and supporting national DDR Council
      decrees and SSDDRC strategic plan, and the immediate implementation environment where the
      DDR Pilot Reintegration Project fit with the wider NDDR Pilot Programme hosted at Mapel
      Transition Facility.

      2.      The original Development Objectives of the Project include (i) socio-economic pilot
      objectives, and (ii) reintegration programme, systems and learning objectives.

      3.      The socio-economic objectives of the pilot are:

             (a) To provide ex-combatants with skills enabling and enhancing their livelihood
                 opportunities in communities of return;

             (b) To facilitate the social reintegration of ex-combatants.

      4.      The reintegration programme, systems and learning objectives are as follows:

             (a) Develop lessons learned that can be applied to future South Sudan DDR
                 programming;

             (b) Develop and instill a system of DDR Reintegration Management in South Sudan that
                 can live beyond the life of the pilot project.

      5.      The main beneficiaries of the project are: the 290 ex-combatants who received
      Reintegration supports through the Project as well as community members in the communities of
      return where training was delivered in cooperative working and where ten Community Based
      Reintegration activities (bore-hole installation and one Payam rehabilitation) were planned to take
      place.

      6.       The Project had four official components: (i) Livelihood Support which had two sub-
      components: (a) 1: Start-Up Kits, and (b) Training; (ii) Institutional Capacity Building; (iii) M&E,
      and (iv) DDR Community Support Projects. While not identified as such the Project also had a
      fourth component: Project Management and NDDRC Support (US$ 130,000) which finances the
      operational costs to the NDDRC and included the (no-cost to the Project) Technical Assistance
      (TA) provided by the TDRP.

      7.      The MTR was conducted in November and December 2013 in RoSS with additional
      consultations in the United Kingdom. The MTR included a verification mission from Juba to
      Wau and Kuajok, 42 unique consultations, many of which were then followed up with repeat
      consultations. The MTR also included an extensive review of project documentation and the




122
outputs of all Implementing Partners. The preliminary analysis of the MTR was presented at KfW
in Berlin, Germany on December 2nd 2013.

Summary of Findings
8.       In summary, the MTR finds that with regards to the expected achievements of the core
three Project components the following outputs were identified. At the time of MTR the start-up
kits had been procured and distributed to State offices in a prompt and efficient manner. In
Northern Bahr el Ghazal State all kits had been distributed, in Western Bahr el Ghazal State 3 of
92 kits remained to be collected, in Warrap State 4 of 75 kits remained to be collected and in
Lakes 10 of 91 remained to be collected, after a delay in distribution largely as a result of difficult
moving in the rainy season.

9.       Training of 290 ex-combatants in the 15 modules of the curriculum(which was drafted in
advance and then finalized in Mapel Transition Facility) took place over 10 days and in a total of
60 hours commencing 2nd September 2013 and ending 11th September 2013. Training in the
States after graduation is more difficult to verify because of limitations on record keeping. The IA
reports that training in the States after graduation was delivered to 253 ex-combatants (87 percent
of the total 290) and to 284 community members. This quantitative data has not been possible to
independently verify for the MTR.

10.      Seven team members from the IA including the Team Leader who doubled as the
Principle Capacity Building Mentor, implemented institutional capacity building. The total time
spent in field directly engaging with the NDDRC in HQ and in the State offices in Greater Bahr el
Ghazal (Aweil, Kuajok, Rumbek, Wau) was 35 working days by each of the four State mentors
and 66 days by the TL/Principle Mentor. The Component produced a variety of outputs that are
documented in the MTR as well as strong shifts in institutional confidence and understanding in
the NDDRC.

11.      Community Support Projects were contracted in two phases and while progress
implementing community-based reintegration activities was limited at the time of the MTR in
part because of difficulty working in the rainy season the IA had completed most activities in
Phase 1. As part of the Project suspension the Component was suspended having produced the
following outputs: (i) PIP; (ii) selection of communities (based on criteria agreed with NDDRC),
and (iii) selection of contractors through the tendering process.

12.      Project Management and Project Support has enabled the implementation of the Project
and created additional project management structures in the NDDRC. Specifically the following
have been created: (i) Reintegration Project Steering Committee (SC); (ii) HQ PMU, and (iii)
State Level PMUs (SPMUs). The NDDRC with the assistance of the TDRP established the PMU,
which meets weekly and comprises the representative staff from all units within the NDDRC. The
SC has met three times thus far and the TCC while not part of the overall support of the Project to
the NDDRC brings together the major stakeholders including the UN family and meets regularly.
At the time of the MTR SPMUs were not functional.

13.      The MTR finds that the following outcomes (outcomes can be understood as the shifts in
institutional behavior and knowledge because of the Project) have resulted from the Project. The
outcomes of Livelihood Supports component include: (i) documented learning regarding how an
IA can effectively operate in the complex environment of South Sudan in all aspects of design,
procurement, transportation and distribution; (ii) documented learning regarding how the IA can
better manage knowledge acquisition and quality control reporting from the field, and (iii)

      evidence that if implemented well, Reintegration programming can deliver material assistance in
      the form of tool kits in a timely manner thus increasing confidence in the effectiveness of
      Reintegration programming, and as a consequence, increase in the confidence of the NDDRC to
      manage the processes behind the delivery of material support to ex-combatants. Pending
      confirmation through a Tracer study, it appears that for now there is an interest and receptiveness
      by ex-combatants to receive training on entrepreneurship, financial literacy and business skills.

      14.     By design the Institutional Capacity Building Component resulted in more numerous
      knowledge outcomes and altered institutional behavior. The main outcomes include: (i) increased
      awareness in management and key staff of the institutional challenges facing the Commission and
      some strategies to begin addressing same; (ii) a greater understanding of the need to action
      learning from the CPA and from this first Pilot; (iii) a positive shift in confidence in the NDDRC
      regarding the capacity for project implementation; and (iv) a reconstituted M&E department.

      15.      The MTR finds that the Project has produced certain outcomes coherent with it being a
      pilot; that is, a learning process. By design the Project is clearly orientated towards capturing
      learning and it is clear that the NDDRC is eager to learn by doing but requires more time,
      financing and human capacity to actually engage fully to implement learning at strategic and
      operational levels.

      16.      The MTR finds that the Project’s objectives and design are relevant to: (i) RoSS DDR
      strategies and plan; (ii) national ownership as a pillar of DDR; (iii) the learning principles of pilot
      programming, and (iv) German donor strategy and the MDTF-SS. The Project aligns with the
      RoSS National DDR strategies and papers particularly the Republic of South Sudan Policy Paper
      on Demobilization, Disarmament and Reintegration (23rd September, 2011) and the South Sudan
      National DDR Strategic Plan 2012-2020 (11th March, 2012). The design of the Project supports
      engendering national ownership in DDR, both by facilitating the NDDRC to assume the
      decision-making and management role for South Sudan DDR.

      17.      The MTR finds that the project’s efficiency is moderately satisfactory because: (i)
      disbursement was largely on target despite implementation delays; (ii) low budget costs for each
      Project component; (iii) high unit cost per ex-combatant. Recognizing that if the Project leads to a
      larger project there are likely to be economies of scale that reduce the cost per ex-combatant, still
      the Project does not compare favorably in costs with other DDR processes in neighbouring
      countries. The MTR finds that the Project has been effective in achieving project outputs as
      outlined in the Project documentation and fully examined in the report body below. Prior to its
      suspension the Project was making progress towards achieving the Pilot objectives.

      18.      In summary, the MTR makes the following specific findings that in Section 6 of the MTR
      report are complemented by at least one recommendation per finding.

      19.      Conclusion 1. Prior to its suspension the Project was performing well, and showing
      strong progress on two of three sub-components as well as a variety of outcomes addressing
      institutional knowledge, learning, project management and capacity. The suspension of the
      Project removes what the MTR identifies as critical to the future success of the Project: the ability
      to keep up the momentum of the gains made during the Project, particularly in institutional
      performance and capacity building. Much momentum is likely to have been lost.

      20.      Conclusion 2. Prior to its suspension the Project was restricted by two broad set of
      factors: (i) material and human resources at the NDDRC, and (ii) the wider strategic context of




124
the SSR process in South Sudan. In the first instance the NDDRC was severely constrained by a
lack of material resources and financing so that everyday performance was restricted while
concurrently (and particularly in the States) the NDDRC was constrained by a lack of human
resources with insufficient staffing in the States and some spoilers in the HQ offices.

21.      Conclusion 2a. While the MTR has focused on the program performance aspects of the
Project it is clear to all stakeholders that the Project along with the wider NDDRC Pilot
Programme at Mapel Transitional Facility was severely hamstrung through lack of buy-in from
the SPLA and likely from lack of confidence or progress in wider SSR in South Sudan.

22.    Conclusion 3. Rather than the outcomes for ex-combatants who have participated in the
programming, the focus of the Project on piloting systems, capacity building, project
implementation and institutional development dictate the best areas for examining the potential
outcomes of the Project and gauging the performance of the Project and the Project Implementers.
However, this focus is not reflected Project documentation or M&E frameworks.

23.      Conclusion 4. In Component 1: Livelihood Supports Sub-Component 1 (Start-up Kits)
the Project largely delivered its required outputs by providing high quality start-up kits to nearly
all ex-combatants in Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Western Bahr el Ghazal and Warrap and (with
some remaining in Lakes State NDDRC offices. It did so in a timely fashion and the performance
far exceeded that recorded in the CPA DDR.

24.     Conclusion 5. Component 1: Livelihood Supports under the Sub-Component 2: Training,
the Project delivered a tailor-made curriculum and 60 hours of training comprised of 27 hours of
Financial Literacy and 33 hours on Entrepreneurship to 290 ex-combatants. However significant
challenges were encountered in the delivering the curriculum due to the low literacy and
numeracy levels of ex-combatants. While the curriculum was adjusted to take account of this the
effectiveness of training may have been compromised at least as held to account to the original
expected outcomes of the Component.

25.      Conclusion 6. Component 2: Institutional Capacity Building. M&E capacity building
was seriously undermined by lack of appropriate staff in the NDDRC. This was subsequently
resolved but too late for progress on the building of M&E capacity in the Commission during the
Project.

26.      Conclusion 7. The participative methodology of the IA delivering Component 2 suited
the culture of the NDDRC.

27.     Conclusion 8. One of the Project indicators of success was positive change in the
confidence held by the community and ex-combatants in DDR programming and the work of the
NDDRC, but there were no activities or metrics to measure this.

28.     Conclusion 9. As a pilot the Project, the TDRP, the NDDRC and IAs were all clearly
orientated towards learning and knowledge capture.

29.    Conclusion 10. Regarding M&E of the Project, many of the Project objectives are over
ambitious and/or vague.

      30.     Conclusion 10a. Regarding M&E of the Project, the M&E Framework does not contain
      indicators specific to the nature of the Project as a learning process orientated towards trialing,
      documenting, learning and innovation.

      31.    Conclusion 11. The Project design has aligned with all relevant safeguards including: (i)
      the Conflict Sensitivity Principle of the South Sudan’s National DDR programme; (ii) principles
      of Do No Harm, and (iii) World Bank approach to Conflict and Fragility as contained in the
      WDR 2011.

      32.     Conclusion 12. By design the Project has emphasized sustainability: (i) by approaching
      building the capacity of the NDDRC through learning by doing, (ii) by IAs incorporating
      sustainability into the design of Component 2 (Trainer for Trainers methodology) and Component
      3 (use of VDCs).

      33.   Conclusion 13. The potential impact of Component 3 was overestimated in all project
      documentation and M&E frameworks.

      34.    Conclusion 14. The Project is efficient with costs minimized and very little remaining
      room for reducing costs further. However, efficiency is compromised by the cost per beneficiary
      which exceeds that in other national DDR programmes.

      35.   Conclusion 15. Delivery chains were a key weakness in the delivery of activities in
      Component 2, Sub-component 2 and compounded the negative effect of some factors affecting
      implementation such as lack of preparedness of IPs and lack of understanding of the political
      economy of RoSS.

      36.     Conclusion 16. By design and during implementation the Project sought to engage the
      wider stakeholders in DDR in South Sudan including those in the UN family.

      37.     Conclusion 17. Throughout the Project the TDRP’s role shifted from providing TA to
      providing operational assistance.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1Project Context
38.     The DDR Pilot Reintegration Project1 has a complex context consisting of: (i) the
external political economy and country context; (ii) the program context, principally the
preceding national DDR process implemented by UN Agencies on behalf of the NDDRC2; (iii)
policy context (South Sudan National DDR Strategy 2012 - 2020), and (iv) the implementation
environment where the DDR Pilot Reintegration Project must relate to the wider NDDR Pilot
Programme housed at Mapel Transition Facility.

39.     The Republic of South Sudan (RoSS) became an independent country on the 9th July,
2011 on foot of a peaceful referendum earlier that year held between the 9th and 15th of January.
The referendum followed the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the
Government of National Unity (GoNU) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM).

40.      RoSS is a new country without a history of formal institutions and public administrations
and so it is building national institutions, administrative bodies and practices for the first time.
Economically, RoSS is largely undeveloped and characterised as county with largely
undiversified, highly oil dependent and subsistence economy.3 The institutions of the State that
currently are being built include those to guide the economic development of the country and to
provide services to the general population. They also include the national institution for
Demobilisation, Disarmament and Reintegration (DDR) programming, the National DDR
Commission (NDDRC). Economically the RoSS has been hampered by austerity as a result of oil
flow stoppages, high inflation, currency depreciation and high reliance on imported food and
commodities.

41.      Leaving aside the deterioration of the security situation in RoSS since mid-December
2013 the development challenges for RoSS are substantial. Compounded by recent violence and
instability RoSS has very low literacy, particularly outside urban areas and for females, low life
expectancy and high infant mortality.4 Very little infrastructural development has occurred
outside of Juba and transport links including those between RoSS and neighbouring countries,
particularly those upon which RoSS is reliant for imports, for example, Uganda and Kenya.
Consequently the external environment within which the Project has been implemented is
characterised by limited economic opportunities, severe development challenges and conflict
stressors all of which can mitigate against the achievement of development objectives in a DDR
project.

  In 2010 RoSS was the most oil-dependent country in the world with oil exports accounting for 80% of gross domestic
product (GDP). In 2012 Gross National Income (GNI) was US$650 largely because of the significant income outflows
to oil companies (WDR 2013). Outside of oil livelihoods are largely concentrated in subsistence agriculture and
pastoralism. At the time of the MTR in the national media the President of RoSS has indicated that the country’s two-
year-old austerity budget of restricted government spending will be lifted by mid 2014 as a result of increased oil
productivity and export.

                                                                                                     Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                            Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic ff South Sudan New NDDR Programme - Annex A    127
      42.      At the time of writing of the MTR during December 2013 RoSS succumbed to a serious
      deterioration in the security and political situation in the country. Over the weekend of December
      15th fighting broke out between elements of the SPLA barracked in Juba. The conflict quickly
      developed into a civil conflict resulting in unconfirmed civilian and military casualties and
      creating anything between 500,000 and 1 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). During
      January 2014 the GoSS signed agreements on cessation of hostilities with both the SPLM in
      Opposition (SPLM-O) and the South Sudan Democratic Movement/Defence Army (SSDM/A) to
      begin to bring fighting throughout South Sudan (and in the case of SSDM/A in Jonglei state in
      particular) to an end.

      43.      The CPA DDR dominates the historical program context. As a consequence the Project is
      tasked with overcoming a negative hangover from the recognised under-performance of the CPA
      DDR process. Specifically, the challenges that have resulted from this CPA DDR hangover have
      included ensuring buy-in from the SPLA. However, the focus of the Project on piloting systems,
      capacity building and implementation arrangements (including institutional arrangements) means
      that primarily systems, capacities and institutional arrangements are the areas in which the
      performance of the Project can be gauged, rather than the outcomes for ex-combatants who have
      participated in the programme. The MTR notes that this distinction is not adequately reflected in
      the Project objectives.

      44.       The immediate implementation environment for the Project consists of the wider NDDR
      Pilot Programme.5 The NDDR Pilot Programme pilot consists of all elements in the DDR pilot as
      it is focused on the time spent in the Transition Facility at Mapel including: profiling,
      verification, processing, accommodating, reinsertion activities, vocational training, life skills, and
      literacy/numeracy training and psychosocial supports delivered to ex-combatants. The MTR notes
      that in its official project documentation the Project does not adequately explore how it is
      intended to fit with the NDDR Pilot Programme other than stating that the Project is intended to
      align with the strategic objectives of the NDDR Pilot Programme.6 However in reality, the Project
      was deliberately aligned (in design and implementation) with the NDDR Pilot Programme,
      particularly around the purchase and distribution of start-up kits and the development and
      delivery of the training curriculum. The Project World Bank TT, consultants and IAs all sought to
      work in varying degrees in collaboration with the implementers of NDDR Pilot Programme,
      mainly UNMISS and UNESCO. The MTR finds that at the time of the MTR the Project had
      begun to positively influence the reconfiguration of relationships between the NDDRC and the
      UN agencies above, something that is likely to be critical to the sustainability of the outcomes of
      the NDDR Pilot Programme or building on future programming or a Phase 2.

      45.     The Project is conceptualized first and foremost as a pilot in order to capture learning
      about implementation, project design, national capacity and to test the institutional systems
      necessary to implement and upscale reintegration programming to a national DDR programme.

        Objective 1: To contribute to the reduction of the size of the SPLA/SSAF and other organized forces by 150,000
      individuals; Objective 2: To assist ex-combatants to reintegrate socially into communities of return; Objective 3: To
      increase employability and livelihood opportunities for ex-combatants in communities of return; Objective 4: To
      facilitate the release, return and reintegration of Children Associated with Armed Forces and Groups (CAAF/G) to their
      families and communities of return; Objective 5: To support social and economic reintegration of Women Associated
      with Armed Forces and Groups (WAAF/G) through community-based programmes; Objective 6: To strengthen the
      capabilities of the NDDRC, associated Line Ministries, South Sudanese civil society and the local private sector to
      effectively support service delivery to the people of South Sudan. NDDRC, [project doc]: 6.

Consequently while the performance of the Project can be measured against the achievements of
the Project Development Objectives it can also be measured against the degree to which learning
is being acquired and is likely to be utilised.

1.2. Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators
46.     The original Project Development Objectives are identified as: (i) socio-economic pilot
objectives, and (ii) reintegration programme, systems and learning objectives.

47.      The socio-economic objectives of the Project are:

            (a) To provide ex-combatants with skills enabling and enhancing their livelihood
                opportunities in communities of return;
            (b) To facilitate the social reintegration of ex-combatants.

48.      The reintegration programme, systems and learning objectives are as follows:

            (a) Develop lessons learned that can be applied to future South Sudan DDR
                programming;
            (b) Develop and instill a system of DDR Reintegration Management in South Sudan
                that can live beyond the life of the pilot project.

49.      The Project does not have prescribed Key Performance Indicators at Project level.

1.3 Intended Main Beneficiaries
50.      The main beneficiaries of the project are: the 290 ex-combatants who received
Reintegration supports through the Project. Originally, the intended beneficiaries were 500 ex-
combatants who were anticipated to be entered into the NDDR Pilot Programme. As a result of
the failure of the NDDR Pilot Programme to secure the target case-load of 500 ex-combatants or
to secure the target case-load as it was originally profiled for the NDDR Pilot Programme the
profile of the final main beneficiaries was not as specific as originally anticipated and the number
not as high as planned.

51.     The Project also targets members of communities of return both through community
inclusive reintegration activities (Component 3) and through inclusion in extended reintegration
supports around forming economic cooperatives (Component 2).

1.4 Original Project Components and Outputs
52.     The original project components are outlined in the Project Documentation and along
with Project outputs are discussed below.

Project Component: Livelihood Support (US$ 800,200 Implemented by UNICON)7
53.      The Livelihood Support Component consisted of procurement and distribution of start-up
kits (Subcomponent 1) and design and delivery of training to ex-combatants in Mapel Transition
Facility and follow-up support delivered to ex-combatants and community members
simultaneously to support the formation of economic cooperatives at community level. For
overall management of the Component and the Start-up Kits sub-component UNICON deployed
a Project Lead, Project Manager, Livelihoods Training Specialist, Start-Up Kit Manager and a


7
Component costs from initial contract plus extensions for Phase 1.




                                                                                                      Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot

      Procurement Specialist. To deliver the Training sub-component UNICON deployed 10 trainers to
      conduct training in Mapel TF and 4 state managers and 8 state trainers to conduct the training in
      communities of return.

      Project Component: Livelihood Support Subcomponent 1: Start-Up Kits (US$ 323,100)
      54.      UNICON in alignment with the NDDRC provided eight start-up kits all of which were
      prepared with the engagement of The Ministry of Labour and the Ministry’s Multipurpose
      Training Centres (MTCs) and FAO and with on the ground consultation with Mapel TF
      UNESCO Vocational Trainers.8 UNICON followed a clear and comprehensive bid process with
      an 18-day turn-around between issuing Request for Quotations (RFQ) and opening of bids on
      September 30th 2013.9 Contracts with successful suppliers were signed on October 1st and goods
      were planned to arrive in Juba approximately on 14th October 2013 with distribution to the State
      offices by the end of October 2013. To a large extent this timeline was met with only a seven-day
      delay period resulting from flooding which hampered the roll out in some of the States. At time of
      writing distribution of start-up kits from State offices is as follows:10

      Table 1. Start-up Kit Distribution

      Project Component: Livelihood Support Sub-Component 2: Training (US$ 477,100)
      55.     As outlined in the Project document Livelihood Support through Training was to be
      delivered in four areas:

                   (a)    Cooperatives/associations;
                   (b)   Small farm or rural enterprise training;
                   (c)   Individual micro-enterprise business training, and
                   (d)    Adult or formal education.

      56.      The curriculum as developed by the IA while on the ground in Mapel Transition Facility
      delivered 15 modules and split the training between the modules delivered in the Transition
      Facility and further training in situ in communities of return delivered to both ex-combatants and
      community members working together in associations or in preparation to work as a
      cooperative.11

58.     As conceived in the Project Document the expected outcomes of the activities in this
Sub-Component are simultaneously highly ambitious and overly difficult to measure so the
degree to which the Sub-Component has achieved or was on course to achieve its outcomes is
unclear.12Training of 290 ex-combatants in the 15 modules of the curriculum took place over 10
days and in a total of 60 hours commencing 2nd September 2013 and ending 11th September 2013.
Training in the States after graduation is more difficult to verify because of limitations on record
keeping and differences between testimony collected for the MTR and data provided to the IA by
the Trainers. The IA reports that training in the States after graduation was delivered to 253 ex-
combatants (87 percent of the total 290) and to 284 community members as follows (table 2).
This has not been possible to independently verify for the MTR.

59.      The percentage of community members included in State trainings is well within the
Project Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of twenty percent however there is little gender
balance with women comprising 1 percent of the overall ex-combatant trainee complement but
which reflects the proportion of women ex-combatants who underwent DDR at the Mapel
Transition Facility (12). The actual impact of this training is not possible to gauge at present but
indications of possible future impact would have been available following the Tracer and
Community Dynamics follow-up studies in April 2014.

Project Component: Institutional Capacity Building (USD 519,506 Implemented by ASI with
IR)13
60.      Institutional Capacity building was implemented by Adam Smith International (ASI) with
Integrity Research (IR) providing services for capacity building on M&E systems. In total ASI
and IR deployed seven team members in the area of capacity building including the Team Leader
who doubled as the Principle Capacity Building Mentor. The total time spent in field directly
engaging with the NDDRC in HQ and in the State offices in greater Bahr el Ghazal (Aweil,
Kuajok, Rumbek, Wau) was 35 working days by each of the four State mentors and 66 days by
the TL/Principle Mentor. As per the TOR to the Implementing Partner (IP) the outputs from
ASI/IR for the period of the consultancy have been:

      61.     The M&E activities of Project Component 1 included M&E capacity building to the
      NDDRC and conducting Baseline and Community Dynamics surveys utilizing the human
      capacity of the NDDRC (ICRS case-workers as enumerators).

      62.     Regarding the Baseline and Community Dynamics surveys ASI worked with IR to
      produce the studies. For the Baseline study of all 290 combatants ASI/IR followed the following
      timetable:

                  (a)   Trained enumerators/ICRS case workers (July 2nd to July 4th, 2013)
                  (b)   Conducted baseline survey (July 6th to July 15th, 2013)

                  (d)   Reporting

      Project Component: DDR Community Support Projects (USD 155,750 Implemented by
      IOM)
      63.     The stated goal of the Project Component is “to promote peace building in the four States
      where ex-combatants will reintegrate through a focus on community empowerment and self-
      reliance.”15 It is also intended to “test the direct community support mechanism” for future DDR
      tranches.16 In addition to its goal this Project Component has two objectives:

                  (a) From a macro perspective at a State level: demonstrate both the NDDRC’s
                      commitment to the larger community through the delivery of these 12 construction
                      or rehabilitation of infrastructure projects (three in each State) and accountability
                      among all parties;
                  (b) From a micro-perspective: strengthen trust and cooperation between all parties

      64.      At time of MTR the outputs of this Component have been:

                  (a) PIP;
                  (b) Selection of Communities (based on criteria agreed with NDDRC);
                  (c) Selection of Contractors through the Tendering Process.

      65.      To date the implementation of the Component has been limited to the Site Selection
      Phase and some Community Mobilization and the Tendering Process. Construction was delayed
      due to the rainy season. At the time of the MTR and prior to the suspension of the Project it was

planned to implement 10 projects (9 boreholes and one Payam building rehabilitation) in the
following locations:

          (a)   Western Bahr el Ghazal State (4 Projects)
          (b)   Lakes States (3 Projects)
          (c)   Warrap State (2 Projects)
          (d)   Northern Bahr el Ghazal State (1 Project)

66.      The design of the component has an emphasis on sustainability through the formation of
community water management committees however both the experience of IOM during the CPA
DDR (which identified that there were difficulties maintaining and charging for the water
services) and the model of borehole/water pumps being used (manual compared to solar power)
point to the high risks to the sustainability of the water infrastructure post-completion.

Project Component: Project Management and NDDRC Support (US$ 130,000)
67.      While not described as a Project Component in the Project documentation the Project has
an envisaged management structure comprising: (i) Reintegration Project Steering Committee
(SC); (ii) HQ PMU, and (iii) State Level PMUs (SPMUs) and the Project should interact with the
Technical Coordination Committee (TCC) for the overall work in NDDRC Pilot DDR project.
The NDDRC with the assistance of the TDRP has established the PMU, which meets weekly and
comprises the representative staff from all units within the NDDRC. The SC has met three times
thus far and the TCC while not part of the overall support of the Project to the NDDRC brings
together the major stakeholders including the UN family and meets regularly.

      2. Project Outcomes

      68.      Following is an examination of Project outcomes to date. Outcomes differ from outputs in
      so far as they are the short to medium term changes that follow on from Project activities and the
      production of outputs. Implicitly the Project is designed so that Project outcomes fall into three
      broad categories:

                (a) The knowledge transferred and so behaviour changed (institutionally and in project
                    design, management and implementation);
                (b) The difference made as a result of the NDDRC (hopefully) acquiring greater
                    knowledge about project design, management and implementation, and
                (c) The difference made in the lives of beneficiaries; that is, in the lives of ex-
                    combatants and their communities.

      69.      It can be argued that if successful, eventually the overall outcome of the Project should
      have been greater than the sum of its parts. In other words if the Project was successful then the
      longer term outcome flowing from knowledge transferred (not just through capacity building
      activities by the IP but also through other dynamics of project design and implementation such as
      the experience of implementation, TA by the Bank and the knowledge acquired by non-capacity
      building IPs) will result in concrete changes in the institutional behaviour and performance of the
      NDDRC, which in turn will influence the design, implementation and success of a future national
      DDR programme as well as the buy-in and confidence of the GoSS and SSAF.

      70.      This points to the basic and generic (but in the case of the Project, unwritten) logic model
      that can be applied to the Project design: by design, the Project when complete should have
      achieved the short-term outcomes of a positive shift in knowledge in the NDDRC and providing
      the Commission with systems or institutional arrangements that should enable it to implement
      knowledge acquired and positively change its institutional performance in the next Reintegration
      Project. At the time of the MTR the early stage of knowledge acquisition and the links between
      knowledge and changes in institutional behaviour and performance are not clear. The scale of the
      institutional development that is required to enable the Commission to implement a national DDR
      programme is substantial. Despite this the sum short term-outcome of the Project is a diverse
      body of knowledge and changed institutional arrangements, mainly the PMU.

      71.      A major challenge to the success of the Project has been finding a functioning recipient
      for the knowledge acquired during implementation, whether the appropriate institutional body (a
      PMU, for example), the appropriate individual (a technical or managerial staff member) or the
      appropriate institutional system (comprehensive M&E or Reintegration programming).

      72.      While some newly constituted layers in the Commission are performing (PMU, see
      above) the Project needs to remain objective about these structures and interrogate their
      effectiveness and suitability in principle to a larger national DDR programme in order to clearly
      identify what systems or changes have the greatest chance of surviving post-Project

      73.      There are examples of the challenge of finding a home in the NDDRC for knowledge
      acquired during implementation of the Project. For example, the Project has managed to procure,
      transport and distribute high quality reintegration kits to ex-combatants in a timely manner and
      with clear and transparent procurement systems. The challenge is to enable the NDDRC in the
      future to manage an IA to complete required tasks to a similar or better level of performance. At




134
present it is not clear where the repository lies for actionable knowledge around managing such a
process.

74.    Similarly the Project has managed to run Baseline Ex-combatant and Community
Dynamics studies but it is not evident where the capacity to manage such a process lies in the
NDDRC. And it is not clear how the principles of impact measurement as realized in Baseline,
Community Dynamics or Tracer surveys can be translated by the NDDRC into Reintegration
programming, monitoring and evaluation or sensitization and outreach.

75.      Put simply, at the time of the MTR it was unclear how everything achieved to date (and
that was likely to be achieved by the end of the Project) would fit together to have a longer-term
outcome on either the NDDRC (institutionally or systems) or on Project design and
implementation. This is particularly the case when many of the key pieces (such as particular staff
members) have been missing or replaced during the Project. While the NDDRC has lead the
Project and has constituted new management structures to implement the Project the progress in
Project implementation has relied upon intense and embedded operational support of the TDRP.
Prior to the suspension of the Project it was clearly too early to withdraw that support without
jeopardizing what is arguably the unwritten priority objective of the Project: the creation of
systems and institutional capacity that will persist into the medium to long term. However if
future programming occurs or a Phase 2 there is a clear need for the TDRP to have a clear exit
strategy at Project start-up that best supports the achievement of the development objectives in a
sustainable manner.

2.1. Livelihood Supports
76.        At the time of MTR the outcomes of Livelihood Supports component are:

              (a) Learning regarding how an IA can effectively operate in the complex environment
                  of South Sudan in all aspects of design, procurement, transportation and
                  distribution;
              (b) Learning regarding how the IA can better manage knowledge acquisition and
                  quality control reporting from the field;
              (c) Evidence that if implemented well, Reintegration programming can deliver
                  material assistance in the form of tool kits in a timely manner thus increasing
                  confidence in the effectiveness of Reintegration programming, and as a
                  consequence, increase in the confidence of the NDDRC to manage the processes
                  behind the delivery of material support to ex-combatants.

77.      Regarding learning documenting how an IA can effectively operate in the complex
environment of South Sudan in all aspects of design, procurement, transportation and distribution,
despite implementation challenges the IA has been strongly learning-focused. In the case of the
Start-up Kits sub-component UNICON has delivered high quality reporting that details the steps
in design, procurement, transportation and distribution, and that profiles successful and
unsuccessful bidders and other external Partners involved in the implementation of the sub-
component.17 Effectively this reporting constitutes a mini-procurement and distribution manual
with market intelligence for the NDDRC to implement future similar sub-components.

      78.      Regarding learning targeting how an IA can better manage knowledge acquisition and
      quality control reporting from the field, UNICON has worked with overly and unnecessarily
      complicated implementation arrangements, contracting CRADA, a South Sudanese NGO to
      deliver the training sub-component and encountering significant personnel, quality, and
      contracting issues with the NGO.18 Contracting CRADA appeared to be a way of replicating
      UNICON’s operating model in other countries. However, the approach put a poorly performing
      organization and poorly performing CEO between UNICON and the independent trainers who
      were contracted to deliver training to ex-combatants and the communities. Consequently
      communications with the key personnel on the ground were mediated by a poorly performing
      organization, which it was incorrectly assumed would employ its own staff to deliver training.
      Consequently intelligence from the field as to the effectiveness of training and dynamics in the
      delivery of outputs on the ground was interrupted and reporting from the field not to the standard
      expected by UNICON. The IA has indicated that recommendations regarding this issue are being
      considered as it finalizes its own end reporting to the NDDRC and the TRDP.

      79.      Regarding providing evidence that if implemented well, Reintegration programming can
      deliver material assistance in the form of tool kits in a timely manner thus increasing confidence
      in the effectiveness of Reintegration programming, and as a consequence, increasing confidence
      in the NDDRC; at present there is no evidence for this outcome. Presently there are no surveys of
      perceptions in key stakeholders in the GoSS or SPLA or of ex-combatants regarding emerging
      shifts in perceptions of competency of the NDDRC and confidence in DDR as part of or linked to
      wider SSR. Regarding shifts that may occur in the perceptions and confidence held by ex-
      combatants and community members questions were not included in the Baseline and
      Community Dynamics surveys and so should be in future iterations. Increase in confidence in
      DDR, Reintegration programming and the NDDRC are critical to the future role of the NDDRC
      and future DDR programming in partnership with of SSR.

      2.2. Institutional Capacity Building
      80.    The Institutional Capacity Building component has focused on knowledge acquisition,
      knowledge and skills transfer (from the consultants to the NDDRC) and the nascent emergence of
      new systems and ways of working in the NDDRC. By design it should have produced difficult to
      measure but critical shifts in the institutional behaviour of the NDDRC. At the time of MTR the
      key knowledge, skills and behavioural outcomes of the Component are:

                     (a) Aggregate knowledge products which while listed above as outputs in aggregate
                         form a greater knowledge bank;
                     (b) Increased awareness in management and key staff of the institutional challenges
                         facing the Commission and some strategies to begin addressing same;
                     (c) A greater understanding of the need to action learning from the CPA and from this
                         Project;
                     (d) Positive shift in confidence in the NDDRC regarding the capacity for project
                         implementation;
                     (e) Nascent understanding of key systems required for successful operation
                         particularly internal (within HQ and between HQ and State offices) such as
                         communications; operational planning; human capacity, and monitoring and
                         evaluation;
                     (f) Reconstituted M&E department in NDDRC.


      18
           See Section 3 below.




136
81.      The IA produced a body of knowledge products which together cover key areas of
institutional development. When understood alongside the outcomes of the one-to-one mentoring
(mainly points b, c and e above) there is the beginnings of a shift in institutional culture and
practice which if capitalized upon is likely to return dividends in the medium to long term.
However, capitalizing upon this emerging cultural shift is a long and complicated process. At the
time of the MTR the NDDRC acquired a greater understanding of the full extent of the journey
ahead both in terms of required institutional development and required programme
design/implementation. Critically, the NDDRC is aware of the need to action historical learning
including that from the CPA and that from this project.

82.      Despite these challenges the main outcomes from the Project components are: (i)
organizational shift in the NDDRC M&E unit; (ii) mapping of institutional barriers to improving
the performance of the NDDRC; (iii) capacity changes throughout the NDDRC in key areas such
as operational planning, the work of the PMUs, and formalization of job roles and descriptions;
(iv) nascent improvements in connectivity and information flow between HQ and State Offices,
(v) recommendations pertaining to the way forward for capacity building the NDDRC and critical
areas that need to be addressed including relationships with external partners including UN
agencies (UNMISS, UNDP and UNESCO), (VI) fast track the development of ICRS, (VII) core
team has been trained on the successful delivery of reintegration components and ICRS.

83.      The MTR finds that the ASI methodology was participative, inclusive and effective in
involving the NDDRC in learning by doing. The mentoring of NDDRC staff including the
Chairperson, the Director for Reintegration and the State staff was context specific, that is, it was
situated within a strong understanding of the operational context of the NDDRC and was
delivered in a manner that was cognizant of the fundamental task of the NDDRC: reintegrating
ex-combatants in line with the South Sudan National DDR Strategy (2012 – 2020). ASI/IR also
undertook the mentoring process with a strong orientation towards programmatic and institutional
learning in line with the Project’s overall rationale as a pilot. ASI/IR have documented a wide
selection of areas to be addressed in any future iteration of the Component.19

2.3 DDR Community Support Projects
84.      At the time of the MTR there are no project outcomes from the DDR Community
Supports Projects due to implementation delays stemming from disruption of transport links as a
result of the rains and the suspension of the Project on December 19th, 2013.

2.4 Performance of the Project as a pilot: learning and knowledge acquisition
85.      As a pilot there are certain outcomes that should be expected including actionable
learning regarding implementation, political economy/implementation environment; performance
of stakeholders and future or follow-on project design. In design the Project is clearly orientated
towards capturing learning in all these areas and the Bank TT has worked with IAs to ensure they
are also orientated in that direction. It is clear from the significant amount of practical learning
acquired that the NDDRC is eager to learn by doing but requires more time, financing and human
capacity to actually engage fully to implement learning at strategic and operational levels. The
challenge to the Project has been to ensure that as it progresses all relevant learning is
communicated clearly within the NDDRC and that staff are engaged. Shared learning must be

      understood by the NDDRC as an opportunity to re-engage implementing partners, particularly in
      the UN family, in this knowledge-orientated project. Critically, the methodologies used in the
      Pilot, particularly by the IAs should be replicated in future programming by the NDDRC.
      Ultimately the challenge to the NDDRC is to action the learning it is acquiring: in other words,
      learning should be reflexive and should practically inform the next phase of the Project and
      subsequent programme design.

3. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
86.      At the time of MTR the Project was on course to meet its project objectives. It was on
course to achieve these project objectives despite early implementation challenges in what is now
identified as Phase 1 of the pilot. However, progress that has been made towards outcomes faces
clear institutional and external environmental challenges and the ability of the Project to deliver
reintegration opportunities and to provide a meaningful kick-start to what is hoped will become a
national DDR process is seriously challenged by the external environment, particularly the
security and political environment.

87.     The challenges met by the Pilot can be classified as either: (i) directly related to the
Project design and implementation or as (ii) emanating from or being part of the external strategic,
operational and physical environment.

88.      In summary, the challenges that are directly related to Project design and implementation
and which have affected the overall implementation of the Project or which are affecting or likely
to affect the Project outcomes are as follows. The factors negatively affecting the Project
outcomes are:

          (a)   Design limitations including internal coherence, timing and use of delivery chains;
          (b)   Delays arising with IAs becoming effective and/or beginning implementation;
          (c)   Quality of some outputs, and
          (d)   Capacity (human, skills and resource) within the NDDRC.

89.     The factors positively affecting the Project outcomes are:

          (a)   Fit with the NDDRC Pilot DDR Programme;
          (b)   Strong relationship between the TDRP and BICC;
          (c)   Positive relationships between the TDRP and UN agencies;
          (d)   Close project management and operational involvement of the TDRP;
          (e)   Underestimation of the level of involvement required and knock-on effects on
                TDRP’s ability to respond to IAs in a timely manner.

90.       While generally well designed the Project has design limitations negatively affecting the
achievement of outcomes. At the time of MTR the project timeline has limited the achievement of
outputs and outcomes and has complicated the Pilot design. The Pilot was initiated in line with
the intake of the first tranche of ex-combatants to the wider NDDRC Pilot DDR Programme,
which occurred during the time of year when normally ex-combatants would tend their
agricultural land. The planned time for ex-combatants to be in Mapel Transition Facility was
three months however some were on site for up to five months. When ex-combatants graduated
from Mapel Transition Facility they did so during rainy season when transport is difficult and in
the case of Lakes State unfeasible in many locations. From the perspective of maximising the
ability of ex-combatants to put into practice their entrepreneurship and cooperatives training the
Pilot is likely to have benefited from better timing so as not to clash with when gardens are
tended. With graduation happening during the rainy season many ex-combatants from Lakes
State (see above) were been unable to collect their start-up kits and there have been logistical
issues getting trainers to communities of return to complete their training of ex-combatants and
community members in cooperative working.




                                                                                           Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                  Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic ff South Sudan New NDDR Programme - Annex A    139
      91.      In general the Project has strong external relevance to the strategic context and the needs
      of the NDDRC but it does have internal coherence challenges that appear to stem from trying to
      implement too diverse a range of activities with very limited funds. Internal coherence challenges
      appear to be around the delivery of limited Community Supports Projects (CSPs). While the
      capacity of the IA appears strong the budget line for CSPs is limited, the Project document
      overstates the likely achievements of the component and the documentation is somewhat over
      aspirational about the usefulness of such a limited intervention.

      92.     Delivery chains in DDR relate to the layers of implementers employed to deliver services
      to ex-combatants or the communities of return. In the case of the Pilot and as a result of lack of
      familiarity with the operating context one IA (UNICON) implemented the Training sub-
      component with an overly complicated structure and with an implementer who proved
      problematic in how it has treated the Trainers it hired. Had UNICON better understood the
      environment including service providers and trainers or had it been more embedded in South
      Sudan before the Pilot start-up then delivery could have been simplified and the barriers
      encountered could have been avoided.

      93.      At the beginning of the Pilot UNICON encountered other barriers to implementation. The
      main barriers to the IP becoming effective were lack of experience, lack of institutional presence
      in South Sudan and limited knowledge of operating in South Sudan or of the operational context
      there. The poor content quality of the initial project documentation produced by the IA reflected a
      lack of preparedness. Because of these barriers initial implementation of the Livelihood Supports
      Component was delayed and there was an urgent and immediate high risk that the achievement of
      outputs of both sub-components would be negatively affected. However the IP benefitted from
      extra time allowed for implementation by the Trust Fund (TF) extension to September 2013.

      94.      Despite this difficult start the IP addressed the barriers to implementation by locating
      increased human and capital resources in South Sudan and being present on the ground during
      procurement, transportation and distribution. UNICON deployed additional staff to implement the
      training curriculum in Mapel and engaged additional 10 trainers to deliver the follow-up training
      en site in communities of return.

      95.      During distribution the IA was physically assisted by TDRP staff and consultants to
      distribute kits at State level and as is discussed below the Bank TT actively facilitated
      introductions of UNICON to other relevant organizations including the wider NDDRC Pilot DDR
      Programme partners in order to ensure the effectiveness of this component.

      96.     The turn-around in UNICON’s performance was critical to the success of this sub-
      component. The distribution of kits and the involvement of stakeholders (which can be improved
      upon) hugely improved on the provision of start-up kits carried out during the CPA DDR process
      in terms of timeliness (ex-combatants were provided with start-up kits within one month of
      formally graduating from the Mapel TF as compared to nine months in the CPA DDR) as well as
      bringing State ministries on board with kit design as outlined above.

      97.      The outcome of the Project Component Institutional Capacity Building is difficult to
      quantify primarily because: (i) the weak institutional capacity in the NDDRC with which the IP
      was met resulted in the mentors engaging at a low level and in some cases with units in the
      NDDRC which were not fully functional or which do not have adequate staffing, and (ii) timing,
      logistics and staffing challenges that were not unique to ASI/IR which limited the degree to
      which ASI/IR M&E consultants could coordinate activities with other IAs and the NDDRC. In




140
particular the planned mentoring of the M&E unit failed because of spoilers in the then staff of
the unit in the NDDRC. An alternative strategy was developed by ASI/IR, which is to produce an
M&E manual to be used in HQ and State Offices.20

98.      The one aspect of ASI delivery that was clearly weak was reporting on the Baseline ex-
combatant survey. The Baseline survey report appeared hastily put together and had limited
analytical content. TDRP and NDDRC comments to the IA resulted in revised versions but from
the trajectory of IR engagement on the Pilot it appears that internal staffing and roles were not
appropriately aligned in the inception phase. This was partially rectified later during survey
administration and the production of the Community Survey report. The M&E manual produced
by IR was not optimal and required additional input before being acceptable as a potentially
useful tool for the NDDRC. At the time of the MTR the NDDRC does not have the capacity to
manage or quality assure future impact orientated studies such as the planned Tracer in 2014.

99.      The Project was explicitly designed to begin addressing the capacity challenges within
the NDDRC: one Component explicitly addresses this issue as does the methodology applied by
the Bank TT in closely working with the NDDRC on Project design and implementation. This
cooperation was intended to ensure the implementation of the Project and create structures within
the Commission that would simultaneously ensure the implementation of the Pilot while
contributing to the creation of effective project management systems. While there are questions
raised by ASI in its remit as capacity builder to the NDDRC around the role of the PMU post-
Pilot and while the MTR finds that the SC and PMU could better share information in the
NDDRC and better involve other key staff, clearly the constructive, partnership approach
employed by the TDRP and the focus on capacity building has greatly enhanced the ability of the
Project to deliver outputs and secure outcomes.

100.     The Project encountered challenges around human capacity and resource capacity in the
NDDRC. In summary, the M&E activities of the Capacity Building component were totally
undermined due to spoilers in the staffing and then the need to replace the evaluation staff in the
Commission. Similarly, the lack of personnel in the States greatly undermined the ability to
secure sustainable outcomes from the Capacity Building component. Material resources ranging
from financing to fuel and transport including the state of repair of Commission vehicles were
limiters on the Commission’s ability to fully engage with the Project. However, when it
experienced barriers the Capacity Building IA adjusted its approach to delivering their outputs
and to try and have a greater chance at positively influencing systems and institutional behaviour.
The input was clearly valued by the NDDRC particularly in the States but the fact remains that
the outcome of the Capacity Building component was limited by the often very low starting point
of engagement.

101.    The design strengths of the Project, particularly its alignment with the NDDRC Pilot
DDR Programme and the national DDR strategy have enhanced the implementation of the Project.
The strong relationship between the TDRP TT and the UN family, particularly UNMISS and
UNESCO has contributed to the TT approaching the Pilot in an holistic manner, understanding
the complexity of the overall NDDRC Pilot DDR Programme and ensuring a design fit with the
wider vocational training and literacy/numeracy training delivered by UNESCO to ex-combatants
at the Mapel Transition Facility. During implementation these same relationships enabled the TT

     At time of writing this manual is still in preparation and has not been reviewed by the consultant.




                                                                                                            Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                   Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic ff South Sudan New NDDR Programme - Annex A    141
      to facilitate the IAs to relate to the UN family and overcome the implementation delays being
      encountered.

      102.      A critical factor influencing Pilot implementation and the achievement of outcomes has
      been the intensive support of the TDRP TT and the project management applied not only to the
      Pilot but also to the development of the ICRS. The Bank’s presence on the ground has been
      critical to implementation and ensuring the coordination of IAs and NDDRC.

      103.    In summary, the challenges that emanate from or are part of the external strategic,
      operational and physical environments and which have affected the overall implementation of the
      Project or which are affecting or likely to affect the Project outcomes are as follows:

               (a) Security and political environment;
               (b) Legacy of the CPA DDR;
               (c) Limits on the buy-in of local SPLA and of the GoSS including the effects of limited
                   SSR;
               (d) Little and uneven economic development and market opportunities.

      104.     At the time of writing of the MTR during December 2013 RoSS succumbed to a serious
      deterioration in the security situation in the country. Over the weekend of December 15th fighting
      broke out between elements of the SPLA barracked in Juba. The conflict quickly developed into a
      civil conflict resulting in unconfirmed civilian and military casualties and creating anything
      between 500,000 and 1 million IDPs. During January 2014 the GoSS signed agreements on
      cessation of hostilities with both the SPLM in Opposition (SPLM-O) and the South Sudan
      Democratic Movement/Defence Army (SSDM/A) to begin to bring fighting throughout South
      Sudan (and in the case of SSDM/A in Jonglei state in particularly) to an end.

      105.     Thus at the time of the MTR it is clearly not possible to continue the Project putting all
      achievements to date under severe stress and significantly damaging sustainability and the
      possibility of outcomes. The project was suspended on December 19th 2013.

      106.     Prior to the deterioration of the security and political situation there were risks pertaining
      to the sustainability of Project outcomes as a result of the legacy of the CPA and limited buy-in
      from the SPLA possibly as a result of that CPA legacy. While other factors may have been in
      play clearly the NDDRC Pilot DDR programme encountered major barriers even to the
      recruitment of the appropriate number of SSAF for the Pilot DDR programme (290 soldiers
      instead of the target 500) and those who did enter Mapel Transition Facility did not match those
      profiled in the initial start-up of the pilot. While arguably this did not affect the overall progress
      towards the achievements of objectives by the Pilot these issues (which were characterized as
      barriers or problems with local SPLA senior staff) were still a significant blow to confidence in
      the NDDRC Pilot DDR programme and so to the Project.

      107.     If the Project is to be restarted the achievement of the Social and Economic objective is
      likely to be negatively affected by the lack of economic opportunity in communities of return,
      poor local market conditions and the lack of sufficient policy to address economic development.
      The Project risk management strategy identified this as a risk to be managed. To manage the risk
      the Project design focused on activities to reduce the reliance of ex-combatants on job creation
      policies in the context of (i) limited market opportunities, (ii) the lack of micro-finance to
      establish cooperatives and (iii) the lack of State-level procedures to facilitate establishing
      cooperatives. However this same context is still likely to negatively impact on the social and




142
economic benefits to ex-combatant of participating in the Pilot (and arguably, the broader
NDDRC Pilot DDR programme).

3.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
108.    Project preparation and design were responsive to the emerging policy frameworks and
aligned with GoSS strategy in DDR. Project documentation was drafted on time but was not
available in final draft until around the time of the MTR. The project documentation had the basic
weakness of over-estimating the impact of the Pilot (for example, as captured in the project
objectives) but this has not negatively affected implementation or achievement of outputs.
Overall, the Project Management and M&E of the Project has been of high quality and intensive.

3.2 Risks and Risk Mitigation
109.     Overall, the identification of risks has been satisfactory however the risk management
strategy as mapped out in Project documentation is unsatisfactory and not in sufficient detail. In
reality when expected and unexpected risks have been encountered the Bank TT has performed
well and approached the implementation of the Project with patience and in a solutions-orientated
and problem-solving manner. An example of this approach is the in-depth support of IAs when
IAs encountered implementation delays due their own unsatisfactory preparation for the Pilot.
Once fully engaged, IAs utilized the same approach to navigating difficulties in implementation.

110.     Critically the project underestimated the risk of deteriorating security and political
situation (rated as ‘Substantial’, lower than the rating ‘High’ as per project documentation) but
this risk, which is out of the control of the Pilot has been realized and has stopped implementation.
Also, the MTR notes that the Project did not identify lack of political buy-in as a risk to success
or how the lack of progress in SSR might impact on the Project.

3.4 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) by Bank
111.    The Project M&E framework is a high-level design with both Scorecard and ‘Substantive’
indicators relating to progress towards achieving the objectives of the Pilot. The indicators are
clustered around three outputs:

     (a)   State-level operational and technical support: the provision of operational support
           focused on Greater Bahr el Ghazal to the NDDRC, enabling it to work with line
           ministries and other partners to facilitate and support project planning, development
           and implementation processes ensuring that lessons learnt on both process and
           delivery are identified and captured.
     (b)   Agricultural livelihoods: development and implementation of agricultural livelihoods
           support to ex-combatants that have returned.
     (c)   Urban livelihoods: development and implementation of non-agricultural livelihoods
           support through entrepreneurship, financial literacy and cooperatives training for ex-
           combatants choosing urban settlement in skills such as carpentry, mechanics, electrical
           engineering, metal fabrication and construction.

112.     Scorecard indicators for output (a) above are overambitious and vague and probably
reflect the view of the TT prior to the engagement of the IA that only then identified the full
extent of human and material capacity challenges in the NDDRC. As such the indicators should
be revised to more accurately reflect the assessment by the IA and understand the realistically
achievable progress given the limitations of NDDRC capacity at present.




                                                                                             Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                    Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic ff South Sudan New NDDR Programme - Annex A    143
      113.    Score-card indicators for outputs (b) and (c) are a combination of easily measurable
      indicators (for example, 100 percent of ex-combatants receive a livelihood start-up kit within 2
      months of graduation) and those which implicitly defer measurement to future Tracer studies (for
      example, up to 80 percent of ex-combatants who participated in the non-agricultural training at
      the Transition Facility initiate decent and sustainable livelihood opportunities, through
      entrepreneurship training, cooperatives training, financial management, market, product
      management).

      114.     The M&E framework would benefit from revision based on the learning from
      implementing Phase 1 of the Pilot: specifically, it would be useful to scale back the ambition of
      some of the indictors to more realistically match what IAs have encountered on the ground. For
      example, it is unlikely that 60 percent of those trained will be assisted to establish economic
      associations and regardless in this instance ‘assisted’ should be qualified and defined to more
      accurately reflect the level of support given to ex-combatants and community members thus far in
      the Pilot. In other words, what does ‘assisted’ mean?

      115.    The M&E framework does not contain indicators specific to the nature of the Project as a
      pilot project; that is, one orientated towards trialing, learning and innovation. Despite this as seen
      above the project management of the Project and the work of the IAs have firmly focused on
      learning methodologies.

      116.    Practical day-to-day monitoring of Project activities has been strong. The Bank TT has
      reported concisely and effectively and has combined monitoring of Project progress with close,
      effective, on –the-ground implementation support, particularly in the early stages of project when
      delays were being encountered.

      3.5 Safeguards including Environmental and Fiduciary Compliance

      117.    By incorporating a focus on community-inclusive approaches in its design (Livelihoods
      component and dedicated Community Support component) the Project has aligned with the
      Conflict Sensitivity guiding principle of the South Sudan National DDR programme:

          (a) It is recognized that the legacy of conflict in South Sudan is such that the entire
              population faces multiple needs and challenges in terms of their recovery and
              development. It is therefore intended that overall DDR programme implementation will
              adopt a community-based approach targeting a number of activities aimed at the
              supporting communities, particularly in areas where high numbers of demobilized
              soldiers will be returning.

      118.    The Project aligns with principles of Do No Harm/Conflict Sensitivity and consciously
      looks for opportunities to mitigate potential negative effects of the Project. The Pilot is compliant
      with the 10 Fragile States Principles subscribed to by OECD/DAC donors particularly Principal 1
      (take context as the starting point) in so far as the Project is embedded in the NDDRC and
      supports national ownership, and principal 4 (prioritize prevention) and principal 5 (recognize the
      links between political, security and development objectives) through supporting reintegration
      and micro-economic development. Principal 10 (avoid pockets of exclusion) is implemented
      through the ex-combatant and community inclusive approach. The Project aligns with the World
      Bank approach to fragility and conflict as contained in WDR 2011.




144
119.      In project documentation the Project identified the need for Environmental Analysis as
the first activity in the Community Support Component. During implementation the IA (IOM)
identified that the component would align with its own UN procedures for ensuring
environmental safeguards and so the TT identified that a full Environmental Analysis was not
necessary.




                                                                                             Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                    Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic ff South Sudan New NDDR Programme - Annex A    145
      4. Assessment of Outcomes at time of MTR

      4.1 Relevance of Objectives and Design
      120.    The Project’s objectives and design are relevant to: (i) RoSS DDR strategies and plan; (ii)
      national ownership as a pillar of DDR; (iii) the learning principles of pilot programming, (iv)
      German donor strategy; and (v) the WB MDTF-SS.

      121.   The Project aligned with the RoSS National DDR strategies and papers particularly the
      Republic of South Sudan Policy Paper on Demobilization, Disarmament and Reintegration (23rd
      September, 2011) and the South Sudan National DDR Strategic Plan 2012-2020 (11th March,
      2012).

      122.    The design of the Pilot particularly supports engendering national ownership in DDR,
      both by facilitating the NDDRC to assume the decision-making and management role for South
      Sudan DDR and by focusing on building the capacity of the NDDRC.

      123.    The Project is closely related to and benefited from the MDTF-SS that during its
      operation phase 2006 to 2012 supported nationwide the CPA implementation with 21 projects.
      MDTF-SS had five Strategic Priorities of which two were crosscutting: (i) build the capacity of
      the GoSS and (ii) coordinate and align international assistance.

      124.    The Project is interlinked with the MDTF-SS in several ways:

                (a) The Project’s focus on capacity building is in the same spirit of the MDTF-SS that
                    had a capacity building element to strengthen state institutions in their governance,
                    management, planning and service delivery functions in most of its 21 projects.
                (b) Within its Priority Areas 2 and 3, the MDTF-SS’s funded projects directly
                    supported ex-combatants as beneficiaries of training programs for example the
                    Education Rehabilitation Project. Also, the UNDP implemented CPA DDR was
                    co-funded out of the MDTF-SS with US$ 36.4 million.
                (c) The Project likely benefits from MDTF-SS support to the general development of
                    South Sudan as the economic reintegration of ex-combatants will only be
                    successful if they can be absorbed by the local economy. Within its Priority Area
                    4, the following measures were financed: supportive government policy, a
                    legislative framework and extension services for a modernized agriculture as well
                    as private sector development. This should be especially beneficial for the Projects
                    activities within the Livelihood Support Sub-Component.

      4.2 Efficiency
      125.     The Project efficiency in progress made towards achieving its PDO is rated moderately
      satisfactory because of: (i) disbursement was largely on target despite implementation delays; (ii)
      low budget costs for each Project component; (iii) high unit cost per ex-combatant.

      126.     Disbursement to IPs has been on target. ASI received all six payments as per schedule
      totally US$519,506. UNICON received four of five payments with the fifth pending contract
      extension leaving US$162,140 to be paid out of a total contract of US$920,200. IOM have had
      two of five payments made with three pending Phase 2 leaving US$408,563 to be paid on
      completion of Phase 2 (out of a total contract value of US$450,000).




146
127.    The Project has low budget costs for each component; put simply, the Project has
managed to deliver a high volume of work and outputs from IAs for limited cost (Annex 1).
Among some of the IAs the consensus is that the design and implementation of the Pilot received
high value for money.

128.     At the time of MTR the financial management of the Project by the Bank TT was
satisfactory and showed flexibility in line with the overall flexibility of the project management in
order to enable IAs meet the unforeseen costs in barriers they experienced during implementation.
All IAs were highly appreciative of the consultative and flexible manner in which the TT engaged
around project budgets.

129.    Recognizing that if the Project leads to a larger project there are likely to be economies of
scale which reduce the cost per ex-combatant, still the Project does not compare favorably with
other DDR processes when the cost per ex-combatant is compared. In phase 1 the cost per ex-
combatant of all livelihood support is US$2,759.21 The only regional comparisons are with full
national DDR programmes so this distorts the comparative analysis somewhat however the
differences with neighbouring DDR costs is still relevant: the PNDDR (DRC) cost per
beneficiary was US$1,81722; the cost of the RDRP (Rwanda) was US$2,06523 and Burundi
$2,77524. The question to the NDDRC is whether the costs can be reduced should the modalities
and focus of the Pilot be brought to scale and where can savings be made?

130.     As stated in the Pilot the costs are minimized, with very little opportunity for reducing
costs further on any one component. By component the basic cost of start-up kits averages
US$671.65 per ex-combatant before transportation and warehousing costs are added which
increase the unit cost to US$923.61. Transportation and warehousing costs constitute 28 percent
of the overall costs but by far the highest cost incurred was transportation (US$14,000 total cost
of importing and transport to the States and US$ 20,000 total cost of local transport within the
States) reflecting the logistical difficulties of moving assets into and around South Sudan during
Phase 1. Overall, in Phase 1, the main cost to the Project is the provision of start-up kits totaling
US$ 323,100 compared to US$ 477,100 for Training supports (US$ 312,600 Livelihood Supports
Training plus US$164,500 Mapel Entrepreneurship Training).

4.3 Effectiveness
131.     The Project has been effective in achieving project outputs as outlined in the Project
documentation and fully examined in Section 2 above. Prior to its suspension the Project was
making progress towards achieving the Project objectives. Regarding Objective 1: To provide ex-
combatants with skills enabling and enhancing their livelihood opportunities in their communities
of return the Project had successfully distributed start-up kits to the majority of ex-combatants
well within the target time of two months. The Project also delivered a package of trainings
designed to suit the literacy and numeracy skills of ex-combatants and capitalize on the potential
outcomes of their vocational training. Training was delivered to community members to augment
the community-inclusive methodology and to increase the likely sustainability of economic
cooperatives. In addition the main IA (UNICON) employed a Training of Trainers (TOT)
modality to overcome the lack of available trainers that has had the subsidiary effect of skilling

      new trainers and stimulating them to take the first steps towards forming their own economic
      cooperative.

      132.     The objectives of the Training sub-component are very ambitious and in reality given the
      time spent delivering training in Mapel TF and in the communities, and given the literacy and
      numeracy challenges and that the curriculum was developed and then refined while at Mapel (but
      to a good standard) some are unlikely to have been fully met at the end of Phase 1 or fully met to
      achieve the level of outcomes one would expect from the how the objective is framed. 25 This
      vagueness in objectives is exacerbated by the kind of reporting from the field which overstates
      the potential impact and complexity of the training which in all reality is training in fundamentals,
      not training in advanced business as is suggested from an overview of the curriculum. Also, given
      limits on time it is unlikely that all aspects of the curriculum were implemented in to the
      communities of return.26 Similarly given the limits on the knowledge of the Trainers it is unlikely
      that all modules as per the curriculum were implemented.

      133.    For example, the IA reports that in Warrap community-based training began on 23rd
      September and continued until 13th November 2013 during which time 70 of 75 participating ex-
      combatants were trained along with 34 community members in nine modules.27 However during
      the MTR verification visit to Wau and Kuajok trainers identified that they had not spent much
      time in communities delivering training. In Kuajok it was identified that by the date of the visit



                  25
      1.             Focusing on the objectives of the State-based training, the IA identifies the objectives as follows: (1) To
      support the ex-combatants utilize the Vocational, Literacy and Life Skills trainings gained at the Mapel Transition
      Facility toward productive livelihoods in their communities of return; (2) To reinforce and facilitate the
      operationalization of the decision made by ex-combatants during their training in Mapel to establish themselves in
      individual businesses or in partnerships and cooperatives; (3) To assist in cooperative formation and offer subsequent
      training to ex-combatants along with community members who wish to join in the formation of cooperatives and
      management of cooperatives in different technical sectors; (4) To assist the establishment of individual
      entrepreneurships or partnerships in business activities by offering further training to ex-combatants in business start-up
      and management including (i) micro-enterprise skills training as correlated to the vocational trainings received in the
      Mapel Transition Facility; and (ii) small farm business skills training; (5) To assist ex-combatants in handling the start-
      up and management process such as board formation, marketing and book-keeping initially; (6) To offer advice in
      initial troubleshooting such as lack of support of family or community members or selection of location appropriate to
      the opportunities.
      26
          Training at State level is outlined as including: (1) Business Start-up Training which has the following modules: (a)
      Business Development; (b) Cooperative formation; (c) Start-up of Individual and Partnership; (d) Business plan
      Preparation; (e) Business Skills Development, and (2) Management of Individual Cooperative Enterprises which has
      the following modules: (a) Legal Process and requirements; (b) Marketing and Sales; (c) Purchase Management; (d)
      Production and Work Place Management; (e) Book-keeping Practices.
      27
         (1) Business plan for setting up cooperatives – how to identify resources required to run business, how to name
      cooperative, how these businesses would be useful to the customers; (2) Financial literacy – how to identify resources
      required to run business, how to manage resources and how to allocate them, selection of business name, how to make
      business useful to its customers, how to identify the different type of skills by individuals within cooperative, etc.; (3)
      Book-keeping management – how to deal with day-to-day operations and how to record transactions, utilization,
      allocation of profits and how to control others expenses incurred in business; (4) Marketing research – how to inform
      potential customers, how to advertise the services/goods that are available through this business; assessment,
      advertisement and promotion of goods and services in the market; (5) Communication skills – how to communicate to
      the customers in the market and others suppliers - both external and internal suppliers - and how to communicate
      internally within organization; (6) Planning and controlling – how to plan their businesses, how it will be implemented,
      when activities shall be taken, and how to control operations to minimize expenses and maximize profits; (7) Time
      management skills – how to manage time and avoid inconveniences, how to do scheduling; (8) Leadership
      management skills – how to lead others and how to motivate them, giving them right to participate in decision making
      process and learn different leadership styles, especially those related to cooperatives; (9) Marketing orientation – how
      to sell goods and services to customers, how to organize supply of goods and how to check if the goods are still usable,
      how to select potential suppliers.




148
(November 14th) trainers had trained ex-combatants and community members for just three hours.
From this brief visit there is evidence enough that there are deficiencies in reporting from the
field, quality assurance of training outputs and an overall lack of realism in the indicators used to
plan deliverables in the Training sub-component.

134.     Trainers were unsure how to register or if one could register cooperatives at State level so
logically, it is not likely that they trained ex-combatants and community members in legal
processes and requirements. What this reflects is the need to revisit the alignment of the
curriculum with the capacity of ex-combatants and the available time for trainers to work in the
communities to create a set of indicators that more accurately reflect what can be achieved. These
indicators should align with verification of the exact outputs in each State during Phase 1,
however in the case of this pilot verification is unlikely to be possible given the outbreak of
conflict. However, in future designs this recommendation should be implemented.

135.     Similar to the limitations on verifying the training it is not possible to verify the numbers
of cooperatives formed by ex-combatants and community members or to identify whether ex-
combatants and community members formed cooperatives where they had expressed and
intention to do so. However, the IA reports that the information from Trainers in the field (which
is incomplete) indicates that 11 groups of varying sizes were indicating that they would form
some type of associative work practice28 or cooperative.29

136.     The Institutional Capacity Building component has been effective and produced the
planned outputs as well as less tangible (but not less important) outcomes on institutional
knowledge, understanding and behaviour. The component has produced a starting point for what
should ideally be a long-term process of highly strategic and highly empowering TA and
knowledge transfer including through the methodology of mentoring. The effectiveness of the
Component is its assessment of institutional capacity at HQ and State level as well as the linkages
between the two and critically, the lack of implementation of lessons learned from previous DDR
programmes and their evaluations. The core reporting of the IA was consistent and regular and
the final report contains practical and accurate learning and recommendations.

137.    The Community Support Programmes has not yet been effective at producing outcomes
primarily because the Component was designed to be implemented across Phase 1 and Phase 2.
While the IOM experienced challenges to implementation as a result of the effect of the rainy
season on road transportation planned activities were completed before suspension of the contract
between the Bank and the IOM due to the outbreak of conflict in South Sudan.

4.4 Sustainability
138.    The design of the Project emphasized sustainability by approaching the unstated but
overall purpose of the Project, (that is, to build the capacity of the NDDRC through learning by
doing and concurrently enhance the capital of the NDDRC to implement an effective and
relevance reintegration programme) to place the NDDRC front and centre in the new Project thus



28
   The term ‘associative work practice’ fits the type of collaborative work being initiated by most groups of ex-
combatants because the unit they were forming or intended to form would not meet the legal requirements to be a full
cooperative, particularly the need for 21 individuals to be members. Also, difficulties and lack of understanding around
registering cooperatives were likely to result in ex-combatants with or without community members, joining together as
informal associations to benefit from collaborative work practices.

      exemplifying for any future DDR programme to succeed it must be nationally owned and led by
      the Commission. The Project was designed as a first step on re-enabling the NDDRC post-CPA
      DDR to take that leadership role and so eventually develop and implement a strategic, effective,
      efficient and relevant national DDR programme, which would contribute to the long term reform
      of SSAF. Put simply, the point of the Pilot has been to begin enabling the NDDRC to assume its
      role in Reintegration programming in DDR.

      139.    However a critical challenge to the NDDRC (and so the Project) was how to increase
      donor interest to ensure a second round of programming with a view to gradually growing a
      national DDR process. At the time of the MTR it was clear that any successes thus far would
      hopefully contribute to donor confidence and interest in aligning behind a next iteration of
      Reintegration programming however, with the changes in the internal security environment any
      progress made on persuading donors to contribute to future programming is likely to be seriously
      negatively affected.

      140.     At the level of Components, the Project has had dynamics of sustainability. In the
      Livelihoods Component the unplanned strategy of utilizing Training Of Trainers (TOT)
      methodology has the potential to create a network of domestic trainers who themselves are
      capacitated to build a cooperative and do business in South Sudan. The design of the Training
      sub-component emphasizes TDRP learning on supporting ex-combatants to obtain sustainable
      livelihoods through the provision of generic business and cooperative working skills that
      capitalize on already-acquired vocational training. The principle of including community
      members in training has the potential not only to contribute to social inclusion and mitigate
      tensions but also has the potential to create more sustainable units of diverse background and
      approaches to cooperative working practices.

      141.     The Institutional Capacity Building component focused on creating a baseline for
      sustainable institutional development within the NDDRC to best enable it to assume the role of
      leading on Reintegration programming in DDR and by employing mentoring rather than formal
      training the component approached skills transfer and capacity building in a more gradual,
      collaborative manner which suits the learning style of the Commission and which should have the
      greatest chance of creating genuine and sustainable shifts in institutional culture and performance.

      142.     By design the Community Supports Project component has emphasized the sustainability
      of the infrastructure to be provide through working with communities to create community water
      committee and if possible generate income through water charges in order to finance the servicing
      of boreholes and pumps. However, the outputs of the component had it gone ahead were unlikely
      to be as sustainable due to the low-cost and limited design. For example, solar powered higher
      volume water pumps also have a longer lifespan then the kind being installed in the Pilot thus
      mitigating the reluctance of communities to charge for water and the difficulties obtaining spare
      parts and skilled maintenance people.

      4.5 Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
      143.     The risk to development outcomes is substantial. As has been outlined above the key risk
      to the outcomes of the Project has been the security situation in South Sudan that deteriorated to
      such an extent that the Pilot was suspended on December 19th 2013. The result is that all Phase 2
      planned activities are suspended, as are the delayed Component DDR Community Support
      Projects. At present there is no way of verifying what has happened to ex-combatants who




150
participated in the Project but it is highly unlikely any can progress on livelihood issues in the
current situation in South Sudan. During the MTR it was identified that it in order for the
NDDRC to build capacity and improve its reputation it would be critical to maintain the
momentum of implementation achieved during the Project. With the current security situation in
the country this momentum is likely to be lost or seriously negatively influenced.




                                                                                            Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot

      5. Assessment of Stakeholder Performance
      5.1 Bank Performance
      The performance of the TDRP is assessed here in relation to how the TDRP performed as per its
      agreement with the KfW and the NDDRC as providers of Technical Assistance to the NDDRC.
      The Pilot Reintegration Programme does not constitute formal lending from the Bank. The
      Bank’s role is limited to Trust Fund management and provision of Technical Assistance as
      outlined in the agreement.30

      (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
      Rating: Satisfactory
      144.    Quality at Entry pertains to the design of the Project and the performance of the TDRP
      throughout the period of design and implementation. The TDRP performed satisfactorily because:
      (1) by design the project took consideration of the capacity of the NDDRC; (2) it executed its role
      in a manner that was conscious of wider stakeholder roles in the great SS DDR environment
      including those of the Line Ministries and the UN family; (3) built on learning from the CPA
      DDR programme; (4) emphasized national ownership.

      145.     By design the Project was simple with straightforward components and sub-components
      and so constituted a measured starting point to assess and gradually build the capacity of the
      NDDRC while concurrently implementing a pilot reintegration programme that was intended to
      benefit the 290 ex-combatants that underwent reintegration assistance. The components
      emphasized procurement, and management and facilitation of external implementing Partners as
      well as assisting the NDDRC to critically reflect on its own internal workings and competencies
      rather than being overly complex.

      146.     Interaction with the wider stakeholder community was carried out in a collaborative
      manner but always with the focus on enabling the NDDRC to lead the Pilot Reintegration project.
      The TDRP often with the assistance of the NDDRC, facilitated networking the IAs (UNICON,
      ASI) with the key stakeholders in the wider NDDR Pilot Programme such as UNESCO and
      UNMISSS. The TDRP’s own involvement sought to learn from the UN agencies in particular and
      tried to positively guide the NDDRC’s interaction with those same agencies.

      147.   The TDRP’s role in the Project was informed by a good understanding on the history of
      DDR in South Sudan and cognizance of the learning from the CPA DDR. The TDRP’s


      30
         The Project Management here is a combination of the management of the Project by the TDRP, and the work of the
      PMU as a unit constituted within the NDDRC as part of the institutional arrangements to implement the Project.
      The relevant TDRP activities identified in the invitation from the NDDRC to engage around the Project are limited to
      establishing a Technical Support Unit and Project Management Teams and instituting M&E. The agreement between
      the donors (KfW) and the Trust Fund Administrators (TDRP) is more detailed when outlining eligible expenditure and
      identifying the role of the TDRP.
                    (a) Bank-executed Activities consisting of: (1) analyses and studies on regional aspects of
                         demobilization and reintegration focusing on such aspects as alien ex-combatants as well as cross-
                         border and cross-cutting activities, such as capacity development, research, and evaluation; (2)
                         technical assistance and enhanced supervision activities designed to improve quality and knowledge
                         management for demobilization and reintegration; and (3) analyses and studies on regional aspects of
                         demobilization and reintegration focusing on gender.
                    (b) Trust Fund Management and Administration: Establishment and operation of the Trust Fund
                         Technical Team; management of the Trust Fund; and supervision as well as monitoring and
                         evaluation of Projects.




152
knowledge was assisted by the NDDRC’s self-reflection and own learning from the CPA DDR
and from the knowledge shared with the TDRP by the stakeholders in the NDDR Pilot
Programme.

148.      Throughout the Project the TDRP’s role shifted from technical assistance to operational
assistance with Bank staff and consultants becoming embedded in the implementation of the
Project rather than remaining in technical or project management roles. In the field during the
implementation of any pilot project the Technical Adviser is often under stress to become more
involved in day-to-day implementation of the project than is expected from the role of advisor.
Metaphorically there is a thin line between providing TA and then being hands-on during
implementation. The TDRP clearly crossed over from TA to operational assistance during the
first phase of the Project. While this is somewhat of a grey area and a judgment call by the TDRP
staff as to what it will take to ensure the successful implementation of the Project, the TDRP
should be more explicit in how it plans for this challenge and should more systematically
consider the pros and cons of operating outside the TA remit and plan for same.


(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
149.     Bank supervision in the form of TF management and Project management is rated
satisfactory because: (i) the Bank satisfactorily identified most safeguard issues; (ii) the Project
management by the Bank was responsive to the needs of the NDDRC and the implementation of
the Project, and (iii) the Bank facilitated additional TA and project implementation assistance
although as emphasized above, at times this assistance was operational and not technical
assistance.

150.      The Bank satisfactorily identified safeguard issues and the NDDRC project
documentation clearly identifies the same. In collaboration with the IOM practical and efficient
alternatives to ERM were identified however due to the suspension of the Project these were not
implemented. The Bank closely managed financial risks and where issues emerged between IAs
that were external to the Bank’s own purview the Bank TT worked to support the NDDRC to
facilitate resolving the issues.

151.    Bank supervision was responsive to the needs of the Project, the capacity-issues of the
NDDRC and sought to address implementation delays including those emanating from all IAs.
The Bank TT were closely involved in assisting IAs to become effective when faced with
implementation challenges and throughout the duration of the Pilot Project they were closely
involved with monitoring the progress of IAs. At one point in the implementation of the Project
the Bank TT fell behind when providing feedback to ASI on the deliverables by IR and this
suggests that the Bank found the volume of work managing the Project challenging. Similarly the
IA argues that the Bank’s approach to the project was too hands on and that the form and content
expected by the Bank of the IA’s deliverables was too rigid. Specifically, the IA argues that the
Bank’s feedback on the Baseline and Community Dynamics reports was too prescriptive and
rigid and did not afford IR the freedom to produce the kind of report they planned to produce.

152.     The Bank’s role was to advise the NDDRC on the quality of the surveys and the survey
reporting and facilitated the NDDRC to develop its understanding of the principle and usefulness
of this kind of M&E. Due to the lack of expertise in the NDDRC the Bank lead on reviewing the
deliverables of IR and was detailed on its feedback to the IA on the quality and content of their
deliverables, which to begin with was poor. It is notable that IR did recover somewhat to produce




                                                                                             Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot

      a better quality report for the Community Dynamics study. The MTR finds that in the future the
      Bank should along with the NDDRC be more prescriptive at the beginning of the Project
      outlining the form of the deliverable in any contract with future IAs.

      5.2 NDDRC Performance
      153.    The NDDRC’s role in the Project was to lead the Project with TA from the TDRP.
      Throughout the implementation of the Project the NDDRC engaged positively with the TDRP
      and did so with an emphasis on learning by doing. The NDDRC engaged positively around
      resolving implementation challenges such as those faced around M&E and some IAs becoming
      effective. In the case of the latter the NDDRC facilitated IAs at HQ and State level and where
      particular benefit was identified the Commission sought to capitalize on progress made.

      154.    Throughout the Project the NDDRC was hamstrung by resource challenges and
      challenges from its own institutional arrangements (the latter point being identified by ASI)
      which itself it identified as being unable to alter.

      155.     Resource challenges were felt across the NDDRC but most critically in the States. In HQ
      very fundamental challenges such as losing power when the generator switched off had severe
      impact on the infrastructure supporting the work of the Commission, such as IT and
      communications. Simply put, no power means little work can be undertaken on site. Most critical
      deprivations have been the lack of human and financial capital in the State offices. NDDRC staff
      in the States performs multiple roles so the ability of the NDDRC to capitalize on the activities in
      Institutional Capacity Building Component has been limited. Material resources such as transport,
      the state of repair of vehicles and communications were all severely restricted at State level.

      156.    ASI identified challenges in the institutional arrangements that in the analysis of the IA
      were negatively affecting the ability of the NDDRC to implement learning from the CPA DDR
      and to build capacity and expertise to effectively implement the Project (and future iterations of
      same). From the perspective of the NDDRC institutional arrangements are fixed as a result of the
      Commissions alignment under its respective GoSS ministry. The reality is that challenges to the
      effectiveness of the NDDRC to implement the project resulting from institutional arrangements
      were navigated in part through the creation the PMU, an approach that was beginning to prove
      effective.

      157.     The risk of finding practical workarounds to institutional challenges is that occasionally
      some staff may become unintentionally marginalized so it is incumbent on the NDDRC to
      balance ways of navigating institutional challenges with ensuring that staff members are included
      in the various stages of the Project and future iterations. Arguably some staff members were
      being unintentionally marginalized during the Project and this should be avoided in future
      iterations. The marginalization occurred both at strategic levels and at operational levels.

      5.3 Performance of Implementing Partners
      158.     The Pilot Project had three IAs: ASI, UNICON and IOM. With the suspension of the
      project IOM had achieved little in the implementation of the DDR Community Support Projects
      and so the performance of the IA is not rated below.

      5.3.1 Adam Smith International and Integrity Research
      159.    ASI and IR implemented the Institutional Capacity Building component with IR taking
      responsibility for the M&E focus including conducting the Baseline and Community Dynamics




154
surveys. At Project start-up ASI and particularly IR showed a lack of preparedness regarding
project documentation, background and modalities. Despite this ASI implemented the Component
in an effective manner, adapting to challenges and opportunities as they arose during their
engagement by the NDDRC. As identified above the ASI methodology was participative,
inclusive and effective in involving the NDDRC in learning by doing. The mentoring of NDDRC
staff was context specific and delivered in a manner that was cognizant of the fundamental task of
the NDDRC: reintegrating ex-combatants in line with the South Sudan National DDR Strategy
(2012 – 2020). ASI also undertook the mentoring process with a strong orientation towards
programmatic and institutional learning in line with the Project’s overall rationale as a pilot
project. ASI’s reporting was consistent and succinct during the Project and added to the value of
the Project as a learning process.

160.     Initially, deliverables from IR were of poor quality. While implemented effectively on the
ground the Baseline report from IR lacked analysis and was not confident in its own methodology,
tools or approach – something that fundamentally undermined the validity of the findings. The
Baseline report repeatedly applied conditionality to its analysis and undermined any conclusions
that might be drawn from the work. IR recovered from this poor start somewhat with an improved
report for the Community Dynamics study but the report still lacked sufficient quality analysis
and quality. As noted above the M&E manual was also of poor quality.

161.     Overall the potential institutional impact of implementing Baseline and Community
Dynamics studies was undermined by the absence of an M&E unit during the initial stages of the
Project. This similarly prevented the IA delivering capacity development in M&E. This
essentially null level capacity prevented the principle of integrating the study of impact to create a
feedback loop for future programming or program delivery taking root in any significant way in
the NDDRC. This presents a missed opportunity.

5.3.2 UNICON
162.      Initially UNICON displayed poor project preparation. As discussed above the IA
encountered barriers to effectiveness such as lack of institutional presence in South Sudan and
limited knowledge of operating in South Sudan or of the operational context there. Despite a poor
start to the Project UNICON through its perseverance and allocation of extra resources to the
Project successfully addressed the barriers to implementation.

163.    UNICON’s reporting displayed strong M&E and an orientation towards the Project as a
learning process. By the suspension of the Project UNICON had successfully delivered its project
outputs but due firstly to issues with the delivery chain involving CRADA and second due to
challenges receiving quality reporting from the field the delivery of training in the community
was not possible to verify or correctly assess. In response to this UNICON has documented
challenges obtaining accurate in field reporting from implementers of sub-components.

      6. Conclusions and Recommendations

      164.    Findings and recommendations are presented below and as follows: (i) as they relate to
      the context of the Project and the wider strategic environment; (ii) as they relate to the Project
      design and outcomes of each Component and (iii) as they relate to the role of the stakeholders.

      6.1 Project Context and Strategic Environment
      165.     Conclusion 1.Prior to its suspension the Project was performing well, and showing
      strong progress on two of three sub-components as well as a variety of outcomes addressing
      institutional knowledge, learning, project management and capacity. The suspension of the
      Project removes what the MTR identifies as critical to the future success of the Project: the ability
      to keep up the momentum of the gains made during the Project, particularly in institutional
      performance and capacity building. Much momentum is likely to have been lost.

      166.    Recommendation 1. In any future programming or Phase 2 the negative effect of this
      stop in momentum which can result from a number of factors not just the extreme situation of the
      deterioration of the security situation should be considered and planned for including that any
      future activities in capacity building may be starting from a low level. Momentum is critical and
      where delays can better anticipated and managed they should be. Events such as an outbreak of
      armed conflict are outside the control of the Project.

      167.     Conclusion 2. Prior to its suspension the Project was restricted by two broad set of
      factors: (i) material and human resources at the NDDRC, and (ii) the wider strategic context of
      the SSR process in South Sudan. In the first instance the NDDRC was severely constrained by a
      lack of material resources and financing so that everyday performance was restricted while
      concurrently (and particularly in the States) the NDDRC was constrained by a lack of human
      resources with insufficient staffing in the States and some spoilers in the HQ offices. While the
      spoiler issue was addressed the other issues remained outstanding at the time of the MTR and
      until addressed will restrict the ability of the NDDRC to function and to capitalize on the
      outcomes of the Project or any future Project.

      168.     Recommendation 2. Future programming or Phase 2 should be designed in such a way
      so that the Government of RoSS should be required to commit to increased financing of the
      NDDRC and the NDDRC to commit to appropriately resourcing itself in material and in human
      resources

      169.     Conclusion 2a. While the MTR has focused on the program performance aspects of the
      Project it is clear to all stakeholders that the Project along with the wider NDDRC Pilot
      Programme at Mapel Transit Facility was severely hamstrung through lack of buy-in from the
      SPLA and likely from lack of confidence or progress in wider SSR in South Sudan.

      170.     Recommendation 2a.This critical macro-issue means that while the NDDRC may
      benefit both programmatically and institutionally if the Project is re-started, it is critical that any
      future DDR programming is linked on a strategic level to wider SSR so that project achievements
      are not lost due to lack of progress elsewhere in the broader strategic environment and so that the
      DDR programme can align and have currency in the broader SSR environment.




156
6.2 Project Design and Outcomes

171.   Conclusion 3. Rather than the outcomes for ex-combatants who have participated in the
programming, the focus of the Project on piloting systems, capacity building, project
implementation and institutional development dictate the best areas for examining the potential
outcomes of the Project and gauging the performance of the Project and the Project Implementers.
However, this focus is not reflected Project documentation or M&E frameworks.

172.     Recommendation 3. The focus on being a Pilot should be more coherently incorporated
in future Project documentation or in Phase 2 of the Project and in all relevant M&E frameworks.

173.     Conclusion 4. In Component 1: Livelihood Supports Sub-Component 1 (Start-up Kits)
the Project largely delivered its required outputs by providing high quality start-up kits to nearly
all ex-combatants in Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Western Bahr el Ghazal and Warrap and (with
some remaining in Lakes State NDDRC offices). It did so in a timely fashion and the
performance far exceeded that recorded in the CPA DDR.

174.    Recommendation 4. In future programming the modalities utilized by the IA and the
market intelligence in their reporting should be fully utilized by the NDDRC when designing and
managing the procurement of start-up kits.

175.    Conclusion 5. Component 1: Livelihood Supports under the Sub-Component 2: Training,
the Project delivered a tailor-made curriculum and 60 hours of training comprised of 27 hours of
Financial Literacy and 33 hours on Entrepreneurship to 290 ex-combatants. However significant
challenges were encountered in the design of the curriculum particularly in relation to the literacy
and numeracy levels of ex-combatants. It is not possible to verify the input for State-based
follow-up trainings which included the community.

176.     Recommendation 5. In future programming or in Phase 2 the curriculum should be
further refined to suit the needs and capacities of ex-combatants, a process which should involve
the main stakeholders in vocational training such as UNESCO. All curricula should be
systematically quality controlled and reviewed for effectiveness as part of ongoing project M&E.

177.     Conclusion 6. Component 2: Institutional Capacity Building M&E capacity building was
seriously undermined by lack of appropriate staff in the NDDRC. This was subsequently resolved
but too late for progress on the building of M&E capacity in the Commission.

178.    Recommendation 6. A key output from the activities of Component 2 has been a
capacity audit of the NDDRC. The NDDRC should ensure that the staffing complement is filled
in advance of any future programming addressing the capacity and skilling of the Commission.

179.     Conclusion 7. The participative methodology of the IA delivering Component 2 suited
the culture of the NDDRC.

180.    Recommendation 7. Any future programming or Phase 2 activities delivering capacity
building should utilize a similar approach of embedded mentoring rather than formal training.
Furthermore this methodology should be correctly timed and matched with sufficient resources
(including human resources, that is, staff) by the NDDRC so as to maximize outcomes from such
programme.




                                                                                              Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                     Final Evaluation of the Pilot Reintegration Project Republic ff South Sudan New NDDR Programme - Annex A    157
      181.    Conclusion 8. One of the Project indicators of success was positive change in the
      confidence held by the community and ex-combatants in DDR programming and the work of the
      NDDRC but there were no activities or metrics to measure same.

      182.    Recommendation 8. In Tracer studies attitudinal change regarding the perception by ex-
      combatants and civilians of the value and usefulness of the NDDRC and DDR programming in
      general should be included.

      183.    Conclusion 9. As a pilot the Project, the TDRP, the NDDRC and IAs were all clearly
      orientated towards learning and knowledge capture.

      184.   Recommendation 9. This orientation should be maximized on in future pilot
      programming or in Phase 2. Learning and knowledge capture should be integrated into Project
      M&E and feedback loops to monitor how learning is actioned by the stakeholders should be
      designed.

      185.   Conclusion 10. Regarding M&E of the Project, many of the Project objectives are over
      ambitious and/or vague.

      186.    Recommendation 10. In future programming or in Phase 2 the M&E Framework utilized
      by the Bank should be revised based on the learning from implementing Phase 1. Particularly, the
      ambition of indicators should be aligned with more realistic expectations of activities under the
      various Project Components and all ambiguous language should be avoided.

      187.    Conclusion 10a. Regarding M&E of the Project the M&E Framework does not contain
      indicators specific to the nature of the Pilot as a learning process orientated towards trialing,
      documenting, learning and innovation.

      188.    Recommendation 10a. In future programming or in Phase 2 this must be addressed so as
      to properly monitor the performance of the Project and its stakeholders and in order to maximize
      any gains from Project learning.

      189.   Conclusion 11. The Project design has aligned with all relevant safeguards including: (i)
      the Conflict Sensitivity Principle of the South Sudan National DDR programme; (ii) principles of
      Do No Harm, and (iii) World Bank approach to Conflict and Fragility as contained in the WDR
      2011.

      190.    Recommendation 11. This good practice should be replicated in all future programming
      or in Phase 2.

      191.    Conclusion 12. By design the Project has emphasized sustainability: (i) by approaching
      building the capacity of the NDDRC through learning by doing, (ii) by IAs incorporating
      sustainability into the design of Component 2 (Trainer for Trainers methodology) and Component
      3 (use of VDCs).

      192.     Recommendation 12. In future programming or in Phase 2 sustainability should
      continue to be emphasized and where challenges exist they should be addressed appropriately.
      The main design feature that should be addressed is the design of Component 3, particularly the
      type of infrastructure being put in place and the realistic options to make that infrastructure as
      sustainable as possible.




158
193.  Conclusion 13. The potential impact of Component 3 was overestimated in all project
documentation and M&E frameworks.

194.     Recommendation 13. In future programming involving community-based reintegration,
in Phase 2 or in a re-start of Component 3 serious consideration should be given to increasing the
resources available for community based reintegration. Furthermore expanding the scope of
activities should also be considered and additional buy-in from local Ministries garnered in order
to make activities as likely to produce impact as possible.

195.   Conclusion 14. The Project is efficient with costs minimized and very little remaining
room for reducing costs further. However, efficiency is compromised by the cost per beneficiary
which exceeds that in other national DDR programmes.

196.  Recommendation 14. When estimating the impact on future programming or Phase 2
economies of scale should considered and where possible the cost per beneficiary reduced.

197.  Conclusion 15. Delivery chains were a key weakness in the delivery of activities in
Component 2, Sub-component 2 and compounded the negative effect of some factors affecting
implementation such as lack of preparedness of IAs and lack of understanding of the political
economy of RoSS.

198.    Recommendation 15. In future programming or in Phase 2 the use of delivery chains
should be explicitly addressed in the design process and the risks associated with it should be
appropriately managed. The planned implementation modalities of IAs should be fully
interrogated in light of this recommendation.

6.3 Stakeholders
199.    Conclusion 16. By design and during implementation the Project sought to engage the
wider stakeholders in DDR in South Sudan including those in the UN family.

200.    Recommendation 16. In future programming this approach should be built upon with
particular emphasis on re-engaging Line Ministries (particularly as they pertain to assisting in
community-based reintegration or support of Income Generating Activities (IGAs)/economic
cooperatives), and assisting the NDDRC and UN family to greater share expertise and resources
particularly those within the DDR unit in UNMISS.

201.    Conclusion 17. Throughout the Project the TDRP’s role shifted from providing TA to
providing operational assistance.

202.      Recommendation 17. In future the TDRP should more critically assess the risks of such
a shift in its role and be more explicit in how it plans for this challenge. The TDRP should more
systematically consider the pros and cons of operating outside the TA remit and consider how to
develop an appropriate exit strategy given the difficulties inherent with becoming more embedded
in operationalization.

                  Consultancy To Implement
               Livelihoods Support Component
       South Sudan Nddr- Pilot Reintegration Project




1 Project Background
The World Bank-TDRP wishes to hire a consultancy to establish the Livelihoods Support (Component Three) of the
South Sudan National Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Commission (NDDRC) Pilot Reintegration
Project to be completed from May 15th, 2013 to October 31st, 2014. The selected Firm is to conduct livelihoods
support activities for ex-combatants in the four states of reintegration - Lakes, Warrap, Western Bahr el Ghazal and
Northern Bahr el Ghazal. Livelihood activities will be offered in four primary tracks: 1) cooperatives/associations of
a mix of ex-combatants and community members; 2) individual or partnership enterprise trainings for small farms,
rural agricultural enterprise or micro-enterprise business; 3) targeted vocational training including agricultural exten-
sion and limited technical vocational trainings and 4) education. The overall Pilot Project also includes three other
components - capacity building, M&E, and community support projects - which will be conducted by other imple-
menting partners and are not included in this RFP. (See Background document for further information on the overall
Pilot Reintegration Project).

2 Project Objectives
The Livelihoods Support component of the pilot reintegration project will provide livelihood support services to ex-
combatants in their communities of return to facilitate long-term livelihood success. The component will also test
the livelihoods mechanism for future DDR tranches. The support offered in this component will consist of market-
oriented skills development to encourage individual enterprise or employment for income. The provision of services
to the ex-combatants and their communities of return is the main priority for this project. Alongside this effort, the
testing of the livelihood support mechanism is at the heart of the reintegration piloting itself. Testing the livelihood
track modalities will provide lessons to inform and improve the future reintegration services offered through the South
Sudan NDDR Programme. The livelihoods tracks to be piloted during the reintegration project are designed to inform
the eventual long-term livelihood activities of the overall South Sudan NDDR Programme and to be replicable where
appropriate for the future tranches given differences in size and caseload demographics. They would need to be further
tested and refined amongst future pilot reintegration tranches.

The livelihoods component will be conducted in two phases. The first phase is from May to November 2013. The sec-
ond phase was to last from December 2013 to April 2014, but due to the conflict in December 2013, the second phase
will now last from March to July 2014. The National DDR commission will be conducting follow-up and collecting
lessons learned and the firm will contribute to lessons learned through to June 2014, then the lessons will be compiled
and presented by September 2014. A mid-term and final review will be conducted externally to review the project.

This TOR is broken into the 2 distinct phases with terms for each clearly outlined below.

PHASE ONE
3 Phase 1 - Scope Of Work: Livelihoods Support Activities
An Implementing Partner (Firm) specializing in Livelihoods Support will be contracted to lead the implementation of
Component III of the pilot reintegration project. The livelihoods tracks being tested here include:



                                                                                  Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                                  Pilot Reintegration Project Document - Annex B: Terms of Reference   333
      •	   Group livelihood activities: through cooperatives or associations;
      •	   Individual livelihood activities (including partnerships): small farms and individual enterprise development ser-
           vices; and
      •	   Adult and formal education.
      The selected Firm will possess the requisite expertise to conduct the following key activities and will be responsible
      for the completion of the following tasks effectively and in accordance with Bank guidelines or any other procedures
      set forth by the Bank.

      •	   Provide all interested ex-combatants with entrepreneurship training;
      •	   Provide all community members participating in cooperatives with a short entrepreneurship booster training;
      •	   Provide all ex-combatants and community members joining or creating cooperatives training on governance,
           incorporation, banking, accessing micro-financing, project management and marketing;
      •	   Provide all ex-combatants initiating either partnerships or individual enterprises training on business planning,
           governance, incorporation, banking, accessing micro-financing, project management and marketing;
      •	   Provide all interested ex-combatants (cooperative, partnership or individual) business finance training or capital
           portfolio management as means to provide timely access to finance facilities to enterprises at all their growth
           stages while targeting their financial sustainability;
      •	   Provide all interested ex-combatants (cooperative, partnership or individual) business advisory assistance to sup-
           port the creation of business plans and sustainable growth;
      •	   Capital allocations to all ex-combatants participating in either cooperatives, partnerships or individual enterprise
           trainings; and
      •	   Provide all ex-combatants interested in further education with vouchers for education.
      While the livelihoods tracks are designed to provide clear long-term benefit to the participants, the participation of
      ex-combatants in the reintegration activities is on a voluntary basis and it is up to the individual to choose to take
      advantage of the opportunities offered in the reintegration project.1

      Livelihoods Sub-Components: The livelihoods support activities are to be conducted in five sub-components:

      1)	 Livelihoods project preparation.
      2)	 Livelihood fundamentals.
      3)	 Livelihood opportunities project initiation:
             a)	 Initiating livelihood opportunities through associations/ cooperatives.
             b)	 Initiating livelihood opportunities through partnerships or individual training.
             c)	 Adult & formal education opportunity identification and vouchers.
      4)	 Livelihood Capital Input/Toolkit Distribution.
      5)	 Monitoring and evaluation.



      3.1	       Livelihoods Project Preparation
      3.1.1	 Staffing
      The Firm will recruit a Project Manager who will be responsible for overall administration, and overseeing the func-



      1  As a parallel process in support of the Pilot Reintegration Project, the NDDRC will facilitate land requests of ex-combatants within communities
      of return. This process, however, falls outside the specific remit of the reintegration pilot.




334
tioning of the Livelihood Support initiation phase. They will report directly to the TDRP and NDDRC through the
Head Quarter (HQ) PMU mechanism, which is being established to drive the Project. Under the Project Manager’s
leadership the Firm must carry out all activities related to the project necessary for the successful implementation of
the Project.

3.1.2	 Inception Report and Project Implementation Plan
The Firm will be expected to conduct an inception report based on State field visits which will inform a Project Imple-
mentation Plan (PIP). The PIP which will also be created by the Firm will include detailed service delivery design,
work plan (including team and staffing plans for coverage of the various livelihood opportunities), M&E framework,
costing, management cost, and portfolio management targeting all core areas of work. The NDDRC through the HQ
PMU will input into the PIP who will review the final draft which will be signed off by the TDRP.

3.1.3	 HQ and State Level PMUs Orientation and Training
The Firm will work closely with the organisation hired to undertake Capacity Building and the HQ PMU to incor-
porate information on Livelihood Activities into the HQ and State level PMUs (SPMUs) trainings. The Capacity
Building organisation will conduct all the PMU trainings, with support from the Firm. These will be initiated with a
system and process training which will be held in juba for all HQ PMU members and SPMU members as their tasks
require. This training will be created by the Capacity Building organisation with input from the HQ PMU secretariat.
A second training will be conducted somewhere in the Greater Bahr el Ghazal region immediately before the start of
the reintegration pilot on July 15th 2013. This training will also be created by the Capacity Building organisation with
input and support from the Firm.

3.1.4 	 Community Awareness
The Firm will work with the SPMUs to create a community awareness and sensitization plan to ensure the smooth
return of ex-combatants and an acceptance of their chosen livelihood activities.

3.1.5 	 Planning and capital input procurement
After receiving confirmed reintegration livelihoods choices (see “Livelihoods Fundamentals” below), the Firm will
start procuring all activities capital inputs in preparation for Livelihood Opportunities Project Initiation on September
15th 2013.

The Firm will then deploy to all four states to:

a)	 Work with the HQ PMU and SPMUs to identify where all the livelihood activities will be set-up;
b)	 Work with the SPMUs to initiate the process of sensitizing community members that wish to join the economic
    associations;
c)	 Allocate those ex-combatants choosing partnership or individual models to entrepreneurship trainings; and
d)	 Ensure that all state and/or other support networks are in place, including linking up all of the ex-combatants
    regardless of their modality.

3.2	     Livelihood Fundamentals
The Livelihoods Fundamentals portion of the livelihoods component consists of the work primarily to be done while
the ex-combatants are in the transition facility and is designed to allow for market-based decision-making. This in-
cludes:

•	   Transition Facility Livelihoods Discussions
•	   Transition Facility Entrepreneurial Training
In advance of the state-based reintegration, the ex-combatants will receive vocational, life skills and literacy training
at the Mapel Transition Facility conducted by UNESCO. The Mapel Transition Facility is located outside of Wau in
Western Bahr el Ghazal.



                                                                                  Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                                  Pilot Reintegration Project Document - Annex B: Terms of Reference   335
      This program through the Firm will provide entrepreneurship training during this period and will work with UNESCO
      to synchronize the approach.

      In the pilot reintegration project, the Firm responsible for the provision of livelihoods support will brief the ex-
      combatants on their options to accurately set expectations and respond to questions so the ex-combatants enter the
      reintegration process fully informed.

      The presence of the Firm at the transition facilities will also respond to a crucial lesson learned in previous DDR
      programmes where a disconnect in services and information between the transition facilities and reintegration service
      provision presented a major concern.

      3.2.1	 Transition Facility Livelihoods Discussions
      During the time at the transition facility the NDDRC ICRS trained caseworkers will work together with UNESCO vo-
      cational trainers to provide vocational counseling and class scheduling. The ICRS caseworkers will focus these discus-
      sions on market-based decision making on how ex-combatants make livelihoods choices and cooperative formation,
      discussing what cooperatives are and why they might present a promising option to pursue.

      The Firm will then engage ex-combatants in groups by location of intended return. The Firm will conduct these dis-
      cussions: 1) to get final confirmation on their livelihood choice for reintegration and 2) as needed provide additional
      counseling on reintegration choices based on market opportunities (e.g. is there a market, is it feasible) The Firm
      must be very careful not to inaccurately raise expectations on potential livelihoods and job opportunities upon return.
      These discussions, to take place following the conduct of the baseline study, will be the final opportunity for the ex-
      combatants to choose both their option of livelihood reintegration track and the modality within which they wish to
      approach it – whether cooperative, partnership or individual. This will also determine the available capital inputs for
      the cooperatives and the coordination of agricultural and non-farm business development trainings.

      3.2.2	 Transition Facility Entrepreneurship Training
      A 10 day entrepreneurship training and cooperatives basics module will have to be created and delivered to ex-com-
      batants whilst they are in the Mapel Transition Facility. The classroom sizes in Mapel only allow for 25 ex-combatants
      to be trained at a time. Details would still have to be negotiated with UNESCO.

      3.3	     Livelihood Opportunities Project Initiation
      The Firm is responsible for initiating the various livelihoods activities as outlined below. During Phase 1 (by Novem-
      ber 15th 2013) trainings will be completed and projects initiated for all interested ex-combatants. From January 1st
      2014 to April 15th 2014 follow up visits will be conducted in Phase Two: Consolidation. After April 15th 2014, there
      will be no further site visits and any assistance will be given by the NDDRC staff.

      3.3.1	 Initiating Livelihood Opportunities through Associations/ Cooperatives
      The suggested economic association/cooperative module is intended to create economic opportunities for ex-combat-
      ants and support their reintegration into the communities where they will return. These associations would also include
      an average of 30% community members and as such enhance both the social capital of ex-combatants generally and
      specifically the economic potential of the ex-combatants because the community members joining associations will
      already have both experience and knowledge in the economic activity of that association.

      Association modeling for this pilot project offers other advantages as well: economies of scale, a greater power of con-
      trol over land use or workspace, the purchase of inputs and outputs, namely productive resources and their marketing
      and sales. These advantages would accrue regardless whether the association is in the agricultural or non-agricultural
      sectors. These advantages should act to enhance their overall livelihood (food and cash) security making them less
      vulnerable to external shocks.

      As a rule, although there will be flexibility for exceptions:

      •	   All associations will be designed with a shared value added activity/component linked to associations’ produc-




336
     tion.
•	   Agricultural and farming diversification in its production activities is intended to support association sustainabil-
     ity, growth opportunities while achieving social integration.
•	   Non-agricultural associations will also look at either complementary or value chain activities to ensure a greater
     chance of ex-combatants and their community members to exercise a greater control over the value of their out-
     puts;
•	   Size of the association will be determined by factors such as the level of interest amongst ex-combatants, number
     of ex-combatants per payam and geographical proximities across the payams within a state. However, economic
     factors, such as the potential to succeed and available markets for the goods and/or services produced by associa-
     tion will determine whether such ventures proceed.
•	   Factors such as the proximity of markets to associations in rural areas and small urban settlements are limited and
     that the costs of transport and availability unpredictable, will also be taken into account.
•	   Notwithstanding external environmental challenges, experience has shown that the size of the association matters
     when measured against the likelihood of sustainable success. Unless there are compelling factors arguing others
     that can demonstrate the potential of success, all associations will be capped at a maximum of 12 members. This
     means that there will be a maximum of eight ex-combatants and four community members.
•	   There should be a minimum of six ex-combatants to enable the Project to form an association of nine members.
•	   Where are there between three and five ex-combatants, and there is a compelling case that those a cooperation will
     work, then consideration should be given to raising the number of community members that can join, however in
     no instance can there be more community members than ex-combatants.

Participation in the associations by community members will be voluntary, and the selection of members who join will
have to be sensitively dealt with and in accordance to culturally acceptable methods. To prepare for this potential of
larger community interest than allowed by this format, the Firm will take guidance from the HQ PMU on the approved
system to determine membership such as a lottery system or the like. Sensitization with communities, including the
selection process will be undertaken with staff from the SPMUs.

Training on Associations

For all associations following the identification of the economic activity and identification of community members,
training will be given on how an association should be formed, governed and managed. Associations will be governed
by its member’s governance board, which will be voted by the members to include a chair, secretary and financial
officer. Its board will act and hold responsibilities of a board and will be responsible for the day-to-day activities and
progress of the board. By-laws will craft governance conducts. Association members will also be the managers of
its day-to-day operation while carrying their own specific roles depending on the activity or production type of the
association. All members will be supported through the pilot project capacity building component with technical as-
sistance from to set up and through the early phases of associations life, through to business planning and managing
day-to-day activities.

The initial set of activities and supports will include:

•	   (Training) Life skills, finance and cash management, know-how, governance practices.
•	   (Set up) Association and enterprise set up and account management support.
•	   (Running) Banking practices, access to micro-credit, etc.

The Firm will also provide training on the financial capital structure for each association which will be the reflection of
the total capital allocation, which will assemble the creation of the association. In addition, all association will receive
training and assistance in setting up social safety plans, namely: forced group saving mechanism and savings reinvest-
ment plan, which are crucial to ensure sustainability. Those associations that do not adhere to agreed schemes can no
longer expect to receive economic livelihood assistance from the Project. It should be noted that social assistance will
continue to be given, through the ICRS during the larger Pilot period.



                                                                                    Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                                    Pilot Reintegration Project Document - Annex B: Terms of Reference   337
      The Firm will have to assist associations to prepare business plans if they should seek further assistance. If the associa-
      tions decide that they wish to access their capital inputs and not participate further in reintegration activities, then no
      business plans will be necessary.

      3.3.2	 Initiating Livelihood Opportunities through Partnerships or Individual Training
      It is estimated that around half of the ex-combatants will not choose an association model through which to channel
      their livelihoods options and intend to return to payams where they will either initiate individual options or enter into
      a partnership with one or more ex-combatants or other members of their communities. Geographical distance between
      the payams means that the livelihood assistance they will receive will be limited to additional basic business train-
      ing and where there might be two or more ex-combatants wishing to create a partnership, to elementary partnership
      training. The training will be made available to all ex-combatants choosing this path before November 15th 2013. The
      length of this training is envisaged not to exceed three days and might be shorter if necessary.

      Capital inputs and additional technical training will be provided to the equivalent value as in the association track. The
      largest group of individuals is interested in farming post military service. Training on agricultural best practices, mar-
      keting methods, and small farm management should be offered along with training on potential secondary agricultural
      endeavors, such as poultry and animal husbandry, and other simple trading shops with hybrid type of activities such as
      milling, poultry keeping, or honey making as appropriate to the local market needs in order that this acts to supplement
      their income during period of low or no rains.

      For those pursuing non-agricultural training the focus should be on business development training to support the ex-
      combatants to use their skills effectively and profitably where possible. All ex-combatants starting up such enterprises
      will be assisted to develop a business plan, which will detail how they will utilize their capital inputs. Where ex-com-
      batants dispose of their capital inputs for whatever reason, they will be excluded from further livelihood support.

      3.3.3	 Formal Education Opportunity Identification and Vouchers
      Formal education, including adult education and post-professional training will have a limited appeal; however the
      NDDR is obliged to provide scholarships for secondary, tertiary or further education, to the value of the additional
      post Transition Facility training and capital inputs given to the other ex-combatants. A grant mechanism in the form
      of vouchers may be used towards payment of education fees, although further discussion is required to finalize design
      of the specific modality. Other mechanisms are under investigation to determine how best to link up with institutions
      offering such education programs.

      3.4	     Livelihoods Toolkits/Capital Inputs
      As outlined above under Section 3.1.5, the firm will develop toolkit options taking into account the interests of the
      ex-combatants and in line with the training provided in the Mapel training facility. The contents of the various toolkit
      options will be developed, sourced and purchased by the firm to include quality goods with applicability for liveli-
      hoods in the selected tracks in South Sudan.

      The firm is responsible for sourcing, purchasing and distribution of the toolkits/capital inputs. Distribution may be
      conducted at the State NDDRC offices given that a window of no less than 2 days is provided for ex-combatants to
      collect their toolkits. All capital inputs need to have been delivered by October 31st 2013.

      Capital Inputs for Associations

      All cooperatives will receive an injection of capital inputs appropriate to their economic activity. These inputs will be
      sourced and delivered to all associations through the State offices, namely the members will have to come and sign for
      them through the SPMU. These will be in the form of equipment (tools, basic machinery), inputs (seeds, fertilizers)
      or another item that is identified by the group and falls under the threshold developed for each association. It should
      be noted that these inputs will be of similar value to those given to ex-combatants pursuing partnerships or individual
      enterprises.

      Capital Inputs for Individuals/Partnerships




338
Capital inputs and additional technical training will be provided to the equivalent value as in the association track.

The procurement and delivery of start-up kits will enhance the efforts of ex-combatants to engage in productive and
gainful employment; be it as a private venture or in a joint and cooperative set ups.

There are six key steps in the task of start-up kit distribution:

1)	 Agreement on Modality
2)	 Formation of Start-Up Kit Content Lists
3)	 Procurement
4)	 Transport & Storage
5)	 Confirmation of Contents & Preparation for Distribution
6)	 Distribution to XCs

3.4.1 	 Agreement on modality
The consultant will liaise with the NDDRC leadership & PMU to determine the modality for toolkit composition in
relation to the trainings received in the TF. There are 8 Vocational Trainings conducted in Mapel in this pilot project:
Agriculture, Carpentry, Electrical, Plumbing, Auto-Mechanic/ Driving, Animal Husbandry, Welding and Masonry.

3.4.2 	 Formation of Start-Up Kit Contents Lists
Before launching the actual procurement process, it is necessary to consult with stakeholders including the Depart-
ment of Vocational Training in the Ministry of Labor and its field based Multipurpose Training Centers (MTCs) in
Juba and Wau, and other partners and experts. The Ministry of Labor and the MTCs have a role and authority to set
national standards; especially so in policy and curriculum. Another expert body must be consulted to recommend
standard kits for Agriculture and animal husbandry. As a second step, the trainers in Mapel should be consulted on
what they consider to be priority tools that need to be included in a kit so as to enable an ex-combatant to promptly
and independently engage in a vocation of his/her choice. At this point, the lists are to be cross-checked and finalized
through discussions. The list should then be preliminarily priced and submitted to the NDDRC for a non-objection
before going to bid. The content lists may need to be slightly re-adjusted following bid-opening and evaluation of
potential suppliers.

3.4.3 	 Procurement – RFQ, Opening of Bids and Contracting
The firm will then prepare and distribute Request for Quotations to as many bidders as possible, covering organiza-
tions operating in South Sudan as well as regionally. The RFQs should include exact specifications as well as request
a separation in the bid of net cost of goods from taxes, tariffs, transport, insurance or other fees. A clear, transparent
process must be designed and agreed upon by the firm, the NDDRC and the World Bank for the Opening of Bids. The
firm will then contract with the selected supplier(s) after a no-objection is received from the NDDRC and WB.

3.4.4 	 Transport and Storage
Goods will require transport from the supplier to Juba and further to the states for distribution. Reliable transport
options must be compared. Depending on the transport approach utilized, storage may be required in Juba and/or the
states in preparation for distribution.

3.4.5 	 Confirmation of Contents & Preparation for Distribution
A quality and completeness control must be carried out by the Firm upon delivery of goods to ensure that goods deliv-
ered correspond to the goods ordered and are in good condition. If checking in Juba, goods should be checked again
once arriving in the States.

In addition, the goods must either be delivered by the supplier organized into kits or must be sorted into kits upon ar-
rival. The firm is also responsible for ensuring that the kits are prepared for distribution to XCs including clear label-



                                                                                   Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                                   Pilot Reintegration Project Document - Annex B: Terms of Reference   339
      ing and packaging in a manner able to be collected by XCs.

      3.4.6	 Distribution to XCs
      The NDDRC will be responsible for conveying the information regarding the kit distribution days to the ex-combat-
      ants. This must be done through a variety of media, and should include public distribution methods such as radio.

      The kits are to be delivered to the State NDDRC Offices and distributed to ex-combatants by the 31st of October
      against a signature by the ex-combatant and cosigning by an NDDRC State officer, an NDDRC HQ officer, and a
      UNICON State Manager.

      Those kits which may not be collected on the appointed dates will be passed on to the NDDRC State Offices for dis-
      tribution. The above-mentioned signing off arrangements will apply. At this point the NDDRC will be responsible for
      further storage and remaining distribution to XCs. These should continue to require co-signing for confirmation of
      contents and receipt.

      Capital Inputs for Education

      See Section 3.3.3 above.

      3.5	     Monitoring and Evaluation

      Offerors are requested to present, in their technical proposal, a level of effort chart showing their expected chronogram
      and time allocation for the development of each of the deliverables and any assumptions made regarding the level of
      effort for each of the deliverables and the scope of work to be performed.

      PHASE TWO
      6	          Phase 2 - Scope Of Work: Livelihoods Support Activities
      The Firm is responsible for supporting the various livelihoods activities as outlined below. During Phase 2 trainings
      will be completed & follow up visits conducted for all interested ex-combatants (by July 30th 2014). After July 30th
      2014, there will be no further site visits and any assistance will be given by the NDDRC staff.

      The selected Firm will possess the requisite expertise to conduct the following key activities and will be responsible
      for the completion of the following tasks effectively and in accordance with Bank guidelines or any other procedures
      set forth by the Bank.

      •	     Follow-up Entrepreneurship, Financial Literacy & Association and Cooperatives Training as conducted in Phase
             One, in cooperation with the NDDRC state staff. This is to include:
            ˏˏ    Follow-up with all ex-combatants and community members joining or creating cooperatives with further
                  training on governance, incorporation, banking, accessing micro-financing, project management and market-
                  ing;
            ˏˏ    Follow-up with all ex-combatants initiating either partnerships or individual enterprises with further training
                  on business planning, governance, incorporation, banking, accessing micro-financing, project management
                  and marketing;
            ˏˏ    Follow-up with all interested ex-combatants (cooperative, partnership or individual) business finance training

•	     Facilitation of an Vocational expert visit/ Secondment programme for interested XCs in vocational skills not cov-
       ered through the targeted vocational trainings or agriculture. 	
While the livelihoods tracks are designed to provide clear long-term benefit to the participants, the participation of
ex-combatants in the reintegration activities is on a voluntary basis and it is up to the individual to choose to take
advantage of the opportunities offered in the reintegration project.2

Livelihoods Sub-Components: The livelihoods support activities are to be conducted in five sub-components:

•	     Follow-up Entrepreneurship, Financial Literacy & Association and Cooperatives Training
•	     Agricultural Extension
•	     Supplementary Vocational Trainings
•	     Vocational expert visit/ Secondment

The following summary indicates what livelihood paths of the XCs in this pilot group:

6.1	         Livelihoods Project Preparation
6.1.1 	 Staffing
The Firm will continue to employ a Project Manager who will be responsible for overall administration, and oversee-
ing the functioning of the Livelihood Support work. They will report directly to the TDRP and NDDRC through the
Head Quarter (HQ) PMU mechanism. Under the Project Manager’s leadership the Firm must carry out all activities
related to the project necessary for the successful implementation of the Project. The Project Manager will also be
responsible for timely submission of all reporting.

The firm will also hire 2 technical training specialists. One training specialist with specific knowledge on business



2  As a parallel process in support of the Pilot Reintegration Project, the NDDRC will facilitate land requests of ex-combatants within communities
of return. This process, however, falls outside the specific remit of the reintegration pilot.




                                                                                                    Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                                                    Pilot Reintegration Project Document - Annex B: Terms of Reference   345
      and cooperatives in developing countries will 1) develop and conduct the entrepreneurship, financial literacy and as-
      sociation/cooperative follow-up training and trainers, and 2) advise on the implementation of trainings. One training
      specialist with specific knowledge on agricultural methods and farming best practices in South Sudan will advise and
      oversee the agricultural extension pillar.

      The firm will hire 4 state managers to manage the Livelihoods Support work being conducted for the XCs reintegrat-
      ing in that state. State Training Managers will be responsible for coordinating the training teams, mentoring the staff
      at SPMUs, and preparing periodic progress reports. The managers will act as mentors to the NDDRC staff in areas of
      planning, strategy and coordination. As in the case of the trainers, a profile that could facilitate easier communication
      and understanding between staff and beneficiaries is encouraged.

      The firm will further require 4 trainers to conduct the entrepreneurship, financial literacy and association/cooperative
      follow-up trainings in the 4 states of Greater Bahr el Ghazal. They will be based at each of the NDDRC state offices.
      They will conduct trainings and continue supporting and counseling ex-combatants on entrepreneurship development
      and formation of cooperatives. The effective delivery of the component will require knowledge of Dinka, the popular
      local language, and/or Juba Arabic. Therefore to facilitate easier rapport and communication, the profile of the trainers
      should include proficiency in Juba Arabic and English with a preference for Dinka speakers. These trainers could be
      chosen from the group trained in Phase 1 of the project. These trainers will work alongside the NDDRC ICRS case-
      workers in providing the follow-up trainings so that the ICRS caseworkers are fully capacitated to conduct trainings
      independently by the close of the project.

      6.1.2	 Project Implementation Plan Addendum
      The Firm will be expected to complete a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) Addendum which will build on the PIP
      submitted in Phase One. The PIP will include detailed service delivery design, work plan (including team and staffing
      plans for coverage of the various livelihood opportunities), M&E framework, costing, management cost, and portfolio
      management targeting all core areas of work. The NDDRC through the HQ PMU will input into the PIP who will
      review the final draft which will be signed off by the TDRP.

      6.2	 Follow-Up Entrepreneurship, Financial Literacy & Association/Cooperatives
      Training
      The selected firm will be tasked with the responsibility to train ex-combatants in financial literacy, small business
      development and cooperatives, including the formation of private, and joint ventures and cooperatives. These Follow-
      Up trainings will build on the foundation of trainings received by XCs in Phase 1. Further training will outreach to all
      XCs involved in the current program. For those XCs that are succeeding in their enterprises, partnerships, associations
      or cooperatives the trainings will provide Performance Enhancement methods. Those XCs who are struggling will
      receive additional training, problem solving and discussions of alternatives. All XCs would be assisted with additional
      training on money management. The trainings will be conducted in the states from March 17 to no later than July 31,
      2014.

      Process

      •	   Step 1: Curriculum design
      •	   Step 2: Training plan & schedule
      •	   Step 3: Training of Trainers for ICRS Caseworkers and firm-hired trainers
      •	   Step 4: State-based follow-up trainings following model of current trainings

      The business training specialist is central to the delivery of this task. He or she will lead the preparation of all the
      necessary components for the effective delivery of the training. He or she will be supported by the team leader and
      the 4 state trainers.

      6.2.1	 Curriculum Design
      The firm is to develop an amended curriculum to include the follow-up training that builds on the initial trainings. In




346
all trainings a balance should be maintained between theory and practice – learning by doing and simulated interac-
tion should be encouraged. The Curriculum and the training modules must be developed, reviewed and receive a no
objection.

6.2.2	 Training plan & schedule
The firm will develop and present to the NDDRC and World Bank a training plan with schedule building on knowl-
edge from Phase 1 on location of XCs and business types in formation. This is to be drafted in advance of the Train-
ing of Trainers and can be adjusted during the training with input from the ICRS caseworkers and trainers. An agreed
plan must be established before the end of the so all trainers receive aligned information and are fully aware of their
responsibilities and schedule for the period of the trainings. The plans may be updated over the course of the project,
as needed.

6.2.3	 Training of Trainers
A Training of Trainers (TOT) is to be conducted in mid-March to early April 2014, as agreed in the Amended Project
Implementation Plan and workplan with the NDDRC and the World Bank. The length of the training should be no
more than 10 days with the exact length suggested by the firm in the responding proposal.

The training should start with a basic course similar to the TOT conducted in Mapel in August 2013 and end with an
advanced session providing training on build-on training materials and methods. The participants will be NDDRC
staff, primarily ICRS caseworkers. The NDDRC staff will attend the basic course which will train them in how to
conduct training on entrepreneurship, financial literacy and association/cooperatives. The curriculum developed for
the TOT in Phase 1 should be utilized for the basic course and can be adjusted as needed. In addition to the curriculum
presented in the Phase 1 TOT, the final days of the training should be dedicated to training in areas that build on the
information and training provided to XCs in Phase 1.

The TOT will:

•	   Discuss training needs of Ex-combatants based on information collected during Phase 1 and knowledge of ICRS
     caseworkers.
•	   Finalize the XC training inputs, methods and approach, and prepare modules for the trainers to utilize in the
     follow-ups.
•	   Train the participants using the developed modules for training of trainers.
•	   Develop posters for creating business activities, exercises, visuals, format for use in the training of ex-combat-
     ants.

6.2.4	 Follow-Up Trainings
The entrepreneurship, financial literacy and association/cooperative follow-up trainings are a core component of the
reintegration work. Following from the Mapel based entrepreneurship trainings & Phase 1 state-based work, the firm
will conduct further trainings through associations, cooperatives, partnerships or individual training – including op-
tions for business development training. These trainings are to build upon the state-based trainings provided in Phase
1 and objectives and methodology are described in detail in the TOR above.

In summary the objectives of state based follow-up trainings include:

1)	 To further support the ex-combatants to utilize the Vocational, Literacy and Life Skills trainings gained at the
    Mapel Transition Facility toward productive livelihoods in their communities of return.
2)	 To reinforce and facilitate the ex-combatants’ decision on start-up of their business enterprises during the training
    at Mapel as individual, partnership and/or cooperatives.
3)	 To further assist in cooperative formation and offer subsequent training to ex-combatants along with community
    members who wish to join in formation of cooperatives and management of cooperatives in different technical
    sectors.



                                                                                    Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                                    Pilot Reintegration Project Document - Annex B: Terms of Reference   347
      4)	 To further assist individuals/partnerships in business activities and trainings by offering further training to ex-
          combatants in business development, start-up and management of individual and partnership based enterprises
          including 1) Individual or Partnership micro-enterprise skills training as correlated to the vocational trainings
          received in the Mapel Transition Facility and 2) Individual or Partnership Small Farm business skills training.
      5)	 To further assist ex-combatants services in handling the start-up and management process such as board forma-
          tion, marketing and book-keeping initially.
      6)	 To offer advice in business troubleshooting such as lack of support family members or community or selection of
          location appropriate to the opportunities.

      Further training will outreach to all XCs involved in the current program. For those XCs that are succeeding in their
      enterprises, partnerships, associations or cooperatives the trainings will provide Performance Enhancement methods.
      Those XCs who are struggling will receive additional training, problem solving and discussions of alternatives. All
      XCs would be assisted with additional training on money management.

      The follow-up trainings conducted will thus include:

      •	   Money management
      •	   Motivating / reinforcing
      •	   Follow up to assess the progress by the Trainees
      •	   Problem solving
      •	   Conducting short modules on setting up cooperatives for ex-combatants along with their community
      •	   Assistance with forms and instituting formats for use by ex-combatants for their businesses
      •	   Guidance for Registration of their cooperatives

      These trainings will be conducted following the TOT in late March/early April through late July 2014. Each XC should
      receive 2 follow-up visits over the course of these months. ICRS caseworkers and the firm-hired trainers will work
      together in teams to conduct the follow-up trainings. The locations of training will mirror that utilized in Phase 1 with
      trainings being conducted as closely to the local communities as feasible. Particularly, trainings will be held in com-
      munities where cooperatives were formed or were forming in Phase 1 and areas with high concentrations of individual
      XCs. The firm will present the schedule and logistics for trainings in their Amended Project Implementation Plan. The
      firm will be responsible for training materials, transportation of trainers and venue rental as needed.

      Trainers will be out posted in their respective States of assignment from after the TOT training in March/early April
      to late July 2014. The trainers will begin providing field (State) based support immediately following the TOT. On
      behalf of the firm, the state managers will coordinate the state-level engagement in this component and monitor the
      progress. The business training expert will lead on the content and form of trainings who will work together with the
      project manager to coordinate the overall effort and interface with the HQ NDDRC staff through the PMU on overall
      programmatic implementation.

      6.3	     Agricultural Extension
      Of the current caseload, the largest group of individuals are interested in farming post military service. For this group,
      Phase 2 reintegration support will include further appropriate agricultural extension training, which will be supple-
      mented with small business training. This training will be made available to build upon and upgrade the technical
      skills developed in the Mapel Transition Facility. The training is to include agriculture improved methods, best
      practices and small farm business skills. The overall orientation of the trainings is to be on livelihood success for the
      individuals receiving the extension trainings.

      The firm will work with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of South Sudan and the NDDRC to implement
      a program of agricultural extension. The Ministry’s agricultural extension workers will be utilized as trainers. In
      this manner the program will increase the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and contribute a positive benefit to
      the communities at large. The firm will develop a curriculum for extension trainings and a training of trainers. The




348
agricultural extension workers will attend a training of trainers and then will be deployed to the states to conduct the
extension work. The timing of this work will need to be aligned with the rainy season which must be included in the
firm’s amended project implementation plan.

Process

•	   Step 1: Assessment of training needs of Agricultural Extension workers & XCs
•	   Step 2: Curriculum design
•	   Step 3: Training plan & schedule
•	   Step 4: Training of Trainers for Agriculture Extension workers
•	   Step 5: Agricultural Extension field trainings

6.3.1	 Assessment of Training Needs
The firm will begin the agriculture extension component by briefly assessing the training needs of the Agricultural
Extension workers in Greater Bahr el Ghazal. Each state Ministry of Agriculture manages their own workers and this
will require outreach to those state offices. This can be done in coordination with the NDDRC state staff. Further it
is important to understand what trainings have been provided to this group, so the TOT may build on this work rather
than replicate.

Additionally, the firm will conduct a brief assessment of the further training needs of the XCs. This is to include:

•	   Outreach to UNESCO to understand the curriculum presented during the Mapel training.
•	   Discussions with the ICRS caseworkers, firm-hired trainers, and XC representatives on the status and remaining
     training needs of XCs in the program.

6.3.2	 Curriculum Design
The firm is to develop a curriculum for both the training of trainers and the agricultural extension field trainings. In all
trainings a balance should be maintained between theory and practice – learning by doing and simulated interaction
should be encouraged. The curriculum should be informed by the existing training provided to agricultural exten-
sion workers as provided by the Ministry of Agriculture. The training curriculum is to include agriculture improved
methods, best practices and small farm business skills. The curriculum the firm develops will expand on the content
and structure of the trainings. The Curriculum and the training modules must be developed, reviewed and receive a
no objection.

6.3.3	 Training Plan & Schedule
The firm will develop and present to the NDDRC and World Bank a training plan with schedule building on knowl-
edge from Phase 1 on location of XCs and farm types in formation. This is to be drafted in advance of the Training of
Trainers and can be adjusted during the training with input from the extension workers. An agreed plan must be estab-
lished before the end of the TOT so all trainers receive aligned information and are fully aware of their responsibilities
and schedule for the period of the trainings. The plans may be updated over the course of the project, as needed.

6.3.4	 Training of Trainers
A Training of Trainers (TOT) is to be conducted on days to be agreed in late March to April 2014, as agreed in the
Amended Project Implementation Plan and workplan with the NDDRC and the World Bank. The length of the train-
ing should be no more than 10 days with the exact length suggested by the firm in the responding proposal. The
participants will be Ministry of Agriculture state Agriculture Extension Workers. The NDDRC will request that 11
Agricultural Extension workers be made available for the training and following extension trainings, with 3 from each
WBeG, Lakes and Warrap, and 2 from NBeg. The training should be a training refresher & skills enhancement for the
workers before they return to the field.

      The TOT will:

      •	   Discuss training needs of Ex-combatants based on information collected during Phase 1, knowledge of ICRS
           caseworkers and extension workers.
      •	   Finalize the XC training inputs, methods and approach, and prepare modules for the extension workers to utilize
           in the extension trainings.
      •	   Train the participants using the developed modules for training of trainers.
      •	   Train the participants in use of any training materials to be utilized. Develop any additional training materials for
           field-based trainings such as posters, exercises, visuals, format for use in the training of ex-combatants.

      6.3.5	 Agricultural Extension Field Trainings
      The Agricultural Extension field trainings will focus on agriculture improved methods, best practices and small farm
      business skills. The trainings are to build primarily upon the agricultural methods trainings conducted in Mapel tran-
      sitional facility and on the business learnings from the state-based trainings provided in Phase 1.

      In summary the objectives of state based follow-up trainings include:

      1)	 To further support the ex-combatants to utilize the Agricultural trainings gained at the Mapel Transition Facility
          toward productive livelihoods in their communities of return.
      2)	 To train the ex-combatants on agriculture improved methods, best practices and small farm business skills.
      3)	 To train the ex-combatants on small farm business skills with an emphasis on livelihood success.

      The field-based extension trainings will outreach to all XCs involved in the current program. These trainings will be
      conducted after the TOT until late July 2014, with timing contingent on timing of the Training of the Trainers. Each
      XC should receive 2 follow-up visits over the course of these months. The trainings are to be conducted in local
      communities where feasible. Particularly, trainings will be held in communities where cooperatives were formed or
      were forming in Phase 1 and areas with high concentrations of individual XCs. The firm will present the schedule and
      logistics for trainings in their Amended Project Implementation Plan.
      The Ministry of Agriculture is to provide 11 Agricultural Extension workers to be made available for the training of
      trainers and following extension trainings, with 3 from each WBeG, Lakes and Warrap, and 2 from NBeg. Following
      the TOT, the extension workers will return to their respective States of assignment to conduct the extension trainings
      from late March/early April and late July 2014. The trainers will begin providing field (State) based support immedi-
      ately following the TOT. The extension workers will be allocated 55 each field days in each of the 3 states of WBeG,
      Lakes and Warrap and 10 field days to be shared between the 2 extension workers in NBeG.
      The firm will be responsible for training materials, transportation of trainers and venue rental as needed. The training
      materials to be used for agricultural extension are to be discussed and agreed to with the NDDRC.
      On behalf of the firm, the state managers will coordinate the state-level engagement in this component and monitor
      the progress. The agricultural training expert will lead on the content and form of trainings who will work together
      with the project manager to coordinate the overall effort and interface with the HQ NDDRC staff through the PMU on
      overall programmatic implementation.

      6.4	     Supplementary Vocational Trainings for Auto-Mechanics & Drivers
      Preceding the reintegration phase XCs participating in the current DDR pilot programme attended vocational training,
      literacy/numeracy and life skills classes at the Mapel Transition Facility. XCs received training in 8 vocational areas
      at the Mapel Transition Facility. Some of these trainings have been found to require supplemental trainings during
      the reintegration phase. To address this concern, a component of the livelihoods support work will be to facilitate XCs
      attending driving and auto-mechanic courses.

      For those individuals who expressed interest in driving at Mapel and did not yet receive this training but are still in-
      terested in this path, phase 2 reintegration support will include driver training and licensing. For those that chose and




350
continue to be interested in the auto mechanic path vocational training courses at a vocational training institute will be
made available. In the current caseload this consists of approximately:

•	   50 XCs interested in driving classes and drivers licensing.
•	   19 XCs interested in auto-mechanic training

The firm will work closely with the NDDRC, who will conduct the follow-up with the XCs to finalize which path the
XC is interested in. The firm will also work closely with the NDDRC to determine which training entities have capac-
ity to well train this group and arrange with those entities for trainings to be provided to the listed XCs.

On behalf of the firm, the state managers will coordinate the state-level engagement in this component and monitor the
progress. The project manager will work with the HQ NDDRC staff through the PMU to coordinate the overall effort
and on overall programmatic implementation. The state managers will coordinate the state-level engagement in this
component with the NDDRC and monitor the progress.

6.5	     Vocational Expert Visit/ Secondment
Of the 290 participants in the current program, 92 have chosen vocations other than agriculture or automotive skills.
These 92 individuals may be interested to pursue an vocational expert visit or secondment program. The NDDRC will
implement an vocational expert visit/secondment effort. Through this work the NDDRC will match interested XCs
with vocational expert visit training opportunities. The XCs can be facilitated in this effort in transport and accom-
modation during their vocational expert visit. Hosts will benefit through the additional labor and will not receive direct
payment for their participation. The state managers will coordinate the state-level engagement in this component with
the NDDRC and monitor the progress.

6.6	     Lessons Learned and Nddrc Capacity Building
The objectives of this pilot reintegration project include to “Develop lessons learned that can be applied to future
South Sudan DDR programming.” To this end, the firm will compile lessons learned over the course of phase 2 and at
the close of the project submit with the final report:

•	   A summary of lessons learned for each of the areas delineated above;
•	   Updated curriculum based on learnings if amendments are required;
•	   Consolidated lessons learned document on the start-up kit process; and
•	   Updated start-up kit recommended contents list.

One are requiring specific attention is the start-up kit contents. In phase 1 of the pilot reintegration project the firm con-
ducted a distribution of livelihood start-up kits to participating ex-combatants. By the close of the 2nd phase of this
project the firm will submit a consolidated lessons learned document on the start-up kit process as well as an updated
list of kit contents informed by the lessons. To compile this updated list the firm will gather input from the NDDRC,
ICRS caseworkers, ex-combatants, business trainers and agriculture extension workers.

Throughout the project all staff of the firm will look to build capacity of the NDDRC through their work. The working
method will be one of partnership and mentoring where appropriate. The firm will support the NDDRC to participate
in the reintegration activities listed above as agreed upon by the NDDRC and TDRP.

6.7	     Tracer Ex-Combatant & Community Survey
In phase 1 of the pilot reintegration project a baseline survey was conducted of both Ex-Combatants and Community
members. To contribute to the lessons learned for the pilot, the firm will facilitate a tracer study designed to compare
against the baseline survey. The surveys are aimed at: (i) understanding the demographic characteristics, livelihood
aspirations and social capital profiles of ex-combatants; (ii) documenting the impacts of livelihood activities on ex-
combatants and their communities, income and savings, and overall economic productivity per cooperative and small
farm and enterprise; (iii) providing broader level information to NDDRC for use in documenting programme impacts
in a post-pilot phase, and methods for improving programme management, and developing new and improved liveli-

      vey, providing a refresher training to ICRS caseworkers, and facilitating the field work to be conducted by the ICRS
      caseworkers. TDRP will provide the trainer to conduct the refresher training and ICRS caseworkers will conduct the
      field work. A total of 16 ICRS caseworkers who are staff of the NDDRC will be involved in this work. Ex-combatants
      will be interviewed during the tracer survey that will take place between July and August 2014, with the fieldwork to
      require approximately 25 days in field. The tracer data for the ex-combatants will be entered into the ICRS system
      while the data for the community members will be entered into tablets. The TDRP will be responsible for producing
      the tracer reports.

                 Consultancy To Implement DDR
                  Community Support Projects
         South Sudan ddr- Pilot Reintegration Project




1	     Project Background
The World Bank-TDRP wishes to hire a consultancy to complete the DDR Community Support Projects of the South
Sudan National Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration Commission (NDDRC) Pilot Reintegration Project.

The selected Firm is to conduct DDR Community Support Projects in the four states of ex-combatant reintegration
- Lakes, Warrap, Western Bahr el Ghazal and Northern Bahr el Ghazal. Projects will be conducted where there is a
high concentration of returning ex-combatants. Community projects will be led by community committees, who will
be trained and mentored by the implementing partner to work with their communities to select a project and create a
sustainable support structure for that project.

The DDR Community Support Projects will be implemented in no less than 8 and up to 12 selected villages in differ-
ent counties in the four states where the first tranche of demobilised ex-combatants are returning. Community water
or market infrastructure projects will be identified for construction or rehabilitation. Water projects will be a priority
for this intervention though rehabilitation of existing market places will also be provided as the need is identified and
as project resources allow.

The selection of communities will be the prerogative of the NDDRC guided by the selection criteria and will be done
at the outset of the Project through the Project Management Unit (PMU) and in line with the available resources for
this component of the overall pilot reintegration project. The NDDRC, with support from the Firm, will develop selec-
tion criteria to identify target locations for community support interventions. Engagement of local stakeholders includ-
ing local government and community representatives will be essential in the finalization of the criteria. Environmental
and Social Impact Assessments will be undertaken on each project to ensure that the Projects are in compliance with
World Bank environmental procedures before the projects are initiated.

This community-driven development/reconstruction (CDD/R) approach aims to promote community engagement and
ownership of the initiative while also reducing tensions between communities and newly assimilated combatants
through improving community infrastructure that will mutually benefit the groups. Moreover, this CDD/R approach
will ensure that the identified infrastructure projects address priority needs of the community that is assimilating ex-
combatants, ensuring key gaps are addressed and incentivizing the community to engage in the implementation and
maintenance of the project.

The overall Pilot Project also includes three other components - capacity building, M&E, and livelihoods support -
which will be conducted by other implementing partners and are not included in this RFP. (See Background document
for further information on the overall Pilot Reintegration Project)

2	     Project Objectives
The overall goal of the Community Projects component of the Pilot Reintegration Project is to promote peace building
in the four States where ex-combatants will reintegrate through a focus on community empowerment and self-reliance.
This component will both provide direct benefit to the communities of return to facilitate long-term reintegration of
the ex-combatants by enhancing social capital and long-term livelihood success. In addition this component will test
the direct community support mechanism for future DDR tranches.




                                                                                   Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                                   Pilot Reintegration Project Document - Annex B: Terms of Reference   361
      The following are the objectives of the DDR Community Support Project in the communities where community proj-
      ects are implemented:

      •	   From a macro perspective at a State level: demonstrate both the NDDRC’s commitment to the larger community
           through the delivery of these 8-12 construction or rehabilitation of infrastructure projects (three in each State)
           and accountability among all parties. This type of Community Driven Development/Reconstruction (CDD/R)
           partnership is a mechanism to ensure that reconstruction and development assistance addresses the needs and pri-
           orities of communities assimilating returning ex-combatants return according to the aspirations and the decisions
           of the people within these communities.
      •	   From a micro perspective: strengthen trust and cooperation between all parties. A CDD/R approach will foster
           trust between the ex-combatants and rest of their communities, as well as between the NDDRC and local authori-
           ties by providing opportunities and incentives for practical collaboration on reconstruction activities of mutual
           importance.
      The process whereby community committees would be structured could having a lasting impact beyond the life cycle
      of the project in that there would be democratic representative structures that would be in place that can capitalize on
      future opportunities. The process by which community committees are selected, trained and mentored will be tested
      and, depending on effectiveness of the process, could be transferred to other communities. This component can further
      help build linkages and provide the foundation for engagement with other community-driven development initiatives,
      which either exist or may arise in the future.

      3	     Scope Of Work: Community Support Projects
      The DDR Community Support Projects will comprise the fourth component of the pilot reintegration project. These
      community support projects are designed to ensure that the selected communities where ex-combatants return are also
      indirect beneficiaries of the NDDRP. As such, these projects are designed to incorporate processes of social capital
      formation while also enabling the enhancement of livelihood opportunities for all community members. These proj-
      ects will be conducted where there is a high concentration of returning ex-combatants. These projects also have a clear
      linkage to broader recovery and development in South Sudan.

      The Community Support Project component will target no less than 8 and up to 12 communities where ex-combatants
      will return in order to build or rehabilitate prioritized key community infrastructure (water boreholes or rehabilitation
      of market spaces) through direct investment. A consultative process will result in the creation of a representatively
      selected group of community members (including youth, women’s, elders, disabled, etc.) that will form a community
      committee to caucus and discuss with the rest of the community which project will be selected, where the project will
      be implemented and how it will be managed afterwards. As such this component of the pilot reintegration strategy
      aims to enhance social capital formation by both building community’s capacity for collective decision making and
      providing infrastructural resources for communities. Project locations will target rural areas where local needs are
      most pressing. In these communities democratically selected community committees (VDCs) will be established,
      trained and mentored to work with their communities to select the appropriate project most appropriate to meet local
      needs.

      Before implementing the project, the firm will conduct a feasibility and Environmental Impact Assessment.

      The DDR Community Support Project is delivered in two phases: initiation and consolidation.

      •	   Initiation Phase: this component is comprised of three segments: 1) orientation of NDDRC and communities 2)
           convening communities to select committees, 3) training the community committees, 4) feasibility and environ-
           mental impact assessments.
      •	   Consolidation Phase: this component has a single phase: 1) implementing the CDD/R
      Parallel to the above phases will be an M&E process, which will be initiated from the outset of the DDR Community
      Support Project. Key functions of this process will be to document lessons learned and track outcomes as well as
      to identify areas for improvement or remediation through corrective actions throughout all of the phases. A separate
      M&E consultancy team will work with the Firm to create a framework to enable the capacity of VDCs to self-monitor




362
and evaluate progress.

The selected Firm for this project will be responsible for the completion of the following tasks effectively and in ac-
cordance with Bank guidelines or any other procedures set forth by the Bank.

3.1	     Project Preparation
The Firm will recruit a Project Manager who will be responsible for overall administration, and overseeing the func-
tioning of the Community Support Projects initiation. They will report directly to the TDRP and NDDRC through the
Head Quarter (HQ) PMU mechanism. Under the Project Manager’s leadership the Firm must carry out all activities
related to the project necessary for the successful implementation of the Project. The Firm will also hire two commu-
nity development officers to assist with the project preparations at the community level.

The Firm will be expected to conduct an inception report. They will also be responsible for creating a Project Imple-
mentation Plan to include service delivery detailed design, work plan and M&E framework to be approved by the
PMU.

Over the course of the project the Firm is responsible for responsibly conducting procurement, accounting and dis-
bursement processes and administrative services related to the provision of the community support projects and sub-
mit progress reporting according to the agreed formats as requested by the PMU.

The HQ PMU will manage overall implementation of the CDD/R component of the project within the framework of
reintegration pilot. The HQ PMU will devolve some of its functions to the NDDRC and the State level and the Firm
will work closely with the NDDRC State Coordinators and State PMUs (SPMUs), which will be responsible for
monitoring the process on the ground.

The SPMUs will be the teams that will have primary responsibility for making local agreements and for following up
on activity implementation by communities, through the implementing agency to achieve project results. The SPMUs
will make contact with local county and locality authorities to inform them of the project and involve the authorities
with a role in approving micro-project applications and supporting community initiated micro-projects.

The Firm will be active in all implementation areas and will be directly responsible for the community selection and
training phase, selection of projects phase and project implementation phase of the CDD/R project. The project man-
ager and community development officers of the Firm will be supported by the HQ PMU and the SPMUs.

3.2	     Local Government and State Level Pmus Orientation and Training
Community Development Project activities will be initiated through an awareness campaign targeting local authori-
ties to be undertaken by the PMU and structures within the NDDRC. This will be followed by training, along with
on-going awareness raising activities to improve understanding of roles and responsibilities in supporting the CDD/R
process. In addition issues of good governance and people-led processes will also be trained and mentored amongst
staff both within local government and the SPMUs in each of the four States. There will also have to be a carefully
measured amount of capacity building, guidance, mentoring and quality control to the SPMUs to enhance their ability
to deliver such future projects.

3.3	     Community Orientation
Awareness raising and orientation will also take place in target communities to ensure that the population in all of the
communities understands the purpose of the project as well as their rights and responsibilities in the process. Follow-
ing the awareness campaign it will be vital to orient selected communities properly on the purpose of the project, both
in terms of process and output and specifically what their role will be. In each village the project staff of the Firm,
together with relevant local government representatives and SPMU staff will call for a full general assembly meeting
in order to introduce the CDD/R project to the community, elect a community committee and select a project.




                                                                                 Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                                 Pilot Reintegration Project Document - Annex B: Terms of Reference   363
      3.4	     Project Selection
      Once the Community Committee is elected and the projected decided upon, the Firm will initiate a basic project
      implementation process and project management training for the Community Committee. Training will include under-
      standing the delivery process, how resources are used, how personnel are hired and how the borehole or market place
      is managed after the project is completed. The design of the trainings must include understanding the nature of the
      infrastructural deliverables, as well as the procedures for facilitating good governance to ensure that these becoming
      genuinely ‘empowering’ experiences and not just mechanical steps to be completed to fulfil the operational protocol.
      Given high rates of illiteracy in the region, training should ensure all materials developed are appropriate and that they
      can be used by all community members.

      3.5	     Project Feasibility and Environmental Assessments
      Feasibility and Environmental assessments must be undertaken using criteria agreed upon by the Firm, World Bank
      and NDDRC prior to committing to complete a project in a particular location and prior to construction. Regarding
      feasibility, for areas where water projects are selected, the sites must geologically have water available in aquifers that
      are appropriate for hand or solar pumps. For the environmental assessment sites must be assessed based on the agreed
      upon criteria which will include having proper drainage, and not being near to latrines, garbage dumps or cemeter-
      ies as well as other criteria as agreed. Best practice guidelines will be used to choose sites that are environmentally
      suitable for the intervention. Efforts must be made to account for any negative environmental impact of proposed
      interventions. If it is assessed that the project has potential for mitigatable risk, a mitigation plan will be developed.
      Finally, the land where the projects will be implemented must also be officially turned over to the community if pri-
      vately owned.

      3.6	     Project Implementation
      Once communities have been identified and the type of community project has been selected, through a competitive
      tendering process, the Firm will identify the most efficient service provider to carry out the construction/rehabilita-
      tion work in these areas. This process must meet internationally established standards for procurement and contract-
      ing procedures and regulations. The Firm will issue tenders to experienced contractors working on water initiatives
      throughout South Sudan. The tenders must receive a no-objection from the NDDRC and World Bank. Bid opening will
      be done at the agreed upon location and officials from the NDDRC and World Bank will be invited to observe the bid
      opening. Contractor selection will be done in accordance with established selection criteria agreed between the Firm
      and NDDRC. All contracting must also receive a no-objection from the NDDRC and the World Bank.

      Once contracts are issued and works ready to commence, the Firm will work together with state NDDRC representa-
      tives will introduce the contractor to the community and inform the community of the tentative start date of the project.
      Any community obligations that are required while the project is being implemented will also be discussed at this
      introduction meeting.

      Once the community project is completed, the infrastructure will be turned over to the community management com-
      mittees to ensure its proper use, management and sustainability.

      3.7	     Monitoring And Evaluation
      The Firm will be responsible to contribute to the overall M&E process conducted by the NDDRC and M&E Firm
      including coordination on M&E design and data collection. The proposal is to include a M&E logframe including
      objectives, indicators, targets and assumptions. The M&E of the overall pilot project will be identified under a separate
      tender and that organisation will responsible for the M&E components of the pilot reintegration process. The M&E
      team will be responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of trainings, community election processes, and the impacts
      of micro project implementation. Six weeks after a community has completed project implementation the M&E team
      will

      be responsible for sitting with the groups to gauge project effectiveness and achievement of intended outcomes. The
      Firm will contribute to any external evaluation, impact assessment required of the Project, including financial audits
      to be submitted to the World Bank.




364
4	     Deliverables
The Firm, under the direction of the Project Manager, will ensure overall coordination and implementation of the Proj-
ect in accordance with agreed performance targets. The Firm would also be responsible for day-to-day administration,
and monitoring and reporting on pilot activities to the World Bank-TDRP team.

4.1	     Reporting, Accounting, and Auditing
The Firm will designate community development staff responsible for training village committees and assisting in
project selection. Community development staff will meet with the relevant SPMU staff monthly to report on progress
and to discuss implementation and financial activities, including the distribution of funds. The delivery plans for each
of individual projects will be developed by the Firm and will be subject to a review by the HQ PMU and SPMUs
who will also review and endorse the Project work plans and budgets and provide support to implementing agencies
in resolving issues that constrain implementation. In addition they will review and assess M&E reports and make ap-
propriate recommendations to implementation agencies based on these reported findings.

Community development staff

•	   Community development staff will be responsible for weekly reporting and a basic monthly report outlining
     activities achieved, impact of trainings, community project progress, and restraints. In addition a monthly budget
     will be presented of expenditures to date and funds required for the following cycle.
•	   All reports should be submitted to the management of the implementing partner agency and forwarded to the
     SPMUs and HQ PMU. Although the Field Manager reports directly to his or her own implementing agency, the
     HQ PMU maintains ownership and authority over all documentation collected in the field.
Project Manager

•	   The Project Manager will be responsible for reviewing community development staff reports and compiling the
     weekly reports to the NDDRC via the PMU and to the World Bank and monthly project updates to the same,
     outlining project progress and major issues that need addressing.
The contracted Firm will establish a designated Project account. Allocations would be deposited in the account for
eligible expenditures as identified under the Project plan. The Firm would maintain a separate identifiable account
to be used exclusively for project-related expenditures for phases detailing sub activities, and retain all supporting
documentation for audit purposes at the completion of the pilot phase to be review by the Bank and donor. The Firm
will develop an accounting system that should be as detailed as possible to allow all the Firms Project activities to be
tracked. The Firm would maintain records of accounts (all statement of expenditures, flow of funds) in such a manner
that they meet the requirements of the Bank and other donors. The accounts should be prepared in accordance with
acceptable accounting principles and must be independently audited at the end of the contract.

The Firm will prepare weekly updates and monthly progress briefs on the overall project implementation for review
by NDDRC, Bank and other donor. At the end of the contract period, the Firm will prepare a final report (supported
by data) which would include project implementation experience, project impact. The report should contain a table of
contents, executive summary, findings, tables, and specific recommendations.

          Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building
                and Monitoring and Evaluation
       SOUTH SUDAN NDDR - PILOT REINTEGRATION PROJECT




1	     Project Background
The World Bank-TDRP wishes to hire a firm to establish the Institutional Capacity Building and Monitoring and
Evaluation of the South Sudan Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration Commission (NDDRC) Pilot Reinte-
gration Project, limited to the work to be completed in Phase 1: May 1st to November 30th 2013.

With the objective of building local capacity, and ensuring ownership of DDR activities in South Sudan by the South
Sudanese government, the firm is to conduct capacity building activities to the NDDRC including project management
training, shadowing, support and systems development. They will provide this capacity building to the HQ Project
Management Unit that is located in NDDRC in Juba, and to State project management units (SPMUs) in the four states
of Greater Bahr el Ghazal – Lakes, Warrap, Western Bahr el Ghazal and Northern Bahr el Ghazal where the reintegra-
tion activities will be conducted. The firm chosen to conduct the Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation of
the Pilot Reintegration Project will systematically strengthen the capacities of local NDDRC staff at the HQ and four
state offices to provide project oversight of the implementation of the livelihoods and community projects compo-
nents, and to capacitate the staff to take over the PMU management at the completion of the project pilot period. The
firm will be highly involved in the creation and continual maintenance of the PMU Project Implementation Manual
with particular emphasis on the state aspects of the document. The PIM must be in line with NDDRC institutional
operations and implementation systems.

The firm will also be responsible for: designing an M&E system; forming an M&E unit within the NDDRC, locating
this within the SPMUs, administrating a baseline survey amongst ex-combatants and a sample of communities within
which they will reintegrate; training staff related to the M&E and surveys; and ensuring on-going reporting.

The overall Pilot Project also includes two other components - livelihoods and community support project which will
be conducted by other implementing partners and are not included in this RFP.

2	     Project Objectives
Relevant to the Institutional Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) components, the key objective
of the overall pilot reintegration project is to build the capacity of the NDDRC through both staff and systems. The
two major mechanisms for this capacity building are 1) through the formation of a national Project Management Unit
(HQ PMU) and four State level Project Management Units (SPMUs) and 2) through the development and support
of an Information Counselling and Referral System (ICRS). (See Background document for further information on
objectives and the overall of the Pilot Reintegration Project)

These terms of reference have two objectives:

•	   Objective 1: Institutional capacity building
•	   Objective 2: Formation and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system

2.1	     Objective 1: Institutional Capacity Building
Institutional capacity building in the pilot reintegration project will primarily develop staff and systems capacity to



                                                                                 Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot
                                                                                 Pilot Reintegration Project Document - Annex B: Terms of Reference   369
      manage reintegration implementation by the NDDRC. This capacity building is inextricably connected with the proj-
      ect management function conducted by the HQ PMU and will provide staff management and systems training to both
      the HQ PMU and SPMUs staff.

      As the primary mechanism to achieve implementation at the state level, both the HQ and SPMUs will be capacitated
      to set up programme systems and learning objectives of the pilot reintegration project in such a manner that enables
      the:

      •	   Development of lessons learned that can be applied to future South Sudan DDR programming;
      •	   Development and instillation of a DDR Reintegration Management system in South Sudan that can live beyond
           the life of the pilot phase.
      By the completion of the Pilot Reintegration Project, the NDDRC staff at both the HQ and state levels will have par-
      ticipated in the full management cycle and through hands on training, will ideally be prepared to manage future DDR
      tranches with minimal or no assistance. The work to be completed in this phase will initiate the above process.

      2.2	     Objective 2: M&E
      The M&E system of the pilot reintegration project will provide critical data to improve operations throughout the
      project as well as on the true impact of the program and contribute to the learning outputs of the project. The M&E
      system should be designed to: 1) provide a continual assessment of progress, 2) create a data flow to inform and adjust
      operations and 3) document all lessons learned recommending modifications or improvements to individual parts or
      all of the components. In addition to M&E system outputs, NDDRC staff training on M&E is a key component of ca-
      pacity building activities. The pilot is meant as a learning experience, an opportunity to build systems and procedures,
      test modalities and to build institutional capacity (systems and people). The M&E component is therefore central to
      the programme system and learning objectives of the reintegration pilot as listed above. 	

      The M&E system will be designed in consultation with the NDDRC. A similar shadowing and mentoring process as
      outlined in the institutional capacity building component will be provided to the NDDRC staff as well. In addition,
      the M&E design, tools and systems incorporated during the pilot period should be transferrable for future tranches of
      DDR.

      3	     Scope of Work: Capacity Building
      An Institutional Capacity Building Implementing Partner (firm) will be contracted to execute the activities listed be-
      low. The Institutional Capacity Building Component will be conducted through systems development, as well as train-
      ing and shadow mentoring of the National DDR Commission (NDDRC) staff within the overall Project Management
      Unit (PMU) and in the four state-level PMUs. The selected firm will be responsible for the completion of the following
      tasks effectively and in accordance with Bank guidelines or any other procedures set forth by the Bank.

      3.1	     Project Preparation
      The selected organization will submit an inception report based on State field visits and a Project Implementation Plan
      (PIP), including a detailed outline of staffing and costing plans to facilitate the institutionalization of the SPMUs in
      the four states. The plan will be developed jointly with the NDDRC through the HQ PMU and reviewed and cleared
      by the World Bank.

      3.2	     Shadow Mentoring And Capacity Building Of NDDRC Staff
      A staff mentoring modality will be adopted by the HQ PMU and SPMUs through which management capacities of
      NDDRC staff will be enhanced by the firm. The full approach to be taken will be reviewed by the PMU through the
      submission of the PIP by the firm.

      The contracted firm will ensure that affiliated staff offers support to the HQ PMU and the SPMUs in all four States.
      South Sudanese staff will be selected from the State DDRC and assigned by the NDDRC to work in parallel as a
      shadow staff to firm staff as members of the SPMUs where they will conduct work in tandem throughout the pilot




370
phase. The staff mentoring process is intended to build HQ and state NDDRC staff capacity, and create specialized HQ
and state-based teams with management skills to help support future reintegration activities after the pilot phase. The
PMU will be installed at the NDDRC HQ office and within the facilities of the State based NDDRC in the four states
of NBeG, WBeG, Warrap, and Lakes State. Housed in the State NDDRC office, state level PMUs will be responsible
for the oversight and implementation of the livelihood and community project components at the state level. The unit
will be led by a core management team of dedicated NDDRC staff at the state level supported by capacity building
implementing partner staff.

3.3	     Capacity Building of Nddrc Systems
The firm will together with the HQ PMU develop a Project Implementation Manual (PIM) that will be continually
updated as the project rolls out to ensure that all pilot-based state operations systems are in line with NDDRC institu-
tional operations and implementation systems and the HQ PMU implementation and operations procedures. In addi-
tion the firm will be responsible for recommending operational systems at the state and HQ level. The firm will then
be responsible for mentoring the SPMUs in implementing the approved operational systems.

3.4	     PMU Trainings
The firm will conduct PMU trainings. First, once the PIM is created, a systems and process training will be held at
HQ for all HQ PMU members and state technical PMU members as their tasks require. This training will be created
with input from the PMU secretariat. Second, a SPMU training will be held somewhere in the Greater Bahr el Ghazal
region immediately before the start of the reintegration pilot on July 15th 2013. This training will also be created with
input from the PMU secretariat.

3.5	     Project Management Support In Tandem With Nddrc State Staff
The SPMUs will provide oversight of the livelihood and community projects components of the pilot reintegration
project. In the role as mentor to the SPMUs, the firm must bring project management techniques and systems expe-
rience to the state offices to ensure the state NDDRC offices can provide the necessary project management during
the pilot. The SPMUs will provide project management support for the core socio-economic reintegration livelihood
activities while also providing a forum for capacity building to the NDDRC. During the pilot reintegration pilot phase,
TDRP will provide direct oversight of financial and procurement activities, in accordance with World Bank rules and
requirements.

4	     Scope of Work: M&E
An independent M&E system will be put in place that will operate throughout the pilot program. The M&E system
will be designed to track achievements and progress of the project, to provide updated information to guide decision-
making, to detect problems as they arise and ultimately to assess the overall impact the project and to identify lessons
learned to inform the NDDRC at project closure.

The selected firm will be responsible for implementing the M&E system which will include an on-going monitoring
process the NDDRC’s ICRS database. The M&E will include a baseline study to be conducted with all ex-combatants
while they are in the transition facility and a baseline study of a sample of communities. The M&E of the DDR pilot
reintegration project will contribute significantly to its effectiveness and will draw the necessary lessons to improve
the overall DDR programme. To do this, a mechanism for monitoring and evaluation will be created that is participa-
tory and interactive with relevant and measurable indicators of the effects and results of the project.

The M&E lead for the firm will report to the PMU steering committee, but will be directly responsible to the TDRP
for outputs. A TDRP external M&E consultant will be engaged to design the pilot monitoring and evaluation plan to
be implemented by the various players engaged in pilot activities and components.

The selected firm will be responsible for the completion of the following tasks effectively and in accordance with Bank
guidelines or any other procedures set forth by the Bank.

                                                                                  Pilot Reintegration Project Document - Annex B: Terms of Reference   371
      4.1	     M&E Framework, System and Unit at The HQ PMU
      An M&E unit will be set up within the HQ PMU team, which will create the necessary synergies with the NDDRC
      ICRS project, NDDRC offices linked to reintegration and all other external implementing partners and stakeholders.

      This M&E team will set out a program plan, which will include all measures and indicators, the execution of their
      duties and a mentoring component that will be aimed at capacitating NDDRC staff both in the Juba Headquarters and
      the state offices. The plan must further outline a process for collecting data from Livelihoods and Community Project
      implementing partners.

      This team will produce regular weekly communiqués, which will be distributed across all the personnel working
      with reintegration. A monthly report will be prepared for the Vice Chair of the NDDRC and head of the PMU Steer-
      ing Committee, whose prerogative it will be to distribute further. A mid-term report will be produced the month after
      the initiation phase. A final independent evaluation report will be produced at the close of the full pilot reintegration
      project in 2014.

      4.2	     Mentoring of NDDRC M&E Staff
      The M&E unit is to be managed across HQ and States as a functional team. A dedicated NDDRC M&E staff will be
      housed within each state office. An assigned M&E officer will manage the unit data collection, which will be coor-
      dinated with livelihood activities and community development projects. This staff member will be mentored by the
      firm as well as the NDDRC HQ M&E staff. The firm will be responsible for providing hands on training to assigned
      NDDRC M&E staff and for training the M&E staff on the M&E functions of the ICRS database. Wherever possible
      state-level M&E staff will be used to undertake monitoring activities, both in field data collection and overall report-
      ing, while the HQ-M&E officer will co-author the evaluation reports. Trained ICRS caseworkers from all 10 States
      will be brought into the pilot project at crucial junctures to be trained to assist with the M&E. This way, the capacity
      building process also reaches the six non-participating states.

      As part of the institutional management capacity building component, the shadowing of the firm by local state staff
      aims to leave behind a group of state level M&E officers that are trained and operational at the end of the pilot phase.
      All NDDRC IT and ICRS staff will be trained and mentored on how to produce basic reports on all relevant M&E
      activities.

      4.3	     PMU and M&E Unit Training
      The M&E team members will work closely with the Capacity Building team members to incorporate M&E into the
      PMU trainings at HQ and at the states. Additionally, M&E specific staff trainings will be provided to the M&E unit.
      The PIP will outline the frequency and content of these trainings.

      4.4	     Baseline Ex-Combatant Study
      A baseline and tracer study will form part of the M&E tasks aimed at: (i) understanding the demographic character-
      istics, livelihood aspirations and social capital profiles of ex-combatants; (ii) documenting the impacts of livelihood
      activities on ex-combatants and their communities, income and savings, and overall economic productivity per co-
      operative and small farm and enterprise; (iii) providing broader level information to NDDRC for use in documenting
      programme impacts in a post-pilot phase, and methods for improving programme management, and developing new
      and improved livelihood and capacity building products and services.

      The firm will be responsible for finalizing the baseline survey and training ICRS caseworkers and providing necessary
      supplemental researchers to conduct the baseline survey. A total of 10 ICRS caseworkers who are staff of the NDDRC
      will be trained to collect the data and enter this into the ICRS. The firm will be responsible for supplementing the
      research team as necessary to complete the baseline survey of 500 participants in 2 weeks. All ex-combatants will be
      interviewed during the baseline survey that will take place between the 31st and 45th day of the reinsertion period
      in the Transition Facility. In the later phases of the pilot, a sample of ex-combatants will be surveyed in a follow-up
      tracer.




372
The baseline data will be entered into a simplified data tracking system that will then be used throughout the lifespan
of the pilot reintegration project and will be available for use in the future programme.

The firm will be responsible for producing a baseline ex-combatant report within 2 weeks of completion of the last
data entry into the ICRS.

4.5	     Baseline Community Study
In addition, during the reinsertion period (April 15th - July 14th) the firm will conduct a baseline survey of a sample
of communities that is representative of the various location types where ex-combatants return will be interviewed. In
a later phase of the pilot a tracer study will be conducted.

This baseline data will also be entered into the simplified data tracking system that will then be used throughout the
lifespan of the pilot reintegration project and will be available for use in the future programme.

The firm will be responsible for producing a baseline community report within 2 weeks of completion of the last data
entry.

4.6	     Coordination with The ICRS
Research inputs will be entered into the ICRS and findings will be generated against sets of indicators, feeding into
different status reports to provide project status and policy guidance. These reports will be accessible to the HQ PMUs
and SPMUs. The firm will work closely with the ICRS team to ensure complementarity of the systems and trouble
shoot over the course of the pilot.

4.7	     Ongoing Service Monitoring and Reporting
The M&E system will be relied upon to capture ongoing service implementation outputs. This will require ongoing
Implementing Partner data collection. To achieve this, the M&E Unit will need to ensure coordination between the
M&E Unit, the HQ PMU, the SPMUs, and the implementing partners.

The M&E unit will be responsible for the Weekly and monthly progress on all components of the project and the com-
pilation of a data set within the ICRS management information system that will be used as both a means of analyzing
the pilot but also as a baseline to monitor future impact.

5	     Deliverables
The Firm, under the direction of the Project Manager, would ensure overall coordination and implementation of the
Project in accordance with agreed performance targets. The firm would also be responsible for day-to-day administra-
tion, and monitoring and reporting on pilot activities to the World Bank-TDRP team.

5.1	     Duration of Appointment
The firm will be hired to complete from April 15th to November 30th 2013, namely to cover Phase One, activities
of this component of the pilot reintegration project. The firm will be invited to tender for the new RFP, linked to this
component (capacity building and M&E) in June 2013.

5.2	     Reporting, Accounting, and Auditing
The contracted firm will establish a designated Project account. Allocations would be deposited in the account for
eligible expenditures as identified under the Project plan. The Firm would maintain a separate identifiable account to
be used exclusively for project-related expenditures for phases detailing sub activities, and retain all supporting docu-
mentation for audit purposes at the completion of the pilot phase to be review by the Bank and donor.

The Firm will develop an accounting system that should be as detailed as possible to allow all the firms Project activi-
ties to be tracked, but not limited, to the following:




                                                                                  Republic of South Sudan National DDR Programme - 2013-2014 Pilot

      •	     Administration and operations of each activities assigned to the firm.
      •	     Institution building activities and their impact – should include details of capacity building programs e.g. trainings
             received, equipment procured and other.
      •	     Performance indicators against which the implementation experience is measured.
      •	     Data that would assist in assessing impact against the base line targeted of 500 ex-combatants.
      •	     Financial and accounting procedures.
      For the financial control of project operations, the Firm would be responsible for keeping the above mentioned data up
      to date. The Firm would maintain records of accounts (all statement of expenditures, flow of funds) in such a manner
      that they meet the requirements of the Bank and other donors. The accounts should be prepared in accordance with
      acceptable accounting principles and must be independently audited at the end of the contract.

      The Firm will prepare monthly progress briefs on the overall project implementation for review by NDDRC, Bank
      and other donor. At the end of the contract period, the firm will prepare a final report (supported by data) which would
      include project implementation experience, project impact. The report should contain a table of contents, executive
      summary, findings, tables, and specific recommendations.

      5.3	        Outputs, Delivery Schedules and Acceptance Criteria for The Deliverables
