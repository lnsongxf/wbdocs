I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Burkina Faso perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Burkina Faso
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Burkina Faso
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From March to April 2016, 571 stakeholders of the WBG in Burkina Faso were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a
minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
agencies; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 413 stakeholders participated in
the survey (72% response rate).
Respondents received and returned the questionnaires via courier or email. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Burkina Faso; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the
WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the
WBG; the WBG’s future role in Burkina Faso; and the WBG’s communication and information
sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate was 64%, N=329). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’13 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (page 92).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister were
       combined with respondents from the office of a minister; respondents from the financial
       sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations;
       respondents from NGOs/community based organizations, private foundations, and trade
       unions were combined in the “CSO” category; and the small number of respondents from
       independent government institutions and the judiciary branch were included in the
       “Other” category. There were no respondents from faith-based groups and youth groups.

      North Region, Center-South Region, High Basins Region, Center-West Region, South-
      West Region, Center Region (other than Ouagadougou city), Sahel Region, Central
      Plateau Region, Center-East Region, Cascades Region, Center-North Region, and
      Mouhoun Buckle Region) were combined in the “Other” category. Geographic location

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey indicated significantly
        lower levels of familiarity with the WBG compared to respondents from the FY’13
        Country Survey (weighted mean in FY’16 = 5.6; weighted mean in FY’13 = 6.2)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Burkina Faso, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Burkina Faso, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the
        country’s development results.

IV. General Issues Facing Burkina Faso
Headed in the Right Direction2
          Year comparison: This year’s respondents were significantly more likely to believe that
           Burkina Faso is headed in the right direction compared to respondents in the FY’13
           Country Survey.
          Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, respondents from the Office of the
           President/Prime Minister/Minister and employees of ministries were significantly more
           likely to indicate that Burkina Faso is headed in the right direction, while respondents
           from the media and academia were significantly less positive about the prospect of
           Burkina Faso.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Burkina Faso,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty three
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Burkina Faso. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at fight against corruption.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Burkina Faso, suggesting that
       ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s
       ability to help achieve development results. The area determined to be key driver from
       these analyses was:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at education;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at energy.

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 284  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 391

By weighting, the FY 2013 and FY 2016 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:
