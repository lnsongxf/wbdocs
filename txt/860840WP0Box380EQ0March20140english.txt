Investment in flux

March 2014
Preface
          The Indonesia Economic Quarterly (IEQ) has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past three months in Indonesia’s economy, and places these in a
          longer-term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes over
          the period, the IEQ regularly updates the outlook for Indonesia’s economy and social
          welfare. Second, the IEQ provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and
          policy issues, and analysis of Indonesia’s medium-term development challenges. It is
          intended for a wide audience, including policymakers, business leaders, financial market
          participants, and the community of analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia’s
          evolving economy.

          The IEQ is a product of the World Bank’s Jakarta office. The report is compiled by the
          Macro and Fiscal Policy Cluster, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM)
          Network, under the guidance of Jim Brumby, Sector Manager and Lead Economist, Ndiame
          Diop, Lead Economist and Economic Advisor, and Ashley Taylor, Senior Economist. Led
          by Alex Sienaert and with responsibility for Part A, editing and production, the core project
          team comprises Arsianti, Magda Adriani, Masyita Crystallin, Fitria Fitrani, Ahya Ihsan, Elitza
          Mileva (Part A lead), Michele Savini Zangrandi and Violeta Vulovic. Administrative support
          is provided by Titi Ananto and Sylvia Njotomihardjo. Dissemination is organized by Nur
          Raihan, Indra Irnawan, Jerry Kurniawan and Nugroho Sunjoyo, under the guidance of Dini
          Sari Djalal.

          This edition of the IEQ also includes contributions from Yue Man Lee and Arvind Nair
          (Section B.1, mineral exports policy), Suryani Amin, Abigail Baca, Iwan Gunawan, Jossie
          McVitty and Saut Sagala (Bandung Institute of Technology)(Section B.2, urban disaster risk
          preparedness). Key input was received from The Fei Ming, Neni Lestari, Djauhari Sitorus
          and Carlos Pinerua. The report also benefited from discussions with, and in-depth
          comments from, Mark Ahern, Bill Wallace (Australia Indonesia Partnership for Economic
          Governance) and Roland Rajah (Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade). Peter

 Executive summary: Investment in flux




As Indonesia’s             Indonesia’s economy continues to adjust to weaker terms of trade and tighter external
economic adjustment        financing conditions, with the composition of growth tilting more towards net exports, and
to a changing global       economic growth slowing moderately. While this shift is positive for macroeconomic
environment                stability, it has to date been based primarily on tighter monetary policy and the depreciation
continues, further         of the Rupiah in 2013, the effects of which are continuing to play out. To further reduce
progress is needed on      Indonesia’s vulnerability to external shocks, to minimize the risks of a more marked cyclical
long-standing policy       slowdown in growth, and to convert the near-term macro adjustment into strong, sustained
priorities…                growth over the longer term, further progress on long-standing policy priorities is warranted.

…including                 Progress in three key areas can support both near-term macro stability and Indonesia’s long-
improvements in the        term economic prospects. First, there is a need to support domestic and foreign investor
quality of the             confidence. Recent policy and regulatory developments, including the partial ban on mineral
investment and trade       exports, have increased uncertainty, may weigh on investment across the economy, and
climate, fiscal reforms,   compound the usual difficulty of predicting policy ahead of elections. Given rising fiscal
and continuing to          pressures from slower revenue growth and higher fuel subsidy costs, the second priority is to
make progress on           broaden the revenue base and improve the quality of spending, notably by reducing energy
loosening the              subsidy expenditure. These measures would also increase available fiscal space for more
structural impediments     equitable, pro-growth spending. Third, credible progress is needed on addressing structural
to growth                  impediments to stronger and more inclusive growth, namely infrastructure and worker skills
                           gaps, and factor and product market constraints. The policy environment is naturally
                           constrained ahead of legislative elections in April and the presidential election in July.
                           However, in light of ongoing economic risks and Indonesia’s ambitious development
                           agenda, laying the groundwork for future reforms, minimizing policy uncertainty, and
                           making continued reform progress in some areas, should remain a priority.

Global economic            The global economy continues to strengthen gradually, led by the ongoing recovery in high-
conditions are also        income economies, notably the US and the Euro Area. This is broadly positive for emerging
shifting, bringing         market economies (EMEs) including Indonesia, since it means a general strengthening in
challenges for             trade flows. However, the price trajectories of many commodities, which together account
Indonesia                  for about two-thirds of Indonesia’s goods exports, remain subdued, and downward price

                          pressures may continue due to supply-side factors, and China’s continued rebalancing away
                          from credit-fueled investment. In addition, the pricing-in of a gradual withdrawal of
                          extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy in the US is placing upward pressure on
                          global interest rates. Portfolio investment inflows to EMEs have slumped as investors assess
                          adjustment risks and longer-term relative growth prospects, with markets appearing
                          increasingly to differentiate amongst countries on the basis of domestic vulnerabilities.

Indonesia’s economic      Indonesia’s economy continued to rebalance in the fourth quarter of 2013, adjusting to
rebalancing continued     weaker terms of trade and external financing constraints through tighter monetary policy and
through the end of        currency depreciation. Net exports provided a significant boost to growth, due to a
2013, visible in          moderation in import volume growth and pick up in exports. Fixed investment maintained

                           impose high opportunity costs and fiscal risks. For example, higher Rupiah-denominated
                           fuel costs are projected by the World Bank to push up fuel subsidy spending to IDR 267
                           trillion in 2014 (2.6 percent of GDP) from IDR 210 trillion in 2013 (2.2 percent of GDP),
                           and above the original 2014 Budget allocation of IDR 211 trillion. Reform, such as a move
                           from a discretionary to rule-based fuel price adjustment, is clearly important and should aim
                           to reduce budget uncertainty and subsidy spending and to ensure that the poor and

                          trade and foreign ownership laws, and the delay in implementing the revised negative
                          investment list, are in fact increasing policy uncertainties. The January ban on unprocessed
                          mineral exports has been a particularly prominent recent policy change, with potentially far-
                          reaching implications for the mining sector and wider economy. The policy process leading
                          to the introduction of the revised regulations in January 2014, and the subsequent legal
                          challenges, has further weakened perceptions of Indonesia’s mining investment climate,
                          which is already rated one of the poorest in the world.

…with the mineral         Through the imposition of the partial ban and new export tax on unprocessed mineral
export ban policy         exports, Indonesia is seeking to boost domestic value-addition in the mineral sector. It is
expected to have a        hoped that this will lead to higher growth, employment and fiscal revenues. Whether these
significant, negative     outcomes will be achieved depends on the extent to which the policy can stimulate
near-term impact on       development of new smelting and refining capacity, on the degree to which increased
trade and fiscal          processing increases value-addition, and on achieving sufficient gains in export and fiscal
revenues                  revenues from processed minerals to offset losses from reduced unprocessed exports and
                          higher import requirements from building and operating smelters. International experience
                          highlights that such policies often fail to achieve their aims. Focusing on the short to
                          medium-term impacts, the World Bank estimates that there will be a negative impact on net
                          trade of USD 12.5 billion and a total loss in fiscal revenues (royalties, export taxes and
                          corporate income tax) of USD 6.5 billion from the current (as written, de jure) policy in 2014-
                          17, including a USD 5.5 to 6.5 billion drag on the trade balance in 2014 alone. While the
                          quantum remains uncertain, negative impacts of this order from the ban, along with the
                          broader economic issues the policy raises, suggest it is worthwhile to evaluate a wider set of
                          policy options to ensure that Indonesia benefits to the maximum extent possible from its
                          considerable mineral wealth in a socially and environmentally sustainable manner.

                         most recent payrolls data and leading indicators suggest that its recovery continues, as is also
                         the case in the Euro Area. Looking ahead, the baseline scenario is for the global economy to
                         strengthen over 2014 and 2015, led by the expansion of high income economies (Figure 2).
                         Developing economies are expected to record trend-like growth, notably including solid
                         growth in China of close to the official growth target of 7.5 percent in 2014. Thus, the
                         international economic backdrop should continue to be broadly supportive for the demand
                         for Indonesia’s exports.

…and the terms of            Indonesia’s terms of trade have stabilized in recent months, consistent with a modest
trade have stabilized        strengthening in external demand due to a gradual pick-up in global economic activity. As
                             measured by average unit export and import values, the terms of trade troughed in August
                             2013 and have since picked up somewhat, though remaining approximately 30 percent
                             below the level when export prices peaked three years ago (Figure 3). This stabilization of
                             relative export and import prices has supported the trade balance and is broadly positive for
                             the economy, but there have been no signs of a broad-based lift in commodity prices.
                             Rather, price developments for Indonesia’s key commodity exports remain mixed so far in
                             2014, with natural gas prices rising 6 percent over the first two months of the year, but coal
                             falling approximately 10 percent, while palm oil and crude oil prices were broadly flat. The
                             price of Indonesia’s single largest mineral export product, copper (about 2.5 percent of total
                             export value), was little-changed through end-February.

Emerging market              Global benchmark interest rates have fluctuated in a fairly narrow range (e.g. US 10-year
economy financial            yields between 2.6-3.0 percent), following the start of “tapering” of quantitative easing
assets have                  measures by the US Federal Reserve last December. Against this backdrop, many emerging
underperformed               market currencies and equity markets have either lost ground or lagged the gains seen in
                             some high income economy markets; for example, the MSCI Standard EM equities index
                             weakened by 5.9 percent in US Dollar terms in 2014 through 13 March, against a flat S&P
                             500 index (of major US stocks). The underperformance of EME assets likely reflects
                             continued investor concerns over the required economic or policy adjustments and
                             potentially weaker growth prospects in the context of gradually normalizing monetary policy
                             in high income economies, and, ultimately, higher global interest rates. These are very
                             relevant concerns for Indonesia as well, but so far in 2014 Indonesian financial markets have
                             performed relatively strongly.

                   2. Fixed investment has led the economic adjustment
Indonesia’s economic         Indonesia’s economy continued to rebalance in the fourth quarter of 2013, adjusting to
rebalancing continued        weaker terms of trade and external financing constraints through tighter monetary policy and
through the end of           currency depreciation. Net exports provided a significant boost to real GDP growth,
2013, with fixed             reflecting a moderation in import volume growth and acceleration in exports. Fixed capital
investment moderating        formation maintained its below-average pace of growth, dampening import demand and
and net export volumes       accounting for a significant part of the growth adjustment. At the same time, consumption
rising                       spending remained resilient. The process of economic adjustment is expected to continue in
                             the short term, causing growth to moderate further over 2014. Over the medium term,
                             growth momentum is projected to pick-up somewhat, but the rate of growth is likely to stay
                             below 6 percent.

on-year growth in Q4               GDP accelerated over the same period, to 13.2 percent yoy, as a result of a rise in the GDP
2013                               deflator of 7.1 percent yoy. For 2013 as a whole, real GDP growth moderated to 5.8 percent
                                   from 6.3 percent in 2012, owing to somewhat weaker domestic demand.

                                   percent in Q3. Partly as a result of the deceleration in fixed investment growth and the

Recent high frequency          Several high frequency economic activity indicators, except retail sales, suggest a loss of
data are mixed but             momentum in domestic demand in the first month of 2014. Motorcycle sales, in particular,
consistent with a small        declined sharply by 11.3 percent yoy in January (or an increase of only 4.3 percent yoy if
election-related               smoothed over three months), possibly affected by prolonged flooding in Java (Figure 7).
increase in private            The HSBC Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for Indonesia’s manufacturing sector, at 50.5
consumption                    in February, remains in marginally expansionary territory. However, BI’s survey measure of
                               retail sales increased significantly to 26.6 and 28.8 percent yoy in December and January,
                               respectively. The high retail sales readings point to a pick-up in private consumption
                               spending in the first quarter of 2014, likely supported by early campaign-related activity.

Relatively moderate            The baseline World Bank projections for Indonesia’s GDP growth remain unchanged at 5.3
output growth is               percent in 2014 (Table 2). Private consumption is expected to receive a temporary boost
projected over the             ahead of the April and July elections. Nevertheless, tighter credit conditions are likely to
medium term                    affect somewhat household spending in 2014. Similarly, investment growth is expected to
                               remain subdued in the short term on account of higher borrowing costs, lower commodity
                               prices and higher import costs driven by the weaker Rupiah. Export growth is projected to
                               rise gradually as external demand conditions improve (see Section 1). However, the
                               contribution of net exports to growth is expected to decline somewhat over the forecast
                               horizon as import growth recovers in line with the projected increase in domestic demand.

                   3. Core inflation has been gradually rising
Upward inflationary          Having risen sharply after the June 2013 increase in subsidized fuel prices, monthly
pressures have mostly        consumer price inflation declined substantially in the final months of 2013, but has recently
faded, except the pass-      increased again on the back of seasonal factors. At the same time, core inflation declined
through from Rupiah          towards the end of 2013 but has recently pushed higher, partly in delayed response to a
depreciation                 weaker Rupiah. In the short term, the lags in the pass-through effect to the economy of
                             earlier rate increases should keep inflationary pressures in check.

Seasonal factors              Consumer price pressures subsided in the second half of 2013, after the 33 percent average
pushed up headline            increase in subsidized fuel prices which took effect on June 22 (Figure 8). Weakening
inflation in recent           domestic demand contributed to the deceleration in monthly inflation. An additional factor
months…                       was the tighter financing conditions caused by foreign capital outflows in the second half of
                              last year and the increase in the Bank Indonesia’s (BI) policy rate from 5.75 percent in May
                              to 7.50 percent in December. In December 2013 and January 2014, at the height of the rainy
                              season, consumer prices rose again sequentially. In year-on-year terms, CPI inflation stood at
                              8.2 percent in January 2014 and declined to 7.7 percent in February.

…while food price              Food price inflation continued to decline to 8.8 percent yoy in February 2014 from a high of
inflation continued to         15.1 percent yoy in August last year, during Ramadan. The lower food price pressures
ease…                          observed in recent months were caused by price deflation in some key foods such as red
                               chilies and onions in some cities in Sumatra and the eastern Indonesian regions, which
                               compensated for increases in the prices of foods such as rice, flour and beef. Heavy rains
                               since December and the disruption caused by the eruption of the Mount Kelud volcano in
                               East Java in February do not seem to have had a significant impact on national food price
                               inflation.

… but the gap between          In contrast, a weaker rice harvest on account of heavy floods in Indonesia has resulted in a
domestic and                   larger gap between domestic and international rice prices. In December 2013, comparable
international rice             international rice prices (represented by the Vietnam medium quality benchmark) were 41-52
prices has widened             percent cheaper than domestic wholesale rice prices, and the gap rose to 70-83 percent in
                               February 2014. Recent developments in the price gap were driven by three factors: falling
                               international rice prices due to over-supply of rice in the international market, increasing
                               domestic rice prices (up by 7.3-10.3 percent yoy), and the depreciation of the Rupiah against
                               the US Dollar.

Core inflation has             Core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, declined in the fourth
risen, partly as a result      quarter of 2013 but has risen again early this year. In year-on-year terms, core CPI inflation
of Rupiah depreciation         has increased from 4.0 percent yoy in June 2013 to 5.3 percent yoy in February 2014, its
                               highest monthly reading since June 2009. This was due in part to the pass-through to
                               domestic prices of the weaker Rupiah, which depreciated by 25 percent between May 2013
                               and January 2014 before appreciating by around 5 percent in February (Figure 8).

Headline inflation is          Looking forward, year-on-year headline inflation is expected to peak in the second quarter of
expected to fall just          2014. Afterwards, inflationary pressures are projected to decline on account of favorable
below BI’s target              base effects and weaker growth. By the end of 2014, monthly CPI inflation is expected to
ceiling by end-2014            fall just below the ceiling of the BI’s current target band of 3.5-5.5 percent yoy and to remain
                               there until end-2015. Core inflation is expected to follow broadly the same trajectory, as the
                               adverse effects of the exchange rate depreciation diminish. The risks to the base case
                               projections are balanced and are related to the likelihood of further Rupiah weakness and
                               future administered price increases, the size of the impact of higher election-related
                               spending, set against weaker domestic demand and credit growth.

                    4. Strong balance of payments performance in Q4, but risks lie ahead
Indonesia’s current            Indonesia’s balance of payments turned positive in the last quarter of 2014 after three
account balance                consecutive quarters of deficit, replenishing reserves (Figure 10). The strong performance
improved in Q4 but             was driven by a solid outturn in the goods trade balance, partly, but not only, on the back of
this was in part due to        increased mineral exports ahead of the introduction of the mineral export ban in January.
temporary factors              Import compression continued, with capital and intermediate goods imports leveling off and
                               consumption goods growing weakly. Government debt issuance and foreign private
                               borrowing, and repatriation of currency and deposits, helped finance the USD 4 billion
                               current account deficit. Despite the improvement in the last quarter of 2013, the basic
                               balance, defined as the sum of the current account balance and net direct investment, is
                               projected to remain negative in the near term, implying that Indonesia’s net external
                               financing will likely continue to rely on potentially volatile portfolio and other investment
                               inflows.

                                percent of the year-on-year fall in exports in the first month of 2014 (Figure 12). The value
                                of ores, slag and ash exports declined from USD 970 million in December 2013 to USD 290
                                million January 2014. The World Bank estimates export losses associated with the raw
                                mineral export ban, relative to a base line of no ban and no export tax, of USD 5.3-7 billion
                                for the full year. The impact of the mineral export ban is being compounded by delays in
                                issuing export permits for processed minerals. For further discussion of the mineral export
                                ban and its impact, see Section B.1.

Subdued capital and             Import compression has also been a clear recent feature of trade dynamics, although less so

imports also                    quarterly swing in the value of the trade balance in Q4 relative to Q3 2014, they accounted
contributed to the              for 60 percent of the improvement in the trade balance from a year earlier. Imports of
improvement in the              capital and intermediate goods have been soft, with the former in particular averaging 16
trade balance                   percent lower than their year-ago levels in the second half of 2013. Consumer goods imports
                                have made virtually zero contribution to total import growth (Figure 13). Falling capital
                                imports are related to the marked slowdown in investment (see also Box 1). Little relief
                                appears in the oil and gas trade balance where, despite decreasing imports and slowly rising
                                exports, the deficit (of USD 1 billion in Q4) remained a sizable drag on the overall goods
                                trade balance.

Financial account               Capital and financial account inflows increased sharply, from USD 5.6 billion in Q3 2013 to
inflows rebounded on            USD 9.2 billion in Q4, largely driven by flows in the “other investments” sub-account. Here,
significant private             repatriation of offshore assets increased to USD 1.4 billion, reversing the outflow of USD
borrowing and                   2.3 billion in 2013 Q3. Strong drawings of offshore loans by domestic corporates
repatriation of offshore        contributed to USD 4.1 billion of private sector other investment liability inflows, up from
capital                         an outflow of USD 133 million in Q3. Inbound FDI remained in line with the 3 year average
                                of approximately USD 4 billion per quarter. Pertamina’s acquisition of oil fields in Algeria
                                worth approximately USD 2.5 billion contributed to a reduction in net direct investment, to
                                USD 1.6 billion from USD 5.6 billion in Q3. As a result, the basic balance remained negative
                                despite the large current account deficit contraction. Net portfolio investment remained
                                broadly stable at USD 1.8 billion in Q4, helped by substantial net foreign purchases of
                                domestic government bonds (Figure 14). Conversely, equities saw persistent outflows in the
                                second half of 2013, before turning positive again in January.

Box 1: The determinants of Indonesia’s import demand: investment and exports are important
 Import volume growth in Indonesia declined significantly in 2013. Estimates from an error correction model (ECM) suggest that a
 significant part of the decrease in import demand can be explained by the considerable slowdown in fixed investment (which is
 consistent with the observed decline in capital goods imports) and the increase in the price of imported goods relative to domestic
 goods. Historically, household consumption has not been a significant determinant of import growth.

 As is standard practice in the literature, an ECM model can be used to study both the short- and long-term effect on real import
 demand of three demand components from the national accounts and relative prices, the latter defined as the ratio of the import
 deflator to the consumer price index (CPI). All variables are transformed into logarithms and the sample period is Q1 1993 – Q4
 2013. The results indicate that private consumption is not a statistically significant determinant of import growth (Table 4). In the
 short run, a one percent increase in investment adds around 0.5 percentage points to import demand. Similarly, a one percent rise
 in exports is associated with 0.6 percentage points import growth as imported goods are used in the production of exports (see the
 March 2012 IEQ for more details on the important role of imports in export value-added in Indonesia). The long-term effect of
 investment appears weaker, whereas that of exports remains strong. As expected, a rise in the price of imported goods relative to
 domestic goods results in lower import demand.

 A decomposition of the annual growth of real imports shows that the slowdown in exports explains a large portion of the decline
 in 2012, while the demand for imported inputs to export production is estimated to have contributed almost all import growth in
 2013. These findings suggest that import compression does not necessarily lead to an improvement in the trade balance, as it may
 be related to lower exports. The significant decline in investment growth, as discussed in Section 2, is also reflected in the
 composition of import demand in 2013. Finally, higher import prices, in part caused by the weaker Rupiah in 2013, have also
 negatively affected imports.

Monetary policy has            In the second half of last year, Bank Indonesia (BI) adopted a clear focus on facilitating the
been tightened…                adjustment of Indonesia’s external balances, which is proceeding as described in Section 4
                               above. Monetary policy was tightened over June-November 2013, with BI raising the lower
                               bound of its interest rate corridor (the overnight deposit facility, FASBI, rate) and reference
                               rate by a cumulative 175 basis points, to 5.75 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively. In
                               addition, BI also increased the secondary reserve requirement from 2.5 percent in September
                               to 4 percent in December, and the foreign exchange reserve requirement from 1 to 8 percent
                               over the same period. Box 2 provides additional perspective on the monetary policy stance.
                               A tighter monetary policy stance in the second half of last year, as well as lower credit
                               demand stemming from moderate fixed investment growth, has contributed to a slowdown
                               in credit growth. Moderating deposit growth and limited loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR)
                               headroom, especially for some smaller banks, indicate that weaker credit growth is likely to
                               persist in the near term.

…while currency        Turning to currency market conditions, there have been several positive developments in
market conditions have recent months. The Rupiah has strengthened by more than 6 percent from IDR 12,242 per
improved               US Dollar at the beginning of 2014 to 11,449 on March 10 2014. International reserves
                       increased from USD 95 billion in September 2013 to USD 100 billion in January 2014. In
                       addition, on March 6, 2014 Bank Indonesia and the Bank of Korea established a bilateral
                       currency swap arrangement for up to KRW 10.7 trillion (IDR 115 trillion) for an initial
                       period of three years. Finally, on February 19, 2014 the Association of Banks in Singapore
                       adopted the Jakarta Interbank Spot Dollar Rate (JISDOR) as the fixing for non-deliverable
                       forwards (NDFs), which followed the convergence of offshore and onshore Rupiah
                       exchange rates since October 2013. The move sends a positive signal of market confidence
                       in price transparency in the onshore spot foreign exchange market as overseen by Bank
                       Indonesia, and should facilitate currency hedging by foreign investors using NDFs,
                       potentially supporting portfolio inflows.

Credit growth has              Nominal bank credit growth has fallen from 23.1 percent yoy at the beginning of 2013 to
decelerated further…           21.6 percent in December. In real terms (deflated using CPI inflation), credit growth went
                               down from 18 percent yoy in January 2013 to 12.2 percent in December. Since foreign
                               currency-denominated credit accounts for 16 percent of total outstanding credit, the nominal
                               credit figures were inflated by the Rupiah depreciation seen during 2013. Hence, excluding
                               currency effects, the credit growth reduction is more significant than the above numbers
                               suggest, with nominal credit up 17.4 yoy in December on this basis, according to BI.

credit…                        to 13.7 percent at the end of the year. Although household consumption has so far remained
                               resilient, financing constraints may yet weaken spending in the near term, suggesting
                               additional downward pressure on real consumption, as discussed in Section 2. At the same
                               time, the growth rates of working capital credit, which constitutes almost 50 percent of total
                               credit, and investment credit have remained stable at 20 and 32 percent yoy, respectively,
                               since June last year.

Weaker credit                  Deposit growth continued to ease at a faster rate than lending growth, causing higher Loan-

deposit growth and             LDR of commercial banks was 89.7 percent in December 2013, up from 83.6 percent at
limited LDR headroom           end-2012 and close to the ceiling of the BI target band of 92 percent. The five biggest banks’
                               LDRs were below the BI upper limit. However, across a sample of 25 banks accounting for
                               75 percent of bank assets, the LDRs of smaller banks, i.e. those with asset size of less than
                               200 trillion Rupiah, varied considerably from 60 to 109 percent (Figure 17). About 30
                               percent of banks in this category had LDRs above the ceiling of BI’s target band.

The establishment of a     Interbank money market liquidity conditions are expected to improve after a mini repo
mini repo master           master agreement was established between eight banks last December and an additional
agreement should           thirty-eight banks in February. This new agreement is expected to increase money market
support liquidity in the   trading volumes and to complement the unsecured transactions which currently dominate

Property price growth      Property sector lending (about 15 percent of total bank lending) and price growth have
has also slowed down       decelerated since mid-2013. This is in line with tighter monetary conditions, and the
                           imposition of more stringent property loan-to-value ratios adopted last year may have also
                           had an impact. The deceleration in lending in Q4 appears marked; in December, lending
                           growth for property was down to 26.5 percent yoy or 1.1 percent qoq from 30.6 percent yoy
                           or 4.9 percent yoy in September. Residential house prices increased by 1.8 percent qoq in
                           December compared with a recent high of 4.8 percent qoq in March 2013. Smaller
                           residential house prices experienced the largest slowdown, from 8.6 percent qoq in March to
                           1.8 percent in December. Residential apartment price growth peaked at 12 percent qoq in
                           June and slowed down to 9 percent in September and 3.5 percent in December. Industrial
                           land price growth also decreased from 13 percent qoq in June to 0.9 percent in December.

                   6. Much less fiscal room to maneuver in 2014
Fiscal pressure from       The Government’s 2013 fiscal deficit outturn was lower than projected, mostly due to
revenue moderation         shortfalls in expenditure disbursements rather than improvement in the revenue collection.
and fuel subsidy           Marked moderation in revenue growth is expected to continue in 2014, while on the
spending call for          expenditure side, fuel subsidy spending continues to impose significant fiscal pressure on the
further fiscal reforms     budget, emphasizing the importance of additional reform measures.

The provisional fiscal     According to the currently available unaudited figures, the 2013 Budget recorded a deficit of
deficit for 2013 was 2.2   IDR 209.5 trillion (2.2 percent of GDP), which was below the projected 2.4 percent in the
percent of GDP             revised 2013 Budget and the World Bank’s projections in the December 2013 edition of the
                           IEQ of 2.5 percent of GDP. The lower than projected budget deficit for 2013, despite
                           weaker than budgeted revenue growth, primarily reflects recorded expenditure disbursement
                           shortfalls relative to the revised Budget allocations.

Revenue collection and     Revenue collection reached only 95.2 percent of the 2013 revised Budget projection of IDR
nominal growth in 2013     1,502 trillion. This was mostly driven by the weaker realization of tax revenues at 93.4
was significantly below    percent of the 2013 target. In comparison with previous years, this was the lowest realization
that in previous           of the revised revenue target since 2006. Non-tax revenue collection was in line with Budget
years…                     projections, supported by strong oil and gas revenue outcomes resulting from the weaker
                           Rupiah. Overall, total revenues recorded only moderate nominal growth of 6.8 percent yoy
                           in 2013, well below average nominal growth of 16.5 percent over 2010-2012 (Figure 19).
                           Below-average growth was observed for all major types of revenues (Figure 20).

… while energy             By the end of 2013, total expenditure disbursements reached 95 percent of the revised
subsidy costs again        Budget plan of IDR 1,726 trillion, lower than the outcome of 96.3 percent in 2012.
overshot the revised       Nevertheless, the disbursement of the core spending categories, namely capital and social
Budget target              spending, increased compared with previous years, at 89.1 percent for capital (82.4 percent
                           in 2012) and 95.9 percent for social spending (87.9 percent in 2012). The improvement in
                           the disbursement rate of capital spending is notable, although the nominal growth rate of
                           capital spending was down slightly on 2013 at 18 percent (versus 23 percent in 2012).
                           Material spending disbursement was slightly lower in 2013 (85.5 percent of the plan) than in
                           2012 (87.0 percent of the annual target). Finally, 2013 saw another overshooting of the
                           revised Budget target for fuel subsidy spending, by IDR 10 trillion (5 percent more than
                           planned), to IDR 210 trillion. In addition, fuel subsidy obligations of IDR 40 trillion were
                           incurred towards the end of the year but not paid and therefore not included in the cash
                           based 2013 Budget outturn. These would take the accrued fuel subsidy expenses in 2013 to
                           IDR 240-250 trillion. The additional IDR 40 trillion, or about 20 percent of the fuel subsidy
                           budget, is likely to be paid in 2014. This represents about 0.3 percent of GDP and would
                           impose additional fiscal pressure on the 2014 budget.

revisions, the 2014     the expected effect of the minerals export ban on revenues (see Section B1), the World Bank

projected to be 2.6     of GDP deficit projected in the previous December IEQ. The revision is primarily a result
percent of GDP          of a downward-revision in the forecast for tax revenue collection. Lower tax revenues are
                        projected for two reasons: an expected slowdown in VAT collection due to lower private
                        consumption and import growth, and a reduction of the corporate income tax collection due
                        to the mineral export ban (see Section B.1). In addition to moderation in revenue collection,
                        the World Bank has revised up its projection of fiscal spending by 1.4 percent, mostly due to
                        higher expected energy subsidy spending at the exchange rate prevailing in Q1 through
                        March 7 (see Box 3 for a further discussion of fuel subsidy spending and reform options).

                        exchange rate effects. The World Bank estimates that reduction of oil lifting of 10,000 bpd
                        would reduce revenue collection by IDR 3 trillion, mostly through non-tax revenues (about
                        IDR 2.4 trillion), all else constant. Given the continuing significant fiscal pressure from fuel
                        subsidies, amplified by the weakening of the Rupiah in H2 2013 that widened the gap
                        between regulated and market prices (Figure 21), the revised Budget may provide an
                        opportunity for fuel subsidy reform, building on last year’s price increase. The Government
                        is exploring the option of a fixed fuel subsidy per liter.2 An additional option is to set a fixed
                        total nominal subsidy cost limit, enhancing the Government’s ability to control spending;
                        Box 3 examines these options. Another rise in electricity tariffs for large businesses and
                        industrial groups has been approved by Parliament, likely effective in May.3

 Box 3: Following last year’s subsidized fuel price increase, more fuel subsidy reform is needed
  Substantial fuel subsidy overspending in 2013 highlights the need for further and sustained reform to reduce budget uncertainty
  and limit budget spending exposure, in addition to reducing the opportunity costs of such poorly-targeted and distortionary
  spending. Despite the 44 percent and 22 percent increase in subsidized petrol and diesel prices, respectively in June 2013, fuel
  subsidy spending again overshot the revised budgeted level on the back of subsequent Rupiah depreciation, accounting for nearly
  one fifth of central government spending or 2.2 percent of GDP. This experience shows that ad-hoc price adjustment cannot
  protect fuel subsidy spending from volatility in oil prices and the Rupiah exchange rate, and does not guarantee sustained fiscal
  gains.

  Fuel subsidy spending therefore continues to pose significant downside risks to the fiscal position in 2014, which remains highly
  sensitive through fuel subsidy costs to the exchange rate and crude oil price. The World Bank's baseline projections for fuel subsidy
  spending in 2014 assume an average US Dollar/Rupiah exchange rate of 12,000 and an Indonesian crude oil price of 105 USD per
  barrel. Thus, without reform, the fiscal deficit in 2014 is projected to reach 2.6 percent of GDP. If 2013 fuel subsidy payment
  arrears were to be carried forward to 2014 without a commensurate rolling over into 2015 of current year subsidy costs, the fiscal
  deficit may reach as high as 3.0 percent.

  For illustrative purpose, two reform scenarios are simulated to examine potential impact on fiscal deficit and saving that can be
  allocated for much needed development priorities such infrastructure and social security. Two scenarios are assumed to be effective
  in July 1st, 2014:

  Scenario I: assumes a similar nominal Rupiah per liter increase as in June 2013, of IDR 2,000 per liter for gasoline and IDR 1,000
  per liter for diesel. All else equal, this would reduce the fiscal deficit to 2.1 percent of GDP, generating a fiscal saving of about IDR
  45 trillion in 2014, and IDR 97 trillion in 2015. As discussed previously, this one-off price adjustment still exposes the budget to
  future exchange rate and international energy price volatility.

  Scenario II: assumes an increase in subsidized gasoline and diesel prices by closing the gap between current subsidized prices and
  market prices by half. This would mean a 30 percent and 50 percent nominal price increase for gasoline and diesel. Under this
  scenario, all else equal, the projected fiscal deficit in 2014 is 1.9 percent of GDP and the estimated fiscal savings are IDR 69 trillion,
  increasing to IDR 144 trillion in 2015.

  by closing half of the gaps to economic prices

  In addition to the above indicative scenarios, to reduce the amount and uncertainty of the fuel subsidy, the alternative fuel pricing
  policy should strive for simplicity, transparency and predictability to ensure better public understanding and easy implementation.
  A wide range of approaches have been tried in various countries. While all of them have advantages and disadvantages, there are
  two potential realistic options for the Indonesian context, which involve a move from discretionary to rule-based price
  adjustments:
      Option 1: Indexation (with threshold). Periodically moving prices through a pre-agreed rule. Under this option, prices can
       move both up and down. Domestic prices are reviewed on a periodic basis (monthly, quarterly, etc). A pre-agreed rule is
       used to set a new domestic price (or keep it the same), with reference to recent world prices.
      Option 2. Quarterly subsidy spending limits. Announce subsidy limits for the coming budget year by quarter, and then adjust
       prices in subsequent quarters when there is a breach in the target, which would limit the fiscal exposure of the Budget. The
       quarterly limits would be based on observed fuel consumption patterns and assumed prices, converted into Rupiah. This
       would allow adjustment of prices in the subsequent quarter based on the prior quarter’s total subsidy spending. The basis
       upon which this could be done would be transparent and rule-based, aiming to depoliticize the price adjustment process.

                           has recently improved, as highlighted above, but, nevertheless, a resumption of heightened
                           volatility in external financing conditions remains a risk, particularly as the US Federal
                           Reserve continues to “taper”. Similarly, the expected improvement in Indonesia’s trading
                           partner growth is supportive of exports, but there is still a risk of weaker than projected
                           external demand, in particular in relation to the trade impact of China’s economic
                           rebalancing. China’s economic trajectory may also further impact commodity prices,
                           decreases in which pose another external downside risk to the outlook.

…while uncertainty         Until now most of the macroeconomic adjustment in Indonesia has come from fixed
remains around the         investment, while private consumption has continued to grow at a robust rate. There is a risk
path of                    that slower credit and property price growth (see Section 5) and higher real interest rates,
macroeconomic              could have a more negative than anticipated impact on investment, including building
adjustment…                investment and construction (which have so far remained resilient), and consumption.
                           Further exchange rate depreciation or volatility may also weigh on the economy, by raising
                           the domestic prices of imported goods (both investment and consumption goods), the
                           Rupiah costs of foreign-currency debt on private and public sector balance sheets, as well as
                           through the fiscal burden of fuel subsidies (see Box 3). In addition to these downside risks,
                           the effect of the upcoming national elections on consumption, through campaign-related
                           spending, and on investment, through heightened policy uncertainty, is another risk factor.

... with vulnerabilities   The World Bank’s base case projections include a considerable improvement in Indonesia’s
rising considerably in     trade balance in 2014. However, this scenario is subject to several risks, all of which relate to
the export sector          the export sector. On the upside, Section 4 showed that non-commodity exports have not
                           yet responded to the more competitive exchange rate, and could therefore provide a positive
                           surprise if not held back by structural constraints. On the downside, recent policies limiting
                           the export of minerals, constraining foreign ownership, raising export taxes, and suppressing
                           imports are likely to reduce exporters’ margins, and may also weigh on future FDI.

The macroeconomic         While Indonesia’s economy continues to adjust in a favorable direction for safeguarding
stabilization of recent   near-term macroeconomic stability, driven mainly by monetary policy and helped by
months needs to be        Indonesia’s flexible exchange rate, some recent trade and investment policy and regulatory
reinforced by trade and   developments increase uncertainty and may weigh on investment, both domestic and
investment policy         foreign, and hence external financing and growth. With political noise increasing ahead of
certainty, and more       legislative elections in April, and presidential elections in July, it will be particularly important
fiscal reforms…           to minimize policy uncertainties, and to the extent to possible make continued progress on
                          strengthening Indonesia’s economic resilience and sustainable growth (as focused on in
                          Section C). However, recent policy and regulatory developments, including the partial ban
                          on mineral exports (as discussed next, in Section B.1), and also new trade and foreign
                          ownership laws, and the delay in implementing the revised negative investment list, are
                          having the opposite effect. More fiscal sector reforms to safeguard stability and enhance the
                          use of fiscal policy as a macroeconomic management tool, and support long-run growth,
                          also remain urgent.

B.Some recent developments in Indonesia’s economy




                   1. A closer look at Indonesia’s unprocessed mineral export ban
The recent ban on        Indonesia is rich in minerals and in the top ten countries in the world for proven reserves of
unprocessed mineral      copper, nickel, tin, bauxite and gold. Total mineral export value more than tripled from
exports has focused      USD 3 billion to USD 11.2 billion between 2001 and 2013, driven by historically high
attention on policy in   commodity prices and increasing production (Figure 23). Mineral exports constituted 6.2
Indonesia’s important    percent of total exports in 2013 with copper, nickel, tin, iron and bauxite the largest
minerals sector, with    contributors. By value, approximately forty percent of total mineral exports are currently
concerns over the        processed; all tin exports are processed, while most copper, nickel and bauxite exports are
ban’s near-term impact   unprocessed. The recent imposition of a partial ban and export tax on unprocessed mineral
on trade and fiscal      exports has triggered intense debate on its potential impact, and has important implications
revenues and its         for the overall mining sector and wider economic outlook. This Section examines the policy
longer-term economic     rationale, the estimated near- and medium-term trade and fiscal implications, and options
implications             for future policy discussions.

                            a.   Background and current status of regulations
The 2009 Mining Law              The 2009 Mining Law (Undang Undang /2009) requires all mining business permit (Izin Usaha
established the policy           Pertambangan, IUP) and Contract of Work (CoW) holders to ‘add value’ to mining products
of adding value in the           through domestic refining and processing within five years, i.e. by January 2014. More than
mineral sector through           three years after the Mining Law, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR)
domestic processing              Regulation 7/2012 explicitly compelled producers to formulate smelting plans, defined
but the first                    minimum standards for domestic processing and refining, and imposed a ban on the export
implementing                     of raw mineral ores within three months of the regulation (by May 2012). Three months
regulation was only              later, MEMR 11/2012 postponed the May 2012 export ban until January 2014. In the
issued in 2012                   interim period, producers were allowed to export unprocessed minerals, but IUP holders
                                 were subject to a 20 percent export duty.

The government                   On January 11, 2014, a day before the export ban was due to take effect, the Government
enacted a ban on                 announced a new regulation, GR 1/2014, which upheld the ban on unprocessed exports of
unprocessed mineral              nickel and bauxite but permitted the continued export of semi-processed ‘concentrates’ for
exports in January               the other minerals, including copper, until 2017. However, in an unanticipated development,
2014, although last              all producers, including CoW holders, are now subject to an export tax on unprocessed and
minute revisions                 semi-processed mineral exports as specified in Ministry of Finance (MoF) Regulation
exempted certain                 6/2014. The export tax rates, starting at 20-25 percent of sales revenues4 in 2014 and
minerals and imposed             increasing to 60 percent by 2016, have been described by the Government as a fiscal
an unanticipated                 instrument to compel companies to build smelters, rather than as a revenue generating tool5
export tax on them               (Table 8). It is assumed, in the scenario analysis below, based on an analysis of aggregate
instead                          profit margins for Indonesian mining companies6, that once the tax rate climbs to 40 percent
                                 companies will cease to export unprocessed minerals as it will no longer be profitable.

There is still                   The implementation of the ban may still be subject to change given current and potential
considerable policy              legal challenges and negotiations. For example, the Indonesian Mineral Entrepreneurs
uncertainty in light of          Association (Asosiasi Pengusaha Mineral Indonesia, APEMINDO) has already filed a legal
current and potential            challenge in Indonesia’s constitutional court over the differential treatment of different

exports have been             and how to apply them have delayed the issuance of export permits for both processed and
severely impacted             unprocessed minerals with reports that some producers have halted exports in objection to
                              the export tax.9 The latest trade data show that mineral exports (including copper
                              concentrate) were very low in January.

                              development agenda, it is important to highlight that the above logic rests on a number of
                              key assumptions.

The ban may stimulate         First, that the ban will stimulate new investment in smelters and refineries. The extent to
few new investments in        which this is true depends on their economic viability and Indonesia’s share of global ore
domestic smelting and         production, both of which vary across minerals. For copper, lead and zinc, additional
refining, except for in       investments in processing appear unlikely to be economically viable in current conditions

                              bauxite and iron ore are more likely to be viable if the raw ore can be accessed cheaply,
                              although bauxite refining is input-intensive (especially for energy), placing Indonesia at a
                              disadvantage compared to other countries such as China. If construction of smelters is not
                              viable in its own right, there will be pressure for government subsidies - mineral producers
                              have already started to call for government financial support to build smelters.12

                            Nickel smelters are likely to be the most viable, as Indonesia is the world's second largest
                            exporter of nickel ore13, and the largest supplier of low-grade nickel ore for Chinese Nickel
                            Pig Iron (NPI) producers14. The ban on export of nickel ore may prompt an increase in
                            smelter investment from Chinese NPI producers in Indonesia in the short term, provided
                            that the considerable energy requirements for a smelter are satisfied.15 However, in the
                            medium to long term, new NPI smelter investments in Indonesia may be limited if Chinese
                            NPI producers secure other low sources of low grade nickel ore, such as the Philippines16,
                            and Chinese stainless steel manufacturers substitute away from NPI.

…Increased mineral          A second key assumption is that increased smelting and refining will increase the share of
processing may not          value added in mineral exports. In reality, mineral processing is input, especially energy,
necessarily raise           intensive so the actual value-addition is far less than the difference in the market prices of
domestic value-             ore and processed minerals. For instance, copper downstream processing has three steps:
addition by as much         concentrating the mined copper ore to increase copper content from 3 to 30 percent;
given the high input        smelting concentrate into blister, which is 99 percent copper; refining blister into copper.
costs…                      About 96 percent of copper’s market value is derived from the first step of concentration,
                            and this is already done on mine site in Indonesia, with only 4 percent of final value
                            generated in copper smelting.17

… The overall impact        A third assumption is that increases in processed mineral exports will be sufficient to offset
on net trade and fiscal     lower unprocessed ore exports (for example, because there will be a gain from an increase in
revenues could be           unprocessed ore prices due to Indonesia lowering global supply). Higher net exports will, in
negative due to high        turn, lead to higher mineral tax revenues and royalties. However, as highlighted, apart from
import costs of             nickel, Indonesia does not have global market power to drive international mineral ore prices
building new                up by reducing its supply. Moreover, the substantial import requirements to build and
smelters…                   operate smelters could offset trade balance gains from increased exports, and the
                            construction costs, and later depreciation charges, of smelters will lower corporate profits
                            and hence income taxes (which constitute two-thirds of mining fiscal revenues). The overall
                            impact on net trade and fiscal revenues could therefore be negative, as discussed below.

… Some better jobs,     Finally, although increased domestic processing may well create some better quality jobs in
but unlikely to be more the sector, the number of new jobs is likely to be limited given that processing is very capital,
jobs in the sector      not labor, intensive. Net job creation (new processing jobs minus lost mineral production
                        jobs) due to this policy is uncertain, but could be negative. Mineral producers have already
                        stated that the reduction in unprocessed mineral exports from the ban will result in
                        thousands of job losses.18

                       c.   Estimating the short- to medium-term fiscal and trade impacts

The current de jure         This section presents the findings of the World Bank’s analysis of the impact of the
policy is likely to lead    unprocessed mineral export ban and tax in the period 2014-17. Overall, the World Bank
to both short and           estimates that there will be a negative impact on net trade of USD 12.5 billion and a total
medium-term negative        loss in fiscal revenues of USD 6.5 billion from the current (as written, de jure) policy during
impacts on Indonesia’s      this period. The negative impact is driven by the increase in imports of smelter/refining
trade balance and           equipment and the fall in unprocessed mineral exports, more than offsetting the potential
fiscal revenues             increase in processed mineral exports.

                              increase in Chinese import demand for commodities (as China is Indonesia’s main buyer of

                              research group. The change in unprocessed and processed mineral exports (and

                                exports multiplied by the export duty/tax/royalty rate. The collection of corporate taxes is a function
                                of company profits, and thus changes in corporate income tax revenues is driven by changes in sales
                                revenues, production costs and depreciation charges. In the absence of detailed information on
                                balance sheets of major companies, these are calculated on the basis of aggregate mineral sector
                                profitability numbers.

                              21 The Weda Bay Phase I project, financed by the French holding company Eramet is an exception.

                                While the project was expected to commence production in 2014, Eramet announced an indefinite
                                delay in the final investment decision in February 2014 thus increasing the risk that the project will
                                not be completed by 2017. Therefore, the estimates presented are subject to the downside risk that
                                the Weda Bay project does not commence production in 2017.

Given the uncertainty              The analysis estimates the impact of the de jure policy, and two other scenarios, against the
regarding the                      base case of no unprocessed mineral export ban and no export tax:
implementation of the                De Jure Policy (Partial Ban with Export Tax): This scenario reflects a full
regulations, three                     implementation of the current de jure policy regulations outlined in Table 8.
policy scenarios were                Full Export Ban Scenario: This was the original policy to be implemented from
analyzed                               January 2014: a ban on unprocessed exports for all minerals. This would also describe
                                       the de facto situation if significant unprocessed exports of minerals currently not
                                       banned are halted due to wrangling over the regulations, as is currently the case. It is
                                       assumed in the model that by 2016 the export tax is high enough to become binding
                                       with companies ceasing unprocessed mineral exports as it is no longer profitable to
                                       do so. Thus, the de jure policy scenario effectively becomes a full export ban from
                                       2016 onwards.
                                     Partial Ban, No Export Tax Scenario: This is an alternative policy scenario: a ban on
                                       nickel and bauxite, without the export tax on the remaining minerals. Compared to the
                                       de jure policy scenario, this scenario provides an estimate of the marginal effect of the
                                       export tax.

Under all scenarios,               Under all three policy scenarios in 2014-2015 there will likely be a significant negative impact
there is a significant             on net trade (Figure 29). The negative impact on net trade relative to the baseline in 2014 is
negative impact on the             estimated to be USD 5.3 billion under the de jure policy scenario and could be as high as
trade balance in 2014-             USD 7 billion under the full ban scenario. This compares to the World Bank’s current
15 and the impact                  baseline current account deficit projection of USD 24.4 billion or 2.9 percent of GDP in
remains negative                   2014, i.e. a sizeable contribution to external financing needs at a time of tightening external
through to 2017 under              financing conditions. The negative impact on net trade in 2015 is estimated to be between
the de jure policy and             USD 1.3 and USD 4.1 billion, depending on the scenario. Under the de jure policy and the
full export ban scenario           full export ban scenarios, the impact on net trade remains negative through to 2017, while
                                   under the scenario of a partial ban with no export tax the impact on net trade turns positive
                                   in 2017.

The negative trade                 The negative impact on net trade is driven partly by a decline in export earnings, with the
impact is driven by the            loss in unprocessed mineral export earnings associated with the ban or a fall in production
loss of unprocessed                due to the export tax offsetting the earnings from additional processed mineral exports until

                        d. Policy implications and the way forward

Under the scenario that     Within the scenarios considered, a full ban on all unprocessed mineral exports generates the
some form of an             most negative estimated impact on net trade and fiscal revenues in the short to medium
unprocessed mineral         term. A partial ban on nickel and bauxite (minerals that have additional smelting capacity
export ban remains in       coming on stream) with an export tax on other minerals, as per the current de jure policy, is
place, the policy is        estimated to have a lower negative impact than a full ban initially, but when the export tax
likely to add significant   becomes binding (which is likely at a rate of 40 percent or above) the current de jure policy
pressures on                effectively becomes a full ban. Removing the export tax will reduce the negative impact, but
Indonesia’s trade and       even a partial ban without any export tax is likely to result in a negative impact on net trade
fiscal balances…            and revenues, compared with the base case, over the short and medium term. These negative
                            impacts come at a time when there remains considerable investor focus on Indonesia’s trade
                            balance and the performance of fiscal revenues has weakened.

... other policy options    The fact that a partial export ban, with no export taxes, results in the least negative net trade
should be evaluated,        and fiscal impact of the scenarios considered does not mean that it is good public policy.
looking at broader          Other policies, such as public infrastructure investments in energy, may be more effective in
economic impacts,           increasing domestic processing with lower efficiency costs. Given the likely sizeable negative
second-round effects        impact on trade and fiscal revenues of the ban, it is worthwhile to evaluate a wider set of
and overall efficiency      policy options. A thorough evaluation of a wider set of policy options requires deeper
and welfare gains and       analyses and consultation with all stakeholders, including assessing the broader, interrelated
losses                      economic impacts (on the wider external balances through exchange rate and investment
                            effects, on output and employment, and on corporate balance sheet effects due to possible
                            debt financing, and profitability); differentiating between the minerals as the economic
                            viability of processing differs across minerals; incorporating second-round effects on
                            production and investment decisions; and analyzing overall efficiency and net welfare impact
                            through general equilibrium analysis. Although it is not covered in this piece, the negative
                            impact on the environment of mineral extraction and processing should also be taken into
                            account.

                      mining primary commodities without adding value domestically, as demonstrated in the case

Box 4: International experience in promoting downstream mineral processing
 Policies to encourage downstream mineral processing are gaining popularity internationally and have taken various forms, from
 restricting exports of unprocessed commodities in one part of the value chain to providing subsidies for downstream processing
 and refining industries. For example, South Africa has imposed export controls on many unprocessed minerals and created
 financing programs to promote value-addition in mineral industries. Several other African countries have taken a similar path, such
 as Botswana in diamonds, Zambia in copper, Ghana in oil, and Mozambique in natural gas and coal. In Australia, tax incentives
 and energy subsidies have been used to promote the downstream steel industry.

 While the policy of promoting forward linkages in the mineral sector has gained popularity, there remains a considerable debate on
 its impact, with a recent cross-country empirical study failing to find positive effects in promoting value-addition in exports. Across
 a wide range of industries, shrinking transport costs have driven a general trend towards global fragmentation of supply chains.
 This trend is also seen in the mineral sector where only a very small number of countries that export unprocessed minerals also
 export the same processed minerals (Figure 29). Hausman et al (2007) investigate the efficacy of mineral downstream processing
 policies on improving value addition in exports using trade data for the period 1975–2000 for all countries and input-output data
 describing supply-chain linkages for 241 products. They find that increases in value added in primary commodities are not
 associated with increases in the share of value added in the country’s export basket in the medium to long term.

 Mining and mineral processing are distinct industries requiring different capabilities; a country with a major mining sector may not
 be able to move profitably into downstream processing. Hausman et al’s research highlights that the development of mineral
 processing capabilities in a country has historically been linked to comparative advantages in other factors (such as energy) rather
 than access to raw mineral ore. Key determinants of the location of smelters or refineries for many minerals revolve around the
 need for complementary inputs like low-cost power, access to land, pollution controls and other regulatory requirements, access to
 low-cost finance, external economies such as markets for by-products, and so on, rather than simply access to nearby minerals.

 Moreover, it is possible to enhance growth performance by focusing on mining and exporting of unprocessed minerals and using
 the associated revenues to make productivity-enhancing investments, with Chile’s experience in managing the copper industry a
 case in point. Chile is the world’s largest exporter of copper, accounting for over 40 percent of total global exports in 2012, and it
 also has the largest copper reserves in the world. Since the 1980s, Chile has not focused on processing copper within the country
 and exports the bulk of its copper as concentrate to China and India where it is smelted further (Figure 29); today copper still
 contributes 50 percent of Chile’s exports. Chile has focused on maximizing revenues from its copper concentrate exports and using
 the proceeds to build a strong human capital base. During this period (1982-2012), when there were also considerable political and
 institutional changes happening, Chile’s per capita income increased dramatically from USD 5,000 to USD 16,000 (in real 2005
 USD), while poverty rates declined from more than 40 percent in 1990 to 13 percent in 2013.

                            Section examines the challenge of making cities more resilient.

Many urban centers          Cities are traditional engines of development, concentrating businesses, knowledge,
are located in              technology, and diverse labor opportunities. However, many urban centers are located in
hazardous zones             hazardous zones: zones that lie at sites of agricultural surplus, such as fertile volcanic soils,
                            or in seismic fault zones, or along major trade and transportation routes, which align with
                            coasts and river systems that are prone to flooding, storm surges, and coastal erosion (Dilley
                            et al. 2005; see also Hallegatte 2011). The increasing concentrations of people and assets in
                            hazardous areas is the largest driver of disaster risk and the greatest challenge in building
                            resilience at global, national and local levels.30

Indonesia’s cities are      Indonesia is leading the rapid urbanization experienced across East Asia. With an average
among the most prone        annual urbanization rate estimated at 4.1 percent between 2000 and 2010, Indonesia is

risks…                      and Thailand (2.8 percent). This has made Indonesia one of the most urbanized countries in
                            Asia, with an urban population share of 54 percent in 2010. Projections of urbanization
                            suggest that this figure will increase to 68 percent by 2025. However, Indonesia has yet to
                            achieve the economic returns to urbanization of other countries. For every additional 1
                            percent that Indonesia urbanizes, it achieves just 2 percent of additional GDP, whereas
                            other countries in the region have achieved a 6-10 percent increase in GDP per 1 percent of
                            urbanization.31

planning and controls      However, without strategically planned investments, policy interventions, and stronger
                           institutional capacity, poorly managed urbanization could act as a constraint to sustainable
                           and inclusive growth, and expose Indonesians to climate change and disaster risks.
                     b. A framework for building urban resilience
Three important steps      The World Bank has introduced a practical framework for building urban resilience in the
towards building urban     East Asia and Pacific region. Three approaches are essential and of particular relevance to
resilience include land-   cities in Indonesia.
use and infrastructure      First is risk-based Land-use and Infrastructure Investment Planning that identifies and
investment planning,             prioritizes investments to improve urban resilience over projected risks. When enacted
urban infrastructure             and enforced, land-use plans can control development in hazard-prone zones, facilitate
upgrading and urban              rescue operations, and provide sites for safe emergency evacuation centers.
ecosystem                   Second is Urban Infrastructure Upgrading. Slum settlements are often found in disaster-
management                       prone areas. The typical characteristics of urban slums (over-crowded, poorly-built
                                 structures, narrow streets or alleys, lack of basic services) make the urban poor more
                                 vulnerable to disaster risks. In order to formulate the appropriate strategy for improving
                                 urban settlements, locations prone to high risks need to be identified and existing assets
                                 in these areas upgraded. For the identified locations, one or more of the strategic urban
                                 upgrading instruments could be applied, such as: (i) applying zoning regulations in
                                 disaster-prone areas (e.g. allowable activities and building codes); (ii) implementing
                                 structural and non-structural instruments for mitigation and evacuation; and (iii)
                                 upgrading the slum’s infrastructure in accordance with the citywide spatial plan.
                            Third is Urban Ecosystem Management, which combines investment planning with
                                 ecosystem restoration. This is essential in reducing disaster risks triggered by
                                 development investments. A number of ecosystem management procedures are relevant
                                 to urban resilience, including watershed management (riverbank area management,
                                 water catchment area management, etc.), coastal zone management, environmental
                                 buffer zones, green infrastructure, and urban landscape design.

Detailed spatial plans        Following Government Regulation No. 8/2013 on the scale and accuracy of maps for spatial

maps with a scale             span of critical focal areas, as well as the size of objects of importance being planned. In the

                              considered. This should be supported by proper data validation procedures to ensure that
                              the geospatial information produced is acceptable as a formal basis for legal zoning.

Failure of local              Addressing disaster and climate risks in hazard prone areas with existing settlements and

Rapid diagnostics           In each of the six cities, a risk profile was developed through rapid risk diagnostics to outline
allow disaster and          the story line of each city’s overall spatial structure and growth trends, the pattern of disaster
climate risks and           occurrence and the main affected areas, together with all existing urban investment being
corresponding               undertaken (Figure 32). The story line provides a snapshot of how the cities could consider
priorities for resilience   incorporating a resilience component in their public investment. For instance, Balikpapan is
to be clearly               prone to coastal flooding and is about to build a new coastal road. This investment could
identified…                 become part of a coastal zone redevelopment, integrating a water management feature, such
                            as lagoon retention with multi-functions for both flood control and tourism.

… and common                Common themes emerge across the cities, including issues of urban poverty with slum-
themes emerge across        dwelling populations, and traditional disaster risk management challenges for persistent
the cities                  urban hazards of flooding and fires. With the exception of Yogyakarta, all the cities are in
                            coastal zones and face difficult decisions to balance economic development and protection
                            of coastal ecosystems in these delicate environments. The rapid risk diagnostic highlights
                            opportunities for the six cities to respond to these challenges and start increasing resilience.

                    d. Building resilience with risk sensitive land-use zoning and infrastructure planning
Existing RTRWs form      Detailed spatial and infrastructure planning processes allow cities to incorporate risk
the basis for risk-      mitigation measures into existing practices. For instance, existing RTRWs that have
sensitive RDTRs          recognized disaster and climate risks, such as those in Balikpapan, Denpasar and Yogyakarta,
                         can be further translated into risk-sensitive RDTRs.

Balikpapan is            Balikpapan, under the current RTRW, is implementing several flooding countermeasures,
implementing several     including river normalization, drainage system development and maintenance, as well as
flooding                 construction of a small dam. Public investment has been allocated towards resilience
countermeasures          activities, such as river basin area revitalization, protected forest conservation and drainage
                         system improvements, both at the city and at the residential area level. Similarly, the city is
                         implementing zoning control measures, including strict construction permit issuance for
                         landslide-prone areas. These efforts could be consolidated into risk-sensitive land-use zoning
                         as the basis for investment planning in infrastructure, and the rehabilitation and protection
                         of green space and waterways.

Denpasar could           In Denpasar, risk-based infrastructure investment planning options include accelerating the
establish development    implementation of comprehensive flood and tsunami disaster mitigation by establishing
controls in flood- and   development controls in flood- and tsunami-prone areas. With many new hotel
tsunami-prone areas      developments occurring in the Sanur area, for example, the city government could use
                         building and site permits as an instrument to re-arrange the coastal layout to open more
                         evacuation access to the beach areas as part of its “Tourist-safe Denpasar” campaign.

Yogyakarta has           Yogyakarta, which is confronted with serious hazards from flooding, lahars, landslides and
planned for evacuation   earthquakes, has planned for evacuation sites in its RTRW. These have been identified
sites in its RTRW        throughout the city, including green spaces, city squares and sport centers. Planning
                         measures have restricted development in some zones along the river, with substantial
                         investments in flood, lahar, landslide prevention and control infrastructure. Upgrading
                         informal settlement along the river could be further used as a way to open a buffer zone to
                         mitigate flood impact, but also with multiple functions to develop “kampung walk” tourism
                         potentially benefitting the lower income population from the city’s large tourism market.

                        e.   Building resilience with urban infrastructure upgrading

Opportunities to build       Reclamation has become a popular choice for development in coastal cities. While often
resilience arise with        ambitious, such major urban projects present opportunities to build resilience via urban
major urban projects         infrastructure upgrading, for example where urban upgrading can be incorporated into land
                             reclamation, as in Makassar and Balikpapan.

Makassar can use its         Makassar has a significant number of slum areas including those located in riverbank and
plan to incorporate          tidal prone regions. The city has an ambitious plan for coastal reclamation along the Losari
slum upgrading and           beach, revitalization of the Tallo river tributaries and reclamation along its coastal delta. This
adopt water-sensitive        grand plan can account for resilience by incorporating slum upgrading and adopting the
development                  concept of water sensitive development, to ensure that adequate drainage and sanitation
                             systems are developed and risks are mitigated from coastal as well as inland flooding.

In Balikpapan a new          Balikpapan has six major slum villages containing floating wooden structures along the south
coastal road can be          and west coastal zones. These settlements are highly vulnerable to coastal hazards including
used to upgrade slum         rising sea levels. As the city is also working on a plan for coastal road development, which
areas                        includes reclamation, this project could also be used as the basis to carry out upgrading of
                             nearby slum neighborhoods, drainage improvements for flood mitigation, and revitalization
                             of water retention systems for both water supply and flood control.

                        f.   Building resilience with ecosystem restoration and management

Cities with rivers and       Both Makassar and Palembang demonstrate the importance of building resilience with
wetlands are more            improved ecosystem management and restoration, particularly relevant in Indonesian cities
dependent on the             with rivers and wetlands. In Makassar, urban ecosystem management is needed to revitalize
ecosystem and can            mangrove forests, as well as conserving forests and water catchment areas in the upstream
consider restoration         regions. The aim is to reduce sedimentation in estuaries, particularly the Tallo estuary, which
and conservation as a        has increased due to land conversion and resulting landslides. Ecosystem management may
development approach         offer a more effective land subsidence mitigation approach through the planting of
                             vegetation in recharge areas that would increase water reserve capacity along the coastal
                             areas in order to prevent seawater intrusion. In Palembang, flooding from the Musi river and
                             its tributaries is a chronic issue. In 2012, the city enacted a local regulation to control
                             development of the wetland. This regulation classifies areas for strict conservation and
                             regions available for farming, fishery, plantation, and settlement. Reclamation will provide
                             alternative retention pools and/or water storage to preserve the environmental balance and
                             maintain water quality and flood prevention. This effort could be further expanded to use
                             an ecosystem approach in land and real estate development along the Musi river.

                        g. Now is the time for Indonesia to prioritize urban disaster and climate risk resilience

It is time to invest in      As most Indonesian cities are about to embark on a process of detailed spatial planning in
risk-sensitive detailed      the next 1-2 years, there is an opportunity to seize the momentum to build urban resilience.
spatial plans                Applying rapid risk diagnostics have proven useful as a means to start the conversation on
                             risks and risk mitigation options with city leaders and stakeholders and in identifying the
                             most significant disaster and climate risks. The diagnostics have also identified practical risk
                             mitigation alternatives that cities can undertake through adjustments to on-going urban
                             investment programs.

over the next 20 years       These are ambitious goals. Realizing them requires sustained high growth and job creation,
are very ambitious, but      as well as reduced inequality. Can Indonesia achieve them? The World Bank’s forthcoming
they can be achieved         Development Policy Review, titled “Indonesia: Avoiding the Trap” argues that the country
with the right growth        has the potential to rise and become more prosperous and equitable. But the risk of
strategy and a few high      “floating in the middle” is real. Which pathway the economy will take depends on: (i) the
priority structural          adoption of a growth strategy that unleashes the productivity potential of the economy; and
reforms                      (ii) consistent implementation of a few, long-standing, high-priority structural reforms to
                             boost growth and share prosperity more widely. Indonesia is fortunate to have options in
                             financing these reforms without threatening its long-term fiscal outlook. The difficulties lie
                             in getting the reforms implemented in a complex, and decentralized, institutional framework.
                             But Indonesia cannot afford to not try hard. The stakes—both in terms of the payoff from
                             reform and the cost of no reform—are high. “Indonesia: Avoiding the Trap” aims to
                             contribute to the crucial debate over Indonesia’s economic development policy priorities and
                             challenges, and this Section provides a brief summary of its key findings.

manufacturing exports      grow by almost 70 percent since 2005 (Economist Intelligence Unit, 2012). Meanwhile,
                           ongoing Yuan appreciation, with the real effective exchange rate up 30 percent since 2005, is
                           further eroding China’s competitiveness in manufactured goods. These pressures, combined
                           with slower overall economic growth as China rebalances, are likely to prompt investors to
                           look beyond China’s coastal areas. These dynamics offer ASEAN countries, including
                           Indonesia, an opportunity to attract more investments in their manufacturing industries.

But there are two key      However, while none of these potentially favorable factors will be captured without reforms,
risks                      there are two risks: a risk of a slowdown in long-term growth and a risk of growth not
                           becoming inclusive enough.

First, without             International experience shows that growth slowdowns can occur at all levels of income

of a growth slowdown       from 1981, when its GDP per capita stood at USD 3,939 (slightly above Indonesia’s GDP
in Indonesia               per capita today), it embarked in a prolonged relative growth slowdown, until 2004.34
                           Similarly, Mexico experienced more than 20 years of a prolonged growth slowdown past
                           1981 when its GDP per capita was USD 6,965. These experiences suggest that Indonesia
                           cannot take its solid growth performance for granted. In fact, this growth was driven by a
                           very favorable external environment: the commodity boom experienced in 2003-11
                           combined with low global interest rates since 2009 supported corporate revenues, household
                           incomes and government revenues, and led to a significant jump in domestic demand.35
                           Going forward, Indonesia can no longer count on any growth stimulus from external
                           factors. As mentioned above, since 2011, commodity prices have softened significantly. With
                           the normalization of US growth, the US Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing policy—which
                           led to low global interest rates—is being gradually unwound, increasing financing costs, with
                           knock-on implications for investment. As these external support factors fade, without
                           structural reforms, the material risk of a growth slowdown exists for Indonesia.

Second, there is also a    Even if Indonesia manages to avoid a prolonged growth slowdown, growth may not be

growth needs to be         Along with the poor, this group remains highly vulnerable to food price increases, health
fostered and not taken     shocks and natural disasters. One reason for the persistent vulnerability is that the poorest
as granted                 households experienced a small increase in real incomes compared with richer ones. In
                           2003-10, real growth of per capita consumption was 1.3 percent per annum for the poorest
                           40 percent of households, compared with 3.5 percent for the next 40 percent, and 5.9
                           percent for the top 20 percent (Figure 35). Moreover, an increasing amount of consumption
                           inequality in Indonesia is explained by differences amongst people in access to opportunities.
                           In 2002, 27 percent of child consumption inequality was due to differences in their gender,
                           the gender and employment status of the head of their household, their parents’ education,
                           and their region and location of birth. By 2012, this reached 37 percent. Thus going forward,
                           equitable growth needs to be fostered and not taken as granted.




                           34 A commodity-rich country similar to Indonesia, Brazil benefitted significantly from a commodity
                             boom in 2004-11. This favorable external factor explains parts of the strong growth recovery in that
                             country in that period.

                             properties, land and securities), significantly encouraged consumption and investment against these
                             assets and generated multiplier effects in the economy.

wages                                                    productivity (IMF, 2013). Thus, for Indonesia’s GDP per capita to converge rapidly to high-
                                                         income economies, boosting economic growth through increasing labor productivity will be
                                                         crucial. A productivity-driven growth strategy is also important for Indonesia to reduce
                                                         vulnerability and enhance firms’ competitiveness. Indeed, the political pressure for
                                                         increasing wages is unlikely to weaken in Indonesia. In this context, the only way to
                                                         accommodate wage increases without jeopardizing competitiveness is to increase labor

                                                         by regional standards. For instance, Malaysia’s average productivity per worker is more than
                                                         five times Indonesia’s. Average labor productivity in Indonesia is also lower than in
                                                         Thailand, the Philippines and China. Differences in productivity reflect the structure of
                                                         economies. In Indonesia, more than 50 percent of workers are in two low productivity

the movement of            achieved by the movement of labor (and capital or other inputs to production) from low to
resources from low to      higher productivity growth sectors (a “structural-transformation effect”, McMillan and
high productivity          Rodrik, 2011). For instance, when workers leave agriculture and work in higher productivity
sectors                    sectors (e.g., as a result of investment in agriculture that increases yields), the aggregate
                           productivity of the economy increases. Policies that typically facilitate such movements are

                           subsectors (wholesale and retail trade and personal, social services and construction) leads to
                           a doubling of productivity on average. This movement has largely occurred over the past
                           decade and has been the key driver of poverty reduction. Seventeen of the 20 million jobs
                           created in 2001-11 occurred in services, mostly in the low-end segment. The next phase of
                           Indonesia’s structural transformation should seek to expand the movement of labor and job
                           creation in the manufacturing sector and high-end services.38 Despite the sharp decline in
                           manufacturing productivity growth in the past decade, the average productivity of workers in
                           manufacturing industries remains fully five times higher than that in agriculture.39 Job
                           creation in manufacturing and high-end services is clearly a recipe for increasing productivity
                           and reducing vulnerability in Indonesia.

the functioning of         priorities, but progress in addressing them has been uneven. Decentralized decision-making
markets                    since the early 2000s has complicated and slowed implementation, especially in infrastructure
                           development and labor market functioning (such as minimum wage setting). Yet, there are a
                           few key policies that can make a big difference under each of these priority areas.




                           38 The skills requirement for entering the high-end services sector is however higher, implying that the
                             scope for job creation in manufacturing is much larger given the average levels of skills in the labor
                             force.
                           39 In the past decade, labor productivity growth in agriculture increased (driven by rubber, palm oil,

                             coffee and tea) and dropped to almost zero in manufacturing. The sharpest decline in labor
                             productivity growth occurred however in mining and quarrying.

Improving the quality     Improving the quality of public spending will be critical for infrastructure development and
of public spending will   infrastructure service delivery in Indonesia.40 Total infrastructure investment—that is,
be critical for           investment by the central government, sub-national governments, state-owned enterprises
addressing Indonesia’s    and the private sector—has remained at only 3 percent to 4 percent of GDP over the past
infrastructure needs      decade (Figure 36). This is far below the rates of above 7 percent of GDP before the 1997
                          Asian financial crisis and the 10 percent and 7.5 percent spent by China and India,
                          respectively. Scaling up infrastructure spending, both on new investments but also,
                          importantly, on operation and maintenance, rests on improving the quality of public
                          spending at the central and sub-national government levels.

Fuel subsidy reform       At the central government level, large fuel subsidy spending (2.6 percent of GDP and 21
would greatly help        percent of the central government budget after transfers to the regions and interest
towards better quality    payments) is almost double the spending on infrastructure, which stands at 1 percent of
spending                  GDP. Improving the quality of spending can be greatly supported by fuel subsidy reform. A
                          more-than-doubling of government-wide infrastructure spending (from 2.5 percent of GDP)
                          can come from reducing energy subsidies. Any such reallocation would need to be
                          accompanied by further improvements in the areas of budget planning and execution so as
                          to improve absorptive capacity and ensure the quality of infrastructure investment
                          management and implementation.

Sub-national              Sub-national governments spend more on infrastructure than the central government (1.5
governments need to       percent of GDP versus 1 percent of GDP). But sub-national governments could spend
be incentivized to        much more to improve roads, water and sanitation and health infrastructure (both in terms
spend less on             of new investments and maintenance) if their budgets were not tied up by excessive
personnel and more on     spending on personnel and if they could raise more revenues themselves. Over 40 percent of
infrastructure            sub-national government spending is on personnel and about 90 percent of their budgets
                          come from the central government (fiscal transfers). Improving the fiscal transfer system to
                          incentivize greater reallocation of spending to infrastructure requires moving to some form
                          of performance-based transfers and increasing the share of the transfers tied to spending on
                          sectors or areas of national priorities.41 For municipalities that meet fiscal prudence and
                          fiduciary risk criteria, alternative means of financing, such as PPPs, municipal bonds, and
                          intermediary financing can be promoted.

Four other                For increased spending to be effective in reducing the infrastructure gap, however, the
complementary             following complementary reforms will be needed: (i) stronger coordination within the central
reforms will also be      government and across levels of government; (ii) a reform of the government and state-
needed to reduce the      owned utility companies’ processes to enhance project selection and planning; (iii) an
infrastructure gap        effective implementation of the new land law; and (iv) strong partnership with private
                          domestic and foreign investors to bridge the funding gap.

The payoffs from          The growth payoff of greater investment in infrastructure is large. Under-investment in
improving                 infrastructure has been a substantial drag on Indonesia’s growth over the past decade.42 The
infrastructure            consequent slow growth in the infrastructure capital stock relative to the pace of economic
investment in terms of    and urbanization growth has contributed to serious capacity gaps, congestion problems and

                          40 Infrastructure development is not only about money. Land acquisition, coordination between
                            different levels of government and project selection process are all equally important constraints. The
                            Government is aware of this and is working on each of them. For instance a new land bill is under
                            discussion at the Parliament. This land bill is expected to facilitate access to land for public purposes.
                          41 Fiscal transfers to sub-national governments are dominated by a “block grant” component (DAU)

                            relative to transfers tied to special purposes. Block grant transfers are untied, facilitating excessive
                            subnational personnel expenditure, leaving little space for transfers that could be tied to front-line
                            service provider levels. In 2012, the DAU made up almost 60 percent of central government transfers
                            to subnational governments. The specific purpose grant (DAK), allocated to certain regions with the
                            aim of funding special activities of the region in accordance with national priorities, only cover 6
                            percent of these transfers and is highly fragmented (covers too many sectors).
                          42 If Indonesia’s real infrastructure capital stock had growth by 5 percent annually over 2001-11 versus

                            the actual growth rate of 3 percent it is estimated that annual real GDP growth would have been 0.5
                            percentage points higher. See the October 2013 IEQ for further details.

higher growth and           poor logistics performance, undermining productivity growth. Firm surveys show that
better access to            problems with transportation are among the worst business constraints for urban
services are significant    manufacturing firms while rural producers find themselves unable to compete with imports
                            in urban areas. Thus, clearly, connective infrastructure development can help leverage
                            agglomeration economies in urban areas and unleash the growth and productivity potential
                            of agriculture, rural non-farm industries and urban manufacturing sectors. Furthermore,
                            because one-quarter of urban populations and more than half of rural dwellers have poor
                            access to transport services, improving infrastructure is key in enhancing overall economic
                            and social well-being in Indonesia.

                       d. Policy priorities to support productivity growth: second, skills

Indonesia needs to          Enhancing the quality of education and the functioning of training centers will be crucial in
improve the quality of      closing Indonesia’s skills gap. Today, two-thirds of firms complain that finding suitable
education and the           employees for professional and managerial positions is either “difficult” or “very difficult”;
functioning of training     and almost 70 percent of employers in manufacturing report finding it “very difficult” to fill
centers if it is to close   skilled professional-level positions (engineers). There are two types of mismatch. Some
the skills gap.             sectors report insufficient graduates as the reason (for example, in textiles), whereas other
                            sectors complain about the skills of existing graduates (for example, in rubber and plastics).
                            Meanwhile, firms in Indonesia are much less likely to offer training to their employees than
                            in other countries in the region. Most existing training-providers are concentrated in low-
                            value-added areas (such as beauty salon and spa skills and basic computer skills). Finally, in
                            terms of the level of core academic skills, Indonesia compares unfavorably with other
                            middle-income economies and East Asian neighbors in learning assessments such as PISA.
                            For instance, 15-year-old students in Indonesia have learning levels far below their peers in
                            Vietnam, even though per-capita income is higher.

Indonesia has already       Public policy has so far focused on access to education and enrollment. Thanks to strong
made significant            government commitment Indonesia will probably boast one of the largest numbers of
progress in improving       college-goers in the world in years to come.43 Over the past five years, the labor force with
access to education         tertiary and secondary levels of education has increased by more than 1 million and more
and enrollment rates        than 2 million annually, respectively. If recent trends in enrollment continue, the number of
                            Indonesians with tertiary education can more than double in the next decade.44

Now it needs to focus       Thus, going forward the focus should be on equipping graduates and workers with the right
on a three-pronged          technical and employer-valued behavioral skills (discipline, reliability, teamwork and
strategy to improve the     leadership) to support/enable large investments in key sectors such as manufacturing. This
skills of the labor force   requires a three-pronged reform strategy. First, improve the quality of basic education to
                            build a stronger base of cognitive skills necessary to acquire the higher-level skills that will be
                            needed by the workforce. A single key measure that could support this is strengthening the
                            quality assurance system to ensure that quality assessments are followed-up and education
                            institutions have the incentive to implement corrective actions.

But it is essential to      However, even if the educational system could be perfected instantly, the first graduates
find short- and             would only join the workforce in about 10-20 years’ time. It is therefore essential to find
medium-term solutions       short- and medium-term solutions for the current skills constraints: the second and third
to the skills gap           prongs of the strategy are thus improving the relevance of feeders into the labor market
                            (technical and vocational education, and tertiary education) and upgrading the skills of the
                            existing workforce (reform of the training system). Improving the relevance of vocational
                            and tertiary education calls for (i) supplying students and graduates with more information
                            on labor market opportunities, and (ii) making the system more responsive to the market’s


                            43 This commitment is seen in the Constitutional mandate that 20 percent of the budget should be
                              allocated to education.
                            44 The Government’s objective is to provide universal access to senior secondary education through a

                              compulsory 12 years of education and to double enrollment in higher education by 2020. The share of
                              individuals with tertiary education in the labor force stood at 8 percent in 2012.

                               needs. The training system, on the other hand, would serve the economy better if more
                               training institutions were created to deliver relevant training and specific skills in higher
                               value-added, strategic sectors (such as textiles, food products and other key manufacturing
                               branches).

Developing skills will         The growth payoff of skills development is large, if difficult to quantify. Because more than
help Indonesia meet            60 percent of Indonesian firms report that skills are a constraint, relaxing this constraint will
demand from the                help them expand and become more competitive. This could increase aggregate productivity
expanding middle-              and growth through “within sector” productivity growth (e.g. if workers in manufacturing
class and also                 acquire more skills) and/or labor movement from low-end services to manufacturing (see
withstand competition          above). Developing skills should also help Indonesia to leverage the opportunities coming
                               from increasing middle-class demand and withstand competition from ASEAN partners.
                               Without the right skill sets among those entering the workforce, imports may remain more
                               competitive than domestic production in satisfying the demand for higher quality products
                               and services from Indonesia’s growing middle-class.

transformation it will         reforms to facilitate investment and licensing in some sectors, the laws and regulations
need to improve the            governing business conduct in many sectors have, in recent years, sent mixed signals to
way product, labor,            investors and increased uncertainty for businesses. For instance, a number of sector-specific
capital and land               laws and measures announced recently are either inconsistent with previous laws or create
markets function               confusion about the direction of reforms (e.g. conflicts between the horticulture law versus
                               the investment law). In the mining sector, irrespective of how the new regulation banning
                               exports of mineral ores is ultimately applied, the repeated policy shifts have increased
                               uncertainty (as highlighted in the preceding section). The new industry and trade laws
                               provide ministerial authorities with new, sweeping authority to intervene in the market,
                               increasing uncertainty and the cost of doing business.

                               45The land market is also very important for public and private investment. A comprehensive land law,
                                currently being discussed by the Parliament, is expected to address some of the key issues that have
                                constrained investments in recent years.

formation should help     laws and regulations can be addressed by strengthening the quality of the policy formation
to improve the            process for economic policies and regulations. Some countries have done this by
investment climate        empowering ministries or government agencies to play a “policy integrator” function. A
                          strengthened and integrated policy formation process can help ensure that market
                          competition is fostered and anti-competitive practices are limited, and that the policy
                          environment supports inward FDI and frontier technology knowledge flows, and the
                          potential benefits they can bring. A strengthened policy formation should also better address
                          genuine concerns of Indonesians that the public interest be protected, and should enable the
                          Government to push back against more narrow rent-seeking activities and self-centered
                          business interests. This is all the more important given that Indonesian law courts, local
                          governments and politicians poorly in terms of the corruption perception index (for
                          example, in 2012, Transparency International ranked Indonesia 100 out of 183 countries
                          reviewed).

Revising the labor law,   Usefully complementing efforts to clarify rules for business conduct would be measures to
to make it more           ameliorate the functioning of labor and capital markets. Indonesia’s labor market presents an
flexible and inclusive,   insider-outsider feature, with a minority of workers formally protected and a large majority
would greatly support     of workers obliged to work in the informal sector. This divide reflects levels of employment
Indonesia’s structural    protection similar to several European countries (e.g. high level of severance pay) and
transformation            relatively high statutory minimum wages. In addition, the minimum-wage-setting process has
                          become uncertain in recent years although the recent introduction of a new formula indexed
                          on CPI inflation and productivity can help address this.46

                          Although the labor legislation does not apply to most workers (as there are many possible
                          exclusions for employers and the Government’s enforcement ability is limited), it impedes
                          productivity growth and structural transformation. For instance, workers’ entry into fully
                          formal sectors is restricted because employers in these sectors account for the high potential
                          cost of dismissal when making hiring decisions. As a result, most workers operate informally
                          or semi-informally, work on short-term contracts and are not trained as a long-term asset for
                          firms. Thus, workers leaving for instance farm or rural non-farm activities are stuck into
                          slightly higher but still low-productivity sectors and do not gain significant social mobility. A
                          revision of the labor law, in view of making it more flexible and inclusive, would greatly
                          support Indonesia’s structural transformation objectives. Such revision requires an
                          agreement between employers, workers and the Government. Similarly, the adoption of a
                          new minimum-wage-setting formula based on inflation and productivity by these parties
                          would support competitiveness and jobs.

Meanwhile,                As regards the capital markets, there is ample evidence that enterprises in Indonesia are
Indonesia’s capital       credit constrained (IMF, 2012)47. Firms, to a large extent, tend to rely more on retained
markets are thin,         earnings than on bank credit for the expansion of their activities, which in turn means that
impeding the provision    current cash flow becomes the major factor in investment decisions. This has significant
of financing to new       implications for the types of investments taking place in the economy, particularly in
investments               innovative firms that usually have negative cash flows in the early stages of operation, and
                          need bank or non-bank financing to grow and create high-quality jobs.

                          The credit constraint faced by firms reflects the lack of depth of Indonesia’s financial
                          market. The financial sector is dominated by banks (78 percent of assets) and its claims to
                          the private sector stand at only 35 percent compared with close to 100 percent on average

                          46 The minimum wage-setting process is complex. Negotiations and final agreements take place at the

                          province and sectoral level (and often at the district and subsector level), making communication and
                          compliance with new formula-based adjustments more difficult. More generally, ensuring the
                          compliance of firms and employers to minimum wage regulations is not easy, and requires monitoring
                          and coordination at the central level, between the Ministry of Manpower and relevant ministries for
                          effective implementation, as well as between central and local governments and relevant actors
                          (District Governors and Wage Councils).

                           debt securities (outstanding) accounting for less than 5 percent of GDP, similar to Thailand

                           are also relatively low compared with the size of the economy (5 percent compared with 10

intermediaries             recent years but still do not contribute significantly to the pool of domestic long-term
                           savings and investments.48 Public policy can however nudge the system towards greater
                           financial depth. For instance, the development of the corporate bond market appears
                           particularly constrained by strict investment requirements, high underwriting costs and
                           weaknesses in the execution regime. Besides this, international experience emphasizes the
                           role of building a credible legal system that allows for the effective enforcement of contracts
                           and property rights and provides investor protection. Financial contracts are defined and
                           made more or less effective by legal rights and enforcement mechanisms. From this
                           perspective, improving Indonesia’s legal system would facilitate the operations of markets
                           and intermediaries. This relates to improving the quality of the business environment more
                           broadly, as financial sector actors, just as investors themselves, need a minimum level of
                           certainty when making long-term financing decisions.

                      f.   What policy priorities to ensure that prosperity is shared more widely?

Policies need to ensure    Indonesia’s public policy challenge is not only to support policies that generate prosperity.
that prosperity is         Another challenge facing policymakers is that of sharing prosperity more widely. Indeed, a
shared more widely         large number of households classified as non-poor in terms of income/ consumption are
                           poor in many other dimensions, including access to decent housing, transportation, water,
                           sanitation, health and education. At the same time, despite Indonesia’s success in reducing
                           poverty, the slowing pace of progress in recent years and high vulnerability remain a
                           concern. Finally, Indonesia’s hard-fought poverty reduction outcomes are constantly under
                           threat, due to the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis,
                           volcanic eruptions, floods, landslides and forest fires. The last part of “Indonesia: Avoiding
                           the Trap” discusses three key priority areas to address these challenges.

Access to key services     For the poor, the vulnerable and some in the middle-class, higher income and prosperity will

                           The hopes placed on decentralization reforms to improve public services have yet to
                           materialize and decisive reforms will be necessary to improve service delivery.
                           Priority reform options include: (i) clarifying missions, refocusing the bureaucracy to be
                           accountable for results; (ii) providing more resources to front-line services and less on
                           personnel and administration, which requires amending the central government transfer
                           system to increase the proportion of local governments’ budgets tied to specific sectors and
                           performance and; (iii) strengthening of community-driven programs and demand-side
                           accountability through stronger partnership with agents of change at the village level.

                           would create 12.4 million new jobs by 2020. This compares favorably with the employment
                           creation if the country grows by only 5.0 percent per annum: 10.2 more million jobs by
                           2020. Thus, the difference between growing by 5.0 percent and 6.5 percent is a significant
                           2.2 million jobs over the eight years, which is significant.
