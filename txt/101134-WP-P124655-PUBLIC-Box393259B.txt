EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



   COMMUNITY-BASED FOREST MANAGEMENT IN MADAGASCAR

1.      Madagascar is blessed with unparalleled biodiversity and natural resources. It is estimated
that five percent of known species worldwide are found in Madagascar, and approximatively 90
percent of flora and 70 percent of vertebrae are endemic. The country is also blessed with a wide
variety of landscapes and vegetation types, ranging from dense and humid forest in the north and
eastern escarpment, to dry forest in the west and semi-arid spiny forest in the south. The spectacular
landscapes as well as terrestrial and marine ecosystems constitute the country’s main trump card for
tourism. The protected area network and forests also provide other benefits in the form of
hydrological services, regulating the flow of water and helping to reduce floods and water shortages,
essential services for downstream urban water users and hydroelectricity generation. Forests help to
reduce soil erosion and therefore sedimentation, which can adversely affect agricultural activities,
and in particular irrigated perimeters downstream.

2.      In contrast with its unique wealth, poverty in Madagascar has risen and is now among the
highest in the world. Recent estimates show that in 2012, about 78.2 percent of Madagascar’s 22
million people was living on less than USD 1.25 a day (PPP) and approximately 91.2 percent of the
population was living on less than USD 2.00 a day. When using the national poverty line, 70.7 percent
of Malagasy lives in absolute poverty and 58.2 percent lives in extreme poverty. The youth tend to be
poorer: 51 percent of the poor is less than 15 years of age, while the population over the age of 65
represents only 2 percent of the poor. About a third of the population in Madagascar is deprived at
many levels. This part of the population is the so-called “have nots,” disadvantaged in terms of
consumption, literacy and education, basic household assets and electricity.

3.      The balance between natural wealth and livelihoods is extremely fragile. Local, often
isolated, rural populations depend on the country’s natural resources to ensure basic livelihoods.
Poverty in rural areas, where approximately 80 percent of the population lives, is higher (77.9 percent
of the rural population) than in urban areas (35.5 percent of the urban population) and generally the
further away from urban centers the more precarious living conditions are. Livelihoods heavily
depend on subsistence agriculture, fragile pasture lands, timber and fuel wood, and small scale
fisheries. Population growth, estimated at 2.8 percent p.a. has increased demand for agricultural land
both for subsistence production and for cash crops and has consequently increased the pressure on
forests. Poor soil management in areas outside of forests reinforces expansive land clearing and
incursions into forest areas where the soil is more fertile.

                                                                                                     vii
4.      Community-based forest management, or CFM, is a key tool to transform this fragile
poverty-environment balance into a virtuous cycle of development. CFM was conceived as a way to
increase conservation effectiveness by devolving power and rights to local communities. A key tool
for this to work is to improve local livelihoods through direct resources management. Madagascar is
one of the first countries in the southern hemisphere to have put in place a legal framework for
community-based natural resources management, with the GELOSE (gestion locale sécurisée) law (law
96-025) in 1996. The GELOSE promotes the transfer of management of a range of different natural
resources to local communities. This was followed in 2001 by a forest-specific decree known as
gestion contractualisée des forêts or GCF (decree 2001-122).
5.      The key ingredients of CFM contracts include an agreement between individuals from the
local community and the administration, clear terms of use of the resource, land tenure rights and
the support of a mediator and of non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The process starts with
the creation of a local natural resources management group (in Malagasy Vondron’Olona Ifotony
(VOI), or Grassroots Community). The VOI operates according to a set of rules (dina). Once created,
the VOI can request the transfer of management of a given resource from its legal owner, be it the
State or the local authority. The contract is signed by three parties: (i) the VOI; (ii) the owner of the
resources, be it the State or the Municipality (in the case of forests, typically the forest
administration); and (iii) the Municipality (Commune), which is the most decentralized institution with
elected leaders. The typical forest Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM)
contract is often established with support from NGOs and requires the expertise of an environmental
mediator, who would ensure that the needs and objectives of all stakeholders involved in the
negotiations are given equal weight. Land tenure security is a key principle of the law.


   IMPACT EVALUATION
6.      This report uses impact evaluation as a tool to measure the effectiveness of CFM
implementation on two key variables: deforestation and well-being. Impact evaluation assesses the
changes on a variable of interest that can be attributed to a particular intervention, such as a project,
program or policy. To measure the impact of CFM policy on conservation we compared the extent of
deforestation between CFM areas and similar non-CFM areas. To measure the impacts on people’s
well-being we used the annual household per capita consumption expenditure in CFM areas and
compared it to the level of annual household per capita consumption expenditure in similar non-CFM
areas. To deal with the possible non-random application of CFM policy (e.g., the policy is more likely
to be applied in areas where the pressure on forests is high, or where conservation efforts had been
ongoing before the policy was put in place), statistical matching was used. Statistical matching
consists in selecting ‘untreated’ (i.e., non-CFM) units that have characteristics most similar to ‘treated’
units at pre-intervention baseline.


                                                                                                        viii
7.      The analysis suggests that decentralization of forest management to local communities in
Madagascar may not have, on average, achieved its forest conservation goal. In terms of
deforestation, we cannot detect an effect, on average, of CFM compared to non-CFM sites, even after
restricting the sample to those sites for which quality of implementation is higher, at least in recorded
documents (i.e., where the CFM has passed the forest administration’s evaluation three years after
establishment).
8.      While CFM might have failed, on average, to reduce deforestation relative to non-CFM, non-
commercial CFM appears to have had more success, albeit a small one. Putting all types of CFM in
one basket would lead to the conclusion that CFM is not an effective approach to reduce
deforestation, obscuring the positive impact non-commercial CFM appears to have had. The reasons
why non-commercial CFM may have had relatively more success include the fact that pure
conservation sites may have had access to more finance (e.g., through compensation payments to
local communities) than sites in which commercial use of forests was allowed. Some non-commercial
CFM in the sites analyzed in Didy, Tsitongambarika and Menabe practiced direct payments to
conservation schemes to offset restrictions introduced by interventions.
9.      The transfer of forest management rights to local communities has not improved household
economic living standards in Madagascar at the municipality level. There is no statistically significant
difference between households in CFM sites and comparable households in non-CFM sites. However,
CFM has enhanced the economic living standards at a more local scale, for households living along
forest edges.


   THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS AT PLAY
10.     There are four main underlying drivers of the relative ineffectiveness of the CFM policy
observed in this study. The first one is that the GELOSE law, which is the pillar of CFM in Madagascar,
has never become fully functional as it was never complemented by the required implementation
decrees. This regulatory gap is also compounded by the internal contradictions present in other legal
texts on forest areas. The second driver is found in the lack of consistency between different sectoral
laws and policies and the CFM policy. This opens the way for conflicts and ineffectiveness. Thirdly,
different actors involved in CFM implementation may have diverging objectives that are not
necessarily compatible, but also not necessarily compatible with CFM objectives in general. Lastly, law
enforcement and the rule of law present substantial weaknesses both at the local and at the national
levels. These reasons suggest that the problems may lie more with the implementation aspects of the
CFM policy, rather than the policy itself.
Related to the GELOSE law implementation:
11.    A first issue is that while GELOSE requires the application of multiple decrees and
regulations, these regulatory efforts remain unachieved to date. GELOSE covers forests, wild
                                                                                                       ix
terrestrial and aquatic fauna and flora, water and the transition land areas (art. 2). Depending on the
type of resource, it is the responsibility of the relevant Ministries and local authorities to establish,
through legal and regulatory provisions, the law’s implementation modalities (art. 56). However, only
the forest administration has so far produced an implementation text through Decree 2001-122
known as GCF. The decree sets out the conditions for the implementation of community-based
management of forests of which the State considers itself the owner. In practice, all 1,248 CFM
contracts signed to date are contracts for which the State is the resource owner.
12.     The intended coherence between ‘legal’ and ‘legitimate’ resource use rights also remains
unachieved. In issuing the GELOSE, the legislator has made an unprecedented effort to recognize
both the customary rights of populations in their local environment (terroir) (art. 1), and the ultimate
property rights of the State or decentralized authority (art. 2). For this association between
‘legitimate’ and ‘legal’ rights to work, the law requires: (i) the intervention of an environmental
mediator, whose role is to ensure that all stakeholders involved in the negotiations are given equal
weight, given the divergent interests at play (decree 2000-028); (ii) the possibility of providing relative
land tenure security1, after joint delineation of the land subject to management delegation; and (iii)
the responsibility of the municipality in the definition and implementation of its territorial
development policy. These three principles, however, have not yet been fully implemented. In some
cases, other environment-related texts (e.g. the 2001-122 Decree about GCF) have opened the way
for ad hoc arrangements pertaining to community participation in natural resources management,
further weakening the application of the law’s basic principles.
Related to the lack of consistency between CFM and the different sectoral texts:
13.     The ineffectiveness of the CFM policy in promoting conservation and boosting the
livelihoods of local communities can also be linked to the weak integration of CFM in non-
environmental sector policies, in spite of substantial progress over time. The analysis conducted for
this report reviewed key pieces of sector legislation including those on land tenure, agriculture,
energy and mining, and decentralization, among others. The review concluded that important
progress has been made over the years. Yet, the lack of synergy with land tenure policy is particularly
problematic. Synergies do exist in the texts, notably with the agriculture and decentralization policies,
but weak implementation, owing generally to lack of resources, means that more could be done in
practice.

 The 98-610 decree about relative land tenure securing (SFR) gives the opportunity to communities (that got transferred the
management of natural resources) to mark off their land and have decentralized services register the limits.

Related to the diverging objectives of the main stakeholders involved in CFM implementation:
14.     The stakeholder analysis reveals a potentially inefficient power/relevance mix. In particular,
it is important to note that the three entities that are parties to a typical CFM contract (VOI, forest
administration and Municipality) are not in the same stakeholder group along the proposed
influence/relevance matrix. The VOIs are low-influence / high-relevance stakeholders, whereas the
forest administration and the Municipalities are high-influence / high-relevance stakeholders. The
interests of the former risk being under-represented in policy decisions and implementation. In
addition, it is possible that the objectives of the more conservation-oriented forest administration are
not completely aligned with those of the Municipality, which represents not just communities living
near the forest but all communities in the municipal territory (including those in agricultural areas and
urban areas). This delicate balance may be also affected by ‘external’ (with respect to the contract)
agents such as NGOs, donors and the law enforcement authorities, which all have important influence
on the implementation of CFM.
Related to the weakness of law enforcement and rule of law:
15.    Enforcing community-based forest contracts has proved challenging at two distinct levels. At
the local level, community-led enforcement may be ineffective when dealing with agents that are
external to the VOI or to the community altogether. At the sub-national and national levels, the
problems of weak rule of law, corruption in the administration and the judiciary, and poorly equipped
law enforcement agencies are more common.
16.     However, it is worth mentioning that the primary objective of the GELOSE law, which is to
incite and promote local people’s participation in the conservation of renewable natural resources
was reached. Without any nationwide information campaign, the number of signed contracts is
remarkably high; which makes Madagascar one of the most engaged developing countries in CFM.
With CFM contracts, local populations’ capacities were reinforced; they tend to gather in federations
in order to better tackle the challenges of sustainable development and to position themselves as
direct interlocutors for donors.


A BLUEPRINT FOR ACTION
17.      Poverty and environmental degradation can interact in complex ways and in ways that are
often detrimental to both human livelihoods and the environment. For communities relying on
natural resources the journey from poverty to prosperity is likely to be a gradual one, especially
among households with low levels of education and few employment opportunities. Forests may
provide a stepping stone that helps to move the chronically poor to the moderate poverty levels, and
lifts the sometimes-poor out of poverty. CFM is one potential tool for this to happen. The evidence
from a number of countries shows that CFM can indeed be an important tool for conservation and
development. Case studies from Australia and Kenya show that success is possible, particularly when
                                                                                                       xi
the projects are initiated by the communities themselves. Brazil demonstrates how forests under the
management of indigenous peoples are better protected than other forests.
18.     Encouraging examples of community conservation in Madagascar point to the fact that
success is indeed possible. The Anja Miray Association, established in 1999 in response to the
degradation and clearing of local forests, the sedimentation of water resources, and the loss of
wildlife such as ring-tailed lemurs, chameleons and tropical birds, is successfully operating a 30-
hectare community forest reserve in the Haute Matsiatra region of Madagascar. The community has
established an ecotourism initiative which funds community works projects – schools, health clinics
and environmental education – and ongoing conservation activities. Ecotourism has also provided a
revenue stream for alternative livelihood projects such as fish farming and tree nurseries.
19.    Public policy should be geared to allow the spread of successful examples. The analysis in
this report allows to identify some key constraints in the application of CFM and CBNRM in
Madagascar and to sketch a number of recommendations in the short, medium and long terms.
a. In the short term, the Government and its partners should seek to maximize consistency between
   the GELOSE, the forest law and the land tenure law. It should also aim at filling the gaps in the
   CFM legal and regulatory framework and correct the inconsistencies between the different forest
   and environment-related texts. However, this objective must take into account the significant
   progress in environmental international and national laws, as well as the specificities of the
   Malagasy judicial order.
b. In the medium term, the target should be to strengthen the capacity of the State, both central
   Government and regional services, to plan and implement CFM policy. The State could address
   the financial constraints that VOIs and municipalities face through performance-based payment
   schemes, taking for example advantage of REDD+ projects and programs, and payment for
   ecosystem services schemes more generally. In this context, capacity building coupled with the
   networking of the VOI is an opportunity not to miss.
c. In the longer term, the aim should be to strengthen the capacity for law enforcement and to
   strengthen the traceability of forest products. Suspending or prohibiting the commercial use of
   forest products would not solve the issue. On the contrary, the suspension and prohibition
   measures tend to demotivate the VOI from investing in sustainable management of the resources.
   Adequate investment in forest products traceability and control mechanisms are key to allowing
   the profitable and sustainable use of forest resources. The role of the decentralized territorial
   units (CTD), particularly the municipalities is crucial; indeed, it is them that are in charge of the
   implementation of the 2 essential components for regulating access to renewable natural
   resources: management: land tenure and spatial planning (aménagement du territoire).

   I.   COMMUNITY FOREST MANAGEMENT (CFM) IN MADAGASCAR



   A. BACKGROUND

1.     The major role tropical forests play in biodiversity and climate change has led the world to
search for effective ways to slow down deforestation. Many approaches have come in and out of
fashion. Strictly protected areas, which prohibit most human activities, were popular in the early days
of conservation and remain so today. Protected areas have had some success at reducing
deforestation (Geldmann et al. 2013). However, their negative impacts on the livelihoods of local
communities, such as access to forest resources (Brandon and Wells 1992; Adams et al. 2004; Wilkie
et al. 2006) undermined their effectiveness and legitimacy. This led to the development of
approaches integrating forest protection and local livelihoods. One of these approaches is
community-based management of forests, also known as Community Forest Management (CFM).
CFM emerged in the late 1980s (Hutton et al. 2005). By involving locals in forests management, CFM
has the potential to benefit both the forests and local livelihoods (Behera 2009).

2.      CFM is an example of the broader concept of community-based natural resources
management (CBNRM). Numerous definitions and interpretations of CBNRM exist (USAID, 2013).
Generally speaking, CBNRM involves defined groups of individuals living in a given territory
collaborating on the utilization and the regulation of natural resources. Dressler et al. (2010) defines it
as the “devolution of rights to make management decisions and capture benefits, in relation to
resources located on community lands”. A key rationale for CBNRM, and CFM in particular, is that
communities are in a good position to protect natural resources and to manage benefits generated by
the extraction of natural resources as they possess a good knowledge of the ecosystems they are
living in. Because their livelihoods rely greatly on these ecosystems, local communities might be
motivated to implement sustainable management rules and long term conservation efforts (Pollini et
al. 2014).

3.      As part of the decentralization policy in many countries, mainly in Africa and Asia, CFM was
expected to promote i) a more effective stewardship of the resources by involving the local
communities in the management of the resources and ii) a more locally-driven development with
them tapping most of the derived benefits. CFM is tightly related to the decentralization policy, it is
an institutional response to the limitation of the State’s interventions in forest management, and to
promote local, active democracy and the rule of law. CFM objectives include transferring decision
responsibilities and the management of wooded lands to the local communities, which can be
provided with legal status and financial responsibilities. Transfer of forested land property can
eventually occur although not often. The rationale is to provide local communities with all the rights

                                                                                                         1
and duties/responsibilities, making them the main responsible of the management of the forests
(implicitly, they are expected to be better stewards of the forests than the Forest administration
because they are the primary group directly affected by the results of the decisions they are
themselves taking). CFM was is expected to initiate i) a collective awareness of a better local
democracy (especially in terms of the decision-making process related to the management of forest
resources) and thus, have community members change their behavior with a more sense of
ownership; and ii) a local auto-centered development because the communities are expected to reap
the entire/big part of the eventual benefits from forest management. Those benefits, in turn, can be
re-invested into forest management and/or to local development, especially into social
infrastructures. In principle, the Forest administration is there to provide technical and legal support
to the local communities and thus building their capacity in those aspects. In return though, the local
community has to cover itself all the costs (including patrolling and securing the integrity of the
resources, etc.).

4.      The precursors of CBNRM and CFM in Madagascar are the centrally-led compensation-based
mechanisms to conservation. These included programs against bush-fires and projects aiming at
integrating conservation and development, implemented in the beginning of the 1990’s. The
approach was basically aimed at compensating communities beyond just covering the local
opportunity costs of resource preservation. Projects under this approach were designed by
stakeholders external to the community and, while relying on local communities’ participation, did
not substantially change tenure and power relations (Dressler et al., 2010). The Government and
conservation agencies soon realized the need to shift the model from a mere ‘consultation-based’
model (to approve and implement an external agenda) to an ‘engagement’ model, based on the
recognition of key local stakeholders, and thus, the invitation to negotiate their own management
objectives. This is how CFM was conceived in Madagascar: as a way to increase conservation
effectiveness by devolving power and rights to local communities. A key tool for this to work was to
improve local livelihoods through the direct resources management.

5.      Madagascar is one of the first countries in the southern hemisphere to have put in place a
legal framework for CBNRM and CFM (Andriantsilavo et al., 2006; and Montagne et al., 2007). The
country introduced CBNRM in its natural resource policy in 1996 with the GELOSE (Gestion Locale
Sécurisée) law (law 96-025)2 which promotes the transfer of management of a range of different
natural resources to local communities. This was followed in 2001 by a forest specific decree known
as Gestion Contractualisée des Forêts3, or GCF, (decree 2001-122). Based on the 1990 Environmental

2
  The law, approved on 30 September 1996 and recorded in the official bulletin (JORM n° 2939 du 14 Octobre 1996, p. 2377), is officially
referred to as “Loi n° 96-025 relative à la gestion locale des ressources naturelles renouvelables”. The term GELOSE comes from the
expression “Gestion Local Securisée”, that is, Secured [in terms of right of use] local management [of renewable resources].
3
   Literally: ”management of forests by contract”.

                                                                                                                                      2
Charter, the legislation aimed primarily at involving local populations in the management of
renewable natural resources, thus, their involvement in reducing deforestation and protect the
significant part of the world’s biodiversity that is endemic to Madagascar (Raik 2007; Le Saout et al.
2013). Since the GCF decree, the number of CFM units increased rapidly and continues to grow
(Aubert et al. 2013), reaching a total number of 1,248 signed contracts between 1996 and 20144.

6.       The CBNRM implementation process starts with the creation of a local natural resources
management group. The local management group, in Malagasy Vondron’Olona Ifotony (VOI) which
literally means ‘group of individuals from the base’, “consists of any group of voluntary individuals,
united by the same interests and complying with convened rules of the group. It may include
inhabitants of a hamlet, a village or group of villages” (art. 3 of the GELOSE law)5. Participation to the
VOI is voluntary and any person residing within the boundaries of the VOI territory may submit an
application to the VOI’s General Assembly to become a member. By this act, the person agrees to
comply with the operating rules, the activities and the objectives of the VOI (art. 5 of the GELOSE law).
Such rules often include the payment of a one-time membership fee, the payment of monthly or
quarterly fees to cover the running costs of the management committee of the group, and agreeing to
participate in activities that the group convenes to conduct, such as attending General Assembly
meetings, patrolling the forests on a regular basis and giving up on certain traditional economic
practices (e.g. slash-and-burn agriculture, or wildlife hunting). In terms of structure, the VOI has to
have: (i) a deliberative body (the General Assembly of all VOI members); (ii) an executive body (the
Management Committee, with at least a president, a vice-president, a secretary, a treasurer, and
several advisors); (iii) operational and financial management rules (Statute, rules of procedure or
dina); and (iv) other structures such as the local forest controllers (polisin’ala) in charge of patrolling
the forests on a regular basis and report any infractions to the Management Committee. See Figure 1.

7.      Once created, the VOI can request the transfer of management of a given resource from its
legal owner, be it the State or the Decentralized Territorial Units (CTD). The contract is signed by
three parties: (i) the VOI; (ii) the owner of the resources, be it the State (in the case of forests,
typically the forest administration) or the CTD; and (iii) the Municipality (Commune), which is the
most local decentralized institution with elected leaders (Raik 2007; Froger and Méral 2012; Pollini
and Lassoie 2011; Aubert, Tchousso, and Razafiarijaona 2013). The typical forest CBNRM contract: (i)
is valid for an initial period of three years, evaluated by the forest administration and if successful,
renewed for another ten years; then, evaluated again before becoming a definitive agreement; (ii)
involves the management of specific natural resources located within the boundaries of the local
communities; (iii) is often established with support from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or

  Details about all legal aspects of VOI are to be found in Appendix A.

                                                                                                                                    3
other external stakeholders because of the importance of the preparation of technical and official
documents (e.g. management plans, zoning resource maps and the contract itself); (iv) normally
requires the expertise of an environmental mediator, who would ensure that the needs and
objectives of all stakeholders involved in the negotiations are given equal weight; and (v) includes
land tenure securing. In reality, these last two provisions have not been implemented universally.

                                 Figure 1. Key stakeholders in CFM contracts




8.      A natural resources management group, or VOI, does not need to coincide with the most
traditional forms of ‘local community’. This is a key feature of CBNRM practice in Madagascar and
one that needs to be kept present when interpreting the results of the CBNRM policy implementation
(section 3 also provides a brief stakeholder analysis). In fact the VOI is in practice an association of
individuals who decide to collaborate to achieve certain goals. These associations do not (they could,
but often do not) necessarily correspond to the group of people that, by ancestry, family link and by
sharing similar customs, but they had broad autonomy of management, including at the security and
judicial level, and operated following the code of dina (social pact). CBNRM policy adopts some of the
key traditional governance tools, but applies them to associations of people that may or may not
coincide with the fokonolona. Originally, in the 1990’s, it was intended that the term be used for the
transfer of management of natural resources to local communities, that is fokonolona, but the
proposition was rejected at the time by the Parliament because of the semantic vagueness of the
concept (Bertrand et al., 2014). Hence, the concept of VOI came to be with the assumption that it
would include a big part of the fokonolona and that the newly created association would provide
legitimacy to conservation actions within the community. In fact, the term “Fokonolona” is
polysemous: in the highlands culture, it represents a group of people that, by ancestry, family link and
                                                                                                      4
by sharing similar customs. In 1972, the term was used to describe a legal territorial assembly, which,
currently refers to the population of a Fokontany. The polysemous nature of the terms “Fokonolona”
and “dina” allow various interpretations of the formalization of the traditional and the legal
dimensions in CFM contracts; which can be a strength and/or a weakness for the law.


       B. RELEVANCE OF CBNRM FOR MADAGASCAR

9.      Madagascar is blessed with unparalleled biodiversity and natural resources. It is estimated
that five percent of known species worldwide are found in Madagascar, and approximatively 90
percent of flora and 70 percent of vertebrae are endemic. As such, Madagascar’s national parks and
forests constitute a global public good, for which national and international partners share
responsibility. The country is also blessed with a wide variety of landscapes and vegetation types,
ranging from dense and humid forest in the north and eastern escarpment, dry forest in the west and
semi-arid spiny forest in the south. The spectacular landscapes as well as terrestrial and marine
ecosystems constitute the country’s main trump card for tourism. It has been estimated that 70
percent of tourists traveling to Madagascar visited at least one protected area. The protected area
network and forests also provide other benefits in the form of hydrological services, regulating the
flow of water and helping to reduce floods and water shortages, essential services for downstream
urban water users and hydroelectricity generation. Forests help to reduce soil erosion and therefore
sedimentation, which can adversely affect agricultural activities, and in particular irrigated perimeters
downstream. It is estimated that protected areas provide water services for at least 430,000 hectares
(1,062,553 acres) of irrigated perimeters, and drinking water to 17 major towns.

10.     In contrast with its unique wealth, poverty in Madagascar has risen and is now among the
highest in the world. Recent estimates show that in 2012, about 78.2 percent of Madagascar’s 22
million people was living on less than USD 1.25 a day (PPP) and approximately 91.2 percent of the
population was living on less than USD 2.00 a day. When using the national poverty line, 70.7 percent
of Malagasy lives in absolute poverty and 58.2 percent lives in extreme poverty. The youth tend to be
poorer: 51 percent of the poor is less than 15 years of age, while the population over the age of 65
represents only 2 percent of the poor6. Preliminary estimates suggest that from 2008 to 2013, the
proportion of the population living below the poverty line, already high before the crisis, may have
increased by 10 percentage points, with the larger effects over 2011-2013, as the crisis continued to
deepen. When population growth is factored in, it is estimated that 4 million more Malagasy live
below the poverty line than in 2008. About a third of the population in Madagascar is deprived at
many levels. This part of the population is the so-called ‘have nothings’, disadvantaged in terms of
consumption, literacy and education, basic household assets and electricity.

6
    These data are part of a Poverty, Gender and Inequality Assessment undertaken between mid-2013 and mid-2014.

                                                                                                                   5
11.     The balance between natural wealth and livelihoods is extremely fragile. Local, often
isolated, rural populations depend on the country’s natural resources to ensure basic livelihood.
Poverty in rural areas, where approximately 80 percent of the population lives, is higher than in urban
areas and generally the further away from urban centers the more precarious living conditions are.
Livelihoods heavily depend on subsistence agriculture, fragile pasture lands, timber and fuel wood,
small scale fisheries. Livelihoods rely mostly on forests and other natural resources. Population
growth, estimated at 2.8 percent p.a. has increased demand for agricultural land both for subsistence
production and for cash crops and has consequently increased the pressure on forests. Poor soil
management in areas outside of forests reinforces expansive land clearing and incursions into forest
areas where the soil is more fertile.

12.     The government has identified the protection of natural capital and the harnessing of its
value as a key pillar in its National Development Plan for 2015-2019. The Plan identifies poor
governance as a major constraint to achieving the country’s development objectives. It puts strong
emphasis on the roles of both natural capital and the necessity for a more inclusive economy to
achieve sustainable development. Its goal is to “build a new and strong Madagascar and to transmit
to future generations a peaceful, united and prosperous country able to become a world leader in the
valorization and the preservation of its immense natural capital based on a strong inclusive growth at
the service of sustainable and equitable development of all territories”. The recent presidential
declaration at the World Parks Congress (WPC) in Sydney, in 20147, reinforces this vision.


    C. RELEVANCE OF THE WORK FOR THE WORLD BANK

13.     This report will help the bank take stock of the nearly two-decades of implementation of
the National Environmental Action Plan and provide nation-wide facts that will inform future
investment in renewable natural resources management, biodiversity conservation and poverty
reduction and local development in the future. In 1989, the Government of Madagascar, with the
support of the Bank devised Africa’s first National Environmental Action Plan, a long term
commitment to environmental protection for Madagascar. Initially planned for 15 years, it has been
extended until the end of 2015. Under the NEAP’s three phases, chronologically, the Bank helped the
Government create a proper policy, regulatory and institutional framework (phase 1:1991 to 1997);
put in place different national institutions (ONE, ANGAP, etc.) to promote good stewardship of the
country’s natural resources (phase 2: 1997 to 2003) and mainstreaming environment into
macroeconomic management and sectorial programs that focus on results at the regional and field

7
  The commitment consists in making the “7 million hectares of protected areas not to become islands in the middle of deserts and
lavaka, but for them to thrive within living land and seascapes where they will be the center piece of an integrated vision, in which
economic sectors fully mainstream environmental values, and that is supported by concerted land use planning, equitable resource
distribution and transparent governance”.

                                                                                                                                   6
levels, which includes accelerating and scaling-up transfer of forest management rights to provide a
utilitarian incentive for improved management (phase 3: since 2003). Aside from supporting the
Government for achieving those main goals for each phase of the Program, the Bank always
collaborated closely with the Government in adjusting and undertaking adaptive management during
the implementation of NEAP: including (but not limited to) scaling back overly ambitious objectives
during phase 1, creating a strategic, results-oriented logical framework that involved more
stakeholders to reinforce ownership, etc. One of the lessons learned during the NEAP
implementation, and related to the current work is the “need for a viable environmental policy
framework”: Madagascar has managed to mainstream the environment into many of its sector
policies, the legal and policy framework is well established; the environmental impact assessment
law, the forestry policy law, the protected area code, the GELOSE law (which is based on the principle
of subsidiarity management of natural resources) and the foundation law undoubtedly provide a solid
foundation for a sustainable environmental management. Taking stock of what happened during the
implementation of NEAP, the current work seeks to inform future investment in biodiversity
conservation; especially by providing nationwide, reliable elements - until then missing- about what
impacts did one of the pillars of the environmental policy (the GELOSE law implementation) yield after
nearly 2 decades of implementation. Along with that, the current work informs a better
understanding of how well the above existing environmental policy framework function. These two
aspects are crucial for future interventions in the environmental sector in which different market and
performance-based payment mechanisms will be important. Indeed, it is unlikely that the country will
be successful entering those mechanisms if the management of the natural resources at the
grassroots level does not perform well.


   D. PURPOSE AND ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT

14.    While most of the recommendations in this report can be extended to CBNRM in general,
the analysis has focused specifically on CFM. The key steps leading in principle to the creation of a
CFM contract apply (with some minor differences) to all CBNRM contracts. In fact, the GELOSE law
applies to forest, terrestrial and aquatic fauna and flora, water and pasture land resources. We have
focused on forest-related natural resources (GELOSE and GCF) because of the relative abundance of
data which has allowed to conduct an original empirical analysis. In addition, CFM contracts constitute
the majority of the contracts that exist in Madagascar.

15.     The present work is targeted to decision makers and stakeholders involved in CFM policy
with the objective of taking stock of almost 20 years of implementation and advise on future
directions in policy formulation. CFM contracts have the potential to improve conservation of natural
resources while improving local communities’ wellbeing. This potential, however, has been
questioned (Behera, 2009) and its evidence base has been found to be weak (Bowler et al., 2012).
                                                                                                     7
Many publications review the institutional and political aspects of Madagascar’s forest
decentralization process (Pollini et al., 2014; Pollini and Lassoie, 2011; Raik and Decker, 2007; Rives et
al. 2013; Urech et al. 2013), but only a few focus on empirically estimating the performance of CFM in
terms of conservation outcomes (e.g. CIRAD 2013; Sommerville, Milner-Gulland et al. 2010; Toillier et
al. 2011) and human well-being outcomes (e.g. Hockley & Andriamarovololona 2007; Sommerville,
Jones, et al. 2010; Toillier et al. 2011; Ramamonjisoa and Rabemananjara 2012). For the reasons
mentioned above, high quality studies evaluating the effectiveness of CFM are therefore important
for shaping future investments in community-based approaches to reduce deforestation. Specifically,
the present work seeks to: (i) provide robust evidence on effectiveness of CFM at reducing
deforestation and improving human well-being in Madagascar; (ii) identify the underlying causes of
ineffectiveness of the policy; and (iii) sketch a number of policy recommendations.

16.     The report is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the result of an impact evaluation
analysis conducted on the application of CFM policy. Impact evaluation has been conducted on the
two implicit objectives of the policy: (i) forest conservation; and (ii) community welfare. Results are
opposite to the conventional wisdom on CFM as they portray a largely ineffective policy. Section 3
provides an analysis of the legal and institutional aspects of the application of CFM policy in
Madagascar. It sheds light on the complexities of the policy, on the legislation and regulatory gaps, on
the inconsistencies with other sector policies and on the complex balance of power between different
stakeholders. Section 4 concludes with a number of recommendations for the short, medium and
longer term. This report is intended as a primer for understanding the basic characteristics and
challenges CFM policy faces in Madagascar. As such, it is not exhaustive. But it will hopefully invite
more work in the area and a renewed interest by development practitioners.

      II. EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMMUNITY FOREST MANAGEMENT

17.     This section uses impact evaluation as a tool to measure the effectiveness of CFM policy on
two key variables: deforestation and well-being. Impact evaluation assesses the changes on a
variable of interest that can be attributed to a particular intervention, such as a project, program or
policy. To measure the impact of CFM policy on conservation we compared the extent of
deforestation between CFM areas and similar non-CFM areas. To measure the impacts on people’s
well-being we used the annual household per capita consumption expenditure in CFM areas and
compared to the level of annual household per capita consumption expenditure in similar non-CFM
areas.

18.     Assessing the effectiveness of CFM approaches comes down to answering the question:
what would have happened if there had been no intervention? The literature on impact evaluation is
vast, but useful references include Ferraro & Pattanayak 2006; Andam et al. 2008; Andam et al. 2010;
Joppa & Pfaff 2010. In the real world, that is, outside of the controlled environment one can create in
a laboratory, it is impossible to observe what would have happened in the absence of a given
intervention. One approach is to infer it from other locations (this was done for the deforestation
analysis) and from other households (for the well-being analysis) which are not exposed to the policy
(Joppa & Pfaff 2010). Then, impacts of the policy could be inferred by comparing conditions in units
with intervention (treated) and without intervention (untreated).

19.     The analysis performed for this section aims at answering the following policy questions:

        Objective 1: Has CFM policy reduced deforestation in Madagascar?

        Objective 2: Has CFM policy improved human well-being, as measured by consumption
        expenditure?

With respect to the first policy question, the analysis aimed at measuring: (i) the overall effectiveness
of the policy in reducing deforestation; (ii) test the sensitivity of the above result by looking at a
subsample of CFM units that have passed the Government validation after three year of
implementation; (iii) any difference in impact between CFM contracts that allow commercial use of
forests and contracts that impose strict conservation. With respect to the second policy question, the
analysis aimed at measuring: (i) the effectiveness of CFM at improving household economic living
standard; and (ii) the spatial distribution of CFM benefits by looking at the heterogeneity of impacts
as a function of household location relative to forest edges.




                                                                                                       9
20.   To conduct the analysis, and to ensure robust results, particular attention was given to
address the following issues:

   -   The potential non-random assignment of CFM. CFM interventions are in all likelihood not
       randomly assigned. In fact they are often biased towards locations having characteristics more
       or less favorable to conservation and/or development. For example, CFM is more likely to
       occur in areas with higher human pressures (Ferraro & Pattanayak 2006; Bowler et al. 2012;
       Rasolofoson et al. 2015). Thus, comparing spatially-biased treated units with random
       untreated units biases impact estimates because the two groups differ in characteristics that
       are yet having confounding effects on the variable of interest (e.g. deforestation). It is like
       comparing “apples to oranges” (Joppa & Pfaff 2010). To solve this issue, statistical matching
       was used. Statistical matching consists in selecting untreated units that have characteristics
       most similar to treated units at pre-intervention baseline (Ferraro & Pattanayak 2006; Joppa &
       Pfaff 2010).

   -   The lack of baseline data (for the well-being analysis). Ideally, an impact evaluation using
       statistical matching should have baseline data gathered before the intervention was
       implemented. Those data are needed to control for initial conditions that may confound
       measures of intervention effectiveness (Ferraro & Pattanayak 2006). However, our study on
       well-being impact misses outcome baseline data. To address this issue, we perform the
       falsification or placebo test (Ferraro & Hanauer 2014) to demonstrate that treated and similar
       untreated units that are matched in terms of observable confounding characteristics have
       similar outcome values in the absence of CFM. If they do, we have higher certainty that
       matching observed confounding characteristics ensures that matched units have similar
       outcome values at baseline when there was no CFM intervention. If treated and untreated
       units have different outcome values in the absence of CFM, the chance is higher that they had
       different outcome values at baseline.

   -   The possible effect of unobserved variables. It is possible that the treated and the untreated
       subjects already differed at the baseline due to the effect of other variables than the observed
       ones. Sensitivity analysis was used in this work to assess the sensitivity of the results to such
       unobservable bias.




                                                                                                     10

Box. Impact evaluation and methods used for the deforestation and well-being analysis

Impact evaluation consists in isolating the impacts attributable to a given intervention (CFM implementation in our case)
by comparing conditions in units with intervention (treated) and without intervention (untreated). If interventions were
randomly assigned, comparing treated with random untreated units could reveal causal impacts of interventions, since
randomness of both units would ensure similarity in environmental and socio-economic characteristics across these two
groups of units (Joppa & Pfaff 2011). However, interventions are not randomly assigned in reality. They are often biased
towards locations having characteristics more or less favorable to conservation and/or development. For instance, CFM is
more likely to occur in areas with higher human pressures (Ferraro & Pattanayak 2006; Bowler et al. 2012; Rasolofoson et
al. 2015).

Overall, described below are the key elements of the methods we used to conduct both analyses:

    1) Matching was used to address the non-random assignment of CFM to the different units of analysis: this was
       conducted via a careful choice of covariates to ensure as precisely as possible that the only difference between
       the treated and non-treated units was the implementation or not of CFM. This step involved a careful choice of
       the covariates to be controlled between the two groups (the CFM and non-CFM). Those covariates were pressure
       and access-related (Appendix B, table B3) for the deforestation analysis and site and household characteristics for
       the well-being analysis (Appendix H, table H5).

    2) While the forest cover map from 2000 was used as baseline data for the deforestation analysis, a falsification test
       had to be performed to address the lack of baseline data for the well-being analysis: it was aimed at
       demonstrating that both treated and untreated households did not differ in terms of well-being at baseline, in
       the absence of CFM (or to know the direction of the bias if the differences at the baseline cannot be controlled).
       The falsification test provides the percentage of the outcome variable (household expenditure in our case) for the
       treated units compared to the untreated ones. The results of the falsification test are associated with a level of
       significance (p-value).

    3) Sensitivity analysis was conducted to check the robustness of the results to unobservable variables (i.e. the
       parameter from the sensitivity analysis), associated with a p-value, measures, the likelihood for unobservable
       variables to make the treated units receive the intervention (compared to observably similar non-treated ones)
        for the results of the impact analysis to remain significant (e.g. a Γ value of 1.2 at p<0.05 would mean that the
        results of the impact evaluation analysis remains significant at p-value 0.05 even if unobservable variables make
        the treated units 1.2 times more likely to receive treatment than the observably similar units).

    A. IMPACTS OF CFM ON DEFORESTATION


    METHODS

21.    Impacts of CFM on conservation were measured by the extent of deforestation having
occurred between 2000 and 2010 in forests within and outside CFM areas. We used deforestation
data developed by ONE et al. (2013). These are based on satellite images from Landsat TM and
Landsat ETM+ and have a resolution of 28.5 meters and an accuracy rate close to 90 percent. Full
methods are in Harper et al. (2007).

22.     Information on CFM contracts was obtained from multiple sources. These include
organizations involved in implementation of CFM such as the “Direction de la Valorisation des
Ressources Forestieres”8 (DVRF). Information was also obtained from the Office National pour
l’Environnement (ONE), various NGOs that promote CFM, including Asity, Fanamby, Durrell Wildlife
Conservation Trust, Conservation International, Wildlife Conservation Society, and World Wide Fund
for Nature. In total, we counted 1248 CFM units with natural forest resources throughout the country
(Appendix K).

23.    The study sample included only CFM established between 2000 and 2005. This was mainly to
allow at least 5 years of CFM implementation after the establishment of the contract. Undated CFM
contracts and CFM established before 2000 or after 2005 were excluded from the sample. We also
excluded protected areas managed by Madagascar National Parks, as these contracts are not
comparable to the typical GELOSE or GCF contract. Finally, extensions of protected areas, temporary
and new protected areas created since 2003, were excluded. However, any portions of these newly
created protected areas that were known to be community managed were considered as CFM (see
Appendix B Table B1 for how CFM, non-CFM and excluded areas fit into official Madagascar forest
statuses since 2003). Table 1 provides a summary of the total number of CFM in the sample.

24.   The analysis on the impacts of CFM on reducing deforestation was divided into three
dimensions:

    -   Overall effectiveness of Madagascar’s CFM policy at reducing deforestation by looking at all
        CFM units across the country. We considered the entire sample, composed of contracts
        satisfying the eligibility criteria stated above.

  DVRF is part of the Direction Générale des Forêts (DGF): most of the data we gathered from DVRF derived from Alexio Clovis
Lohanivo’s Doctorate research. Before then, there was no nation-wide data about CFM in Madagascar.

                                                                                                                         12
-   Effectiveness of CFM at reducing deforestation in a subsample of CFM units where we have
    information to suggest that CFM was fully implemented on the ground. Malagasy CFM
    contracts vary in their implementation quality. Some were established with little input from
    local communities (Rives et al. 2013), and others received little or no external support
    (Hockley & Andriamarovololona 2007). It is very difficult to get information on the
    implementation quality of the individual CFM projects. We looked at whether a CFM unit
    passed the forest department evaluation that is undertaken three years after the contract was
    signed (Pollini & Lassoie 2011) as an indicator of whether the project was indeed
    implemented. While not an ideal indicator, it does at least suggest the CFM unit has met the
    basic institutional, socio-economic and environmental criteria of the evaluation. We refer to
    units that passed the evaluation as CFM units that have information to suggest
    implementation.

-   Effectiveness of CFM at reducing deforestation depending on whether CFM enables or
    prohibits the commercial use of forest resources. CFM implementation in Madagascar varies
    according to regulations related to commercial use of forest resources. Commercial CFM
    allows the sustainable exploitation of timber and adopts it as a conservation strategy. Non-
    commercial CFM contracts do not allow commercial uses and follow a pure conservation
    strategy (Randrianarivelo et al. 2012). Because there are no reliable national data regarding
    where commercial uses are permitted within CFM, we could conduct analyses on commercial
    and non-commercial CFM on four sites only, where we were able to ascertain information on
    commercial uses through field visits, interviews with site managers or search for existing
    literature. The four sites are Didy, Tsitongambarika, Menabe and Boeny (Figure 2). All CFM
    units that we considered in these four sites had passed the forest department evaluation.
    Table 1 indicates the number of CFM units, the area of land and natural forest covered by each
    type of CFM considered in our deforestation analyses.

25.     Impact evaluation has been conducted with six comparison groups. Table 2 summarizes the
data gathered. The first analysis compares forest dynamics in areas with CFM established between
2000 and 2005 to forest dynamics in areas without CFM (or non-CFM sites or areas, for brevity). The
second compares forests in CFM areas that suggest implementation (i.e. evaluation completed by the
forest administration) to forests in areas with no CFM. Note that non-CFM areas refer to forests that,
up to 2010, were not technically and financially supported by particular organizations and thus were
under government control. Since the government has been weak and unable to enforce forest laws,
these forests are practically open access (Raik, 2007; Urech et al., 2013).

26.     The four remaining comparisons are with regards to commercial and non-commercial CFM
contracts. The third and fourth analyses compare, respectively, commercial and non-commercial CFM
to non-CFM. The fifth and sixth compare commercial to non-commercial CFM, and vice versa. The
difference between the fifth and sixth analysis rests upon the type of matching applied to the
sampled pixels used in the comparison. The CFM forests where commercial use is permitted may be
observably different from the CFM forests where such use is prohibited (in terms of the confounding
factors). To understand how deforestation in commercial CFM forests would have been different
without commercial use requires that we compare commercial CFM forests to non-commercial CFM
forests that are observably similar at baseline (in terms of the confounding factors). So the
comparison of commercial to non-commercial CFM uses an intervention group of all the randomly
selected commercial CFM pixels and a comparison group of only the best matches of non-commercial
CFM pixels. Dissimilar pixels from the non-commercial CFM sample are discarded. The estimate from
this comparison represents the average impact of permitting commercial use on the types of CFM
                                                                                                   14
forests where commercial use has been permitted. The impact of commercial use may be different on
the types of CFM forests where commercial use has been prohibited. To estimate this impact, we
formed an intervention group of all the randomly selected non-commercial CFM pixels and a
comparison group of only the best matches of CFM-commercial pixels. Figure 2 shows CFM with
natural forest resources, commercial CFM sites used for the analysis in this report, and non-
commercial CFM sites.

27.     The unit of analysis is a forested pixel from the 2000 forest cover baseline (See Appendix C
for limitations of using 2000 baseline forest cover and CFM established between 2000 and 2005, and
Appendix B for how we deal with potential pseudo-replication in which pixels within a particular CFM
are not independent). For each forested pixel at baseline, covariates take the values of each
confounding characteristic at that pixel location. For each analysis (Table 2), we selected random
forested pixels in intervention areas. Then, we used matching9 to pair each randomly selected pixel
with the most similar pixel in comparison areas in terms of covariates. The outcome variable is
whether a pixel remained forested or not in the 2010 land cover. The estimated difference in
deforestation between intervention areas and similar comparison areas represents the impact of the
intervention on deforestation for intervention sites or the Average Treatment effect on the Treated
(ATT). We used independent samples T-test to compare deforestation between intervention areas
and similar or counterfactual areas.

28.    We performed exact matching on vegetation zones (eastern humid, western deciduous and
southern spiny forests, Appendix D Figure D1). We executed bias adjustment regression to correct for
any remaining post-matching covariate imbalance (Abadie & Imbens 2006). We used the ‘matching’
package in R (Sekhon 2011).

29.   We aimed to select sample sizes that balance our interests in achieving high statistical
power and reducing computer processing time. Learning from multiple trial analyses, we decided on
a sample of around 30,000 pixels for all intervention areas in each analysis. For comparison areas, we
sampled around two to four times more pixels (Appendix B Table B2). The larger sample size from
comparison areas increases the probability of finding a good match for each intervention pixel.

                                                                                                   17
     RESULTS: IMPACTS OF CFM ON DEFORESTATION ANALYSIS

30.      Before matching, we note a number of differences between the units of analysis, confirming
non-random treatment. CFM pixels are, on average, located closer to recent deforestation, to a road
and to an urban center, and are characterized by shorter trip durations to an urban center than non-
CFM pixels. Although these patterns suggest CFM is assigned to areas of higher deforestation
pressure, CFM is also located on lands less suitable for agriculture and on lands at higher elevation
(Appendix B Table B5). Commercial CFM pixels are, on average, associated with lands more suitable
for irrigated rice, closer to a village, a road and an urban center and are characterized by shorter trip
duration to urban centers and higher population density. However, they are located on lands less
suitable for agriculture and on steeper slopes than non-commercial CFM sites (Appendix B Tables B9,
B10).

31.    Matching generally improves covariate balance. The mean differences and the mean raw
eQQ differences10 of covariates in intervention and counterfactual areas tend toward zero after
matching (Appendix B Tables B5 – D10). An exception is the suitability for agriculture in the
comparisons of commercial and non-commercial CFM, and vice versa. Matching does not improve
balance for this factor (Appendix B Tables B9, B10). This is because all suitable lands for agriculture
are found only in the non-commercial CFM in Menabe. Thus, there are no matched suitable lands in
commercial CFM. We describe potential effects of this imbalance in the discussion.

32.      The results of the analysis are robust and suggest no significant impact of CFM on
deforestation. Between 2000 and 2010, CFM sites had, on average, 0.02 percent less deforestation
than matched non-CFM sites, a statistically insignificant difference (p = 0.89, Figure 3). When we
consider only CFM with information suggesting implementation, CFM had 0.71 percent less
deforestation than matched non-CFM, but still statistically insignificant (p = 0.78). Differentiating CFM
by whether commercial uses are allowed, we estimate that commercial CFM experienced 1.83
percent more deforestation than matched non-CFM (p = 0.16). Non-commercial CFMs reduced
deforestation by 2.01 percent relative to matched non-CFM (p < 0.001). When we compare
commercial CFM to matched non-commercial CFM, to investigate their relative effectiveness on the
types of CFM forests where commercial use has been permitted (i.e., forests on lands more suitable
for irrigated rice, closer to a village, a road and an urban center, shorter trip duration to urban center,
higher population density), commercial CFM experienced 3.24 percent more deforestation (p<0.001).

effectiveness on the types of forests where commercial use has been prohibited (i.e., forests on lands

by 5.59 percent (p < 0.001, Figure 3).

33.     Table 3 presents the results of the sensitivity of our analyses to hidden bias (i.e., an
unobservable covariate). For example, where the parameter Γ is 1.38, the estimate of 2.01 percent
remains significantly different from zero at a p value of 0.05 even if unobservable covariates make
non-commercial CFM pixels 1.38 times more likely to receive intervention than non-CFM pixels. In
other words, unobservable covariates need to increase the likelihood of the non-commercial pixels to
receiving intervention by a factor greater than 1.83 in order for the impact estimate to be statistically
insignificant from zero.

     B. IMPACTS ON WELFARE


     METHODS

34.     The variable used to measure the impact of CFM policy on welfare is the annual household
per capita consumption expenditure. This measure comes from two sources of data collected by the
National Institute of Statistics of Madagascar (INSTAT): (i) Enquête Périodique Auprès des Ménages
2010 (EPM 2010) ; and (ii) Enquête Nationale sur le Suivi des Objectifs du Millénaire pour le
Développement à Madagascar 2012 (ENSOMD 2012). The two sources provide comparable data as
they used similar questionnaires and were designed to monitor households’ well-being throughout
Madagascar. EPM 2010 surveyed a nationally representative random sample of 12,460 households.
ENSOMD 2012 was carried out on 16,920 randomly selected households. Thus, together they
collected data on randomly sampled 29,380 households throughout Madagascar. Household per
capita consumption expenditure from EPM 2010 and ENSOMD 2012 comprise food, non-food
consumption, durable goods and housing expenditure that were aggregated following methods in
Deaton and Zaidi (2002). We adjusted for regional and temporal differences in prices and converted
to 2005 international dollars.

35.     The unit of analysis is a household, and the sample has been constructed as follows. We only
considered CFM established before or in 2007 for EPM 2010 and before or in 2009 for ENSOMD 2012
to allow reasonable time for impacts to take place (i.e., 3 years), which corresponds to the first
evaluation of the CFM12. Among the sampled households, the numbers of treated and untreated
households in our analyses are shown in table 4. CFM (treated) households are those located within a
commune that has 10 percent or more of its area covered by CFM. As our results may be sensitive to
this arbitrary 10 percent threshold, we performed an analysis at 25 percent threshold as a sensitivity
test. Non-CFM (untreated) households are those located within a commune that has less than 1
percent of its area covered by CFM. This is to make sure that potential impacts of CFM are minimal, if
any, in non-CFM households. We excluded from the analyses households that are located within a
commune that has between 1 percent and 10 percent of its area covered by CFM. Households within
communes, with less than 5 percent of forest areas and urban households, were excluded. We used
the percentage of the area of a commune covered by CFM as threshold to designate CFM and non-
CFM households because CFM impacts may extend well beyond CFM boundaries, which only include
the community managed forests and do not include the areas inhabited by the managing
communities in certain cases. The commune is also one of the signatory parties defined by the


12
   The choice of the 3 years of implementation was based on the fact that according to the GELOSE law, any CFM contract has to be
evaluated after 3 years from its signature before it can be renewed, suggesting that some tangible progress should be recorded within
this timeframe.


                                                                                                                                    20
GELOSE law. It also receives taxes from commercial use of forest resources in CFM that permits such
activity (Randrianarivelo et al. 2012). Improved or degraded ecosystem services provided by the
community managed forests may also affect the well-being of people beyond CFM boundaries.

36.    The analysis of CFM policy impacts on welfare has been performed by conducing three
groups of comparisons:

   -    The first analysis compares households in communes that have more than 10 percent of their
        area under CFM with households in communes with no CFM (households that are similar in
        terms of the site and household confounding characteristics, located within a commune that
        has less than 1 percent of its area covered by CFM).

   -    The second analysis compares households in communes with more than 25 percent of their
        area under CFM with non-CFM households.

   -    The third comparison checks for an eventual heterogeneous impact of CFM. To reflect the
        potential heterogeneity of impacts as a function of household location (spatial distribution of
        impact), we divided the sampled households into two subgroups: households within 3 km
        from forest edge and households beyond 3 km from forest edge. We then investigated CFM
        impacts in the subgroup within 3km from forest edge. We could not do the same for the
        subgroup beyond 3 km from forest edge because there are not enough comparable non-CFM
        households for the analysis to be carried out.




                                                                                                    21
    RESULTS: IMPACTS OF CFM ON HOUSEHOLD WELL-BEING

37.     Before matching, CFM and non-CFM households do not differ much in terms of household
characteristics (Appendix E). In contrast, the differences between CFM and non-CFM households are
large for some site characteristics before matching. CFM communes have more forest area and
percentage of forest area, on average, than non-CFM communes (30,166 hectares vs. 18,558 hectares
and 34.7 percent vs. 24.7 percent). CFM communes also have, on average, less road-less and cart
trackless volumes than non-CFM communes (8,084 km3 vs. 8,722 km3 and 2,214 km3 vs. 2,352 km3
respectively). CFM communes are less densely populated than non-CFM communes on average (34.7
vs. 38.6 inhabitants per km2). Finally, CFM communes are located in shorter trip duration to urban
center than non-CFM communes (19.6 vs. 31.3 hours) (Appendix E).

38.     Overall, matching improved covariate balance. This is shown by the post-matching mean
differences and mean raw eQQ differences of covariates in CFM and non-CFM households (Appendix
E).

39.      The results of the work are robust and suggest that there was no significant impact of CFM
in improving households’ livelihoods, except for those who live within 3km from the forest edge.
The result of the falsification test suggests that CFM households had 0.56 percent (US$ 1.71) less per
capita consumption expenditure than non-CFM households in the absence of intervention, a result
that is not statistically significant (p. 0.97) (Table 6). The analysis, in which CFM households are those
located within a commune that has 10 percent or more of its area covered by CFM, shows that CFM
increased per capita consumption expenditure of CFM households by 4.33 percent (US$ 12.57)
relative to non-CFM households, a difference that is not statistically significant (p. 0.43). When the
threshold is brought up to 25 percent, this difference increases to 6.00 percent (US$ 18.53), which is
still not statistically significant (p. 0.52). Finally, we found that CFM improved per capita consumption
expenditure of CFM households by 18.55 percent (US$ 51.42) (statistically significant, p. 0.03) in
location nearer to forest edge (Table 5).

   C. DISCUSSION

40.     The analysis suggests that decentralization of forest management to local communities in
Madagascar may not have, on average, achieved its forest conservation goal. In terms of
deforestation, we cannot detect an effect, on average, of CFM compared to non CFM, even after
restricting the sample to sites where we have information to suggest CFM implementation on the
ground (i.e. where the CFM has passed the forest administration’s evaluation three years after
establishment).

41.     While CFM might have failed, on average, to reduce deforestation relative to non-CFM, non-
commercial CFM appear to have had more success, albeit a small one. Putting all types of CFM in
one basket would lead to the conclusion that CFM is not an effective approach to reduce
deforestation, obscuring the positive impact non-commercial CFM appear to have had. This result
emphasizes the importance of differentiating among types of CFM in evaluation (Lund et al., 2009).
Potential mechanisms through which non-commercial CFM may have had relatively more success are
complementary direct payments for conservation. Some non-commercial CFM in our work sites in
Didy, Tsitongambarika and Menabe practiced direct payments to conservation schemes to offset
restrictions introduced by interventions (e.g. Brimont and Bidaud, 2014; Sommerville, Milner-Gulland,
et al. 2010).

42.     Commercial CFM tend to increase deforestation compared to non-commercial CFM. The
estimated reduction in deforestation from non-commercial CFM is important given that the role of
commercial use of forests in conservation is subject to much debate in theoretical and empirical
studies. Some studies argue that by assigning value to forests, commercial use provides means and
incentives for local communities to protect forests, while others show that it can trigger the
destruction of the resources being commercialized (Agrawal & Chhatre 2006; Persha et al. 2011). Our
findings do not support the argument that permitting commercial extraction can enhance the
deforestation-reducing impacts of CFM.

43.     Our measure of the relative performance of non-commercial CFM vis-à-vis commercial CFM
is conservative. Our matching algorithm was unable to remove the pre-matching difference between
commercial and non-commercial CFM in terms of agriculture suitability (Appendix B Tables B9, B10).
After matching, commercial CFM has lower suitable lands for agriculture (0 percent) than non-
commercial CFM (29 percent). However, knowledge of the direction of the effect of agriculture
suitability on deforestation allows us to infer the implications of the post-matching imbalance.
Gorenflo et al. (2011) show that lower suitability for agriculture is associated with lower deforestation
rates in Madagascar. Thus, the post-matching imbalance should occasion lower deforestation in
commercial CFM than non-commercial CFM. Therefore, if matching had balanced the suitability for
agriculture between the two types of CFM, commercial CFM performance relative to non-commercial

                                                                                                      23
CFM would have appeared even worse because the lower deforestation occasioned by the lower land
suitability in commercial CFM would have been erased. Our estimates of impacts for commercial
versus non-commercial CFM, and vice versa, are thus conservative.

44.     At the national level, our findings substantiate the rather gloomy pictures of CFM in
Madagascar depicted in a number of institutional and policy studies. See for example Pollini et al.,
2014; Pollini and Lassoie, 2011; Raik and Decker, 2007; Rives et al., 2013; Urech et al., 2013. To
explain the ineffectiveness of CFM, these studies describe inadequate integration of local
participation, resource capture by elites, unfulfilled support promises by different organizations, and
lack of capacity of the community and state, among other factors. A recent empirical study (CIRAD,
2013) is of particular interest because it also looked explicitly at the impact of CFM on deforestation
and covered part of our study areas, and its results contradict ours. It found that deforestation was
significantly less in CFM than in areas without community conservation. It also shows that commercial
CFM was more effective at reducing deforestation than non-commercial CFM. The results are not
directly comparable to ours because the analyses cover a different time period and are at a different
spatial scale, but the CIRAD study should be interpreted with care because it did not adequately
control the biases in confounding factors as we do here. Failure to adequately control such biases can
result in incorrect impact estimates (Andam et al. 2008; Joppa and Pfaff, 2011).

45.   The transfer of forest management rights to local communities has not improved household
economic living standards in Madagascar at larger scale (Municipality level). However, CFM has
enhanced the economic living standards at a smaller scale, for households living along forest edges.
We have some confidence that our findings are robust to the missing baseline outcome or any other
unobserved confounding characteristics because the falsification test shows that, in the absence of
CFM, the household per capita consumption expenditure levels are similar in CFM and non-CFM
households.

46.     Our finding that CFM improved local livelihoods of household along forest edges lends
support to some previous studies in other developing countries. For example, Bandyopadhyay &
Tembo (2010) study on the participation of local communities in game management areas in Zambia
recorded higher per capita consumption expenditure for households living in the management areas.
Other studies show that households have better livelihoods by participating in local forest user groups
(Bandyopadhyay and Tembo 2010, Ameha et al. 2014, Gelo and Koch 2014). However we could not
investigate the impacts on those explicitly participating in forest user groups (i.e. VOI members in
Madagascar) because our data did not allow us to differentiate between participant and non-
participant households.

     D. CAVEATS AND RESEARCH AGENDA

47.     One of the contributions of this report to the literature on CFM impacts in Madagascar is the
careful control of site and household characteristics. Most of the existing Madagascar specific
literature takes a case study approach. As such, earlier studies have benefited from locally specific
information, allowing them to provide a crispier picture at the site level. Our study, which is based on
national level surveys that were not originally intended to evaluate CFM impacts, has probably failed
to take into account some relevant dimensions of the CFM universe. Data from EPM 2010 and
ENSOMD 2012, while nationally representative, may not be representative of communities affected
by CFM. It may be the case that certain types of forest households are underrepresented in the
samples. Therefore our findings should be interpreted with caution.

48.     Some caveats are in order. In particular, we should not disregard the context of the period
covered by the analysis. VOI experienced many difficulties during the period 2005-2010 to exercise
their prerogatives. For example, commercial use of forest products was prohibited from VOI forests
between 2000 and 2007, then, they were suspended multiple times (in 2008, then in 2011 and 2014),
by means of various ministerial notes suspending commercial activities. As a consequence, there were
very few of these lawful activities that could be conducted, resulting in potentially lower incomes for
farmers (Rahajason et al. 2014).

49.     Caution should be taken related to the 3-year implementation of CFM, taken as threshold in
the welfare analysis. Although based on the GELOSE law, the 3-year implementation of CFM might be
not enough to reflect tangible positive outcomes, especially in economic terms for the households. It
is possible that changing the number of years of implementation would yield more positive results,
however, due to data limitation, the team could not conduct sensitivity analysis by increasing this
threshold: already, only 5,575 out of the 29,380 households in the initial database could be used for
the analysis; increasing the threshold would have meant losing a lot more cases (and the related
valuable information).

50.     The negative performance of commercial CFM should not directly imply a failure of CFM, as
other forces might be at play. Commercial use of forests would usually lead to the degradation of
forests, and not to deforestation (exploitation of natural forest by clear-cutting is prohibited,
including in CFM). Deforestation at the scale of a 28.5m x 28.5m pixel13 implies a regression of the
wooded canopy which can only be obtained by clearing, usually driven by a conversion of forest to
farmland, wildfires or fires to show discontent. That conversion to cropland that might have been at

  The spatial resolution of the analysis is 28.5m; ONE resized the Landsat images (originally at 30m resolution) to have 28.5m pixels.
Each pixel was then classified in one of the following categories: natural forests, mangroves, tapia forests, water, cloud, cloud shade.

                                                                                                                                     25
play is supported by the welfare impact results. In fact, it is possible that the increase in consumption
may also (and especially) come from the conversion of forest lands into agricultural lands. The
economic profitability of forest land converted to cropland is for the most vulnerable households
highly profitable in the short-term, even compared to the commercial use of the forest
(Ramamonjisoa, 200114) without securing land tenure. Without forest control, sustainability of
forested land is difficult to achieve as long as the forest constitutes a reserve of fertile suitable
agricultural land. In all cases, the significant results of the adverse impact of CFM and the commercial
use of forests on deforestation seem to primarily express the inability of the VOI to enforce rules on
members of the community (VOI members, the fokonolona or the migrants).

51.    A more systematic analysis of CFM policy impacts should aim at identifying the factors of the
mixed performance. Many factors can influence effectiveness of CFM (Agrawal 2003). We focused on
the potential role of commercial use of forest resources (and given our study area, the potential that
complementary direct payment for conservation could have on non-commercial CFM). Another
potential moderating factor is the amount of resources invested, which may explain the apparently
better performance of non-commercial CFM in comparison to commercial CFM. During our visit to
Didy, officials in areas with commercial CFM complained about receiving smaller resources compared
to their peers in neighboring non-commercial CFM areas (implemented by different organizations
with different funding). However, we lacked quantitative information on spending to allow this
potential moderator of success to be included in the analysis. Data regarding additional sources of
finance will also offer opportunities to extend our study by exploring CFM cost-effectiveness in the
future. Our findings also suggest that differentiating among types of CFM is important when
evaluating effectiveness. Availability of information on institutional arrangements, degree of power
devolved to local communities, and forest physical characteristics will allow more differentiation
among types of CFM and thus will shed more light on the factors that promote effective CFM. Future
studies that collect and use information on the eight design principles of robust, self-governed
common-pool resources institutions of Ostrom (2000) (Appendix O), will be a first step toward
exploring factors that make CFM effective.

   III. UNDERLYING DRIVERS OF CFM INEFFECTIVENESS: LEGAL AND STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS

52.     The impact evaluation in the previous section points at the potentially poor performance of
Madagascar’s CFM both in terms of conservation and welfare. This in spite of the long lasting
experience accumulated in the country’s almost 20 years of CFM policy application. As noted above,
Madagascar has been one of the first southern hemisphere countries to have put in place an original
legal framework for CFM (Andriantsilavo et al., 2006. Montagne et al., 2007). The analysis showed
that CFM did not have significant impacts on reducing deforestation. It may actually have had
perverse effects in CFM sites allowing the commercial use of forest resources. The analysis also
showed that CFM did not have significant impacts on reducing poverty, excluding perhaps for those
individuals living closest to forest edges.

53.     This section analyzes the underlying drivers of this apparent ineffectiveness of CFM, mainly
from a legal and institutional perspective. Background work has been undertaken to systematically
review the legislation on CFM in Madagascar and the sector legislation that is directly or indirectly
linked to the practice of CFM. This has been accompanied by an analysis of the policy’s actual
implementation by relevant stakeholders, and by a stakeholder analysis looking at their relevance and
power to influence policy outcomes. Due to resource limitations, the analysis of the actual
implementation of CFM is necessarily limited. The section on recommendation offers some avenues
for further analytical work.

54.     In general, there are four main underlying drivers of ineffectiveness of the policy. The first
one is that GELOSE law, which is the pillar of CFM in Madagascar, has never become fully functional as
it was never complemented by all the required implementation decrees. This regulatory gap is also
combined with the internal contradictions present in other legal texts on forest areas. The second
driver is found in the lack of consistency between different sector’s laws and policies and the CFM
policy. This opens the way to conflicts and ineffectiveness. Thirdly, different actors involved in CFM
implementation have different objectives that are not necessarily compatible, but also not necessarily
compatible with CFM objectives in general. And last, law enforcement and the rule of law present
substantial weaknesses both at the local and at the national levels. They are described below.


   A. AN UNFINISHED CFM REGULATORY BODY

55.    Law 96-025, known as GELOSE, occupies a central role in the application of CFM in
Madagascar. The law was introduced after acknowledging that the participation of local communities
in the management of forest resources and renewable natural resources in general was crucial for
achieving better conservation results. The law is based on the principle that sustainable use of
resources and land tenure security are crucial for improving local communities’ well-being, hence
                                                                                                   27
ensuring their engagement. The law foresees the establishment of a contract between three parties:
(i) the owner of the resource, be it the State or a local or regional authority, ultimately responsible for
the conservation of natural resources; (ii) a group of individuals from the local community legally
grouped in an entity called Vondron'Olona Ifotony (VOI15); and (iii) the municipality, responsible for
planning at the local level.

56.     CFM is effectively a delegation of a public service emanating from the State in favor of VOIs.
In fact, according to Law 97-017, text of reference of the forest policy16, the forest administration
exercises over the whole national territory of Madagascar a mission of public service of sustainable
forest management. Through contracts, the VOIs agree to fulfill this public service mission on behalf
of the State, under conditions negotiated by mutual agreement17. Hence through GELOSE, CFM is
intended as a form of ‘decentralization’, in terms of delegation of the management of forest
resources from the central Government to local actors (Aubert et al., 2015).

57.     A first issue is that while GELOSE requires the application of multiple decrees and
regulations, these regulatory efforts remain unachieved to date. GELOSE covers forests, wild
terrestrial and aquatic fauna and flora, water and the transition land areas (art. 2). Depending on the
type of resource, it is the responsibility of the relevant Ministries and local authorities to establish,
through legal and regulatory provisions, the law’s implementation modalities (art. 56). However, only
the forest administration has so far produced an implementation text through Decree 2001-122
known as “Gestion Contractualisée des Forets”, meaning the “Management of Forests under
Contracts”, or GCF. The decree establishes the conditions for the implementation of community-
based management of State forests. In practice, all 1,248 CFM contracts existing to date are contracts
for which the State considers itself the resource owner18.

58.    The intended cohesion between ‘legal’ and ‘legitimate’ resource use rights also remains
unachieved. In issuing the GELOSE, the legislator has done an unprecedented effort to recognize both
the customary rights of populations in their ‘terroir’ (art. 1), and the ultimate property rights of the
State or decentralized authority (art. 2). For this association between ‘legitimate’ and ‘legal’ rights

15
   The assumption under GELOSE was that the VOI would include a big part of the fokonolona, which would provide legitimity within the
community for its purpose and actions. In fact, originally, it was intended to use the term fokonolona iself. However, the proposition
was rejected at the time by the parliament because of its semantic vagueness (Bertrand et al., 2014).
16
   Before this law was published, forest rights were governed by the related decree issued on 25 January 1930.
17
   Special management delegation to VOI: According to GELOSE law, sustainable use of renewable natural resources constitute the
ultimate objective of CFM contracts (art. 1). Likewise, the 2001-122 decree on the GCF, puts the CFM in place for the VOI to be
accountable of the management of forest resources, along with forest policy orientations and objectives (97-1200 decree), in
conformity with the Malagasy Environment Charter (90-033 law and its subsequent revised texts).
18
  However it is not always true, the State considers itself as the owner of the resources. There is there confusion between the forest
administration’s public service mission and the presumption of property of the resources.


                                                                                                                                         28
(Aubert, 2002) to work, the law requires: (i) the intervention of an environmental mediator, whose
role is to ensure that all stakeholders involved in the negotiations are given equal weight, given the
divergent interests at play (decree 2000-028)19 but also to ensure the long term viability of CFM
contracts; (ii) the possibility of providing relative land tenure security, after joint delineation of the
land subject to management delegation (Decree 98-610); and (iii) the responsibility of the
Municipality "within the jurisdiction of which the resources, object of the application of transfer of
management are located" in the definition and implementation of its territorial development policy.
These three principles, however, have not been integrated in the GCF decree. In addition, the decree
was never published in the Official Journal of the Republic of Madagascar (JORM) and thus remains
not enforceable against third parties. In practice, it is common to make the distinction between
GELOSE-based CFM relating to the provisions of the law, and GCF-based CFM responding to the
regulatory provisions. The later now accounts for the majority of CFM (Cf. distribution map in
Appendix G).

59.     Thirdly, the gap in implementation texts also opened the way to inconsistencies between
the principles of the GCF decree and other texts, particularly those dealing with conservation. One
such inconsistency is found between the GCF20 text and the protected areas codes (COAP) of 2001
which (art.19 and art.20) does not include the possibility of implementing CFM in protected areas (in
the controlled settlement zones, in the controlled utilization zones, or the peripheral zones). This
allowed organizations delegated to manage new protected areas to have substantial latitude in
creating ad hoc CFM contracts, tailored to the organization’s objectives and falling outside of the
general principles established by the GCF decree and the GELOSE law (Bertrand et al. 2012). This lack
of coherence has been fueled by the financing decisions of the international community, notably the
donor community and the international NGOs, and their selective support to the development and
conservation agendas over the years. These emphasized: (i) the support to a conservation agenda
that largely neglected the productive use of natural resources in spite of the inevitable demand of
timber and non-timber forest products at the local, national and international levels (Bertrand et al.,
2009); (ii) the support to a land tenure reform that has focused exclusively on agricultural land,
neglecting the issue of land tenure security for forested lands21.

60.   Absence of implementation texts not limited to the GELOSE law. The absence of
implementing texts is not uncommon for forest and environmental laws and this makes interpretation

19
   In 2002, a committee of environmental mediators, chaired by the general secretary of the Ministry of environment was put in place.
Forty-four environmental mediators were officially recognized. However, since then, none of the licenses or national lists of
environmental mediators were updated.
20
   The forest administration conceives the delegation of forests management to the VOI for “domanial forests, classified forests, forest
stations, planted forests, and, in the protected areas, in the controlled settlement zones, in the controlled utilization zones, or the
peripheral zones” (art. 5 of the 2001-122 decree), in other terms, forests under forest land reserve status.
21
   GELOSE had made forest land tenure security a pillar of community based management.

                                                                                                                                     29
of the laws, notably vis-à-vis CFM, particularly difficult. The background analysis of the five texts
referenced in table 6 showed that only 7 implementing decrees were enacted and 17 legislations
(laws, decrees or orders) are not yet subject to publication.

22Although the 98-610 decree of August 13 1998 sets land tenure securing as implementation of the 90-033 law, related to the
environment charter, modified by the 97-012 law of June 06 1997, its art.2 explicitly states that land tenure securing is for implementing
the GELOSE law 96-025.

                                                                                                                                       30
61.    Figure 4 and Table 7 provide a comprehensive view of the key inconsistencies between
GELOSE and other texts and among CFM relevant texts. The review undertaken for this report
conducted an analysis of 1 decree, 4 laws (including the 2001-005 law, repealed and substituted by
the 2015-005 law on the new protected areas code COAP) and 6 implementing decrees for forest and
environmental law (Appendix L).

62.    Inconsistencies can be noted at two levels: between the 4 laws and between the laws and
the implementation decrees:

     •    Between the laws. The major inconsistencies include: (i) under the GELOSE law, the
          management of certain categories of resources23 can be transferred to the VOI; however,
          neither the forest law, nor the GELOSE law provide any list of those resources; leaving things
          open to interpretation, which, in turn, might become source of confusion; (ii) the infractions
          law (60-128) does not have any provision related to the liability regime for the VOI; (iii) the
          COAP law (2015-005), in its art.19 and art.20 do not state any provision for implementing CFM
          in protected areas, as the art.5 of the GCF decree suggested24. This would constitute a step
          back for the implementation of CFM.

     •    Between the laws and the different implementation decrees. Many inconsistencies exist
          between the laws and the related implementation decrees but the major ones include: (i) the
          complete omission of the use of the service of an environmental mediator and the land tenure
          securing in the GCF decree despite the provision in the GELOSE law and its importance for
          having an effective implementation of CFM; (ii) one of the main purposes of GELOSE is to
          provide VOI with the possibility to earn economic profits from the management of the
          resources in return of the delegation of public service they accepted. Although decree 98-782
          on forest management provides the possibility for the economic valuation option, its art.4
          explicitly requires training certification (or diploma attesting that the person has the right
          expertise and experience in the activity) for any individual who wishes to be issued a forest
          harvesting authorization. Furthermore, it does not specify any guidance on what would be the
          equivalent of those trainings to VOIs; this limits considerably the likelihood for VOIs to benefit
          from these activities; (iii) the prohibition for the VOI to confiscate illicit products by the
          infractions ordinance also goes against the provisions in the GCF decree; a related risk is the
          impunity of authors of infractions.


23
   Under the GELOSE law, the management of forest, terrestrial and aquatic fauna and flora, water and pasture land resources can be
transferred to the VOI.
24
   The forest administration conceives the delegation of the management of the forests to the VOI in the “domanial forests, classified
forests, forest stations, planted forests, and, in the protected areas, in the controlled settlement zones, in the controlled utilization zones,
or the peripheral zones” (art. 5 of the 2001-122 decree); in other terms, forests under forest land reserve status.

                                                                                                                                             31
     •   Between the implementation decrees. Of the many inconsistencies between the different
         implementation decrees, we can enumerate: (i) the complete absence of land tenure securing
         in the GCF decree although it is present in the 98-610 decree about land tenure securing,
         which is also an implementation decree of the GELOSE law; (ii) the GCF decree, with the
         provision for VOI to sub-contract timber-harvesting activities to professionals, is in
         contradiction with the decree 98-782 on timber harvesting, preventing any sub-contracting
         possibilities under a management contract scheme; lastly, (iii) under the forest law, the
         incentives for valorizing forest products from CFM is complicated to implement because the
         implementation text25 is missing.




25

All of these inconsistencies within the forest and the environment have contributed to make the
implementation of CFM difficult, despite the legislator’s good intentions at the time of preparation of
the GELOSE. The possibility for the VOI to get economic profits from the forest resources that they are
managing is particularly difficult.




                                                                                                                                                    34
     B. SUB-OPTIMAL SYNERGIES BETWEEN CFM AND SECTOR POLICIES

63.     The ineffectiveness of the CFM policy in promoting conservation and boosting the
livelihoods of local communities can also be linked to the weak integration of CFM with sector
policies, this in spite of substantial progress over time. The analysis conducted for this report
reviewed key pieces of sector legislation including those on land tenure, agriculture, energy and
mining, and decentralization, among others. Figure 5 and table 8 provide a summary. The review
allowed to conclude that important progress has been made over the years. Yet, the lack of synergy
with land tenure policies is particularly problematic. Synergies are existent, in the texts, notably with
the agriculture and decentralization policies, but weak implementation means that more could be
done in practice.

64.     Progress to date. Since the publication of GELOSE, sector level reforms have recognized
directly or indirectly the importance of natural resources management and of CFM in particular. In
2005, the Policy note on Decentralization and Deconcentration stressed the importance of turning
decentralized authorities into key actors for the sustainable management of natural resources, in
order to promote sustainable development. The policy also recognized the importance for
Municipalities, Regions and Provinces to rely on the participation of local communities. The policy also
gave a role of monitoring and control to the deconcentrated authorities (i.e. the technical services of
the central ministries located in the various regions). In 2006, the National Policy for Regional
Planning made explicit reference to the 2004 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and its objective of
promoting community-based rational management of forest resources. This principle was also
captured in the National Program for Rural Development (PNDR), in 2008.

65.     Progress has also been made since the end of the political crisis in 2013. The process to
revise the National Policy for Regional Planning is under way. The draft law26 stresses the need to
adequately classify the zones between forests, pastures and agricultural lands. It also invites different
stakeholders, including the deconcentrated services of the administration, the private sector and the
civil society, to actively participate in the committees being established for the elaboration of
National, Regional and local Planning Schemes. Notably, the draft law mentions that agriculture
should have enough space for crop rotation. The lack of enough “official” space is one of the reasons
behind continuing slash and burn agricultural practices, which is in turn a cause of deforestation.




26
  Despite the promising potential for improving things, it is still a draft law that has not been adopted yet. So one should be cautious
and not take it for granted.


                                                                                                                                           35
66.     Outstanding issues with land tenure policy. A key aspect of the CFM policy is the transfer of
renewable natural resources management rights to VOIs within the limits of their ‘terroir’ and with
respect to lands that are in the domain of the State or the decentralized authorities. While at the time
of approval of GELOSE all idle lands were presumed property of the State, the land tenure reform of
2005, with the objective of promoting rural development, reversed the burden of the proof. With the
reform, municipalities could recognize land tenure rights to private individuals that occupied the land
under question. In addition, law 2008-014 established that lands within the private domain of the
State and the decentralized authorities was subject to registration. The combination of these two
well-intentioned reforms, together with the lack of registration of most forest land (Aubert, 2012),
implies that it is not clear if land that is not already registered in the State’s or municipality’s private
domain could make the object of CFM. As a consequence, the principle of land use right, and legal
sustainable exploitation of forest resources, established in GELOSE, is virtually void.

67.     Although sector policies recognize the role of CFM, practical implementation of the legal
principles is absent from key sectors. According to the legislators, development policies, particularly
in forestry and agriculture, should provide the basis for the promotion of economic alternatives that
are of key importance for motivating local communities to implement CFM. In practice, the regional
agriculture and livestock services are often unaware of the existence of CFM contracts (which are
rarely mapped or registered by the administration). For this reason, technical rural development
services do not actively support any particular development activities in CFM areas. This situation is
regrettable; especially in areas where slash and burn agriculture is predominant. In fact the role and
importance of fallow lands is often neglected27. However, the transition areas between forests and
agricultural land provide important social, ecological and economic services which are being quickly
degraded. On the contrary, farmers are almost exclusively offered alternatives for agricultural
intensification that involves “fixed” crops, along with a substantial reorganization of the traditional
production systems, including livestock. It is likely that the control of fertility of fallow lands is an
important step towards the search for solution to primary forests’ clearing, which would provide
more incentives to encourage farmers to sustainably manage or conserve their forests28.




27
   For foresters and conservationists, these lands are not considered forests because they do not have any ecological function
(biological bridge for example), or because they are located in the core of protected forest. For the agriculture service, their
contribution to the production is neglected because they are not agricultural land per se.
28
   Recognition of the importance of fallow lands can be found under article 6 of the draft law on regional planning, stating “The
agriculture sector must have enough space for crops rotation”. A possible interpretation of this formulation is the recognition of fallow
lands as locations to implement rotation of crops. However, those rotations have to be sustainable in order to deter the slash and burn
practitioners in forests.

68.    Capacity constraints are also key in the application of the decentralization policies. The
GELOSE law, along with the revision of the law on decentralization30 (October 2014), establishes that
Municipalities play a key role in planning for and monitoring the sustainable use of forest resources,
as well as in protecting the VOI. In fact, the Municipality is theoretically capable of redistributing
benefits from timber and non-timber forest products via the development of tax mechanisms. In
other words, along with the forest administration, the Municipality could contribute to ensure the
sustainability in the management of forest resources. However, due to the lack of financial, material
and personnel means, the implementation of the actions often rely on the development of
partnerships with different stakeholders (e.g. VOI, NGO, associations, donors, among others).

69.     Farmers living in transition areas between the forest and the cropland are supported
through alternative income generating activities which are often inefficient. As a compensation for
the lost use of a conservation forest, conservation programs typically promote alternative income-
generating activities (IGR) with the objective of modifying the habits of individuals that regularly rely
on natural forests for their livelihoods. However, alternative income generating activities have often
struggled to be adopted in the long run, particularly because these models are rarely sustainable
(Rabelohataona 2011; Rakotomalala 2011; Brimont et al., 2015): (i) the appropriate technical skills are
lacking, thus the practice generates much less benefits than it potentially could if proper techniques
were used; (ii) access to markets is often limited; (iii) access to credit is also limited.


     C. THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF CFM ARE NOT RESPECTED BY THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS

 70.     Several basic principles have been identified using international literature for CFM to work.
Those principles include i) the empowerment of local actors in terms of responsibility, ii) strengthening
of local organizations, and iii) a redefining of the role of the State: –

- Empowerment of local actors in terms of responsibility. Participatory CFM is pertinent only if it
contributes to empowering local users of woodlands (Ostrom 1990, Borrini-Feyerabend, 1996, Ingles
and al., 1999, Dubois and Lowore, 2000. Roe et al., 2009. Shackleton et al., 2010. Waglen et al., 2010).
This can be effective under three conditions: i) Respect of the relevant stakeholders’ will thus, of the
voluntary nature of the initiatives: actions from voluntary actors should be given preference. Actors
must be well informed of the benefits and limits of the proposed options. It is recommended not to
seek for collective organization and/or any form of obligation unless it is proven that they guarantee
the effectiveness of the actions carried out by volunteers. This situation should be rare. ii) The
absence of administrative affiliation of initiatives in participatory approach within a community is also


30
   According to the law, the municipalities are provided the role of setting operations and actions related to the protection of natural
resources, especially in terms of fire prevention and deforestation (art.24 of the 2014-018 law).

                                                                                                                                     39
important, for reasons of principle and for psychological reasons: indeed, to feel responsible,
members of a given community must feel free undertaking their actions (with the risks that this
entails) and not having to permanently report to an external entity on which they depend. iii)
Provision of free access to information and training on technical and organizational topics related to
the management of resources for individuals that are interested. Local actors cannot, from one day to
the other, become efficient managers; they must learn from experience, and this takes time and the
appropriate training. Unfortunately, many participatory and community forestry cases (IIED, 2009)
failed because they did not respect this fundamental principle of responsibility.

- Strengthening of local organizations. The importance of training and information of local actors
emphasizes the need for the public authority to leave the leadership of the forest management to
local actors. The public authority must be there to provide support, assist, and facilitate the
development of the chosen types of local management by: (i) providing information on the technical
options and organizational potential, which must be left open. This would provide information on
what has been done elsewhere, even if they ended in failure. Technical systems and organization
should never be presented as models, but as simple examples to follow or not, depending on local
conditions and the expectations of stakeholders. (ii) by providing awareness to stakeholders on the
legal conditions, and administrative formalities to satisfy for a good implementation of the activities,
and thus, to ensure that local forest management contributes to sustainable development. The role of
the public authority is to inform stakeholders on what can be done and what cannot, without
substituting themselves to the actors themselves. (iii) finally by facilitating local communities’ access
to funding (grants, various aid) when activities involve the need for additional resources from outside
of the local community. Some countries that opted for a policy of devolution of the responsibility for
management of natural resources to local actors, have implemented local investment incentives, but
the modalities for obtaining those are not always well understood/known by actors involved in
participatory and community management of the resources.

The bottom line is that local actors should be supported by the public authority, and not put under
administrative affiliation/supervision.

- The redefinition of the role of the State. This orientation towards support for local communities is
relatively new in many countries, where the forest services of the State remain primarily responsible
for monitoring the use of forested lands by the rural population. The participatory and community
management implies a redefinition of roles, tasks and responsibilities of the forest administration.
This can take various forms: (i) implementation of a specific service to support communities:
consisting of extension workers assigned to specific regions, the support specialist systematically
provides advice to communities. This type of organization is relevant only if the public authority
deliberately embarks on a decentralization policy that led to the creation of many forests under a

                                                                                                      40
participatory and/or community management regime. This type of organization is rare. (ii) Set-up of a
special mailbox for the support to communities facing management problems (techniques and
organization of harvesting of timber and non-timber products, choice of species to plant and
techniques for planting. The systematic provision of forest agents to help communities in their
respective sectors, as well as their systematic appointment in management boards remains for now
the most widespread form of support. In the absence of adequate training from the foresters in
question, it is however the worst case possible because it created long term dependence of
communities on the forest administration.


     D. STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS: DIVERGING OBJECTIVES AND AN INEFFICIENT POWER/RELEVANCE MIX

Because of the lack of synergy between the texts, especially the non-respect of the normalization of
the legal actions (production of laws, followed by the implementation decrees), there is no precise
procedures for the transfer and the monitoring of the implementation of CFM. Therefore,
stakeholders act, not on the basis of the texts and the procedures but rather based on their position
vis-à-vis the other stakeholders. Indeed, experiences in CFM between 1997 and 2004 suggest the lack
of a procedural basis since the beginning31. The transferred resources are slightly degraded because
of predators from outside the VOI (RESOLVE-PCP-IRD, 2005).

The three conditions to ensure the effectiveness of the implementation of CFM (i.e. i) the respect of
the relevant stakeholders will thus, of the voluntary nature of the initiatives; ii) the absence of
administrative affiliation of initiatives; and iii) the provision of free access to information and training)
depend, at the end of the day on the stakeholders’ strategies, which needed to be analyzed.

71.     A rapid stakeholder analysis has been conducted to identify key constraints and
opportunities for CFM policy development in Madagascar. Stakeholder analysis is the process of
identifying the agents or group of agents that are likely to affect or be affected by a proposed action
or policy. The analysis aims at sorting them according to: (i) the impact (influence) they may exercise
on the policy; and (ii) the impact the policy will have on them (importance or relevance). The analysis
is then used to assess how the interests of those stakeholders should be addressed in the case of a
change of policy, program, or other action, and what level of engagement is required for the policy
change to succeed (Brugha, R., and Varvasovszky, Z., 2000). A key tool in stakeholder analysis is the
influence/importance matrix, which graphically maps agents across these two dimensions. In this
report influence is taken as the power different agents or group of agents have to affect the impact of
CFM policy either through their participation in the planning process or in the implementation of the

policy. Importance, or relevance, measures the fit or alignment between the overall CFM policy
objectives and the individual stakeholders’ objectives.

72.       The following actors can be thought of being involved in CFM policy.

      •   The forest administration (representing the State) is in charge of policy development as
          mentioned in CFM contracts and it is involved in the monitoring and evaluation of CFM
          contracts. The State theoretically lies at the center of decision-making and plays a very
          important role in terms of regulation and supervision. However, low financial resources may
          imply a weak human and technical capacity that hampers the effective exercise of these
          functions.
      •   The Municipality is part of CFM contracts and could be the owner of the land being transferred
          to the local community. It is also in charge of preparing and implementing the local
          development plan with which CFM implementation should be consistent. It also plays an
          important role under CFM in protecting the VOI, in monitoring and evaluating the
          implementation of CFM at the local level, but also in redistributing benefits from the
          sustainable use of forest products. It also plays an important role in the management of
          conflicts. In practice, the role of the Municipality is often limited to the validation of files
          relating to the existence and the functioning of the VOI. In implementing its functions, it may
          be limited by the lack of financial, human and technical resources.
      •   The VOI is a legal entity formed by a group of members of the community that voluntarily
          constitute themselves as a civil society organization and are part of CFM contract. They are the
          entity to whom the forest management public service is delegated to by the owner of the
          resource. The VOI members, according to the law, should also be the primary beneficiaries of
          the economic benefits from the forest management transfer. They have very limited power to
          influence the process of CFM, especially at the design level. Generally, contributions are
          limited to simple consultations.
      •   The fokonolona may include individuals residing in a delimited territory (a village or a hamlet),
          possibly linked by similar ancestry, lineage or culture. Traditionally, fokonolona enjoy broad
          autonomy of management, including security and judicial aspects. Although the fokonolona is
          not directly involved in the decision making process regarding the resource, it may block
          decisions by various means because its interests are sometimes contradictory to those of VOI.
      •   The NGO or support organization is often primarily driven by forest conservation objectives
          and uses the CFM contract as a tool for engaging local communities in conservation activities
          in forest buffer zones. They are actively involved in the design of CFM contracts; they
          collaborate with the State in the design of projects and temporarily) supervise CFM
          implementation. But their methods of intervention are not always transparent. They have a
          relatively good capacity to capture financial resources. They can exert strong lobbying at the
          State and donors level by obtaining funding. Their time-bound involvement (based on project
          duration) does not allow them to invest locally into the social dynamics for the long term.


                                                                                                        42
   •   Law enforcement is applied by the army, the gendarmerie, and the police and include those
       parts of the administration in charge of making citizens respect the rule of law. They play an
       important role at supporting to the VOI during the implementation of CFM, especially with
       regard to non-VOI members. Despite the fact that many of the CFM dina are already
       homologated by the tribunal, because of the existence of a transaction instrument, by which
       an infraction can be dealt with administratively by the forest department, and because they
       are rarely mobilized for CFM issues, this group of stakeholders does not really influence the
       CFM planning and implementation process.
   •   Migrants are individuals who came to a certain territory mainly for economic reasons (e.g. for
       the exploitation of mines or forest conversion to agricultural lands) and that are not
       necessarily subject to local customary rules. They can be major players in terms of
       deforestation, degradation, or conservation. Although they have no influence on the CFM
       design and implementation process, depending on their main activities, they can foster, or
       become constraints for the VOI during the implementation of CFM, especially in the
       enforcement of the dina.
   •   Private sector operators can play an important role in the development of management plans
       for the sustainable extraction and commercialization of forest resources. Their financial
       support can influence the implementation of CFM. Taxes related to their activities can
       contribute to the effective redistribution of forest revenues by the Municipality or forest
       administration. They are not invited to participate in CFM decision-making process, but they
       can influence the VOI by providing access to markets and finance for the exploitation of forest
       resources.
   •   Customary authorities usually correspond to the ‘elders’ in the village, whom in pre-colonial
       times used to have authority over the village or fokonolona. Their involvement in CFM is far
       from being systematic and depends on the support organization and the willingness of the VOI
       to include them. But usually, they still play a very important role in the management of
       conflicts.
   •   Academia involves universities and research institutions. They can contribute to the training of
       actors and assist them in the decision-making process through better understanding of social
       or ecological dynamics, and disseminating knowledge, as well as best practices. But they are
       not systematically mobilized in the implementation process or impact assessment of CFM.
   •   Donors provide finance for development and conservation programs. Without their support,
       the implementation of CFM is hardly possible. Donors can be influential due to their policy
       dialogue role, which allows them to stimulate political decisions. They can establish
       conditionality that determine the obtaining of financing support. But it is often difficult for
       them to promote inter-sectoral approaches.


73.    Figure 6 maps stakeholders in the matrix along the influence/importance axes. The fact that
CFM has a dual objective of (i) promoting the conservation of renewable forest resources, while (ii)
boosting the economic conditions of participating local communities, is represented in the figure by
                                                                                                    43
the developmental/conservationist shades in the right-hand side of the matrix (i.e. along the ‘higher’
relevance/importance to stakeholder objectives dimension).

74.       Through the stakeholder analysis, we can identify 4 distinct groups of stakeholders:

      •   In the upper-right quadrant is the group of ‘core’ stakeholders, whose objectives are most
          aligned with the CFM policy objectives and that have power to influence the success of the
          policy. These include the forest administration, influential in planning and execution, the
          municipalities, influential in both (local) planning and implementation, and the NGOs who are
          often able to channel financial resources towards community development and conservation
          activities. In this group there is a potential tension between the conservation and
          development objectives of the policy, particularly when win-wins are difficult to obtain. It was
          noted above how the GELOSE principle of community development through (sustainable)
          natural resource extraction has been poorly implemented in practice and how the
          conservation motive might have played a role in such state of affairs.
      •   In the lower-right quadrant is the group of stakeholders that policy implementation should
          aim at ‘protecting’ as they are among the primary beneficiaries of the policy. This is a group of
          highly important stakeholders, yet not influential, including VOI and migrants. For CFM to be
          effective, this group will require special attention. However, their interests may be divergent:
          VOIs have a stake in terms of both income generation and conservation (the base for future
          income generation). VOI also seek to regulate access to the transferred forests, so they have a
          relative ability to influence the impact of the policy. Migrants who do not have land and need
          to settle somewhere for their subsistence, may enter in direct conflict with VOI and the
          conservation goals. Sitting at the frontier between the upper and the lower quadrant are the
          fokonolona. These may occasionally have the power to influence the outcome of the policy,
          particularly when the collective forces can drive change at the individual level.
      •   In the upper-left quadrant is the group of stakeholders to be actively engaged in CFM policy.
          Their objectives are less aligned with the policy but they may be highly influential stakeholders
          due to their ability to finance conservation/development efforts or promoting the rule of law.
          Although these two groups of stakeholders are not explicitly mentioned in any CFM-related
          texts, in practice, they are unavoidable actors. The two stakeholders in this group require
          careful monitoring because they may become source of opportunities. They may also be
          source of risks if instead of supporting the process, they distort it to advance different agendas
          or priorities. This has been the case for example in respect to the 2005 land tenure reform,
          highly supported by donors (for agricultural development) but that effectively resulted in
          creating a legal void for unregistered forest land transferred to local communities.
      •   In the lower-left quadrant are the ‘resources’ stakeholder. They have low relevance and low
          power to influence. Although they can contribute to the effectiveness of CFM by bringing new
          knowledge and financial resources to the table, or make sure the cultural rights are
          safeguarded in the process in the interest of long-term sustainability.



                                                                                                         44
75.      The stakeholder analysis reveals a potentially inefficient power/relevance mix. In particular,
it is important to note that the three entities part of a typical CFM contract are not in the same group.
The VOIs are mapped to the lower-right quadrant (high relevance, low influence), whereas the forest
administration and the municipalities are mapped to the upper-right quadrant (high relevance, high
influence). In addition, it is possible that the objectives of the more conservation oriented forest
administration are not completely aligned with those of the Municipality, which represents not just
communities living near the forest but all communities in the municipal territory (including those in
agricultural areas and in urban areas). This delicate balance may be also affected by ‘external’ (with
respect to the contract) agents such as NGOs, donors and the law enforcement authorities.

                                    Figure 6: CFM stakeholder analysis matrix




The current position of the VOI does not suggest a trend toward an efficient implementation of CFM
because despite their high relevance, they have limited influence over the process, including the
decision-making. For CFM to work, there would be a need for :

      -   Increasing the influence of the three main stakeholders of CFM, especially that of the VOI.

      -   Decreasing the influence of the i) migrants, by reinforcing the simultaneous implementation of
          forest patrolling and the efficiency of the dina (via the improvement of existing customary

                                                                                                        45
       social conventions - already accepted by both the local population and the migrants - and not
       the creation of new ones) ; and ii) the NGOs by limiting their actions, which mandate should
       be well defined in the CFM process (because currently, NGOs are the trigger of the process,
       they provide financial and technical support, they are the bridge between the administration
       and the VOI, and/or between the VOI and the market, and they decide when to end the
       support to a given CFM.

However, these two points cannot be achieved without the formulation of a clear and precise
procedure about CFM to follow for its implementation and monitoring.


   E. WEAK LAW ENFORCEMENT: A CHALLENGE AT LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS

76.    Enforcing community-based forest contracts has proved challenging at two distinct levels. At
the local level, community-led enforcement may be ineffective when dealing with agents that are
external to the VOI or to the community altogether. At the regional and national levels, the lack of
information, the problems of weak rule of law, corruption in the administration and the judiciary
bodies, and poorly equipped law enforcement agencies are more common. These issues are
described below.

77.       Traditionally, behavior and resources use in rural communities have been governed by sets
of local rules or social norms called dina. These rules are meant to be the result of experiences and
the history of a community. They are developed and enforced by the communities themselves.
Rakotoson and Tanner (2006) estimated that more than 75 percent of the Malagasy population that
still lives in rural areas, is governed by the dina. Failure to comply with these obligations is punishable
by vonodina (penalties).

78.     The GELOSE foresees the dina as a key tool for its implementation. Under the law, the dina is
used to govern VOI members and to regulate their rights to use natural resources. Nevertheless, it is
important to denote that the expression “dina” refers to various types of local regulations. The
adoption of dina-like instruments by the law has meant that dina can be categorized in three basic
types, depending on whether they are used to regulate the use of State (or local Government) owned
resources vs. community owned resources; and depending on whether dina are developed by the
community itself. Type 1 dina are meant to regulate access to community-owned resources and are
developed by the community. They are typically oral. Because they apply to traditional land owned by
the community. They fall under custom and aren’t concerned by the control of legality. The key
rationale for the dina is to regulate the use and allocation of land. Forest is typically considered a land
reserve, eventually convertible to agricultural land through slash and burn. This is the most traditional



                                                                                                        46
type of dina and is still found in the most remote rural communities. Type 232 dina is usually written
and it is applied to a resource whose right of use has been transferred by an official owner (e.g. the
State) to the local community. It will take effect only after approval by the local mayor and may be
subject to a judicial review at the request of the State representative. This type of dina is meant to be
used to manage a resource within certain limits of use. Its preparation is the prerogative of the
community. Finally, type 3 dina are created and driven by local authorities with the participation of
the fokonolona and require a legal review. They must be homologated by the Ministry of Justice to
ensure compatibility to the State laws and the Constitution. This is the least genuine typology of dina.

79.     Dina governing CFM falls into the second category. In this context, the dina have become
local normative provisions which set out obligations “to do” or “not to do” to members of the
community who recognize them (art. 15 of the 2000-027 decree). They “may not include measures
which may harm the general public interest and public decrees. Its requirements must comply with
the constitutional, legislative and regulatory provisions in place, as well as the recognized and
uncontested uses in the municipality of affiliation” (art. 50 of the 96-025 law). Failure to comply with
dina is punishable by vonodina (penalties).

80.      It is therefore the responsibility of the VOI to approve a given dina according to the
customary rules governing the Community (art. 49 of the GELOSE), and it is responsibility of the
Mayor to validate the community-agreed dina to make it enforceable. If the Municipality considers
that a given dina was stained with illegality, it can file a complaint to the Administrative Court (art. 51
of the GELOSE). In order to better anchor the dina in the national legal framework and to empower
the actors involved in its application (communities, elected traditional authorities), it is common to
proceed to the homologation of the dina by the Court. This strengthens the legality of the dina, and
facilitates appeals to justice in case of necessity. However, an appeal to the court should only incur
upon exhaustion of all the procedures established by the dina (article 52 of the GELOSE).

81.         In practice, the dina effectiveness has faced the following challenges:

       -    Uncertain application. Even in the event of homologation of the dina by the Court, the judge
            will not necessarily sanction a refusal to comply by members of the community. Relations of
            influence still play an essential role, often at the detriment of respect for the dina.

       -    Lack of legitimacy. As indicated in the GCF decree, NGOs supporting the implementation of
            CFM usually offer standard dina. This type of dina does not necessarily reflect the real, natural
            needs from the communities (ESSA 2008; Bérard 2011). Moreover, externally driven dina


32
     The art. 49 to 53 of the GELOSE law refer to the dina of VOI and the art. 15, 18 and 19 of the 2000-027 decree.


                                                                                                                       47
       often lack the flexibility of the traditional rules, thus are incapable to take into account the
       economic status of the rule breaker.

   -   Weak ownership by the community. One strength of dina lies in its legitimacy within the
       community. It is because they emerge through local institutions identified as the seat of
       community power that they are respected and enforced. In the case if CFM, the dina is often
       times developed by the VOI, a sub-group of the fokonolona, legally recognized by the State as
       an entity that is part of the CFM contract. But the VOI can represent as little as 10 percent of
       the fokonolona in some cases, which considerably limits its effectiveness.

   -   Limited range of application. The dina cannot be enforced to control and/or punish people
       outside the community. So it is not a full substitute to the forest control carried out by law
       enforcement entities. The latter are in fact the only ones habilitated to verbalize infractions.

   -   Tension with social cohesion. Fihavanana, the notion of solidarity and cohesion between
       members of a community, is an important value. It is a powerful force in communities and
       creates unity. However, fihavanana also creates problems in the application of dina. Even
       though each member is supposed to be responsible for the enforcement process, ‘betrayal’ of
       a close friend or a relative and having him/her pay fines, even when they infringe the
       convened rules, is seen as a threat to this rule of social cohesion. The village leaders are
       hesitant in this context to apply the vonodina fearing that it will cause further disputes and
       hurt relations within members of the community.

   -   Capture. The strength of a dina can also be its weakness. When a group dominates other
       groups the application of dina can become a tool of power. In many cases, the village
       authorities have total control over the VOI. Some authorities manage to exert pressure on the
       management committees of the VOI so that the implementation of dina becomes selective.
       Many people therefore remain in impunity, discouraging the population and causing feelings
       of anger and frustration.

82.     Law enforcement by Government authorities becomes essential when the dina fails,
particularly in terms of applicability. This is especially the case when a territory with a CFM contract
is targeted by mass migration from other regions. According to Karsenty (2011), mass migration into
forests occurs when lucrative activities (such as precious stone mining) are identified. This happens at
times with the complicity of local authorities. Under such circumstances, the local structures are
powerless and the support of armed forces becomes the only possible measure to deal with the
situation. Owing to lack of resources, Government response is often delayed or absent. Non-mastery
of the illegal exploitation by migrants can have substantial consequences for community
management, because it highlights the weakness and lack of effectiveness of the dina as a regulatory

                                                                                                     48
tool. It also causes a loss of confidence towards the leaders and members of the management
structure of the VOI, because they are powerless and are unable to resolve the case. In such cases,
the VOI may eventually get dissolved and free access to forest resources becomes widespread
(Ramamonjisoa et al. 2012).

83.     Even when migration is not an issue, the need for social cohesion can be a constraint to
Government law enforcement. Even if the failure to condemn exposes the community to sanctions
for transgressions (articles 48 and 49 of decree 60-128), fihavanana prevents the members of the
community to condemn their neighbors. This mechanism has been abused by illegal loggers during
the political transition period, and in the aftermath of natural disasters33.

84.     Lack of resources can be a constraint to the application of law enforcement by the
Government. At the municipality and fokontany level34, officials, thanks to an established dina,
subsequent to the 2001-004 law on public security, can proceed to the enforcement of certain
punishments against law infractions within their territory. A vonodina can be applied as a penalty for
the offender35 but in that case, the penalties are not equivalent as those pronounced by the courts.
The enforcement of forest laws principally is incumbent upon the forest administration which plays a
major role in pursuing the offenders. For this to happen, however, the infraction must have been
verbalized by agents of the forest administration, the only ones allowed to proceed to identify and
verbalize infractions and the ones in charge of bringing the case to justice. However, forest law
enforcement is often understaffed or underequipped, and areas to monitor are often very vast.
Moreover, most infractions at the local level are rarely punished because they are never reported to
authorities.

85.    Confidentiality of transactions is also an important aspect of weak forest law enforcement.
Even if a forest transgression is reported, there is always a risk that the normal sanction is not
enforced. Indeed, decree 60-128 allows for a ‘transaction’ to be concluded between the offender and
the forest administration. This transaction may occur either before or after judgment (art. 41). The
transaction consists in the offender admitting the infraction and paying a certain amount of money to
the forest administration in exchange of the abandonment of the prosecution (art. 20). However,
these transactions which are the preferred solution for dispute resolution, can easily be a source of

33
   When a natural disaster occurs, and if the impact on rural livelihoods is particularly affected, logging becomes socially accepted as a
mean to compensate for lost income.
34
   Fokontany refers to the smallest administrative unit in Madagascar.
35
   The penalties, however cannot replace the monetary reparations to be considered for the benefit of the VOI (if the offender is a
member of a VOI), or, if applicable, the criminal prosecution by the administration. Moreover, despite certain practices, the vonodina
cannot request any "fine greater than stipulated in articles 472/6, 472/7 and 472/8 of the penal code on the fokonolona conventions"
from the offender.


                                                                                                                                       49
corruption at the local level and are rarely reported at central level or at the level of the public
treasury. A first step recommended would be to require the results of the transactions to be
systematically public; this is expected to be more efficient than prohibiting transactions, which would
easily just make transactions illegal without actually reducing the number of infractions.

In specific cases, when forest service catch infractions, the preferred method to promoting rule of law
is for the forest service to educate the people caught in violation of forest legislation and avoid the
application of sanction unless the offenders repeat the infraction. However, the lack of effective
punishment of crimes may lead to the fast and uncontrolled degradation of forest resources. This
discourages members of the fokonolona at large in participating in CFM.




                                                                                                    50
   IV. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

86.    Poverty and environmental degradation can interact in complex ways and in ways that are
often detrimental to both human livelihoods and the environment. With communities relying on
natural resources, the journey from poverty to prosperity is likely to be a gradual one, especially
among households with low levels of education and few employment opportunities. Forests may
provide a gradual stepping stone that help to move the chronically poor to the moderately poor, and
the sometimes poor to the non-poor. CFM is one potential tool for this to happen; indeed, it is a mean
to build local people’s capacity and thus promoting civil society’s involvement in establishing
democracy and the rule of law.

87.     A number of successful examples of CBNRM around the world point at the fact that
conservation through communities’ efforts is possible. Measham and Lumbasi (2013) stress the
importance for the local community to initiate the process. In Australia, a group of concerned
Gippsland residents, mostly farmers plus some retired forestry professionals living in rural towns,
came together under the title of the Gippsland Plains Tree Health Group in 2004, due to long-held
concerns about remnant vegetation management and revegetation. The initiative was instigated by
local residents, seeking ways to better understand dieback, how to improve ecosystem health and in
addition, how to engage neighboring landholders in addressing the issues. In Kenya, the Ishaqbini
Hirola Community Conservancy was formed for the protection and management of the hirola
antelope (an umbrella species) in the northeastern part of the country. The local community in the
Ijara district in North Eastern Kenya established the conservancy in 2007 with expert advice from the
Kenya Wildlife Service and the Northern Rangeland Trust. It has been the local Somali clans’ desire
that their natural heritage (hirola) is protected. Today, the local communities have set up their own
rules vital for survival of hirola in the conservancy. Grazing rules have been formulated and are
adhered to by all. Livestock is not allowed within the conservancy and there is prescribed punishment
for any offenders.

88.     Encouraging examples of community conservation in Madagascar point at the fact that
success is indeed possible. Anja Miray Association was established in 1999 in response to the
degradation and clearing of local forests, the sedimentation of water resources, and the loss of
wildlife such as ring-tailed lemurs, chameleons and tropical birds. The Association operates a 30-
hectare community forest reserve in the Haute Matsiatra region of Madagascar. The community has
established an ecotourism initiative which funds community works projects – schools, health clinics
and environmental education – and ongoing conservation activities. Ecotourism has also provided a
revenue stream for alternative livelihood projects such as fish farming and tree nurseries. The
Association has provided a leading model of community-based forest management in the country. In
2012, Anja Miray Association was awarded the Equator Prize.
                                                                                                   51
89.    The analysis of the previous pages has allowed to identify some key constraints in the
application of CFM and CBNRM in Madagascar. These help explain why the Anja Miray Association
example is not the norm, and what could be done to obtain progress at the national level. In this
section, we capitalize on the review and sketch a number of public policy recommendations in the
short, medium and long-term. These proposals should constitute an essential public policy
complement to the widespread efforts already deployed by individuals, communities and associations
throughout the country.


     A. SHORT-TERM RECOMMENDATIONS (WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR)

90.      Seek consistency between the GELOSE, the forest law and the land tenure law. It is necessary
that legal texts on forest land tenure are developed in accordance to the provisions of the forest and
environment policies. This will ensure streamlining of the sustainable use of domanial forests, and to
facilitate the implementation of both the new protected area code (COAP) 2015 and the environment
charter, revised the same year. This also applies to forestland reserves allocated for private
reforestation purposes or for “local community use”, as suggested in the new land policy (final version
in progress, 2015). In addition, art.2 of the GELOSE law could be revised to allow local communities to
have land tenure securing of the resources they are managing regardless of the land status, as long as
the purpose is related to sustainable forest management and development; the idea of using Local
Land Rights Mapping (PLOF) also for protected areas management could serve this purpose.
Furthermore, to strengthen the consistency even more, Municipal land offices staff should be
provided training in natural resources management / CFM matters, and the delimitation of
community forests should also involve the Local Land Rights Recognition Committees.

91.    This amendment to the GELOSE law would have two benefits. On the one hand, it would
imply that community managed land would be automatically under the forest land status36, and on
the other hand, it would make CFM a tool for securing stakeholders vis-à-vis their respective rights on
the resources on the basis of an explicitly shared and formalized management objective
(reforestation, rights to use and to harvest, ...). Thus, specific land tenure under CFM should be based
on a revision of the relative land tenure security decree (n° 98-610), harmonized with the spirit of the
ongoing land reform, and proposing options for securing land (Montagne et al., 2009). In all cases,
improved cooperation between the forest administration and the other services of the State (e.g. land
and territory development) and the decentralized authorities (Municipalities, or even Regions) is



36
 In fact, the specific land status are not limited to forests; the law is expected to acknowledge the importance of sustainable
management of renewable natural resources; including protected areas, wetlands, pasturelands, lake, etc.


                                                                                                                                  52
necessary, as well as the production of texts, mentioned in article 38 of the 2005-19 law on Land
status in Madagascar.

92.     Fill the gaps in the CFM legal and regulatory framework and correct the inconsistencies
between the different forest, commercial and environment related texts. We have seen in the
previous sections that regulatory gaps in the implementation of the GELOSE have led to multiple
interpretations and applications of the principles of the law, and later on, to the development of texts
that are inconsistent with GELOSE, which contributed to the ineffectiveness of CFM. One of the top
priorities related to filling the gaps in the implementation texts of the GELOSE law is about the 4th
section of the law, about the economic benefits that the VOI would obtain from ensuring a good
stewardship in managing the resources in a sustainable way under CFM. Therefore, it is a key
necessity, in the short to mid-term, to take action and to fill those gaps and inconsistencies in
application of article 54 of the GELOSE law.

93.     Develop national sources of finance to support CFM policy implementation on the ground.
Today, CFM arrangements either lack sufficient finance to work (often resulting in forest degradation)
or receive financing from donors or NGOs, and are then financially unsustainable. To overcome this
issue, the use of the Local Development Fund (FDL) could be better linked to environment/forest
dimensions. The obligation for Municipalities to develop municipal management plans is in this sense
an opportunity to link sustainable forest management to Municipal finance. Obviously, such a
commitment of the municipality will not be realistic unless there is involvement of the municipal
advisory committee in the whole CFM process. In addition, the commercial use of natural resources in
CFM should be well monitored and used to the profit of VOIs and local communities. This way, CFM
and its beneficiaries could be strengthened. Furthermore, as the long term success of conservation
interventions depends not only on communities along forest edges but also on different stakeholders
at larger scales (Kremen 2000, Chan et al. 2007), policy should be developed to make sure that
benefits reach all key stakeholders.


   B. MID-TEM RECOMMENDATIONS (BETWEEN 1 AND 5 YEARS)

94.    Strengthen the capacity of the State, both central Government and regional services, to plan
and implement CFM policy. The stakeholder analysis we conducted highlighted both the forest
administration’s central role in CFM policy and its lack of financial resources. It is necessary to boost
the forest administration’s capacity to fully play its role, including making all stakeholders
(Municipality, VOIs, private sector, NGOs) accountable for their share of the implementation work.
Only the forest administration, among the key CFM stakeholders, can ensure an effective CFM policy
implementation. Priorities should be given to: (i) the development of a training program that will
involve the forest administration personnel; (ii) the collection of data for building a complete, national

                                                                                                       53
database of all national forest resources; (iii) the development of a timely, robust and negotiated
strategy to provision funds to the national forest fund (FFN) at the national and regional level, thus
enabling access to sustainable financial resources for the forest administration; (iv) the update of the
national forest zoning, allocating categories of forests according to their ecological vocations; (v) the
development of a national forest monitoring system that is crucial for any forest-related initiative that
the country undertake in the future, including REDD, or any PSE mechanism; (vi) the capitalization on
the lessons learned from pilot projects implementation involving different sectors of activity, and the
integration of such lessons in the development and implementation of appropriate legal and
regulatory provisions.

95.    Investing on building the capacity of the VOI through trainings and supporting the VOI
network. One of the encouraging results from CFM implementation in Madagascar is the slow but
tangible empowerment of the VOI, mainly through the training opportunities in various topics that
are provided to them either by NGOs or by the decentralized technical services. One particular
attention should be put on the networking of the VOI because peer-to-peer learning has a higher
potential to be effective than expert-farmer type of learning.

96.     Address the financial constraints that VOIs, Municipalities and the State face through
performance-based payment schemes. Regulations could develop the use of payment for ecosystem
services (PES) schemes with a clear emphasis on the benefit sharing mechanisms that should
characterize such schemes. PES must respect the principle of economic additionality, but also that of
the legal additionality: PES cannot lead "to pay for law enforcement", nor to question the rights of
third parties involved in the land or the resources and exclude them from payment (Brimont et al.
2015; Karsenty et al., 2015). Finally, the benefit sharing linked to PES cannot be calculated on the sole
basis of opportunity costs, particularly low in remote forested areas in a developing country like
Madagascar. On the contrary, it should be based on the investment necessary to initiate households
behavior change (Rakotondrabe et al., 2014). In all cases, the understanding of local dynamics
(ecological, sociological, economic and institutional) should be well understood before bringing
innovations for likely better targeted and more perennial development strategies (Rakotondrabe et
al., 2014). Indeed, CFM is a system of governance in which a coordinated set of tools must be put in
relation to the objectives of conservation and sustainable management of forests (natural and
planted), while improving the living conditions of populations. None of these tools alone is a solution.

97.    An example of PES is the REDD+ mechanism. The country is currently developing its national
REDD+ strategy. In this context, the country will define the national principles for benefit-sharing of
REDD+ revenues. REDD+ can have the potential to provide direct payments to the VOI or the whole
community and could, in the mid- to long-term, compensate for the lack of financial means that the
VOI, the Municipality, and the forest administration are currently facing. In fact, Madagascar counts a

                                                                                                      54
number of projects, such as that of the Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ) and Makira, which have
already delivered results and sold carbon credits to the market. This suggests that the forest carbon
mechanism can work although the amounts involved are for the moment still quite modest. More
importantly, both the CAZ and Makira projects have put in place community benefit sharing schemes.

98.     Awareness of the local rural population and the municipalities about the responsibilities
related to CFM. The two above paragraphs assume that the municipalities and the local population
are aware of all information surrounding CFM (the constraints and the eventual benefits, etc.), which
is not necessarily the case; back in the late 1990’s, under the Environmental Program II, a national
awareness campaign about GELOSE was planned but was never undertaken because the priority
under EPII was about establishing the pillars of the environmental institutions in the country, as well
as strengthening them. However, the context has changed, those institutions are well functioning
(although are not self-sustaining yet); and perhaps, now would be the time to undertake the national
awareness campaign to have both the rural population and the municipal authorities to make
informed decisions about CFM; which would be the key to deliver results under performance-based
payment mechanisms. Indeed, full awareness about a given subject would provide more initiative to
rural population to enter, in a completely independent way, a social dynamic and suggest actions that
would help them get out of poverty, including (but not limited to) entering performance-based
payment mechanisms.


   C. LONG-TERM RECOMMENDATIONS (BEYOND 5 YEARS)

99.     Move towards a decentralized, self-sustained forest monitoring, involving the coordination
of actions of different stakeholders. It would not be possible to extend the implementation of the
GELOSE law to CFM with harvesting and economic sustainable valuation of the resources without a
strong consistency between the law and the texts on forest monitoring. To date, few support
organizations (development or conservation) seem to give high importance to the necessity for a
continuous monitoring of CFM contracts (GELOSE or GCF). However, some significant examples, with
encouraging results exist in Boeny and Didy: these examples are the proof of the feasibility and
possibility of a sustainable, functioning decentralized, self-sustained forest monitoring system,
involving the coordination, at different levels of the different stakeholders that signed the CFM
contract:

   -   The forest administration maintains its regalian power and focuses its interventions at its
       “cantonnements” jurisdictions, as well as its regional branches.




                                                                                                    55
   -   The local community, via its VOI and their own forest patrollers (polisin’ala), ensuring the
       continuous monitoring of the resources that fall within its territory, and more specifically
       within the boundary, subject of the management transfer.

   -   At the municipality or inter-municipality level, a municipal (or inter-municipal) forest
       monitoring verifies and ensures that no illegal exploitation is taking place beyond the CFM
       transferred areas.



However, efficient monitoring has costs, which should be covered: in part by i) the income that VOI
earn from the economic activities that they undertake from the forest, under CFM; ii) the taxes
collected by the municipality for forest products harvesting taking place within its jurisdiction; iii) the
taxes collected by the forest administration, based on the categories of the harvested resources (with
important update to consider); and iv) either the public treasury or the national forestry fund (FFN).

The experience from Didy and Boeny showed that there is strong consistency between the
implementation of section 4 of the GELOSE law, the increasing number of CFM contracts with
economic valuation of the resources, and decentralized forest monitoring.

But realistically, upscaling these experiences at the national scale still requires several prerequisites,
including i) at the VOI level : the VOI has to already have enough source of income (from economic
incentives) for them to be able to cover the costs of the forest patrolling in a sustainable way ; ii) at
the municipal level : the taxes (ristournes) from the harvesting of forest resources are actually
collected and are allocated to activities such as control of forest products (i.e. The municipality has to
already have included in its development plan the management of forest resources); and lastly, iii) at
the national level, the national forestry funds (FFN) has to already be sufficient enough to allow the
forest administration to undertake their role of forest patrolling, in coordination with other
stakeholders.

100. Strengthen the capacity for law enforcement. A key element of functioning forest
management contracts, whether with private operators or with local communities, is the capacity to
clearly apply the law and respond to non-compliance. Building capacity of the judiciary, the
administration and civil society is necessary to improve effectiveness of the legislative framework. In
addition, environmental justice and information need to be taken to the people. Procedures need to
be less complex and in line with the capacity of local communities to become meaningfully involved in
environmental action and mechanisms such as traveling to courts and/or reopening of local courts.
Another key element for this is the development of information tools capable of detecting pressure
on natural resources at an early stage so as to be able to address the causes early on.


                                                                                                        56
101. Promote traceability of forest products. We discussed the difficulty for the VOI to enforce
rules towards members of their own community, migrants or the fokonolona; this is a major issue for
CFM in Madagascar. Suspending or prohibiting the commercial use of forest products would not solve
the issue; on the contrary, the suspension and prohibition measures tend to demotivate the VOI from
investing their effort into sustainable management of the resources. The possibility to commercially
but sustainably use forest resources cannot be effective without adequate investment in forest
products (timber and non-timber) traceability. Without this investment, which exists under the law
but is rarely implemented, VOIs will see pressures increase on the forests they manage (e.g. out of
jealousy, lack of control capacity, and lack of support sanctions enforcement). In some cases, private
sector operators may take advantage of the situation by using the name of the VOI, formally allowed
to commercially use forest products, at the law enforcement checkpoints to justify the origin of
products that are in fact obtained through illegal logging in surrounding forests.

102. Promote systematic collection of data related to the implementation of CFM contracts and
their restitution to CFM stakeholders. Achieving this objective implies that all stakeholders involved
in CFM contracts are responsible, including donors. In fact, a system for monitoring the impacts of
CFM has already been developed under the COGESFOR project; the tool was transferred to the Forest
Administration, which planned to upscale it nationwide with the help of conservation and
development stakeholders (Aubert et al. 2011, Rahajason et al. 2014). This type of information
system still has a lot of room for improvement; however, once optimized, the system will allow
different research and training organizations to have comprehensive and reliable data that will help
better assess the impacts of CFM in Madagascar and help stakeholders in better implementing
adaptive management of renewable natural resources in the future, both in terms of reducing
deforestation, and in improving people’s well-being.




                                                                                                   57
   V. CONCLUSION

103. This report is not questioning the fact that CFM can be an effective tool to achieve
conservation and to improve local communities’ livelihood; nor does it minimize the achievements
recorded with CFM implementation in the country; rather it focused on identifying the main pitfalls
that should be avoided when designing/implementing CFM; in order to improve its effectiveness in
the future. From experiences across the world, CFM proved to be an effective tool for achieving both
conservation and improvement of people’s livelihoods. In Madagascar, the substantial number of
CFM contracts in itself suggests the interest of local people to participate actively in the conservation
of renewable natural resources. Also, local populations’ sense of ownership of the resources
management process, and their capacities improved in many respects (organizational skills,
democratic decision-making process, planning, collaboration with various stakeholders, etc.). Along
with those lines, the analysis suggests that CFM may have improved households well-being for those
who live closer to the forests, pointing at the heterogeneity of CFM impacts. However, overall, in over
15 years of implementation, CFM may not have achieved palpable results, neither for conservation
nor for local communities’ well-being. The legal and stakeholder analyses allowed to shed light on
some of the main underlying drivers of the ineffectiveness of CFM. Those drivers include the lack of
texts for implementing the GELOSE law, the internal inconsistencies between texts within the forest
and environmental sector, the lack of synergy between the main public sector policies and CFM
policy, the divergent agendas of the different stakeholders involved in CFM, and the lack of law
enforcement both at the local community level, and at the higher level.

104. Some key recommendations are suggested. For the short-term, these include the need to
strengthen the consistency between forest and land tenure laws, and within the body of forest and
environmental texts, and the identification of national financing channels to support CFM policy
implementation. In the medium-term, it is suggested to strengthen the capacity of the forest
administration to plan and implement CFM policy, given its pivotal role, to promote performance-
based payment at the national and international level. In the long-term, it is necessary to strengthen
the capacity of the judiciary, the armed forces and the forest administration in law enforcement, and
to promote the development of traceability chains for forest products.

105. This work is not exhaustive, due to time and resources limitations, and a number of actions
could be taken to conduct further analysis in this important area:

   -   Consistent data on CFM institutions, design and practices, should be collected across CFM
       projects and shared between stakeholders, so that more in-depth impact evaluations could be
       carried out.


                                                                                                      58
     -    Socio-economic surveys specifically designed for welfare impact evaluation should be
          undertaken to produce results that are more sensitive to local circumstances and to permit
          more detailed analyses of impacts on different groups of individuals within CFM communities
          (VOI members vs. non-VOI members, elites vs. non-elites, households nearer main village
          center vs. households far from main village center, male headed households vs. female
          headed households…).

     -    The relative merits of moving from a VOI-based approach to a village or fokonolona-based
          approach to CFM should be carefully analyzed. VOIs are facing difficulties related to conflict of
          interests, corruption or lack of legitimacy. There is some support in the public opinion for
          transferring the management structure from the VOI to an entity responding more to a
          territorial logic than to an associative process37. In the first case, the residence of the
          individuals on a community territory would be decisive, establishing a de facto membership. In
          the second case, the will and the interest of individuals would be decisive for the community.
          Before supporting a substantive change in legislation, more in-depth research should be
          conducted.

     -    A more in-depth stakeholder analysis could be undertaken, using survey techniques, to better
          understand the motivations, the dynamics, and the power relations between the different
          stakeholders in different contexts.

     -    The present work only focused on two of the pillars of the policy: the legal and institutional
          framework. More in-depth analyses could be conducted in the future to explore other
          dimensions of the non-effectiveness of the implementation of the policy (e.g. lack of access to
          market, etc.).




37
    The association Tafomihaavo supports a legal move to restore the moral personality of the fokonolona, which would allow all
individuals, resident in a given locality (or affiliated individuals non-resident, depending on the definition), to be automatically involved
in the CFM contract if the fokonolona, empowered, signs the contract.

                                                                                                                                          59

APPENDIX A. VOI LEGAL FRAMEWORK


A1. GENERAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK GOVERNING VOI
VOI "consists of any group of voluntary individuals, united by the same interests and complying with convened rules for
the group. It may include the inhabitants of a hamlet, a village or group of villages.” (art. 3 of the 96-025 law).

According to the 2000-027 decree, the VOI is an association of people gathered around a common purpose: "the local
management of renewable natural resources according to the 96-025 law" and must be attached to a “municipality38” (art.
1 and 4).

Any person residing within the limits of the boundaries of the VOI territory may submit an application to the General
Assembly become a member. By this act, the person commits to comply with the rules of operations and run the activities
and objectives of the VOI (art. 5). However, except for financial management, the 2000-027 decree does not mention
anything in particular on decision-making process within the VOI, it is internal to the organization. However, in practice,
relations of influence within local communities make it often illusory to respect a transparent, democratic process. On the
one hand, it is not sure that the customary structures, forming the basis of social cohesion, are based on processes of non-
exclusion. Finally, even in the event of mass inclusion of local populations, notables often find ways to take control of the
management structures in the event of substantial interests; particularly in the process of valorization of forest resources.
Also, in many cases, the management structures are not representative of the fokonolona or lack legitimacy. The result is a
weakening of the VOI who are isolated or not considered by the rest of the population.

Note, however, that, in the event of conflict within the VOI, the law provides pacification, or arbitration, by the President
of the Municipal Council before any (eventual) appeal to the court. Similarly, in the event of a conflict with the
administration, hierarchical recourse must prevail before the court remedy. A provision allows even explicitly that the
parties can submit their dispute to arbitration for an instance composed of two arbitrators appointed respectively by the
parties and a third party-appointed arbitrator by mutual agreement by the two arbitrators or agreement by the president
of the Court in the jurisdiction of which are contentious resources." (art. 46 of the 96-025).

According to articles 7 and 8 of decree 2000-027, the structure of grassroots communities includes:

       - A legislative body: the General Assembly

       - An executive body the Management committee

       - Operational and financial management rules (Statute, Operations procedures and rules, dina)

The management committee members are not remunerated: due to the lack of means39, monetary compensations are not
necessarily considered in proportion to the work provided. But it is also the case for foresters, those of the municipality or
of the fokontany40.



38
  The VOI legal paperwork is submitted to the mayor. The municipality understands the objectives of the association, its
location, its functions. In annex are also the list of the members and that of the elected representatives. The internal rules
and/or dina must be developed and approved by the VOI according to a template appended to the 2000-027 decree.
39
     VOI income mainly come from :
       -    Membership fees,
       -    Financial and/or material support from supporting organizations,
                                                                                                                           66
To benefit from CFM, the VOI’s existence must also be approved by the competent authority, namely, the authority
usually in charge considered resources, i.e. the Regional forest administration (art. 3 of Act 96-025) (see below for the
legal details of the issuance of this approval). Once approved, the VOI can theoretically ask the payment of damages and
interest to the administration in the event of unilateral termination of the contract that prevents it to tap benefits from
the assets it is managing.

The GELOSE law imposes therefore two essential preconditions on VOI for the recognition: (1) its declaration to the
affiliated municipality and (2) its approval by the forest administration. These two administrative actions are inseparable
elements of a reciprocal commitment of the three parties to the contract. However, in practice, these approaches, not
institutionalized, are far from being systematic.

A2. THE LEGAL PROCEDURE FOR THE ACCREDITATION OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES
According to the GELOSE law, "The agreement is the official document giving the beneficiary basic local community [VOI],
for the period specified in the act, the autonomous management of the mentioned resources, subject to compliance with
stipulations and clauses of the management contract and the specifications previously negotiated and concluded between
the parties.»(Art. 4). We note that the use of environmental mediation is mandatory for the first request of approval
submitted by a municipality or when the resources subject to a management transfer should be managed by several
municipalities (art. 18 and 19)”. To be approved the VOI must:
Submit to the mayor of the "affiliated municipality" a "Management transfer request" of renewable natural resources (art.
9).
The management transfer request is made following a standard formula; the content should be defined in its principle by
regulation. The requested information must specify:
         - The territorial base of the applying VOI
         - Its members
         - The list of individuals participating to the deliberations
         - Listing of the resources subject to a management transfer
         - The decision of the VOI in accordance with the rules governing the community
         - The date of the request
         - The signature of the representative of the VOI (art. 10).


The VOIs participate in the survey with the competent administration services (art. 12) allowing the local authority to
submit a request of management transfer. The investigation should enable the affiliated municipality:
         - To verify the existence of the requesting basic local community [VOI] and verify that the community is willing to
           submit a request of management transfer
         - To verify the regularity of the designation and the actual representativeness of the signatory representatives of
           the application on behalf of the local community [VOI]




     -   Donations and bequests
     -   from the VOI’s own activities (art. 20 of the 2000-027 decree)
VOI have to keep a book with the income and expenditures, and the account has to be controlled and approved annually by the General
Assembly (art. 21 of the 2000-027 decree).
40
   Fokontany is considered as an administrative subdivision of the municipality. However, its President is nominated by the Chief District
on a proposition list from the fokonolona.

                                                                                                                                       67
        - Verify the resources situation on the community territory or in the affiliated municipality and determine their
          nature and consistency
        - To finally assess the VOIs management capacity [VOI] (art. 13).


Co-sign the request with the mayor. The competent State Representative of the municipality will transmit the request to
the administration in charge of the concerned renewable natural resources in the management transfer request, if a
favorable opinion was given by the Community Council after the investigation. The request, developed on the basis of a
standard formula established by regulation must specify:
        - The resources subject to the transfer request
        - The identity of applying VOIs
        - Mention the reasons that influenced the decision of the municipal council
        - And if so, the priorities that the municipal council considers should be included in the management contracts.
          (art. 14).




                                                                                                                      68

APPENDIX C. LIMITATIONS OF USING 2000 BASELINE FOREST COVER AND CFM ESTABLISHED BETWEEN
2000 AND 2005

Ideally, baseline confounding characteristics, particularly baseline forest cover, should be measured at the very time CFM
is established (Andam et al., 2008). In this study, baseline forest cover is dated in 2000 while CFM are established from
2000 to 2005. When planners establish CFM, they make decision based on the landscape they are facing. They are likely to
establish CFM in location where there are forests at the time of establishment. Thus, if a CFM was established after 2000,
it was likely to be forested in that post-2000 year of establishment while its counterfactual, which was forested in the
2000 baseline may already be deforested in the post-2000 year of establishment. The fact that the CFM was still forested
in the post-2000 year of establishment could signify that it unobservably has smaller deforestation probability than its
counterfactual, which was already cleared. While matching can control for observable bias, it cannot deal with this kind of
unobservable bias. That CFM could unobservably have smaller deforestation probability than its counterfactual means
that our impact estimates can be considered as upper bounds. That is, if the probability of deforestation of the
intervention and its counterfactual were the same, effectiveness of the intervention would be smaller. Where intervention
has no significant effect, this will not change the conclusion that it is ineffective. However, where there is significant
effect, this means that the effect estimate can be smaller. For the latter, the sensitivity tests to unobservable bias provide
means to know how sensitive an estimate is to potential unobservable bias.

APPENDIX F. MATCHING, UNIT OF ANALYSIS, SAMPLING AND OUTCOME VARIABLE FOR ANALYSIS OF CFM
ON DEFORESTATION

Conservation interventions like CFM are not randomly assigned. The site characteristics that affect where conservation
interventions are assigned also affect deforestation, thus confounding attempts to estimate intervention impacts (Ferraro
and Pattanayak 2006). To control these confounding factors, some empirical studies have used matching (Andam et al.
2008; Joppa and Pfaff 2011). Matching selects comparison areas that are similar to the intervention areas in terms of
values of the confounding factors at the pre-intervention baseline. Thus, one assumes that the outcomes of the
comparison group represents, in expectation, the counterfactual outcomes of the conservation sites had they not been
exposed to the conservation intervention.

The unit of analysis is a forested pixel from the 2000 forest cover baseline (Appendix C for limitations of using 2000
baseline forest cover and CFM established between 2000 and 2005, and Appendix B for how we deal with potential
pseudo-replication in which pixels within a particular CFM are not independent). For each forested pixel at baseline,
covariates take the values of each confounding characteristic at that pixel location. For each analysis (Table 2), we selected
random forested pixels in intervention areas. Then, we used matching41 to pair each randomly selected pixel with the
most similar pixel in comparison areas in terms of covariates. The outcome variable is whether a pixel remained forested
or not in the 2010 land cover. The estimated difference in deforestation between intervention and similar comparison
areas represents the impact of the intervention on deforestation for intervention sites or the Average Treatment effect on
the Treated (ATT).We used independent samples T-test to compare deforestation in intervention and similar comparison
or counterfactual areas.

We performed exact matching on vegetation zones (eastern humid, western deciduous and southern spiny forests,
Appendix D). We executed bias adjustment regression to correct for any remaining post-matching covariate imbalance
(Abadie and Imbens 2006). We used the “matching” package in R (Sekhon 2011).

We aimed to select sample sizes that balance our interests in achieving high statistical power and reducing computer
processing time. Learning from multiple trial analyses, we decided on a sample of around 30,000 pixels for all intervention
areas in each analysis. For comparison areas, we sampled around two to four times more pixels (Appendix B Table B2).
The larger sample size from comparison areas increases the probability of finding a good match for each intervention
pixel.


F1. COVARIATES OR CONFOUNDING BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS
Based on Madagascar CFM practitioners’ opinion, and CFM and deforestation studies in Madagascar and other tropical
countries (Barsimantov and Kendall 2012; Bowler et al. 2012; Forrest et al. 2008; Gorenflo et al. 2011; Sussman et al.
1994), we identified pressure and access as potentially confounding factors. To control for these factors, we used
measures of agricultural suitability, slope, elevation, distance to recent deforestation (1990 – 2000), distance to forest
edge, distance to a village, distance to an urban center, distance to a road, distance to a cart track, duration of trip to the
nearest urban center and population density (see Appendix B Tables B3, B4 for sources of covariate data). Because
community characteristics received little consideration in selection of communities for CFM designation, we did not
consider community characteristics as confounding factors but only condition on these site characteristics indicating
pressure and access (see Appendix G).

F2. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO UNOBSERVABLE BIAS
While matching can ensure that the distributions of observable covariates are similar between intervention and
comparison groups, the groups may still differ in terms of unobserved covariates that affect both deforestation and
assignment to intervention. To check the robustness of our estimates of effectiveness to such unobservable covariates, we
performed Rosembaum's (2010) sensitivity test. A parameter Γ measures the dissimilarity in the likelihood of receiving
intervention between intervention and counterfactual units due to unobservable covariates. In the absence of
unobservable differences, Γ takes the value of one. The higher the value of Γ, the more dissimilar is the likelihood of
receiving intervention for the matched pair due to unobserved variables. The sensitivity analysis consists of increasing the
values of Γ and determining a critical Γ at which the estimate of effect of intervention is not significantly different from
zero. In other words, we seek to measure how strong an unobservable confounder would have to be in decree for the
estimated effect not to be significantly different from zero. The higher the value of the critical Γ, the more robust is the
estimate of intervention effect to unobservable bias. We carry out sensitivity tests with the “rbounds” package in R (Keele
2010).

APPENDIX H: METHODS FOR CFM IMPACTS ON WELL-BEING


H1. MATCHING AND POST-MATCHING ANALYSES
In addition to the non-random location of CFM across landscapes (Ferraro and Pattanayak 2006; Rasolofoson et al. 2015),
households may not randomly choose to live in CFM areas. Certain household characteristics may make households more
or less likely to live in CFM areas (Bandyopadhyay and Tembo 2010). The site and household characteristics that affect
where CFM is located and where a household chooses to live may also affect household per capita consumption and thus
confound the estimate of CFM impacts. Matching42 pairs a CFM household with a non-CFM household that are similar in
terms of the site and household confounding characteristics. Because after matching, ideally, the only difference between
CFM and non-CFM households is CFM intervention, one can assume that the non-CFM household consumption
expenditure equates the counterfactual consumption expenditure if there had been no CFM intervention. Thus, the
difference in consumption expenditure in CFM and similar non-CFM households represents the impact of CFM on
consumption expenditure for the CFM households or Average Treatment effect on the Treated (ATT).

We performed exact matching on the year when the data were produced (2010 or 2012), arid and cyclonic areas. We
undertook matching with the “matching” package in R (Sekhon 2011).

Matching does not usually produce perfect characteristics balance. To adjust for the remaining post-matching imbalance,
we performed regression43 on the matched CFM and non-CFM households. Studies show that combination of matching
and regression may yield more accurate estimate than either of them alone (Ferraro and Miranda 2014). We used the
lme4 package in R to execute the post-matching regression (Bates et al. 2014).


H2. FALSIFICATION OR PLACEBO TEST
We do not have information on household consumption expenditure at the baseline (when the intervention was first
implemented). Although there had been previous living standard surveys, these were with a different sample of
households (i.e. no panel data on living standards is available for Madagascar). This is an important unobservable
confounding variable because CFM households may be poorer (or richer) because they were already poorer (or richer) at
baseline. To address this issue, we performed the so-called falsification or placebo test (Ferraro and Hanauer 2014). The
idea is to test whether the baseline observable confounding characteristics we used are rich enough to capture the
missing baseline household consumption expenditure. In other words, we tested whether CFM and similar non-CFM
households that are matched in terms of the observable characteristics have similar consumption expenditure in the
absence of CFM intervention. We used data from EPM 2005, a household survey similar to EPM 2010 and ENSOMD 2012
that was carried out in 2005 on different randomly sampled households. We selected all CFM units established after 2005.
Then, we selected the treated and untreated households for those CFM units. Finally, we executed matching and post-
matching analysis similar to what we did for the EPM 2010 and ENSOMD 2012 data. None of those households were under
CFM intervention in 2005. If consumption expenditures in 2005 are similar for these treated and untreated households,
then matching on our observed characteristics ensures that matched treated and untreated households have similar
consumption expenditure in absence of CFM intervention. Thus, we can have higher confidence that matched treated and
untreated households for the EPM 2010 and ENSOMD 2012 data have similar consumption expenditures at baseline when
there also was no intervention. If the household consumption expenditures in 2005 are different, then the two groups of

households may have different consumption levels at the baseline. That difference may bias our impact estimate. But we
may use the result of the falsification test to explore the implications of the bias for the impact estimates.


H3. HETEROGENEOUS IMPACTS OF CFM
Because of raised concerns that the impact of CFM is heterogeneous for different types of households we explored the
impact conditional on household location. Conditional impact evaluation can be done by dividing households into
theoretically motivated or policy-relevant subgroups and then, investigating the impact in each subgroup to see if it is
heterogeneous across the different subgroups (Ferraro and Hanauer 2014). Communities managing the forests are often
located along forest edges. It is also reasonable to think that households living closer to forest edges are more directly
affected by CFM than those living farther. To reflect this potential heterogeneity of impacts as a function of household
location (spatial distribution of impact), we divided the sampled households into two subgroups: households within 3 km
from forest edges and households beyond 3 km from forest edges. We then investigated CFM impacts in the subgroup
within 3km from forest edges. We could not do the same for the subgroup beyond 3 km from forest edge because there
are not enough non-CFM households for the analysis to be carried out.


H4. CONFOUNDING CHARACTERISTICS OR COVARIATES
In Madagascar and other tropical countries, pressure and access are potential site confounding characteristics that affect
both assignment of forests to CFM (Rasolofoson et al. 2015) and household consumption (Andam et al. 2010;
Bandyopadhyay and Tembo 2010). We used measures of variables in Table 4 to control for these site confounding
characteristics. All these variables were measured at baseline.

Household characteristics that may influence where households choose to live and their consumption (Bandyopadhyay
and Tembo 2010) are listed in Table 4. These variables were selected as matching covariates because either they can be
brought back to baseline thanks to some household information collected in the EPM 2010 and ENSMOD 2012 surveys
(number of children under 5) or they are unlikely to be affected by CFM intervention (household head gender, household
head age, single female household head, household head education level, presence of disabled individual over 5 years
old).

APPENDIX I. ANALYSIS OF THE SYNERGIES BETWEEN CFM AND THE MAIN PUBLIC SECTOR POLICIES


Insignificant or even harmful impacts of the CFM policy on natural forests in Madagascar could justify the development of
a radical conservationist policy (isolation of all natural forests of Madagascar). However, this option is necessarily based on
a considerable strengthening of the states' control and coercive capacity (or even the private sector capacity) and seems
unrealistic except if considering the advent of a totalitarian system and a total control of human pressures on natural
forests. Indeed, an effective prohibition of access to natural forests to the rural population in order to maintain social
peace and food security would imply the mobilization of considerable resources in the very short term: only titanic
investments would drastically reduce the dependence of the rural population towards forest resources. Furthermore, it
would be necessary for companies still largely anchored on "traditional" values, to quickly capture a large number of
technical and institutional innovations.

Recognizing these constraints and willing to align national politics with the guidelines promoted by the United Nations, the
government of Madagascar has developed a National Development Plan (NDP) for the period 2015-2019 based on an
inclusive and green economy and putting natural capital at the center of the vision for the country. The objective is to
"build a new and strong Madagascar and to transmit to future generations a peaceful, united and prosperous country able
to become a world leader in the valorization and the preservation of its immense natural capital based on a strong
inclusive growth at the service of sustainable and equitable development of all territories. "This formulation is based on an
empirical construction of the Malagasy institutional framework which, despite the presence of some precursors (especially
in the environmental sector,) has actually only been initiated in the 2000s. The process is still young. This, combined with
the successive political crises, explains that these ambitions are based on cross-sectoral work that remains to be built. The
implementation of CFM, while participating to the effort of integrating environment into public policy, highlights the
obvious absence of synergy in the sector.


I.1. THE UNFINISHED CONSTRUCTION OF A FAVORABLE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT FOR THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF CFM
In 1996, the GELOSE law is passed in a highly centralized institutional context. The first laws on decentralization from 1993
and the ’new’ forest policy will emerge a year later. As precursors, management transfers will have to wait many years to
enroll in an institutional framework allowing the necessary synergies between public policies.


The gradual establishment of a cross-sectoral consistency in public policy statements
The Decentralization and Devolution policy initiated by the Malagasy State has been formulated in the Letter of
Decentralization Policy and Devolution (LP2D) in 2005. This policy aims at establishing democratic decentralized
governance embodied by the National Decentralization and Devolution Program (PN2D). One of the main objectives of the
policy is to make CTDs efficient actors in the promotion of sustainable development, particularly in terms of sustainable
management of natural resources and environment. Also, CTDs (municipalities, regions, provinces) are invited to
participate in the management of forest resources located in their territory through the participation of the local
population.
The devolved levels of the administration are involved to control CTDs actions on their legal aspects. In the case of the
forest administration, the increased responsibility of these decentralized administrative levels is expected to allow them
to get more involved in monitoring, control, and support of the various forest manager delegates, including VOIs. Thus,
forest cantonments should for example ensure such monitoring and control at the local level, while regional directorates
in charge of forests represent the central government when signing management transfer contracts.


                                                                                                                            86
The 2006 National Policy on Urban Planning (PNAT) follows the Strategic Document for the Fight against Poverty, which
clearly stated the objective of "rational management of forest resources by communities" 2004. The PNAT emphasizes
the need for development sectors to align with forest and environmental texts, explicitly citing the COAP and the forest
law.
This perspective is reaffirmed in the 2008 National Rural Development Program (PNDR). The environmental degradation
is considered a blocking factor for several reasons. The "overuse or skimming of forestry and fishery resources," the
"reduction of pastures ", the declining soil fertility or the obsolescence and non-implementation of legislation, including
forestry, and insufficient coordination of the disengagement of the state are highlighted. In order to "preserve natural
factors of production", it is recognized that "a greater participation of the poor in environmental management,
programming, implementation, monitoring and decision making, leads the population to invest in reducing poverty while
respecting the environment. " However, the established Committees for the implementation of this national program,
although systematically incorporating environmental sectors, are not yet recognized at the municipal level.
This oversight was corrected by the revision of laws on decentralization in October 2014: these texts reaffirm the role of
municipalities, particularly when it comes to municipal planning, which is seen as a pillar of sustainable management of
natural resources. According to the law, municipalities are vested with the role of setting up operations to protect natural
resources, particularly to prevent and fight against bush fires and deforestation (Art. 24 of Law No. 2014-018 °). However,
given the municipalities lack of resources (financial, human, technical...), the implementation of these actions is solely
based on the establishment of partnerships with different actors (VOIs, organizations, NGOs, external donors ...). Texts on
CFM in Madagascar allow municipalities to be stakeholders for management transfer contracts regarding follow-ups with
the forest administration, as well as the control and the protection of VOIs. Moreover, CTDs contribute to a redistribution
of income generated by the valuation of PFL and PFNLs through the introduction and management of rebates, and should
ensure farms sustainability altogether with the forest administration. Thus, the CBRM seems to be in line with the
decentralization policy as a local factor of development. However, the reference to communities is not explicit in the
General State Policy (PGE) validated in May 2014, despite the fact that it emphasizes the importance of the synergy of
agricultural production and environmental protection to revitalize the rural world. It states that "Madagascar in 2025 will
rely on a competitive and sustainable agricultural production including family farms and industrial units modernized to
ensure food security and conquer export markets ".


The bill currently under development at the State Department in charge of presidential projects, urban planning and
equipment (MEPATE) considers the revision of the 2006 PNAT and incorporates many provisions favorable to a better
effectiveness of Madagascar CFM. While using certain provisions of Ordinance 62-123 on the classification of areas for
forestry, agricultural or pastoral, it specifies that it is important to define the purpose of the land, as well as sectoral
services and different implementation structures purposes. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of the contribution
of all development actors, including the decentralized departments, the private sector and the civil society to the various
committees established to implement territory development plans. These development plans are developed for 15 years
period at the communal, regional, interregional levels and for a 20 years period at the provincial and national levels. They
set at least at the regional and interregional levels, "the principles of occupation and land use, including agricultural soils,
the zones to preserve and land reserves" (art. 39). We note that important decisions must be taken at the local level
regarding “large areas " and "land reserves". At this level, technical services and support organizations can play a crucial
role in the defense and promotion of CFM. Moreover, civil society organizations are represented in the Planning National
Committee (CNAT) and may also play an advisory role on strategic directions for the national land policy. The stakes are
high as support organizations will not only defend CFM as a unit of land occupation, but will also take advantage of the
complementarity of different development sectors so that the CFM can benefit from this synergy. Please also note
interesting prospects for VOIs implementation of Art 6 of the bill stating that "agriculture must have enough space for
crop rotation." In forest areas, the first factor of degradation is slash-and-burn agriculture. This practice is based on the
need to have enough space for agricultural crop rotation, and therefore the inclusion of more or less ancient fallow lands
that are traditionally overtook by the local population despite rules set by the forest law (Ordinance 60-127). The sixth
principle is probably a point to be addressed in the upcoming negotiations in the development and respect of different
urban plans.


                                                                                                                             87
However, the formalization and implementation of this policy faces the powerful lobbying of areas inspectors who are
opposing themselves to the reduction of their powers in favor of CDTs, whose performances are mixed when it comes to
protecting land property.


The lack of integration of the specificity of forest land in land policy
According to GELOSE law, VOIs are supposed to manage some RNR within the limits of their territory on lands belonging to
the State or Local Authorities (art. 1 & 2 of the GELOSE law in relation to paragraph 101 of Decree 1997-1200).
However, the 2005 Land Reform toppled the regime of proof in regards to the presumption of State ownership:
previously, all empty and ownerless land belonged to the State, that is to say that all land non-titled or non-registered by
individuals was supposed to belong to the state (except of course for titled and registered lands in favor of other public
entities). After the land reform of 2005, lands occupied by individuals may be subject to be recognized as private
properties by municipalities. This new land management actor was granted with a new role as a warrantor of land
ownership, while this role was only attributed to the State before the land reform. These provisions have increased
inconsistencies between land rights and forest law, even if they were established with the aim to promote rural
development.
Thus, the 2008-014 Law on private State, Local Authorities and Public Institutions Property requires that lands
constituting the private domain of these public entities get registered. But forests registered at the national, provincial,
regional or municipal forest are rare despite existing texts (Aubert, 2012). In this context, it is legally not obvious that
forest resources that are not explicitly included in the State and local authorities private domain (registered) may be in
favor of a management transfer profitable to communities, especially since the decree regarding the inventory of all
existing forests on the national territory (art. 35 of Law 97-017) has not yet been published (Aubert, 2013).
Furthermore, the forest commissions responsible for recognizing the nature of the forest land (Decree 2005-849) for
eventual submission to the forest system are not functional. Moreover, the land administration fails at requesting the
presence of a representative of the forest administration when engaging in land recognitions which constitutes the first
step of establishing private property. This solicitation is legal but is not systematically requested by decentralized
authorities.
It is therefore often difficult to identify forests owners that could be subject to a management transfer contract under the
forest regime. This situation is especially problematic as the decree establishing the relative land security (Decree 98-610)
was mobilized only in rare cases. The decree gives the opportunity to communities to mark off their land and have
decentralized services register the limits and should be in line with the provisions of the land property reform and the bill
for revision of urban planning currently under development.
This insecurity for the land property administration, the communities and of all forest loggers is problematic for the
organization of networks because it puts the legal exploitation of forest products in a particularly unclear situation:
Operators obligations (reforestation, royalties’ payments, traceability ...) can hardly be implemented. However, the
identification of exclusive rights on lands and RNR explicitly redistributed in lands of those involved in forest management
is a fundamental guarantee to the conservation of resources, particularly in a valorization context (Leroy, 2013).
Also, the establishment of a specific tenure for land under forest law, renewable natural resource management
agreements (including management transfers), and protected areas is required. Yet this regime described under Article 38
of the Law 2005-019 on the status of land property in Madagascar, has not yet been translated into a concrete law. Its
wording should be considered as part of the national land property program that will allow the implementation and the
consolidation of land property policy letter 2015-2030 which was formalized by the Governmental Council on 9 March
2015 ( the finalized version is however not available to the public).


Incompressible wood energy demands in the short term and the threat of a "mining" State
The Law of 10/12/2014 regarding the updated Malagasy Environmental Charter (Act No. 047/2014), defines in its
preamble natural resources as the basis for economic and social sustainable development and also mentions the "need to

                                                                                                                          88
preserve biodiversity and natural resources." The guarantee of the socio-economic wellbeing of local communities is one
of the objectives of economic development, ideally combined with good environmental governance. Alongside the State
and the CTDs, local communities, the private sector, but also technical and financial partners, are explicitly asked to
respect the principles of fairness and responsibility particularly in searching for sustainable funding and assisting actors in
the long term. These provisions are explicitly designed to promote the integration of the environment into all public
policies. Implicitly, they call for the environmental responsibility of actors to influence activities in two sectors of great
importance for the development of the country development: energy and mining.
In this context, the Ministry of Energy and Hydrocarbons receives financial support from the European Union and the
World Bank to develop a New Energy Policy for Madagascar. The vision of this policy focuses on "access to energy for all
and at a lower cost." In the draft of the new policy orientation, two out of eight strategic axes have an implicit link with
CFM: (1) the promotion of rural electrification valuing renewable energy and (2) the reduction of energy consumption
extracted from wood products. Although the operational dispositions of this political document are not yet known, it is
conceivable that the effects and impacts of rural electrification will indirectly contribute to the reduction of deforestation
and forest degradation. Forest sites affected by community management could benefit from the positive impacts of this
initiative. According to an interview with officials from the Ministry, the challenge is to increase by 50% the rate of
electrification in rural areas in 2030, and to reduce the rate of wood energy use from 92% in 2012 (AIDES) to 50% in 2050.
Finally, the Madagascar wealth in mineral and oil resources and the financial issues they represent constitute significant
threats for natural forests and for political stability, considering the significant risks of corruption that could generates this
financial windfall (World Bank, 2010).


The Mining And Oil Policy Framework produced in 2014 by the Ministry at the Presidency in charge of strategic
resources, however, highlights the obligation of the State to find a compromise between economic growth [as a result of
mining or oil operations] and preserving the interests of future generations [referring to environmental sustainability]. A
cohabitation between mining and environment should be considered in order to promote "alternative livelihoods around
PAs, encouraging the participation of miners." We note that formulated this way, this cohabitation could be beneficial to
the CFM for local populations surrounding PAs, including mixed PA, in areas presenting a mining potential. This
perspective does not, however, apply to communities located far from PAs. Many conflicts persist due to the overlapping
of mining licenses with many land occupations and assignments of forests, particularly in the context of CFM. In this
context, the provisions of the Mining Code (Law 99-022 as amended and its implementing decree 2006-910) are very
favorable to miners that can get expropriation in the public interest even with legal owners, if experiencing difficulties to
access mineral resources. Furthermore, the absence of written evidence of occupancy rights of land and forests will not
give right to the payment of compensations related to the loss of forest resources.

  Decree No. 2000-028 of February 14, 2000 regarding the environmental mediators (JORM No. 2627 of February 14, 2000, p.1441)
Main observation: Over the past few years, management transfers occurred without the presence of an environmental mediator. This
presence should be mandatory for the first contract approval request (Article 18 of Law No. 96-025).
The presence of the mediator is important since he remains neutral in relation to parties (members of the VOI, affiliated municipality

                                                                                                                                       95
and forest administration).
Contracts concluded under the GCF decree have the characteristic that the mediator role was played by a facilitator hired by the
promoter. The facilitator is not neutral with regards to the parties because its terms of reference are set by the developer.
One of the main reasons why environmental mediation was dropped is the remuneration of environmental mediators as basic local
communities could not support their salaries due to their limited financial resources.


A reintroduction of mediators in environmental management transfers is necessary. In addition, the environmental mediator can also
assist local communities in the creation of a management system and ensure training on regulation of access to resources, conditions
on how to sell over-the-counter or auction rights an products resulting from the use of renewable resources, income distribution modes
for incomes generated by the valorization of resources, the allocation of profits or penalties.

infringements. This text effectiveness is questionable due the anarchy, abuses and corruption in the forest sector. Updating of the
provisions of this Ordinance in relation to the current context is necessary.

Main observation: this text anticipated the existence of a forestry commission within the Regional Environmental Districts, a forestry
committee having a deliberative legal competence in Articles 5 and 17 of the Forest Act (recognition of the forest nature of a parcel and
diversion of the forestry regime) and an advisory competence under Articles 16 and 22 of the Act ( CTDs and State submission to the
forest system, and private forests submission to the forestry plan). The commission accepts among its members’ stakeholders in the
forestry sector (Article 6 of the Decree), a representative from legally constituted local communities. The problem is that these forestry
commissions have never worked.

However, texts on management transfers namely Decree 2001-122 GCF mentions the possibility of management transfers in peripheral
and buffer zones of protected areas including 5 and 6 categories (Article 5).
19 and 20     Protected areas of category 5 (protected harmonious            Implicitly, the provisions do not take into account the

              of their effectiveness after five years and modified if
              necessary.
Other observations: Although the code on protected areas lists the principles of transparency and accountability of the manager of the
protected area, the text does not specify the rules relating to this. This is for example the case when producing reports accessible to all
age groups including the participation of local communities in and around the protected area in order to optimize management. The
text does not describe penalties applicable in case of mismanagement by the manager. Nothing in the text does grant a right of
opposition to local communities in the context of the creation of a protected area. Their prior consent before the creation of the
protected area is not taken into account.

APPENDIX M. GUIDELINES AND FRAMEWORK TO MONITOR CFM

Community management can take different forms depending on each case, even if established by standards applying
everywhere.
According to the criteria of assessment of community forest management limits and success described in the international
bibliography, the following questions can help to monitor effectively CFM operations.
How important are CFM resources to the community?
   - Areas under CFM control: the surface of land managed in through decentralized approach by local communities is
       very important. CFM is relevant only when applying to large areas so to bring benefits to a greater number of
       locals.
       CFM of degraded soils is not beneficial to communities as the communities inherit from all the disadvantages of
       the land without any advantages. When the surface of a CFM is too small, the community management only
       benefits to a few individuals at the expense and to the exclusion of other members of the local community. To be
       effective, the surface indicator should be reported to the number of potential beneficiaries.
   - Types and forest wealth of CFM classified forests: forest resources must also be estimated in terms of quality.
       What matters to local communities is indeed to manage resources with the aim to generate incomes beneficial to
       locals. Various wood production capacities as well as non-timber forest products should be relevant in the eyes
       of local communities. The composition of natural areas by types (natural forests, plantations, agroforestry, other
       types of land use and occupation) as well as the updated inventory of resources if existing, provide a potential
       indicator of wealth.
Who benefits from CFM?
   - Number of beneficiaries of CFM: number of people, families or small groups who might benefit of CFM. The value
       of community management is to contribute to the resolution of local problems of food security and access to
       land. As the number of potential beneficiaries, the higher the interest of going to CFM diet is important.
   - Nature of CFM beneficiaries: the objective is to know who the local actors benefiting the most from CFM are. In
       some cases, restricted social and ethnic groups monopolize CFM products, excluding others. Particular attention
       should be paid to the inclusion of the poorest or most vulnerable. CFM is even more beneficial to the community
       when it includes numerous actors coming from diverse socio-economic backgrounds.
What is the level of ownership and "empowerment" of local actors?
   - Effective participation of members in the CFM: it is assessed by the number of meetings per year, the number of
         participants attending those meetings, and the number of initiatives involving members of the group.
   - Contribution of members to the decisions: the quality of this participation, warrant of good governance, implies
         that opinions should be expressed by participants and taken into account when making decisions. The average
         percentage of participants in meetings may provide a first indication.
   - Responsibilities transferred to the community: CFM can lead local actors to take on new responsibilities, which
         are usually included in the CFM contract: making of the resources management plan, lead the inventory of
         resources, directly harness or outsource the harnessing of resources (fuelwood, timber, non-timber forest
         products, pasture), participate in ecotourism activities, etc. A comprehensive community empowerment can lead
         the community to pay taxes to the State for the conduct of these operations.
   - Redefining the role of the administration: the decentralization implies that officials in support of community
         management structures intervene only upon request from the group and only to provide technical advice without
         any veto power, and without the will to interfere in the discussions related to the decision itself. They can only be
         present after invitation from the group.


                                                                                                                          103
What is the political and social context of CFM?
    -   Formalizing management objectives: the operating rules established in the community management contract,
        binding local communities, the government and its representatives (being either the local territorial
        administration or the central forest administration) set clear targets for the CFM. These objectives, and therefore
        the corresponding expected results, need to be clarified and accepted by local actors.
    -   Status of land under CFM: the legal status of land under CFM is important. This management regime, established
        to promote the sustainability of resources, must guarantee the maintenance of long-term resources. In some
        cases, CFM can lead to status modifications that can be both favorable and unfavorable. Some mechanisms of
        land appropriation that are beneficial to actors or small groups may also occur as a result. The access to land may
        in some cases be as important as the access to resources.
    -   Legal personality: If the community is recognized by the law and has a special status that keeps it safe from
        encroachments. Sometimes the community is recognized by a single regulatory text, which can cause problems in
        the case of conflicts arbitrated according to external laws. The community can be recognized in general (this is
        especially the case when a decentralization law organizing the decentralization of public authority does exist) or
        in a specific way in regards to the conservation of natural areas (but in this case, the community's scope of
        intervention is limited and management bodies, when they are different, may compete or conflict with local
        policies).
    -   Financial liability: when the community is self-supporting, the community supports CFM economic risks and
        investments but also perceives its management benefits. This situation makes sense when valuable resources do
        exist. Financial management should be transparent, align with national accounting rules, subject to approval /
        validation by the community management bodies and by the public authority when it is formally stated in the
        CFM contract.
What are CFM operating rules?
    -   Status of management bodies: the rules governing the formation and the operations of the various CFM
        committees must be clarified, published and understood by members of the community to enable them to
        resolve potential conflicts.
    -   Mechanisms of negotiation and conflict resolution: an internal regulation system officially accepted and
        amendable should help to manage daily problems. The regulation system establishes rules, stating how personal
        opinions may be taken into account (negotiation methods) and how to resolve potential conflicts.
What were the initial results of the CFM?
    -   Changes in the nature of resources: the development of new standards and norms of management is expected to
        have an impact on resources sustainability. The transfer of management to groups of local actors is expected to
        lead to a better conservation of resources. However, it could have the opposite effect if groups submitted to
        strong constraints decide to pursue immediate interests. This is why it is important to verify as soon as possible if
        the CFM is beneficial to the sustainability of long-term resources. For that matter, the main common sustainable
        management indicators can be used (e.g. surface variations, timber density and volume variations, total biomass,
        the importance of regeneration, changes in species diversity to assess the effect on biodiversity, erosion control,
        water quality, soil fertility, etc.).
    -   Changes in the level of ownership by the local community: CFM gives local actors new rights and new
        responsibilities. More difficult to assess (as it is prone to subjective assessments), the group members feeling of


                                                                                                                         104
         ownership is of paramount importance in assessing the interest of the community for the community
         management of forest resources.
    -    Modification of profits extracted from the valorization of resources: in a traditional system of natural resources
         management, goods and services also benefit to agents external from group, often before benefiting to the group
         itself. In the case of CFM, empowerment of local actors should benefit them economically unless the nature of
         the resources at the moment of the transfer does not generate profits beneficial to the community. Assuming it is
         possible to identify CFM as an income generating factor, it is of prime importance to track the evolution of
         revenues generated by natural resources for local actors under the CFM.
    -    Changes in terms of social equity: Did the CFM allow a more equitable distribution of goods and services
         extracted from local natural resources (for example by allowing a greater number of local actors as beneficiaries),
         or did it give more weight to already dominant actors.
    -    Changes in regards to food security: finally, the CFM if well conducted should improve food security for the
         group, allowing optimal use of local resources (e.g. by providing additional income and forest non-timber
         products between harvests, or by the direct provision of food derived from resources management).

 APPENDIX O: DESIGN PRINCIPLES ILLUSTRATED BY LONG-ENDURING COMMON-POOL RESOURCE
 INSTITUTIONS (OSTROM 2000)

 Elinor Ostrom’s work to beyond the tragedy of the commons and ensure a long term common pool resources use
 identified the 8 following points to pay particular attention to:

            1. Clearly Defined Boundaries
   Individuals or households with rights to withdraw resource units from the common-pool resource and the
   boundaries of the common-pool resource itself are clearly defined.
            2. Congruence
A. The distribution of benefits from appropriation rules is roughly proportionate to the costs imposed by provision rules.
B. Appropriation rules restricting time, place, technology, and/or quantity of resource units are related to local
    conditions.
            3. Collective-Choice Arrangements
   Most individuals affected by operational rules can participate in modifying operational rules.
            4. Monitoring
   Monitors, who actively audit common-pool resource conditions and appropriator behavior, are accountable to the
   appropriators and/or are the appropriators themselves.
            5. Graduated Sanctions
   Appropriators who violate operational rules are likely to receive graduated sanctions (de-pending on the seriousness
   and context of the offense) from other appropriators, from officials accountable to these appropriators, or from
   both.
            6. Conflict-Resolution Mechanisms
   Appropriators and their officials have rapid access to low-cost, local arenas to resolve conflict among appropriators
   or between appropriators and officials.
            7. Minimal Recognition of Rights to Organize
   The rights of appropriators to devise their own institutions are not challenged by external governmental authorities.

                                For common-pool resources that are part of larger systems:
            8. Nested Enterprises
   Appropriation, provision, monitoring, enforcement, conflict resolution, and governance activities are organized in
   multiple layers of nested enterprises.
