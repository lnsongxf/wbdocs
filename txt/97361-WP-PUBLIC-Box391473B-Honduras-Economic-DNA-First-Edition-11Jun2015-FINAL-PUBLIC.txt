It is a great pleasure to present this first edition of the Honduras Economic DNA (Diagnostic for
National Action) prepared by the World Bank. The objective of this series is to provide policymakers,
academics, the private sector, civil society, and the general public with a review of recent
developments in the Honduran economy and its evolving prospects for the future.

This first edition of the Honduras Economic DNA brings together the efforts that Honduras is
undertaking to achieve macroeconomic stability with its continuing struggle to increase the welfare
of its poorest and most vulnerable. While poverty fell in 2013, Honduras continues to have one of the
highest rates of poverty and inequality in Latin America, exhibiting only marginal and, at times,
fleeting progress over the past decade. Violence and limited opportunities remain substantial
obstacles to long-term poverty reduction and have contributed to emigration outflows in recent
years. Addressing the country’s deeply ingrained social challenges is a goal for the medium-term that
will require not only continued economic growth but also a solid macroeconomic and fiscal base.

For those of us who have had the privilege of working with Honduras over the years, it is clear that
while the country faces difficult development challenges, sustained reform efforts can help overcome
these challenges. Today, there are reasons to be optimistic. Honduras’ economic outlook is positive,
with growth improving from 2.8 percent in 2013 to 3.1 percent in 2014, and projected at 3.2 percent
in 2015. Prudent monetary policy has effectively kept inflation under control. The fiscal stance has
also improved, with the deficit decreasing significantly in 2014 thanks to the implementation of an
ambitious reform agenda that began in December 2013. The country should be recognized for its
commitment to restore confidence and build the foundations for inclusive economic growth and
sustainable poverty reduction. The ongoing fiscal consolidation program is notable in two key
aspects. First, the magnitude of the adjustment is significant, with a planned reduction of the deficit
by about 5 percent of GDP over 2014-15, of which over 3 percent of GDP already took place in 2014.
Second, the government is undertaking structural measures to address long term challenges, such as
the financial sustainability of the state-owned Electricity Company.

A typical Economic DNA will be published every twelve months and will (i) review the most recent
developments in the Honduran economy; (ii) reflect about future economic prospects; and (iii)
analyze development topics of interest. In this first edition the focus is on poverty and shared
prosperity. The global community has a renewed mission to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030 and
promote shared prosperity. The World Bank can contribute to these objectives by promoting an
exchange of development experiences, highlighting important lessons from Honduras and bringing
to Honduras lessons from other countries.

I hope you will find this new report series, which reflects the best analysis of the World Bank for
Honduras, to be a useful tool for understanding the country’s complex economic dynamics.

Honduras’ Economy: A Modest Recovery
The Honduran economy has experienced a modest and uneven recovery following the turbulent period of
2008-09 when the country experienced the global financial crisis combined with a political crisis. After
contracting by 2.9 percent in 2009, as the crisis reached its nadir, GDP growth rebounded modestly,
averaging 3.8 percent from 2010-12, below pre-crisis levels, then slid to 2.8 percent in 2013 and recovered
to 3.1 percent in 2014. The recovery in 2014 was driven by rebounding domestic demand due to higher
private investment, increasing remittances, and the gradual acceleration of growth in the United States,
Honduras’s main trading partner. In terms of sectors, services accounted for almost half of the total
increase in economic output in 2013-14. The communications industry has been a major driver of growth
in services, with internet and cellular networks both expanding rapidly. Financial services were a major
contributor to growth in the tertiary sector, but while total lending has increased, access to financial
services and credit remains narrowly concentrated. The agricultural sector contributed to growth as the
sector recovered from exogenous shocks in 2012-13. Manufacturing decelerated due to lower demand in
the auto parts and assembly “maquila” industry. Since 2011 construction activity has exhibited a declining
trend, reflecting a fall in residential projects and lower public investment. Consumption, which accounts
for over 70 percent of GDP, has been fuelled by increasing remittances, but the Honduran labor market is
weak and labor participation remains low. In this context, underemployment and informality are becoming
increasingly prevalent, and the share of workers earning less than minimum wage has increased
significantly in the past 5 years.

Honduras’ economy has gradually recovered since the global financial crisis, but economic
growth rates have not yet returned to pre-crisis levels (Figure 1). Real GDP growth averaged 5.9
percent during 2003-2007, above the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) regional average of 4.9
percent. Growth was mainly driven by agriculture, particularly coffee exports, construction, financial
and communications services, and manufacturing. Growth slowed to 4.2 percent in 2008, at the onset
of the crisis, and the economy contracted by 2.4 percent in 2009, the year in which the country
experienced political instability and the full impact of the crisis registered. The economy partly
recovered during 2010-2013, expanding by an average of 3.6 percent.

In 2014 the Honduran economy grew by 3.1 percent (up from 2.8 percent in 2013), the second
lowest growth rate in Central America. The country’s poor performance was due to a combination
of three factors: (i) a generally adverse trade environment marked by low demand among Honduras’
main export partners; (ii) supply-side shocks in the coffee sector―Honduras’ main export―cause by
disease, combined with a drop in international coffee prices; and (iii) a decline in investor confidence
due to a deteriorating economic outlook in a context of election-related political uncertainty. In 2014,
the growth in consumption and the increase in investor confidence spurred economic activity, yet
the post-crisis recovery remains modest.

Domestic consumption has driven economic growth since the global financial crisis and the
political crisis of 2009, while the share of investment has declined. The growth rate of private
consumption, which accounts for more than 70 percent of GDP, remained positive at 3.8 and 2.7
percent in 2013 and 2014. Consumption growth has been fueled in part by rising remittances—
around 80 percent of which go to consumption—and in part by the expansion of consumer credit.
Meanwhile, the contribution of private investment to GDP has recovered after it dropped sharply in

2013, as investors’ confidence increased due to a positive macroeconomic outlook. In contrast to the
positive contribution that investment had in 2011 and 2012 (3.2 and 1.1 percentage points of GDP
growth, respectively), investment had a negative contribution to GDP growth in 2013 following a
contraction of 4.7 percent with respect to the previous year. In 2014, private investment (comprising
close to 80 percent of total investment) grew by 2.9 percent, though this growth was contrasted by a
decline in public investment of 27.1 percent explained by the implementation of a fiscal consolidation
program. This pattern of investment led to declines in construction activity and capital goods
imports. Since the global financial crisis, exports grew by 11 percent annually between 2010 and
2012, exhibited a contraction in 2013 explained partly by exogenous shocks to the coffee sector, and
recovered again in 2014. An increase in imports has led to a marginal worsening in Honduras’ net
export position, which contributed negatively by 0.1 percentage points to GDP growth in 2014
(Figure 2).

Services, agriculture and manufacturing led economic activity in 2014. Nonetheless, growth in
almost all economic activities decelerated in 2014 relative to 2013. Services, which represent 40
percent of Honduran GDP, decelerated from 3.8 in 2013 to 3.0 percent in 2014, contributing 1.3
percentage points to GDP growth. The manufacturing sector decelerated from a growth rate of 3.4
percent in 2013 to 1.5 percent in 2014, contributing 0.3 percentage points to overall growth. In the
primary sector, agriculture and livestock grew by 2.7 percent, down from 3.4 percent in 2013, and
contributed 0.4 percentage points to overall growth. In this context, the acceleration in the growth
rate from 2013 to 2014 is explained by the significant increase of net taxes and subsidies (by 14.9
percent), which contributed 1.2 percent to GDP (Figure 3).

Communications and financial services led growth in the tertiary sector (Figure 4). Activity in
the communications sector was boosted by technological expansion programs, as mobile services
companies expanded the geographical coverage of their networks, increased speed of data
transmission (through a 4G band allocated in 2013), and diversified their services into cable and
satellite television. Meanwhile, the growth of financial services was driven by increasing loans to the
commercial sector combined with rising consumer credit. However limited progress has been made
towards financial deepening and inclusion. Just over 31 percent of Honduran adults have an account
at a formal financial institution, and only 6 percent have credit cards; these rates are well below the
Latin American averages of 51 percent and 22 percent, respectively.

The coffee industry recovered in 2014 after it was hit hard in 2012-2013 by a combination of
exogenous factors. Coffee production represents one third of total agricultural production in
Honduras. It accounts for 20 percent of total exports and about 3.5 percent of GDP. The impact of the
coffee rust disease (or “roya”), a parasitic fungus that has affected coffee production throughout
Central America, slashed output growth from 20.5 percent in 2012 to just 1.1 percent in 2013 (see
Figure 5). Yet, the recovery in production in 2014 has been modest and production levels have not
reached 2012 levels. The coffee rust is estimated to have affected at least one quarter of coffee
plantations in Honduras, with deep economic and social consequences. As illustrated in Box 1, the
impact of the rust extends well beyond GDP and exports, but also the incomes of households working
in the sector, which suffer from high rates of poverty.

 Despite the recovery in the coffee sector, overall agricultural production decelerated due to
 deceleration in the production of crops oriented towards the domestic market and a
 contraction in banana production. The sector grew by 2.7 percent in 2014, down from 3.4 percent
 in 2013, but still relatively robust. Meanwhile, growth in export-oriented agriculture slowed from 2.8
 percent in 2013 to 1.3 percent in 2014, due to the decline of banana production, explained by adverse
 weather conditions. It is worth noting that agricultural production in Honduras has diversified over
 the last decade, and the country has positioned itself as one of the main exporters of banana, melon
 and palm oil in Latin America.

                     Trouble Brewing?
                     Coffee, Productivity, and Poverty in Honduras
The coffee sector is a key driver of economic activity and an important source of income and employment for many
households: 1 in 10 workers are employed in the sector and coffee is one of Honduras’ top five exports. The
importance of coffee to the Honduran economy has increased in recent years: accounting from an average of 2.4
percent of annual GDP from 2003-2007 to 3.7 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2012. In addition, there are strong
linkages between the coffee sector and the external accounts. Around 90 percent of coffee production is exported.
Moreover, coffee is Honduras’ second highest value export behind the maquila sector. Meanwhile, about 20 percent of
foreign exchange purchases were related to the coffee sector. The bulk of Honduran coffee is higher-value Arabica, with
Honduras’ share of world Arabica coffee exports rising from 2.3 percent in the 1990s to 4 percent over the last decade.
Yet despite recent progress, Honduras remains vulnerable to shifts in international prices, especially since the bulk of
coffee exports are traded on commodities markets at spot prices, rather than via bilateral contracts (as futures).

Honduras has made great progress in improving productivity of the coffee sector over the past decade. Between 2001
and 2012 coffee production increased dramatically from 2.5 million to 5.9 million 60 kg bags due to the adoption of new
practices to improve coffee quality and the introduction of new, disease-resistant seeds, which drove significantly
higher yields per manzana (the basic unit of land in the sector, equivalent to 1.4 hectares) (Figure 7). In addition,
increases in international prices due to rising global demand and production declines in Brazil and Colombia have
spurred higher production. Since 2011 Honduras has become the largest coffee producer in Central America, surpassing
Guatemala, which has suffered relatively stagnant productivity in its coffee sector over the past decade.




                                                                           4
Despite these gains, workers in the coffee sector are among the lowest paid and report high levels of poverty. Of the
280 thousand hectares of land under cultivation, the bulk remains in the hands of small producers. In fact, of Honduras’
110,000 coffee growers, about 92 percent are small producers and account for the majority of production. According
to the 2012 national household survey the average monthly income among coffee workers is 2,700 lempiras per month.
Further, around half of the workers in the sector live in extreme poverty, and over two-thirds are poor. Low income
reflects, among other factors, the relatively low productivity in the coffee sector, and the agricultural sector more
broadly, despite recent productivity gains.

Although Honduras’ coffee crop has been less affected by the rust leaf disease than others across Central America,
the economic and poverty impact has proved significant. The current attack of rust leaf disease is the most severe
since 1976, affecting some 25 percent of crops. The most affected regions are El Paraiso, Santa Barbara, Comayagua
and Lempira (Figure 8). Affected producers have seen incomes decline by as much as 30 percent due to lower
production, as well as recent declines in global prices. Recovery of affected areas is expected to take at least three years,
with a total cost of around US$ 100 million, placing additional burdens on small producers in particular.

 Growth in the manufacturing sector has been led by rising foods and beverage and textiles
 production. The food and beverage industry, which accounts for about 45 percent of total
 manufacturing, grew by just 2.3 percent, similar to the growth exhibited in 2013, explained by rising
 exports of frozen shrimp and the expansion of the harvested area of sugarcane. Meanwhile, textile
 production accelerated from a growth rate of 1.6 percent in 2013 to 3.8 percent in 2014, as a result
 of a higher external demand. Meanwhile, machinery and equipment decreased as a result of lower
 demand from the United States automobile market. The “maquila” industry (of which textile
 represents 30 percent and machinery and equipment 41 percent), has played a key role in Honduran
 manufacturing. According to the Honduran Maquila Association, maquila-style plants currently
 employ 103,180 workers.

Construction activity has decelerated due to weakening residential and commercial
investment, and the reduction of public infrastructure projects. Construction accounts for 3
percent of Honduras’ GDP, and its share is above the average seen across Central America. The sector
was hit hard during the global financial crisis and the domestic political crisis of 2009, with
construction activity falling by 13.3 percent in 2009 and 2.4 percent in 2010. Construction activity
has yet to recover to pre-crisis levels. In 2014, construction activity contracted by 8.2 percent,
exacerbating the contraction of 2.5 percent registered in 2013.

Agriculture and commerce have led job creation; yet, modest economic growth has translated
into weaker labor opportunities. The latest household survey estimates the size of the Honduran
labor force at around 3.5 million, of which about 36 percent of are employed in the agricultural sector,
24 percent in the commercial sector, and 13 percent in manufacturing. Together, these three sectors
provide livelihoods for more than 70 percent of the labor force (Figure 11). Unemployment is
concentrated among urban youth and those lacking secondary education. The urban unemployment
rate is 6.4 percent, while in rural areas it is 1.7 percent. According to the most recent labor survey,
the unemployment rate in Honduras increased from 3.6 percent in 2012 to 3.9 percent in 2013, which
represented a loss of around 140,000 (private-sector) salaried jobs. This loss in salaried jobs led to
increases in the number of self-employed workers and in the number of workers receiving less than
the minimum wage (see further below). However, in the capital of Tegucigalpa, the average time
required to find a job dropped from 4.2 months in 2012 to 2.5 months in 2013.

Two-thirds of the labor force earned less than the minimum wage in 2013. Moreover, the share
of workers earning less than the minimum wage has significantly increased over the last 5 years
(Figure 12). This is likely an effect of rising underemployment, which is estimated to affect around
40 percent of the labor force, particularly in urban areas. In effect, the high level of the minimum
wage is likely acting as a constraint to overall job creation in formal sector employment. Indeed, the
minimum wage has risen faster than economic growth in recent years, as noted further in the Focus
Section to this report.

Inflation: Contained amid Pressures due to Higher Food Prices

Inflation remains within the target band established by the Honduran Central Bank. In recent years, low
food prices have helped to ease inflationary pressures. In 2014, however, drought conditions generated an
increase in food-price inflation, but headline inflation remains contained due to lower oil prices.

Inflation remains within the Central Bank’s target band of 5.5–7.5 percent. Inflation increased
from 4.9 percent in 2013 to 5.8 percent in 2014 (Figure 13) as a result of higher food prices; food-
price inflation reached 9.6 percent by November 2014, compared to 4.2 percent in 2013. Food-price
inflation was driven by rising prices for beans, milk, oil, tomatoes, potatoes, eggs and meat. Drought
conditions and demand factors also contributed to rising prices for livestock and major food crops
during 2014. Since end-2014, however, inflation began to decline following the fall in international
oil prices, which eased inflationary pressures in transport and communications. In the first four
months of 2015, inflation has continued to decline following a reduction in fuel and food prices.

Fiscal Policy: The Path Towards Fiscal Consolidation
Honduras has a history of chronic fiscal deficits. Periodic efforts at consolidation have failed to produce a
lasting realignment in the country’s fiscal stance, and the result has been a persistent accumulation of
debt. The country’s debt burden currently exceeds 40 percent of GDP, and its nominal debt stock is higher
now than it was before Honduras received multilateral debt relief in 2006-07. Public revenues are relatively
strong by regional standards, but current expenditures are high and rigid. Large losses incurred by the
state-owned Electricity Company further hinder the fiscal position. Since December 2013 the authorities
have renewed their efforts to stabilize public finances, adopting a series of fiscal, administrative and
regulatory reforms. These measures have generated positive results. One year later, results are
encouraging: the growth of current spending has been contained, public financial and debt management
systems have been tightened, and the fiscal deficit is narrowing. Nevertheless, given structural rigidities in
spending, a strong commitment will be required to maintain fiscal discipline over the medium term,
supported by consecutive administrations.

Over the past four decades public financial management in Honduras has been characterized
by long periods of fiscal deficit punctuated by efforts at consolidation. Honduras’ fiscal stance
is closely tied to the electoral cycle, as higher fiscal deficits have repeatedly coincided with
presidential and parliamentary elections. In addition, weak budgetary controls have led to higher-
than-projected deficits and the accumulation of public arrears, which in turn has undermined the
efficient allocation of resources.

Honduras’ fiscal position weakened significantly during 2012-2013. The country’s fiscal policy
became increasingly expansionary as current expenditures grew. This contributed to the long-term
deterioration of the public sector’s fiscal deficit, which widened from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to
4.2 percent in 2012 and reached 7.6 percent of GDP in 2013—well above the deficit target of 3.5

Since this reform was implemented, significant progress has already been made and
international lenders are responding positively. Central Government’s fiscal deficit declined from
7.9 percent of GDP in 2013 (the highest in the last decade) to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2014. The
reduction of the fiscal gap was a consequence of a significant increase of 20 percent in current
revenue due to elimination of fiscal exemptions and the increase in the rate of Value Added Tax from
12 to 15 percent. Current expenditure decreased by 1.5 percent due to lower purchases of goods and
services and the reduction of transfers, which allow the Government to exhibit a primary surplus for
the first time in five years. Notwithstanding the increase in debt service, the government’s overall
debt profile, including the yields and maturity for new domestic bonds, has improved since 2013. In
addition, debt yields of 2014 international bond placements have improved (yields fell from a peak
of 10 percent in August 2013 to 6.7 percent in April 2015).

One of the main contributors to persistent deficits of the combined public sector has been the
state-owned Electricity Company (ENEE). ENEE is in charge of the electric grid and public lighting
systems, while private companies manage most of the countries power plants. In 2013 ENEE
registered a loss of 8 billion lempiras (roughly US$230 million), the largest loss in its history, and its
deficit reached 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013. In 2014, ENEE recorded losses over US$ 1 million per day,
equivalent to 1.3 percent of GDP, down from 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013, but still significant and above
the goal of 5 billion lempiras established by the authorities. Although the Government had embraced
several reforms in the electricity sector in 2014, the reduction in the ENEE is explained mainly a
consequence of the reduction in international oil prices. Overall, ENEE’s weak financial position is
explained by structural issues, including its below-cost tariff structure, subsidies,, and high technical
losses (e.g., arising from poor infrastructure) and non-technical losses (e.g., arising from weak
commercial management, theft and fraud). This performance points to inefficiencies in
administration, amid rising concerns about commercial losses related to fraud, theft and billing
errors. Even though public spending on electricity is relatively high, access to electricity is limited: in
2011, only 55 percent of rural households reported having electricity, a modest improvement from
43 percent in 2001. Moreover, the public investment in productive sectors and infrastructure are
being diminished by transfers to cover ENEE´s deficit, with an evident impact on economic growth.

freezing the hiring of new public sector staff. In particular, it (i) keeps wages and expenditures on
goods and services unchanged in nominal terms relative to the previous year, and indexes wage
increases to inflation for a selected number of public institutions; (ii) specifies limits for
disbursements of investment projects so as to reduce capital expenditures; and (iii) maintains public
transfers to sub-national entities unchanged in nominal terms with respect to the previous year.

While recent reforms are stirring fiscal management in a positive direction, Honduras still
faces structural challenges that if not adequately managed could offset the recent fiscal gains.
The World Bank’s Public Expenditure Review of 2013 highlights that it would be important to
enhance the budgetary system to effectively monitor and control spending, and provides a series of
recommendations to enhance budgetary controls.

Despite its relatively high revenue collection, the government has relied on borrowing to
finance its current expenditures. Only in 2014, and as a result of the fiscal reform, Honduras’
Central Government current revenue intake reached 18.0 percent of GDP, of which 91 percent came
from tax collection, and slightly surpassed current expenditure (17.9 percent of GDP). However,
during the last decade expenditures have consistently exceeded revenues. Current expenditures,
account for around 78 percent of all public spending, although they have reduced from 20 percent of
GDP in 2013 to 18 percent of GDP in 2014. The reduction in current expenditure is explained by the
reduction in purchases of goods and services and the reduction in transfers. However, there has been
a rapid rise in interest payments resulting from a rise in the stock of public debt. In 2013, public debt
interest payments reached 2.0 percent of GDP, and one year later they reach 2.3 percent of GDP
(similarly, total public debt increased from US$8.3 billion in 2013 to US$9.3 billion in 2014 ).
Moreover, the increase in the stock of debt has been accompanied by a rise in interest rates. The rise
in debt service is constraining the resources available for social spending and investment. Social
spending has declined as a share of GDP from 18.8 percent in 2008 to 15.3 percent in 2012.
Reductions in social spending have been largest in education (from 6.9 percent of GDP to 4.6 percent)
and social security (from 7.3 percent of GDP to 5.9 percent).

              Public Debt in Honduras since Debt Relief
The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative was launched in 1996 by the World Bank and the IMF
with the aim of ensuring that no poor country faces a debt burden it cannot manage. In 2005 the HIPC Initiative
was supplemented by the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), which allowed for 100 percent relief on
eligible debts for countries completing the HIPC Initiative process. Of the 39 countries eligible for HIPC Initiative
assistance, 35 have received full relief from their
creditors after reaching their completion points Figure 18: Public debt in Honudras increased significantly

development needs of low-income countries of GDP)
and make sure that debt sustainability is
maintained over time. For debt reduction to
have a tangible impact on poverty, the
additional money needs to be spent on
programs that benefit the poor. The total cost of
providing assistance to these 39 countries is
estimated to total around US$ 74 billion by end-
2012.


Honduras’ reached the Completion Point under

Bank. The stock of public debt decreased from 63 percent of GDP in 2004 to 25 percent of GDP in 2007.

However, like many countries that participated in HIPC, after receiving debt relief Honduras has since seen a
significant increase in its stock of debt as a share of GDP. Since 2008 the stock and cost of public debt has
increased as a consequence of the deterioration of the fiscal balance. Public debt increased from 21.9 percent of
GDP in 2008 to more than 40 percent of GDP in 2014. This significant upward trend over 2008 – 2012 was mainly
driven in by domestic debt, although further increases in debt in 2013 were driven by external debt following the
issuance of US$ 1 billion in Eurobonds. By the end of 2014, in nominal terms Honduras’ external debt stock was
higher than the stock in 2005, before the HIPC Initiative.

External Sector: Reduced Pressures Amid Fiscal Consolidation Efforts and
Favorable Global Conditions

The current-account deficit widened dramatically between 2009 and 2013. On the export side a general
worsening of demand conditions was coupled with supply-side shocks to coffee production. On the import
side rising consumer demand was exacerbated by higher oil prices, which contributed to a long-term
decline in domestic savings rates. Meanwhile, the large and persistent fiscal deficit accelerated the overall
deterioration of the current account. Yet, in 2014 more favorable global conditions reduce the external
gap. Foreign direct investment inflows have recovered rapidly since the global financial crisis and now
finance 70 percent of the current-account deficit. Remittances have also recovered as the US labor market
has improved, and remittances represent Honduras’s second-largest source of foreign exchange after
merchandise exports. Moreover, fall in international oil prices has been driving a reduction in the current
account deficit.

and higher remittances.

Honduras’ current-account deficit reflects a sustained decrease in saving rates (Table 3).
Underpinning the current-account deficit is a medium-term decline in saving rates. This decline is
explained in part by the downward trend of private saving and in part by the widening of the fiscal
deficit. The investment rate, on the other hand, has picked up after dropping by more than 10
percentage points of GDP in 2009 (Figure 19). Foreign investment has significantly bolstered
investment rates, though on average they remain substantially below their pre-crisis levels.

The trade deficit improved in 2014, after the country reached in 2013 its highest deficit in the
past five years. Honduras’ external position improved during 2014 as coffee exports increased due
to the recovery in production volumes. In 2014 the general-merchandise trade deficit reached US$3.0
billion, down from US$3.1 billion in 2012. Total exports increased by 3.4 percent, while imports
increased by just 1.1 percent (-3.7 percent in 2013), due to a rebound in purchases of consumer goods,
oil, raw materials and capital goods.

Overall, the impact of the global financial crisis has been more acute in Honduras than in other
countries in Central America. Honduras has run current-account deficits for thirty consecutive
years, relying on foreign borrowing to finance the shortfall, and has seen higher deficits, on average,
than other countries in the region. For instance, during 2000-2014 Honduras’ current-account deficit
averaged 6.4 percent of GDP, compared to an average of 5.5 percent for the countries in its regional
free-trade zone, the CAFTA-DR. 2 However, this gap has continued to widen in the post-crisis period;
Honduras’ current-account deficit averaged 8.1 percent of GDP over the past five years compared to
an average of 6.5 percent for the CAFTA-DR.

 risen to 101. This remarkable 66 percent increase in export destinations was double the average for the other
 CAFTA-DR countries over the same period (Figure 21).

 At the same time Honduran exports have also become more diversified. The expanding range of exports has
 helped to mitigate the impact of shocks in Honduras’ traditional export markets. Melon exports, for example,
 doubled in value in less than ten years. By 2012 Honduran melons were available in Hong Kong, Singapore, the
 United Arab Emirates and other distant markets. Yet despite the rapid diversification of Honduran exports, the
 share of the five most important exports in total export revenue increased from 46.3 percent to 49.7 percent
 over the same period, reflecting, among other factors, increased in international prices for Honduran primary
 commodities over the past decade (Figure 22).

 The signing of a number of trade agreements over the past few years are likely to help in further diversifying
 Honduras’ export basket. These agreements are expected to help Honduran firms reduce their fixed costs in
 penetrating new markets. Trade costs are expected to fall not only due to the reduction of tariffs as a result of
 the trade agreements, but also due to increased trade and trade-related services between Honduras and its trade
 partners. Research and development (R&D) collaboration between enterprises and universities has been
 conducive to innovations, and to the diffusion of knowledge. For instance, Honduras’ successful experience with
 the Agricultural School Zamorano has been held up as an example of regional best practice and deserves further
 attention (see World Bank 2014, Honduras Current Account Assessment).

Remittances have registered strong growth as the US labor market continues to recover.
Remittances are Honduras’ second-largest source of foreign exchange (after goods exports) and are
equivalent to more than three times the value of foreign direct investment (FDI). During the post-
crisis period remittances averaged US$2.9 billion (16.4 percent of GDP), reaching a peak of US$3.3
billion (16.9 percent of GDP) in 2014. Although large remittance inflows can cause the real exchange
rate to appreciate, with potentially negative impacts on the tradable sector, they also provide an
important source of external financing, particularly for domestic consumption.

FDI remains the largest source of external financing for the current-account deficit. Honduras’
FDI inflows have regularly exceeded 5 percent of GDP—except in 2009, when FDI volumes
plummeted worldwide. In recent years FDI has financed almost 70 percent of the current-account
deficit, roughly in line with the CAFTA-DR average. In 2014, FDI surpassed US$1.1 billion, 5.7 percent
of total GDP. FDI inflows have also shown much less volatility than portfolio and other investment
inflows, and are typically associated with technological and knowledge transfers from abroad.


   Box 4
                 Saving and Spending
                 Are Honduras’ Current-Account Deficits a Cause for Concern?
 The widening in Honduras’ “twin deficits”—fiscal deficit and current account deficit—particularly between
 2009 and 2013 has raised concerns about macroeconomic sustainability. The public sector’s fiscal deficit
 widened from 4.5 percent of GDP in 2009 to 7.6 percent in 2013. The current account deficit has widened from
 less than 4 percent of GDP in 2009 to 9 percent of GDP in 2013, a level not seen since the early 1980s. While
 Honduras has run sustained current account deficits for the past thirty years, the recent widening in the deficit
 seen over the past five years reflects a series of shocks, including weaker demand for Honduran exports as a result
 of the global financial crisis, as well as higher import prices and a widening in the fiscal deficit.

 The current account measures the difference between what an economy produces and what it consumes and
 invests in a given period (or alternatively, the difference between national savings and investment). When
 countries consume and invest more than what they produce, they need to borrow from the rest of the world to
 finance that gap. The current account deficit reflects that amount that a country borrows from the rest of the
 world to finance the investment and consumption in excess of its level of production, or income. The current
 account balance of a country comprises three subcomponents: the trade balance, the income balance and the
 transfer balance.

 A large current account deficit in itself is not necessarily a source of concern, provided that the borrowing is
 used to fund productive investment in the economy. For example, if a relatively poor country on a path to
 growth, and constrained by low levels of domestic savings, borrows from abroad to finance higher investment
 rates, all other things equal, it will run a current account deficit. Over time, the returns on these investments will
 help generate the income to repay foreign creditors via accelerating economic growth. On the other hand, current




                                                               17
 account deficits can also arise without a corresponding increase in investment, as often occurs when current
 account deficits are caused by public sector deficits. When governments spend more than what they collect in
 taxes, countries run current account deficits, all else being equal. If public borrowing is predominately channeled
 into greater public investment, such as in infrastructure, it can generate a future economic return. However, in
 most cases public deficits are unlikely to be associated with faster future growth, and instead typically reflect
 higher current expenditures. These simple examples stress the importance of identifying the underlying sources
 of the current account deficit: is it mainly driven by fiscal deficits, by low private saving rates, or by high private
 investment rates?

 In Honduras the deterioration of the current account deficit in the past few years is partly driven by a decline
 in national saving rates resulting from rising fiscal deficits. From 2009-2011, the widening in the current account
 deficit can largely be attributed to a recovery of national investment in the aftermath of the global financial crisis
 – up from around 20 percent of GDP in 2009 to 26 percent in 2011, which was not matched by a commensurate
 rise in domestic savings. However the further widening in the current account deficit since 2011 has coincided
 with declines in national investment, which has been more than offset by even greater declines in national savings
 (Figure 19). Over the same period, the fiscal deficit has widened further from 2.8 percent of GDP in 2011 to 7.6
 percent in 2013, suggesting that fiscal deficits have been a principal driver of the widening current account deficit.

 A recent World Bank study notes that government expenditures have played a crucial role in the dynamics of
 the current account deficit: every extra US$100 spent by Honduras’ government is associated to an increase in
 the current account deficit of US$14, keeping everything else constant.

 If poorly managed, the current account deficit could present external financing risks in the short-term. The
 sustainability of the current account depends upon the degree of borrowing, and whether foreign investors are
 willing and able to lend to the country to finance the current account the short term. To date, the widening
 current account deficit has been financed largely via FDI inflows, which are typically a more stable source of
 financing. However the size of the current account deficit and recent run up in Honduras’ external debt as a result
 of accumulated deficits remain a cause for concern. The country’s large current account deficit could reduce
 confidence in the currency, which is particularly relevant since firms and households hold almost 30 percent of
 their credit lines in foreign currency, mostly unhedged. As such, the potential flow on impacts from problems
 with financing the deficit could have severe implications for access to finance and business and consumer
 confidence, with flow on impacts for growth and job creation.



Monetary Policy and the Financial Sector: Credit Growth Decelerates and
Dollarization Increases
The depreciation of the real effective exchange rate between mid-2011 and 2013 has boosted Honduras’s
trade competitiveness, though this situation has reversed in 2014. Credit growth decelerated but remains
relatively robust, and the banking industry appears healthy. However, lending activity is heavily
concentrated in particular economic sectors, such as consumer and housing lending and by geographic
regions, with over 90 percent of formal lending focused in just three provinces. Going forward, greater
financial deepening to extend access to financial services and credit to households and firms across the
country would help support economic growth. Meanwhile, the dollarization of the economy remains
significant and continues to rise.

In the first quarter of 2015, the Honduran Central Bank adopted an expansionary monetary
policy. Although in the last three years the Central Bank had successfully reduced liquidity in the
money market while keeping its policy rate stable, this year the Central Bank raised the policy rate
by 25 basis points on February and March after 32 months (from 7.0 percent to 6.5 percent) in a

context of anchored inflation expectations, decreasing fuel prices and a negative output gap. In
addition, since 2011 the Central Bank has permitted greater flexibility in daily exchange-rate
movements. In mid-2011 a crawling band was introduced for exchange-rate and foreign-exchange
market interventions. This policy was expanded in July 2013, allowing for more flexibility in
exchange-rate fluctuations, and allowing the currency to depreciate faster since the last few months
of 2014.

monitoring. Credit to the private sector grew by 10.7 percent in 2014, down from 11.1 percent in
2013 (Figure 26). The slowdown in lending was the result of a deceleration of credit in foreign
currency in a context of the depreciation of the local currency, combined with higher interest rates
and less market liquidity (controlled by the Central Bank through open market operations). Yet, the
credit dollarization ratio has increased on the back of comparatively stronger foreign currency
lending, reflecting the gap in interest rates between local and foreign currency lending. Financial
dollarization was also boosted by the increasing foreign currency liquidity held by Honduran banks.

The Global Outlook: A Rising Tide Lifts Expectations

Growth rates among Honduras’ main trading partners are expected to accelerate over 2015-2016, and
current projections anticipate a gradual return to normalcy in international financial markets as the US
and other advanced economies continue to scale back their monetary stimulus policies. Rising consumer
demand in the United States will fuel export growth, while the recovery of the US labor market is expected
to bolster remittance inflows, supporting an increase in domestic consumption. Emerging economies are
projected to grow at a more moderate pace, which should have only modest implications for Honduras,
but further disruptions in the euro zone could indirectly impact the Honduran economy indirectly via its
main trading partners, especially the US. Lower oil prices are expected to drive real income shifts from oil-
exporting countries to oil-importing countries.

Honduran trade, developments in the region have important implications for Honduras’ main trading
partners.

After recovering modestly in 2014, Honduras’ terms of trade are projected to continue
improving from 2015. The stabilization of the Chinese economy, coupled with accelerating growth
in advanced economies, is expected to boost global commodity prices, improving Honduras’ terms of
trade. Overall, prices for key Honduran exports are expected to remain relatively stable, although
some major export products are expected to see very modest price declines over 2015-16. In 2013
coffee prices fell to their lowest level since 2009, as global markets responded to an excess of supply,
but have since recovered. Over 2015-2016, robust coffee production in major exporting countries
and high levels of inventories worldwide should keep coffee prices low and stable. At the same time,
prices for Honduras’ imports are expected to decline, driven by falling oil prices.

A gradual rise in global long-term interest rates is projected as the US Federal Reserve slows
the pace of its bond purchases through a process known as “tapering”. In recent years, a
combination of high commodity prices and favorable global financing conditions has supported the
growth of many developing and emerging economies. However, in January 2014 the Federal Reserve
began to reduce the size of its bond purchases, indicating an important shift in US monetary policy.
During 2015-2016, investors are expected to continue restructuring their portfolios and migrating
toward less risky markets. This in turn, is expected to increase financing costs in emerging markets
and slow capital inflows to Latin America and the Caribbean, which could further increase the cost of
Honduras’ debt and hinder its efforts at fiscal consolidation.


Honduras’ Outlook: The Pivotal Role of Reform

The Honduran economy is expected to experience a recovery during 2015-16. Growth is projected across
all major sectors. The agricultural sector will benefit from a continuous recovery in coffee production
combined with rising yields for other export-oriented crops. Meanwhile, continued growth in the
manufacturing sector, driven by the auto parts and “maquila” subsectors, will have an especially positive
impact on employment indicators—as will increased construction activity, which is anticipated to improve
as investor confidence rises. Increasing investment will boost the credit supply in the context of a solvent,
albeit relatively shallow, financial sector, while expanding internet and telecoms infrastructure spurs
growth in communications and related services. Furthermore, lower oil prices would help reduce the
current account deficit. Yet, this forecast is predicated on the assumption that current efforts at fiscal
consolidation, as well as broader governance reform measures, will continue to be implemented and that
past progress will be maintained. Consequently, sustained political commitment to the reform agenda is
critical to the positive domestic outlook presented below.

The Honduran economy is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 3.2 percent during
2015-16, with growth forecast across all economic sectors (Table 4). The scenario for 2015-
2016 envisages a gradual economy-wide acceleration supported by the steady expansion of
agriculture, manufacturing, construction and services. Agricultural output will continue to grow
partly driven by the fall in oil prices, the recovery in coffee production and because prices for
Honduran exports are expected to remain relatively high overall. Demand for palm oil and fruits is
expected to grow rapidly, particularly from the United States and Central America. Growth in the
manufacturing sector will be supported by rising domestic demand and the ongoing economic
resurgence in the United States, with clothing and textiles and food and beverages projected to lead
sectoral exports. In addition, an expanding manufacturing sector is projected to have an especially
positive impact on employment. Meanwhile, services will continue to grow at the pace observed over
the last two years. The expansion of the tertiary sector will be driven by transportation and
communications (especially internet and telecom) and by financial services. Meanwhile, construction
is expected to rebound after the deceleration of 2014, as increasing confidence in the economy spurs
a mild recovery in private investment, although lower public investment may affect construction.

Honduras’ macroeconomic outlook is expected to improve during 2015-16, with a positive
external environment supporting critical efforts to strengthen the country’s fiscal position
and boost economic growth. The ongoing recovery in the United States is expected to bolster export
revenues and remittance inflows. Lower oil prices are expected to have a positive impact on domestic
inflation 3 (as observed in the last quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015) and on the trade
balance. In particular, inflation is expected to decline below the Central Bank’s target band of 5.5-7.5
percent. The current-account deficit is projected to fall from 7.6 percent in 2013 to 6.0 percent by
2015, reflecting an improved trade balance, increasing remittances, and a supportive fiscal policy.

3To the extent that there is a high pass-through effect from oil-prices to domestic prices, inflation is expected
to fall more rapidly than the increasing purchasing power of Honduran households.



                                                                   23
However, this positive macroeconomic outlook is vulnerable to downside risks. Uncertain
global market conditions, and especially the possibility of weaker growth in the United States, could
negatively impact Honduras’ prospects over the medium term. Perhaps most crucial, however, is the
risk posed by the potential erosion of fiscal discipline and commitment to the structural reform
agenda, as the positive domestic outlook presented below hinges on the government’s continued
pursuit of fiscal consolidation in a context of sound macroeconomic management.

Near-term growth will be driven by consumption, while the share of private investment in
GDP is projected to recover. According to World Bank projections, the share of private investment
to GDP will increase from about 18 percent in 2014 to an average of 19 percent during 2015-16.
Meanwhile, the GDP share of public investment is expected to remain steady, at around 4 percent
during 2015-16 as a consequence of the ongoing fiscal consolidation program. Going forward,
accelerating private investment growth will require further efforts to reduce the cost of doing
business and promote foreign investment, as well as measures to improve domestic security
conditions. However, if achieved, higher investment holds the potential to significantly lift growth
and expand employment opportunities.

Sustained fiscal consolidation will be critical to Honduras’ long-term growth trajectory. The
overall fiscal deficit of the combined public sector is projected to decline from 4.3 percent of GDP in
2014 to 2.0 percent by end-2016. This projection is contingent on the success of efforts to continue
improving the government’s revenue position, limit the growth of current expenditures and mitigate
the fiscal risks posed by state-owned enterprises. The fiscal reform would build the foundations for
more robust economic growth in the longer-term, although they are expected to weigh on growth in
the near-term. The government is also attempting to shore-up the financial position of the ENEE, the
state-owned electricity company, through efforts to improve the utility’s corporate governance
structure. Meanwhile, enhanced public financial management, particularly in the areas of
procurement and payroll, are also expected to yield fiscal savings provided that enhanced controls
can be maintained over time.

The public debt is expected to stabilize over the medium-term as part of a general
improvement in debt indicators. As noted in Part I, Honduras’ debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
peak in 2017 before gradually decreasing in subsequent years. The near-term increase in external
debt will be driven by new bond issues in international markets and by loans from multilateral
institutions, while the domestic debt stock should remain stable. Two-thirds of Honduran debt is
denominated in foreign currency; consequently, a sharp depreciation of the lempira could potentially
threaten debt sustainability. Interest payments are projected to increase over the medium-term, but
the country’s overall debt-service obligations should remain manageable given ongoing
implementation of the fiscal consolidation program.

The domestic financial sector is well capitalized and profitable, and it is expected to remain
so over the medium term; however, the shallowness of financial markets and narrow
concentration of access to credit means that many lack access to financial services, while
placing a brake on growth. The banking sector is relatively sound, and all financial institutions
exceed the minimum capital-adequacy ratio. Bank deposits have held roughly constant, while
nonperforming loans have declined from 4.7 percent in 2009 to a projected 3.6 percent in 2014. Over
the medium term, however, the projected expansion of foreign-currency lending caused by excess
bank liquidity will require close monitoring, especially the foreign-currency loan portfolio held by
unhedged borrowers. Planned reforms supported by an ongoing IMF program would help mitigate
financial sector risks.

III.     Focus Section: Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Honduras 4


The government of Honduras defines poverty reduction as a key development goal in its
national development strategy, Plan de Todos para una Vida Mejor, adopted in 2014.
Eradicating extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity are both fundamental development
goals shared by the government and the World Bank. 5 And they are of especially critical importance
in Honduras, as the country continues to suffer from high levels of poverty and inequality coupled
with low levels of socioeconomic mobility.

Progress in alleviating poverty achieved during the high-growth years of the mid-2000s was
undermined in the wake of the global financial crisis, but 2013 poverty rates suggest the
country is recovering. While economic growth, job creation and significant increases in remittances
led to a decline in poverty and inequality in the mid-2000s, between 2009 and 2012, a combination
of exogenous shocks and domestic fiscal instability had an especially damaging impact on Hondurans
living below or near the poverty line. Low productivity and inequitable distributions of services and
opportunities also contributed to the resurgence of poverty rates.

This Focus Section analyzes recent trends in and drivers of poverty in Honduras and evaluates
the country’s progress in achieving shared prosperity. Understanding the drivers of poverty and
inequality is key to designing effective development policies. The section begins with an examination
of recent trends in poverty, inequality, and shared prosperity in Honduras, situating Honduras’
performance in an international context. An analysis based on international poverty lines reveals
similar trends to those indicated by national poverty measures. The focus section concludes with a
look at how different factors have contributed to recent progress on poverty alleviation and
improvements in the living standards of the population as a whole.


Poverty and Shared Prosperity: Recent Trends

Honduras continues to experience very high rates of poverty, and extreme poverty is
especially prevalent. , Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the region, with an annual GDP
per capita of US$4,445 in purchasing power parity terms, equivalent to about one-third of the average
for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Poverty rates in Honduras are very high, both by regional
and international standards. In 2013, the moderate poverty rate was 64.5 percent according to the
national poverty line, and a full 42.6 percent of Hondurans lived in extreme poverty. While high, these
rates represent a sizeable reduction in poverty since 2012.




4 This section is partly based on a forthcoming World Bank study on Shared Prosperity and Extreme Poverty
Reduction in Latin America.
5 In April 2013, the World Bank Group endorsed two ambitious goals: (1) to end extreme poverty by 2030; and

(2) to promote “shared prosperity” by boosting the incomes of the poorest 40 percent of the population in
every country. The introduction of the second goal marked a shift in the World Bank Group’s poverty reduction
mission.

    Box 5
              Everyone Counts
              Poverty Measurement in Honduras
To measure the incidence of poverty, Honduras uses two income-based poverty lines. First, the extreme poverty,
or “food poverty”, line reflects the cost of a locally obtained basic food basket that meets minimum caloric
requirements. Second, the overall poverty line is constructed by taking the extreme poverty line and adding a set of
basic nonfood goods. Using the national household survey, income estimates are constructed at the household level,
which include both labor and non-labor income. This aggregate income is adjusted by a factor to correct for under-
reported incomes. The adjusted household income is then divided by the number of household members to obtain
the household income per capita.

There are some concerns with respect to how poverty is measured in Honduras. First, the methodology used to
adjust for non-declaration of income was developed fifteen years ago and may not be appropriate today. Second,
different poverty lines are used for urban and rural areas, but it is not clear that there are significant spatial
differences in cost of living. Finally, the nominal urban poverty line may be too high when compared to other
countries in Central America, such as Costa Rica or Panama, which have a higher GDP per capita than Honduras. 6

Poverty in Honduras fell during the economic expansion of the mid-2000s. Between 2003 and
2009 the national poverty rate declined by almost 6.3 percentage points (Figure 30). A robust global
economy boosted export revenue, large investment inflows created new employment opportunities,
and a vibrant US labor market boosted remittances and fuelled increased domestic consumption. In
2009, however, a series of shocks in the global economy caused a sharp contraction in Honduras.
Export demand declined, foreign investment dried up, and remittances faltered as the US
unemployment rate spiked. The years that followed were characterized by slow and uncertain
recoveries in both the Honduran and global
economies. Growth resumed, but at a much Figure 30: Gains in reducing poverty during
slower pace, and both exports and remittances the mid-2000s were reversed in recent years.

This stands in stark contrast to the significant
progress made elsewhere in the region during the same period. In LAC as a whole, both poverty and
extreme poverty have fallen steadily since 2001, with the rate of decline remaining roughly similar
in both the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods (Box 6). Poverty in Honduras, meanwhile, shows a
markedly different trend, indicating that gains in poverty reduction have been harder to achieve and
maintain in the Honduran context.

                Falling Behind
                Comparing Poverty Trends in Honduras with Regional Averages
To measure poverty across countries, the World Bank and its partners have developed comparable income data
and international poverty lines. 7 The figures produced by the Honduran National Statistics Office reveal the evolution
of nationally-defined poverty indicators over time – these are the poverty trends underlying much of the analysis
presented in this report. Though informative, poverty lines and estimation techniques vary between countries, thus
these are not internationally comparable. The World Bank figures, on the other hand, enable international
comparisons and benchmarking. Hence, all cross-country analyses presented in this report are based on these
international lines.

Using comparable poverty estimates, poverty rates in the LAC region have declined significantly in recent years, in
contrast with recent trends in Honduras (Figure 31). On average, total poverty rates in LAC (measured as the share
of individuals earning less than US$4 per day in 2005 purchasing power parity) fell by more than a third between 2001
and 2013. Much of this decline is attributable to gains in the Southern Cone and Brazil, with lower gains in Central
America and Mexico. 8 Meanwhile, Honduras’ poverty rate has fluctuated far above the regional average, ending the
period with poverty rates more than double those of the region.

Trends in extreme poverty rates also lag behind the LAC average (Figure 32). Between 2005 and 2009, extreme
poverty in Honduras (measured as the share of individuals earning less than US$2.5 per day in 2005 purchasing power
parity) fell from 47.4 percent to 31.3 percent. These gains have largely been reversed since 2009 with extreme poverty
reaching 39.6 percent in 2013. This is more than three times the LAC average. From 2009 to 2013, 8.3 percent of
Hondurans, or roughly 780,000 people, fell into extreme poverty. Furthermore, 17.3 percent of Hondurans have

incomes below US$1.25 per day – the global extreme poverty line. This is more than four times higher than the LAC
rate of 3.9 percent and second highest among the region’s countries with available poverty estimates, with only Haiti
surpassing it. As such, it is one of the countries in LAC furthest from achieving the eradication of extreme poverty as
espoused by the World Bank’s twin goals.

After expanding modestly during the mid-2000s, Honduras’ middle class contracted in the
wake of the global financial crisis. As poverty fell from 2005 to 2009, the middle class (those living
on between US$10 and US$50 per day) grew, and by 2009 had risen from 10.9 percent to 15.7 percent
of the population (Figure 33). However, by 2013, the middle class had fallen to less than 11 percent
of the population as a consequence of the financial crisis and its aftermath. As of 2013, Honduras had
one of the smallest middle classes in Latin America, and among the largest shares of poor households,
including the highest proportion living on less than $1.25 per day (Figure 34). In many countries, a
large and growing middle class is associated with stronger economic growth and a more stable
society. In Honduras, the share of households living above the poverty line but vulnerable to falling
back into poverty (those with per capita incomes between US$4 and US$10 per day) rose in the years
prior to 2009, reflecting the economy’s modest success in moving people out of poverty. After 2009
that share declined again as poverty levels increased.

National poverty trends mask significant regional disparities in the incidence and severity of
poverty in Honduras (Figure 35). In 2013, extreme poverty rates were almost three times higher
in rural areas than in the capital of Tegucigalpa. Over the past decade, reductions in extreme poverty
were observed mainly in rural areas. Poverty and extreme poverty increased slightly in urban areas
throughout the country, contributing to an observed increase in poverty rates.

Honduras made good progress in Figure 36: While 2003-08 saw pro-poor income
promoting shared prosperity before the growth in Honduras, income fell after 2008, hitting
global financial crisis but the crisis and its the poorest especially hard
aftermath reversed this progress. Income (Annualized growth rates by income percentile)
grew across the board between 2003 and 2008,
with the poorest seeing the strongest growth
(Figure 36); during this period, the income of
the poorest 40 percent of Hondurans, the
World Bank’s official indicator of shared
prosperity, grew by 9.3 percent per year, more
quickly than average income. Indeed, Honduras
outperformed almost all LAC countries in
growth of the income of the bottom 40 percent
during this period. However, during 2008-
2012 as poverty rates increased, the incomes of
the bottom 40 percent contracted by 4.2

the poorest the hardest, with those in the 5th percentile seeing their income fall by almost 9 percent
per year. Household income growth in 2013 showed signed of recovery as it was positive for the
bottom 90 percent of households in 2013, particularly the poorest.

The extreme poor in Honduras were better off in 2013 than in 2003, reporting more access to
education and higher per capita income (Table 5). The average daily per capita income of the
bottom 40 percent has increased as family sizes and number of children as a proportion of household
members have fallen. In addition, the investment in human capital of the bottom 40 percent increased
substantially in the last decade. Not only did school enrollment of children 6-14 years old increase by
10 percent, but the average number of years of schooling for the bottom 40 percent also grew by
more than one year to 4.5. Even as these improvements have benefited the bottom 40 percent, this
group still faces significant obstacles: At less than $1.40 per day, their average income remains

Labor market outcomes, however, show mixed signs of improvement for the bottom 40
percent. Unemployment rates fell, particularly for men, while the female participation rate among
the bottom 40 increased (Table 5). Even so, female labor force participation of the bottom 40 percent
remained extremely low (34.8 percent), and significantly lower than the female labor force
participation rate for the bottom 40 in LAC (61 percent). 9 Additionally, several indicators of job
quality fell during this period—including a reduction in the share of workers in manufacturing (both

employment among the bottom 40 percent.

Income inequality in Honduras remains above average in LAC. In spite of having lower inequality
than the LAC region in 2001, by 2013 Honduras’ Gini index was 0.53, higher than LAC’s Gini of 0.52
(Table 5). 10 While the 2001-2013 decade was one of consistently falling inequality for the LAC region,
Honduras experienced notable swings in its level of inequality. Between 2005 and 2009 inequality
fell as the income growth of the poorest significantly surpassed that of the richest. In 2009, the global
financial crisis further helped reduce inequality by reducing the income of the top decile by 13.8
percent, leading to a reduction in the share of income held by the top decile from 44 percent in 2008
to 39 percent in 2009. 11 However, in 2010 and 2011 inequality increased as income recovered for
the top decile but fell for the bottom 90 percent, hitting the poorest particularly hard. Income growth
for the bottom 90 percent in 2013 led to a fall in inequality. Efforts to alleviate income inequality
through more macroeconomic stability, equitable opportunities and progressive fiscal policy would
contribute to reducing poverty and securing political and social stability, which in turn would
facilitate continued growth and help pave the way towards the attainment of Honduras’ development
objectives.

Rising income inequality is a significant concern among the public (Figure 37). According to
opinion polls, almost 47 percent of Hondurans find the current distribution of income to be unjust,
and 34 percent think that it is very unjust. 12 The continued income gap between the top of the
distribution and the majority of the population contributes to the perception of inequality, with the
top half percent of households, those earning more than $50 per day, earning 13 percent of total
income in 2013.

Low levels of intra-generational mobility suggest that the poor have been trapped in poverty.
Only 6 percent of Hondurans left poverty since 2003 and remained non-poor in 2011 (Box 7). The
very high rates of poverty observed in Honduras over the past decade coupled with low
socioeconomic mobility implies that almost half of Hondurans have lived in poverty continuously
over the past decade. Limited credit access, low productivity of land and labor, limited access to
quality education, and the absence of effective risk-mitigation strategies prevent the poor from
accessing new economic opportunities, thereby constraining social mobility.

Moreover, a range of circumstances outside of individuals’ control may limit access to the
basic services needed to break the cycle of chronic poverty. Just over 84 percent of Honduran
children between the ages of 10 and 14 were enrolled in school in 2011, while only 37percent of
children had access to running water in the home. The Human Opportunity Index (HOI) examines the
correlation between household circumstances and access to services, thus capturing the degree of
inequality of access to services deemed important for human capital development.13 Lack of access
to basic services in Honduras is largely correlated with living in rural areas, parental education, and
family per capita income. Access to schooling (as measured by enrollment rates of 10-14-year-olds
and on-time completion of the 6th grade) and cellphones are the most equitably distributed services,
while access to sanitation and running water are the most uneven. Honduras has both higher levels
of inequality in access and lower overall coverage rates compared to other countries in LAC. 14 This
unequal access directly feeds into continued income inequality as these children grow up and enter
the labor market.




13 See World Bank (2014b) for further details on the HOI concepts and methodology. Household circumstances
included in this analysis are rural/urban status, gender (both of the child and the head of household), parental
education, family per capita income, number of siblings, and the presence of both parents in the home.

                    Who is moving in and out of poverty?
                    Tracking intra-generational income mobility in Honduras
 Intra-generational income mobility measures change in the income levels of the same people over time.
 Measures of poverty taken at one point in time, or even multiple points in time provide little information on intra-
 generational mobility. Honduras does not collect the panel data required to follow individuals over time.
 However, a methodology that simulates panel data was applied to household surveys in Honduras for 2003, 2007,
 and 2011 to look at movements into and out of poverty using the international poverty line of US$4 per capita
 per day. 15

 The possibility of exiting poverty in Honduras is very low. According to estimates, only six percent of the
 population has been able to move out of poverty since 2003 - that is, only 6 percent exited poverty in 2007 and
 were still out of poverty as of 2011. Households that managed to escape poverty saw income growth of almost
 50 percent over the period. In contrast, chronically poor households, those who remained poor across all three
 surveys, saw income growth of over 30 percent between 2003 and 2011, growth insufficient to move them out
 of poverty. Chronically poor households in rural areas saw stronger income growth (around 40 percent) than
 those in urban areas (around 20 percent). This is corroborated by sharper falls in the poverty gap indicator for the
 rural population than for the urban population (25 percent versus 18 percent reduction) between 2003 and 2011,
 indicating that the poor in rural areas, while still poorer than those in urban areas, saw their incomes rise faster. 16

 Mobility out of poverty is correlated with higher levels of education and with living in urban areas. For both
 individuals and households, rural residence is associated with much greater levels of chronic poverty (65
 compared to 31 percent). Meanwhile rates of extreme poverty were particularly high among those working in
 agriculture. Perhaps owing to the importance of remittances and family migration strategies in which men are
 more likely to emigrate, female-headed households in Honduras have lower chronic poverty rates and saw greater
 upward income mobility than male-headed households, in contrast to most LAC countries.

What Drives Poverty Reduction in Honduras?

Economic Growth and Employment

Up until 2012, household income growth, rather than changes in the income distribution, had
been the key drivers of poverty trends; however, evidence suggests that changes in income
distribution played a dominant role in the poverty reduction seen in 2013 (Figure 40). The
growth elasticity of poverty measures the percentage change in the poverty rates associated with
each percentage change in economic Figure 40: Income growth was the major driver of
growth. In Honduras, a 1 percent increase poverty fluctuations between 2003 and 2013
in GDP growth was associated with a 0.39 (Contribution of income growth, income distribution
percent reduction in the poverty rate, well and prices to reduction of official poverty, %)
below the 2 percent estimated average
elasticity for LAC as a whole. 17
Nevertheless, economic growth via
household income growth had a significant
impact on poverty over the 2003-2012
period,    but    these     changes    were
undermined by the small changes in income
distribution and the opposite effect of the
price level. A decomposition analysis can
shed light on the relative contribution of
income growth, changes in the prices and
income distribution to poverty rates. Gains
in overall official poverty reduction that
occurred in Honduras before the crisis
(2003-2008) were mainly due to income
growth and shifts in the distribution of Source: World Bank staff estimates based on EPHPM.
incomes but these gains were mitigated by
higher prices. This situation reversed during the 2008-2012 period, where both weaker economic
growth and a worsening distribution of income led to increases in poverty. Practically the entirety of
poverty reduction seen in 2013 is attributable to improvements in the income distribution.

Changes in poverty rates are particularly sensitive to changes in labor income and remittance
income (Figure 41). Falls in the labor income of men has been a consistent driver of poverty and
extreme poverty increases throughout the decade, contributing between 3 and 4 percentage points
to poverty increases between 2003-08 and 2008-2012 respectively. During 2003-08, when growth
rates were high, increases in the employment of women reduced poverty by 2.4 percentage points
and extreme poverty by 2.5 percentage points. Similarly, remittances contributed to poverty
reduction during this period; however, during 2008-2012, when remittances fell as a result of a weak
US labor market, the reduction in remittance income was the second primary driver of the observed
rise in poverty rates, being associated with a poverty increase of two percentage points and an
increase of 2.3 percentage points in extreme poverty.

composition of households, receipt of public transfers and other sources of non-labor income.

Low and stagnating levels of labor productivity help explain Honduras’ modest progress in
reducing poverty (Figure 41). Perhaps reflecting a shortage of technological growth in the
agricultural sector in Honduras, agricultural workers, accounting for 61 percent of the extreme poor
in 2013, are the least productive in the economy, and have realized only very small gains in labor
productivity in recent years. While workers in the manufacturing and services sectors are more
productive and have seen larger gains, their productivity levels remain well below the LAC averages
for all sectors. Low and stagnant labor productivity implies that the poor increase their labor income
mainly through increased labor hours rather than through wage growth.

Economic growth has helped create new jobs in Honduras, but these jobs are in low
productivity sectors such as agriculture and commerce. Between 2003 and 2013, employment
grew at an annual rate of 5.1 percent, outpacing population growth and rising faster than in other
Central American economies such as El Salvador (1.7 percent). However the majority of new jobs
created between 2003 and 2013 were in low-productivity sectors such as agriculture, which
accounted for one in every three new jobs created over the period, and informal commerce, which
accounted for a fifth of all new jobs. Only one fifth of workers in Honduras are employed in the formal
sector, which tends to be more productive and have higher wages than the informal sector.

High minimum wage legislation fails to cover many of the poorest and may also discourage
firms from creating more jobs, particularly in the formal sector. Minimum wages in Honduras
are higher than in all of its neighboring countries, including Panama, an upper-middle-income
country. 18 Though it is not well-enforced, even among formal-sector workers, Honduras’ high
minimum wage presents potential challenges to Honduras’ ability to be competitive internationally.
Moreover, due to the prevalence of the informal sector, the minimum wage does not provide an
effective wage floor for workers, especially the low-skilled. The combined impact of these high

increasing income inequality by increasing the gap in earnings between formal and informal workers.

Remittances and Social Programs

Since 2000, immigration from Honduras has grown substantially, resulting in increased
inflows of remittances (Figure 44). There were over half a million Honduran-born immigrants
living in the U.S. in 2013, constituting over 83 percent of Honduran international migration. 19 This is
relatively recent migration, growing at an annualized rate of 5.2 percent per year between 2000 and
2012 and with over 25 percent immigrating since 2006. It is also mostly undocumented, with
estimates ranging from 60 to 77 percent, implying significant limitations on earnings potential. Even
so, remittances skyrocketed during the pre-crisis period, rising from less than US$1 billion in 2000
to US$3.2 billion in 2013, the equivalent of 17 percent of GDP. Studies in other countries suggest that,
while the receipt of remittances is often associated with positive outcomes, such as increased school
attendance, remittances can also lead to decreases in labor supply and “Dutch disease” resulting in
real exchange rate appreciation. 20 It is important to closely study the impact of Honduras’ significant
migration outflow and remittance inflow on both economic and social outcomes.

significant effect on poverty rates in States has grown significantly between 2000 and

2003-2008 period shows that remittances (Immigrants in the US, 2000, 2006 and 2012)
were second only to share of household
members employed in contributing to falling
poverty rates, while their reduction was one
of the lead drivers of the increase in poverty
between 2008 and 2012. Beyond their direct
contribution to household incomes, rising
remittance levels also supported domestic
economic growth by stimulating consumer
demand. However, remittance inflows are
vulnerable to shocks in foreign labor
markets, and the sharp decline in
remittances following the global financial
crisis contributed to rising poverty rates. As
noted in Part I of this report, during the Source: World Bank estimates based on Migration Policy

global financial crisis remittance inflows fell
sharply as labor market conditions deteriorated in the host countries for Honduran migrants,
especially the United States. Just as increasing remittances had supported poverty reduction in the
pre-crisis period, falling remittances were a key contributor to rising poverty rates in the years
following the crisis (Figure 41).

government is able to build on recent reforms to improve targeting. The conditional cash
transfer program Bono Vida Mejor (formerly Bono 10,000), launched in 2010, provides resources to
poor families with children to incentivize child health monitoring (for 0-5 year olds) and school
attendance (primary level). Bono Vida Mejor has expanded quickly to provide benefits to around 23
percent of the population, with total program spending equal to 0.6 percent of GDP (5). Extreme
poverty among beneficiaries of Bono Vida Mejor has fallen by 3 percentage points since 2010, while
per capita consumption has increased by 7 percent, during a time when poverty rates have been
rising nationwide. 22 Beyond its direct impacts on poverty, the program has helped to boost primary
school enrollment by 2.8 percent and visits to health centers for children under three by 2.6 percent.
While these effects have been positive, expanding the program while maintaining fiscal sustainability
will require measures to more precisely focus its support. In addition, reforming less efficient subsidy
programs could help to free up resources and expand the government’s limited fiscal space.


Conclusion

Poverty trends in Honduras will continue to depend on economic prospects, including
macroeconomic stability, employment dynamics, and developments among its major trade
partners and remittance sources. The reduction in poverty rates achieved in the mid-2000s
underscores the critical role of economy-wide growth and highlights the importance of a sound
macroeconomic environment for alleviating inequality and promoting shared prosperity. The
poverty increases following the 2009 crisis, and in part associated with a fall in remittance income,
show that poor Hondurans are exceptionally vulnerable to economic shocks in both foreign and
domestic markets. This vulnerability to shocks is exacerbated by limited access to quality
employment and low and stagnating levels of labor productivity, which constrain the growth of real
income.

Geographic disparity in poverty and access to basic goods and services remains significant.
Poverty rates are significantly higher in rural areas. About 65 percent of the rural households live in
chronic poverty, a rate more than double that seen in the urban sector. In recent years most new jobs
were created in low-productivity sectors such as agriculture, where the poor are concentrated, but
with no commensurate rise in productivity. This remains a critical barrier to poverty alleviation in
rural areas, and raising labor productivity in key sectors could have a significant impact on the
incomes of the poor.

Honduras made modest progress in promoting shared prosperity before the global financial
crisis. Income growth among those in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution exceeded
overall income growth between 2003 and 2008. However, between 2008 and 2012, the bottom 40
percent experienced a bigger decrease in their income than the average Honduran. As a result,
poverty increased and the Honduran middle class contracted.

Efforts to enhance the scope and targeting of government social assistance programs could
help to reduce rates of extreme poverty by directly boosting the incomes of the poor. The
introduction of the Bono Vida Mejor conditional cash transfer program has had a tangible impact on
extreme poverty reduction during a period in which nationwide poverty increased. Improved
targeting could help to further alleviate poverty and expand program coverage. The successful

implementation of the government’s fiscal consolidation agenda would free additional resources to
support increased cash transfers, as would the reform of relatively inefficient subsidy schemes.

The success of the government’s renewed efforts to alleviate poverty will hinge on its ability
to maintain its commitment to the fiscal reform agenda. While some elements of the
macroeconomic environment are beyond the control of policymakers, in the past decade, a lack of
fiscal discipline persistently undermined macroeconomic stability in Honduras, leaving the country
highly vulnerable to shocks. This was illustrated by its experience during the global financial crisis,
when an unsustainable fiscal stance left the government ill prepared to combat the effects of a
deteriorating external environment on income levels and poverty rates. Furthermore, efforts to
accelerate human capital formation, promote productivity gains and support expanded social
protection programs would help to improve the distributional equity of the returns to growth,
ensuring that it the poorest segments of the population are able to fully participate in, and benefit
from, the continued development of the Honduran economy.
