EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



Tunisia today represents a paradox: despite political progress since its 2011 revolution, wide
economic and social disparities persist, threatening stability. The events of 2011 revealed what
had been festering for years: growing inequity. Four years and four interim governments later,
a new government has been formed as of 2015, charged with developing the country’s first mid-
term, five-year development plan since 2010. However, the challenges facing Tunisia remain
formidable. On the one hand, Tunisia has generally shielded itself from the political risks and
deep civil strife witnessed in other “Arab Spring” countries such as Libya, Yemen, Syria, and to an
extent, Egypt. However, ongoing, unpredictable security threats continue to exist in Tunisia,
exacerbated by substantial regional spillovers. Existing social and economic exclusion among
lower- and middle-income households remains an impediment to stabilizing these threats. In
the absence of bold measures, Tunisia’s short-term economic outlook remains particularly dim,
with real GDP growth estimated at approximately 1 percent for 2015.1 While Tunisia has several
social protection and labor programs in place, its ability to respond to increasing social needs is
compromised by inefficiency, fragmentation, and inequity.

Against this backdrop, the objective of this note is to evaluate the e ffectiveness of Tunisia’s
main social protection and labor programs and identify options for reform through a systems-
based approach. The note is based on a review of recent evidence on the efficiency and equity
of key programs. Importantly, it contributes new analysis in three main areas of systems building:
(i) financing and sustainability, (ii) institutions and governance, and (iii) service delivery. The
note argues that without significantly improving institutional coordination on financing and
delivery, Tunisia’s social protection and labor system will be ill equipped to strengthen economic
and social inclusion.


Labor, Skills, and Social Insurance

Persistent unemployment has exacerbated poor social conditions for large swathes of
Tunisians, most notably in its western and southern hinterlands. Although unemployment
declined from 18.9 percent in 2011 to 15 percent as of late 2014, the decrease is mainly due to
continuing increases in public sector recruitment. Poverty was estimated at 15.5 percent as of
2010, ranging from 9.1 percent in the Greater Tunis area to 32.3 percent in the center-west
region of Tunisia2.

While long-standing investment barriers have constrained private sector-led job growth in
Tunisia, supply-side factors have also played a role. Key factors include poor implementation of
labor insertion programs and the lack of practical job skills among low- and high-skilled
populations. Structural constraints on the demand and supply sides have particularly affected
the bottom 40 percent of income distribution.3 On the demand side, a lack of targeted, sectoral
policies to improve productivity and job creation in key value chains are chief barriers. On the
supply side, constraints include the prevalence of skills mismatches, inefficient intermediation,
rigid labor market regulations, and the wide disparity between public sector and private sector
employment benefits. Tunisia’s private sector also faces a relatively high tax wedge, with the
pension system facing a growing, unsustainable deficit. At the same time, the informal sector
remains large, with many workers poorly protected from risks and shocks.

However, renewed social dialogue on pensions and emerging evidence from recent pilot
employment programs offer alternative options to support the most vulnerable. New public-
private partnership implementation arrangements at the local level can boost job placement for
the most vulnerable and semi-skilled.4 Analytic tools developed for the Tunisian context to assess
the impact of alternative pension and unemployment benefit reforms on the labor market could
be used to pave the way for improving the quality of jobs.

Overall, key labor market and social insurance challenges facing Tunisia include:

       Lagging job creation in the private sector and persistent informality: Excessive
        investment climate barriers, a lack of targeted job strategies, and a high tax wedge
        impinge on the creation of sustainable, inclusive jobs. Among the working population,
        nearly 30-45 percent of the employed labor force either do not have contracts or do not
        contribute to social security. Exacerbating this informality is the poor access to finance at
        the household level, where nearly two-thirds of Tunisian adults lack bank accounts or
        have partial access to formal financial services.

       Inadequate skills among the unemployed: While unemployment has largely fallen on
        youth, women, and university graduates, the vast majority (67 percent) of the
        unemployed are low skilled and lack university degrees. There is also a disconnect
        between skills provided by the educational and vocational training system on one hand
        and the demands of a rapidly evolving private sector on the other. Tunisia performs
        relatively poorly in relation to comparable middle-income countries on educational
        outcomes as measured by the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study
        (TIMSS( and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), and the data

       from the most recent Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) cites the relevance of skills
       among the key barriers to hiring in Tunisia.

      Insufficiently targeted active labor market programs and lagging on-the-job experience
       in critical sectors: Active labor market programs (ALMPs) in Tunisia have not sufficiently
       boosted job placement even in sectors that have created jobs, resulting in a placement
       rate of just 20 percent on average. ALMPs face implementation capacity constraints in
       the public sector, poor governance in terms of monitoring and accountability of service
       providers, and a lack of programs catering to low- and semi-skilled workers. Public
       employment services often lack sufficient job counseling and placement matching for job
       openings that exist, which has contributed to a delayed school-to-work transition.

      Impinging deficits facing pensions and low social insurance coverage: The public and
       private pension funds are fragmented in terms of administration, identification, and
       policies. Together these funds currently face significant deficits that are expected to
       reach at least 2 percent of GDP by 2018, threatening benefits and coverage rates. Only
       37 percent of the population contributes to pensions, half of the population is covered by
       health insurance, and no unemployment benefits exist for workers who lose their jobs.
       The social dialogue process in Tunisia, launched in 2013 to address pensions and
       unemployment insurance options, has stalled due to political economy challenges and a
       lack of a common vision among social partners comprising the government, labor, and
       trade unions.


Resilience, Risks, and Productive Social Safety Nets

While poverty has been steadily decreasing in Tunisia, large pockets of vulnerability exist that
can be better tackled through more productive social safety net programs. Key priorities
include improving identification systems, targeting of universal price subsidies and the existing
national cash transfer and health care programs, as well as reforming the design and delivery of
productive mechanisms. The latter include enhancing the role of public-private partnerships for
productive social safety net (SSN) programs, notably ALMPs for low-skilled, low-income
households in viable sectors and a restructuring of public works programs to better respond to
Tunisia’s current demographics and aspirations. To address lagging social indicators, the role of
social safety nets could also be adapted to incentivize the poor to invest in human capital, namely
nutrition, education, and health, particularly in Tunisia’s western and southern regions.

Overall, key social safety net challenges facing Tunisia today include:

      Inefficient targeting and sustainability of social safety nets: Tunisia’s existing cash
       transfer and health card programs account for an estimated 0.4 percent of GDP, already
       reaching levels spent by countries such as Brazil, but with far less accurate targeting of
       the poor. Only 12 percent of Tunisia's poor (based on a threshold of US$2 per day) benefit



                                                xi
        from the national cash transfer program for needy families.5 Among those receiving
        benefits, which account for nearly 23 percent of all Tunisians, only 40 percent are in the
        lowest income quintile representing the poor (considered using a threshold of
        approximately US$2 per day).

       A lack of graduation mechanisms: Limited mechanisms exist among current social safety
        net programs for enhancing access to work, training, or basic social services for the poor
        and vulnerable who are out of school. Recertification and verification procedures are not
        clearly defined, and exit strategies for various categories of beneficiaries and their
        dependents are unclear.

       Inequity among universal price subsidies and hampered fiscal space for social
        protection, labor, and other productive investments: Universal price subsidies represent
        a tremendous burden, with fuel subsidies accounting for approximately 5 percent of GDP
        alone (as of 2013, which has since fluctuated due to global oil prices). The effects on
        productivity and household welfare vary by type of energy product, but maintaining the
        current system siphons off much-needed resources to boost private sector-led job growth
        and reinforce the sustainability of social protection systems.


Building Systems, not Programs: Policy Recommendations for the Short to Long Term

Key recommendations comprise a gradual, systems-building framework over the short to long
term (Figure ES-1). Reforms fall into three types, namely (i) enhancing implementation and
delivery platforms, (ii) strengthening institutional capacity and governance; and (iii) improving
financial sustainability.

Over the short term, enhancing implementation and delivery platforms can pave the way for
broader coordination. Understanding how benefits are delivered, distributed, duplicated, or
entirely omitted across levels of vulnerability is critical to consolidating the system as a whole.
Unemployment has largely fallen on youth and women among the bottom 40-60 percent by
income, with the vast majority (67 percent) of the unemployed being low-skilled populations in
underserved regions. As of 2013, nearly 30-45 percent of the employed labor force either do not
have contracts or do not contribute to social security, particularly among the poorest 40 percent.
Finally, among the poorest 20 percent, only 12 percent of Tunisian's benefit from the national
cash transfer program.

Enhancing delivery platforms can be achieved by:

   Developing public-private implementation systems for skills development and income
    generation mechanisms in key sectors with high employment potential for out-of-school,
    low-skilled, vulnerable populations, as part of a private sector-led jobs strategy;
   Introducing transparent targeting and monitoring systems for existing social safety net and
    active labor market programs;
   Developing platforms for digital payment mechanisms to replace postal transfers and
    enhance financial literacy among households; and
   Strengthening coordination of and promoting access to essential public services (notably
    nutrition, education, health, and water in Tunisia’s lagging regions) for social safety net
    programs.

Over the medium term, strengthening institutional capacity and governance would help lay the
foundation for aligning social inclusion and job growth. ALMPs, pensions, and social safety nets
as currently designed and implemented are not reaching vulnerable groups in part due to
institutional fragmentation in terms of identification and eligibility. Financial inclusion and access
to social protection services remains weak, most notably in lagging regions where the delivery of
services is hampered by inadequate investments in skilled human resources and equipment.
ALMPs are also not adequately capturing and targeting firms’ skills needs in key sectors and
regions. In 2013, Tunisia launched the creation of a unique identification system and introduced
interoperability between information systems for key social protection and labor programs.

Stronger institutional capacity and governance within the system in Tunisia can be attained by:

   Rolling out unified social registry information, targeting, and unique identification systems;
   Consolidating pension administration (CNSS and CNRPS) as well as health insurance
    mechanisms (CNAM and AMG); and
   Strengthening the social dialogue policy framework and evidence base for developing public-
    private partnerships for ALMPs, reform labor contracts, and redefining wage-setting
    mechanisms that more actively promote productivity.

Over the long term, although improving the financial sustainability of the overall system may
take time, building the evidence base and consensus can be achieved in the meantime. A high
tax wedge and pension deficits impinge on the quality of jobs and protection from shocks, and
consumption subsidies crowd out spending on other vital investments that could spur revenue
generation. Pressures on fiscal space could be supported in the medium to long term by
redirecting savings from reforming inefficient consumption subsidies and in the long term
through comprehensive pension reform. Savings could also be used to enhance mechanisms that
promote access to services and coverage of social safety nets.




                                                 xiii
Tunisia can therefore improve financial sustainability of its system by:

    Developing supplemental resource generation models and greater portability for pension
     benefits (CNSS and CNRPS) that explicitly tie benefits to contributions and identify subsidized
     pension benefits;
    Aligning investment code and labor regulations with targeted schemes for unemployment
     benefits to improve the quality of jobs among the vulnerable self-employed and small and
     medium enterprises (SMEs) in lagging regions; and
    Reinvesting universal subsidies into public or private investments that stimulate job growth
     and improve the effectiveness of targeted social protection programs.

Looking ahead, Tunisia’s forthcoming National Development Plan for 2016-2021 provides an
important platform for financing a unified social protection and labor reform agenda. Overall,
consolidation in Tunisia entails enhancing social protection and labor delivery systems over the
short term and realigning policies on benefits, eligibility, and financing schemes over the medium
to long term. Ultimately, modernizing its system will help Tunisia better cope with new shocks
and, importantly, reap the social benefits of its hard-fought political transition.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION: FROM PROGRAMS TO SYSTEMS FOR SOCIAL PROTECTION
AND LABOR POLICY IN TUNISIA




Tunisia’s historically modest, yet steady, social and economic trajectory now faces deep
challenges in terms of persistent unemployment and widening regional disparities. The
immediate challenge for Tunisia is to ensure economic and social stability in a situation where
the short-term economic outlook remains uncertain. The need to bridge economic and social
policies is ever-present as Tunisia struggles to reset its growth path and ensure that the most
vulnerable benefit. Despite advancing politically with a new constitution and elections since
2011, economic progress has lagged.

Economic challenges have worsened over the course of 2015 with outbreaks of violent attacks,
further weakening the economic and social outlook over the medium term. Real gross domestic
product (GDP) growth stood at only 2.3 percent as of end-2014 and was expected to be similar,
at 2.6 percent, in 2015 given the lag in investment and leveling off of consumption,6,7 but has
likely deteriorated to approximately 1 percent owing to violent attacks along the coast during
June 2015. The fiscal deficit is estimated to be 4.8 percent of GDP as of end 2014, down from
6.2 percent in 2013. The decrease is largely due to a marginal reduction in energy subsidy
spending from 7.8 percent in 2013 to 7.2 percent in 2014.

Although unemployment declined somewhat from 18.9 percent in 2011 to 15 percent as of late
2014, the decrease has mainly been due to continuing increases in public sector recruitment,
which is unsustainable going forward. As such, the wage bill has increased from 12.5 percent of
GDP in 2013 to 12.7 in 2014, further hampering sustainability. In addition, unemployment
remains well above the pre-revolution rate of 13 percent, and broad regional disparities in
unemployment persist. Unemployment reached as high as 30 percent in poorer regions such as
Gafsa and Kasserine in late 2014. Poverty was estimated at 15.5 percent in 2010, but ranges
widely from 9.1 percent in the Greater Tunis area to 32.3 percent in the center-west region of
Tunisia.8

Tunisia’s challenges call for a development plan built on a new approach to tackling challenges
through a well-coordinated, consolidated social protection and labor system.

Objectives

Against this backdrop, the objective of this note is to evaluate the effectiveness of Tunisia’s
main social protection and labor programs and identify options for reform through a systems-
based approach. The note is based on a review of recent evidence on the efficiency and equity
of key programs. Importantly, it contributes new analysis in three main areas of systems building:
(i) financing and sustainability, (ii) institutions and governance, and (iii) service delivery. The
note argues that without significantly improving institutional coordination on financing and
delivery, Tunisia’s social protection and labor system will be ill equipped to strengthen economic
and social inclusion.

The note is structured as follows. Chapter 1 assesses key institutional and expenditure trends;
Chapter 2 presents the labor market context, drawing on jobs diagnostics;9 Chapter 3 outlines
key social insurance trends in terms of pensions and health and unemployment insurance;
Chapter 4 discusses social safety nets and consumption price subsidies in terms of welfare
impacts; and finally, Chapter 5 summarizes key challenges facing the system as a whole and
describes key reforms needed over the short to long term from a systems-building perspective.

The framework for the assessment is based on promoting equity through jobs and inclusive
social policies (Figure 1). The World Development Reports for 2011 and 2013 highlight the role
of these policies within the context of fragile, political transition. In addition, the World Bank
Social Protection and Labor Strategy emphasizes that well-coordinated social protection and
labor systems are central to this objective and contribute to realizing three main policy aims:10 (i)
strengthening opportunity for all (such as through human capital and productive employment);
(ii) strengthening equity (particularly in mitigating chronic poverty); and (iii) building resilience
for households (in terms of protecting against unforeseen risks and shocks). In the case of
Tunisia, several recent evaluations have taken stock of the broader country context and
economic and social programs, demonstrating that much of the challenges to its social protection
and labor programs remain today.11 This paper adopts a new framework that calls for
emphasizing that single policies alone will likely fail to realize their full gains without fully
leveraging the financing, targeting, and service delivery of other programs.

Social Protection and Labor Institutions and Expenditure

Tunisia’s main social protection and labor programs include active labor market programs
(ALMPs), social insurance, and social assistance. Tunisia spent approximately 6.4 percent of
GDP on social protection and labor programs during the 2013-2015 period (Figure 2). However,
weaknesses in governance, coverage, and sustainability threaten the accelerating shared
prosperity and poverty reduction noted, particularly in lagging regions. The level of public social
expenditure in Tunisia is comparable to that of other middle-income countries such as Mexico
and Chile, but the mix and effectiveness of its programs differ widely (Figure 3). Public
expenditure on social sectors (excluding subsidy transfers) amounts to almost 19 percent of GDP.
By way of comparison, public social expenditures amounted to an average of 28 percent of GDP
among middle- and high-income countries in 2013, although pension expenditure makes up a
larger share of this spending in high-income countries than in middle-income countries.

The political economy context of social protection and labor in Tunisia has contributed to
fragmented policies. Today, social protection and labor policies and programs in Tunisia are
fragmented and often at odds; thus, better alignment will help improve growth and inclusion
(Figure 4). These policies and programs are managed by a myriad of agencies and ministries,
often with conflicting eligibility criteria and lacking sufficient coverage because of lags in
information on beneficiaries and expenditures. Given the close linkages between labor
regulations, active labor market programs, social insurance, social safety nets, and subsidies,
there is a need to consolidate Tunisia’s social protection system for greater efficiency and
effectiveness.


A New Social Contract

Since 2012, Tunisia has put in place measures that pave the way for reforming social protection
and labor policies to more effectively reach the poor and promote labor insertion. In May 2012,
the government launched a social dialogue process that reached a significant milestone in
January 2013 with the signing of a new “Social Contract.” The Social Contract agreement lays out
critical areas of reform for several key themes, including social protection and labor reform as
well as economic development in lagging regions.

A draft law was also prepared in 2014 for the creation of a new tripartite national social
dialogue council, which can help alleviate some of the political economy challenges. The
council, with a rotating presidency, would have tripartite representation by the government
(coordinated by the Ministry of Social Affairs), labor unions (represented by Union Generale des
Travailleurs Tunisiens (UGTT) and other bodies), and the private sector (represented by Union
Tunisienne de l'Industrie, du Commerce et de l'Artisanat (UTICA) and other bodies).

Going forward, Tunisia will need to develop a broader social protection and labor policy strategy
that improves the efficiency and equity of these programs, which is the focus of the remainder
of this note.

CHAPTER 2        ACTIVATING LABOR MARKETS STRATEGICALLY



Despite earlier trends in growth, broad social disparities in employment persist, with a need to
revitalize labor markets in Tunisia. For decades Tunisia was heralded as an economic engine;
however, Tunisia’s growth masked broad disparities, crony wealth-generation, and deeply rooted
social exclusion. However, annual job growth stood at only 2.5 percent, catering mainly to higher-
skilled, urban groups and excluding youth, women, and vulnerable populations in lagging regions.
A comprehensive jobs analysis highlights current and future trends in detail (Box 1). This chapter
outlines key supply- and demand-side trends, with particular emphasis given to the labor force
and supply-side challenges.


                                      Box 1 Toward a Jobs Strategy in Tunisia
  A recent analysis3 of jobs challenges in Tunisia shows that removing the macroeconomic and fiscal constraints
  alone will likely not be enough to address Tunisia’s job challenge, particularly among the bottom 40 percent of
  the population. Specifically:
       Growth, jobs, and productivity: Assuming that labor force participation rates remain at current levels,
           demographics alone will push around 47,000 new entrants into the labor market on average per year.
           Tunisia’s lagging economy has been creating only around 36,400 jobs per year , largely through micro-
           firms and in low-productivity activities. Under an optimistic scenario assuming that the economy grows
           at only 4 percent per year, the unemployment rate would decline by only one percentage point over
           the next 5 years.
       Access to jobs: Among workers living in households in the poorest 10 percent, the average
         unemployment rate is more than 30 percent, but below 15 percent among the richest 10 percent. In
         the poorest households, less than 20 percent of workers are in formal wage employment in the private
         or public sectors (depending heavily on agricultural and commercial self-employment), compared to 75
         percent among the richest.
       Investments and jobs: Optimization of the distribution and quality of jobs will not automatically result
         from increased investment alone. Simulations show that a 4 percentage points’ increase in the
         investment rate may create 76000 jobs (net). However, in the absence of reforms to guide the allocation
         of investments, most jobs would be created in sectors with low value added per worker, notably in
         construction, trade, non-metal industries, and transportation services.
       Toward an integrated jobs strategy: The starting point of a jobs strategy for Tunisia is to define specific
         social objectives in terms of jobs to inform policies and programs at three levels: (i) facilitating the
         creation of new jobs through private sector investments , taking into account regional and population
         disparities in terms of labor market outcomes; (ii) upgrading production technologies and increasing
         the productivity of jobs in economic activities that are already underway, with a focus on small-scale or
         subsistence entrepreneurs in lagging regions; and (iii) connecting individuals to jobs by facilitating labor
         market transitions, from inactivity or unemployment into jobs or from low- to high-productivity jobs.

Employment Trends

Since the 2011 revolution, labor market outcomes in Tunisia have worsened, particularly in
interior regions. After jumping from 13 percent in 2010 to 18.9 percent in 2011, unemployment
gradually decreased to 15.2 percent in 2014 (Figure 5). While some of the decrease was due to
the initial recovery of selected labor-intensive sectors, the majority has been due to successive
waves of public sector recruitment.12 Unemployment is highest in the western and southern
governorates, headed by the southern governorates of Tataouine (37 percent) and Tozeur (25
percent) and the central governorates of Sidi Bouzid and Kasserine (24 and 23 percent,
respectively) (Figure 6). In absolute terms, Tunis has the highest number of unemployed persons
at 12 percent of the national total, of which 83 percent are low skilled workers (Figures 7 and 8).

Unemployment is more pronounced among women, youth, and low-income groups, although
the majority has only completed secondary education. Unemployment rates are highest among
youth (35.7 percent), women (21.5 percent), and university graduates (31.9 percent, with women
at 41.9 percent). Despite recent improvements, Tunisia’s labor force participation rate remains
low (51.7 percent), particularly among women (28.2 percent).13 In absolute terms, the majority
of the unemployed remain low-skilled workers (67 percent), although in selected governorates
the trend is reversed, such as Kibili and Monastir where only one third of the unemployed are
low skilled. This trend may be explained by migration patterns, the dominance of agriculture (in
Kibili) and low-value added services (in Monastir), or other factors related to the type of
investments made in these regions. Evidence also suggests that social norms and the role

          Note: low-skilled: secondary education or below; high-skilled: university education or above.

The incomplete school-to-work transition and poor labor mobility are associated with a low
quality of education and a skills mismatch. Tunisia performs relatively poorly against
comparable middle-income countries on TIMSS and PISA. In addition, there appears to be some
mismatch between the skills required by the labor market and those acquired by students
through formal schooling. Findings from the most recent Investment Climate Assessment (ICA)
revealed that the workers’ skills and education are the second leading constraint to doing
business in Tunisia, with 39 percent of firms sampled citing this factor as a major barrier, second
only to political instability at 56 percent.15 Skills are generally perceived as a relatively greater
barrier outside of Tunis than in the capital (Figure 9), which is likely associated with the type of
firms, sectoral differences, and the demand for certain skills that also varies by region and type
of skill. It is then no surprise that the rates of underemployment are exceptionally high among
university graduates. Underemployment reaches 30 percent for technicians and 36 percent for
graduates with humanities degrees.

Quality of Jobs

Services account for the majority of employment in Tunisia, with limited employment in
sectors with high-value added. As of 2014, the majority of Tunisians (51 percent) were employed
in the services sector, followed by manufacturing (19 percent) and agriculture and non-
manufacturing industries (15 percent each) (Figure 10). In the services sector, public sector
employment (education, health, and general administration) accounted for almost half of
employment, equivalent to nearly 670,000 civil servants (Figure 11). Between 2007 and 2014,
the public sector witnessed a 17 percent jump in the number of jobs.

During the same period, the mechanical and electrical sector demonstrated the highest rate of
job growth (50 percent job growth), followed by real estate services (37 percent), commerce
(25 percent), mining and energy (24 percent), and construction and chemicals (21 percent each)
(Figure 12). By contrast, important sectors have seen job losses, namely agriculture (11 percent
loss) and unclassified manufacturing industries (10 percent loss). Unclassified general job loss of
61 percent was also witnessed. Other job losses were seen for hotels and restaurants (2 percent
loss) and textiles (nearly 1 percent).

It is worth nothing that the quality of jobs has been low overall, both in terms of informality
and productivity. Up to half of the workforce in Tunisia is informal, leaving workers vulnerable
to shocks. Approximately 30 percent of jobs in the private sector lack social insurance. The
majority of these workers are either in informal wage employment (35 percent) or in self-
employment (30 percent). Overall, 45 percent of the labor force does not have an employment
contract or benefits of any kind,20 translating into high informality. Exacerbating this informality
is the poor access to finance at the household level, where nearly two-thirds of Tunisian adults
lack bank accounts or have partial access to formal financial services.16

Coupled with informality, low productivity is among the most salient features of the Tunisian
labor market. The growth of output per worker was around 2.5 percent on average over the
past decade, below most comparable countries in MENA and emerging economies in the
European Union. It is estimated that the vast majority of the labor force, at 77 percent, is
employed in low-productivity jobs, notably in sectors such as agriculture, textile, diverse
manufacturing, commerce, construction, and public infrastructure. High-productivity service
sectors absorbed only 7.7 percent of total employment.

Lagging job creation in Tunisia stems from a deteriorating investment climate, cronyism, and
relatively high labor costs. At the core of the country’s economic impasse is a protected

regulatory environment resulting in lack of competition and a large bureaucratic burden,
inhibiting labor legislation, a financial sector hampered by governance failures, policies regulating
services that limit competition, and industrial and agricultural policies that introduce distortions
and deepen regional disparities.17 Privileges captured by a few politically connected firms under
the old regime are associated with many of the policy distortions that have weakened private
sector and job growth.18 The tax wedge in Tunisia, at approximately 35 percent, is high relative
to other middle-income countries, encouraging young, small, and low-productivity firms to opt
out of the formal sector.18


Public Sector Employment

The dominance of public sector employment crowds out the pool of workers for the private
sector. Over 90,000 new employees joined the public sector in 2011 and 2012 alone, the majority
of them through the regularization of contract workers, thus doubling annual recruitment
numbers. Along with promotions and salary increases, this recruitment drive led to a 44 percent
increase in the wage bill between 2010 and 2014, which is higher than the 28 percent increase
between 2006 and 2009. Benefits and wages are vastly more generous in the public sector than
in the private sector. For example, on average, a 50 percent higher wage premium exists in the
public sector relative to the private sector for a worker with a secondary education. The average
wage replacement rate for pensioners in the public sector is nearly 90 percent, as compared to
60 percent in the private sector. These premiums help to explain queuing for public sector
employment, especially amongst skilled youth.19


Labor Regulations

The structure of Tunisia’s labor regulations in terms of contracts and wages may create
disincentives for firms to create jobs. While some provisions in the labor code, such as work-
time arrangements, are relatively flexible, other entitlements, such as maternity benefits, are
below internationally accepted International Labor Organization (ILO) standards. No clear
provisions exist for dismissing individual workers for economic or performance reasons, with the
exception of complex tribunal procedures that most employers avoid, and collective dismissal is
restricted by stringent criteria.20 The minimum wage in Tunisia is close to 25 percent of value
added per worker and appears aligned with the country’s average level of labor productivity. The
wage distribution in Tunisia shows that the majority of workers in the private sector earn close
to the minimum wage. Preliminary simulations suggest that, all else held equal, the minimum
wage policy in Tunisia may be exacerbating youth unemployment and informality. Going forward,

economic policy objectives.


Active Labor Market Programs

Active labor market programs (ALMPs) in Tunisia include on-the-job training, skills
development, and wage subsidy programs (Figure 13), complemented by public employment
services (PES). The National Employment Fund (FNE) is the country’s main source of financing
for ALMPs, including wage subsidies and regional development programs that finance public
works, benefiting 405,000 individuals during the period 2011–2014. Programs to promote
insertion into wage employment consist primarily of wage subsidies for on-the-job training, and
benefit a large number of high-skilled individuals (about 114,000 beneficiaries in 2011).21 These
programs have been undergoing reforms since 2013.22 Tunisia also spent about 380 million TND
on labor-intensive public works programs targeting the poorest segments of the population and
reaching approximately 180,000 beneficiaries. A recent assessment of these programs23 shows
that many of public works sites are never completed and, in many cases, wage payments are
given to workers who do not show up for work.

   The fund has been financed from general revenues, proceedings of state privatization operations, and
contributions from private donors as well as from income, payroll, and sales taxes.
22
   Reforms undertaken in 2013 consolidated job insertion programs financed by the National Employment Fund,
from five programs into three programs: two supporting training and wage subsidies, and a first-time employment
program [Programme d’encouragement à l’emploi (PEE)]. As of 2015, implementation remains slow.

The majority of ALMPs implemented by the Agence Nationale de l’Emploi et du Travail
Indépendant (ANETI) are wage subsidy programs that primarily target high-skilled youth. Most
wage subsidy programs provide beneficiaries with a stipend and in-class or on-the-job training,
as well as cover social security contributions. However, these programs are poorly targeted,
fragmented, and duplicative, which hinders their effectiveness and efficiency. To address these
challenges, the Ministry of Employment consolidated and streamlined all wage subsidy programs
into two new ones, to be implemented though results-based PPPs with eligible private providers
and civil society organizations: a “training voucher” (Chèque pour l’amélioration de
l’employabilité) and a “wage voucher” (Chèque d’appui à l’emploi). However, the Ministry of
Employment has faced significant delays in operationalizing these reforms. In fact, to date, the
wage voucher has yet to be launched, while the training voucher is only now currently being
piloted. This is primarily due to the limited capacity of the Ministry of Employment and ANETI
regarding designing and managing the transition to the new consolidated and results-based
system. On average, job insertion rates for Tunisia’s ALMPs were approximately 20 percent in
2011.

PES managed by regional Ministry of Vocational Training and Employment (MVTE) bureaus are
not perceived as being effective even where job opportunities exist, particularly among low-
skilled and low-income groups (Figures 14 and 15). Overall, only 16 percent of PES users report
being satisfied with the quality of services offered, ranging from 11 percent among those with no
education to 22 percent among the high skilled.24 Higher-income job seekers often do not use
these services and rely instead on informal networks, explaining their lack of dissatisfaction with
services. No major differences in satisfaction appear across gender, where only 13 percent of
females and 18 percent of males report being satisfied with services.

Emerging, new approaches to ALMPs shed light on ways to further improve employability.
Recent evidence from a pilot direct employment program in southern Tunisia, where
unemployment rates are nearly double the national average, indicates that skills development is
important for the majority of beneficiaries (Figure 16).25 Beneficiaries that received on-the-job
skills training and work experience most closely overseen by employers were more likely to find
wage employment and/or self-employment following the program. A preliminary assessment
shows that among beneficiaries who found jobs after the program, 65 percent found wage
employment and 35 percent became self-employed (Figure 17).

Overall, emerging ALMP pilot programs offer insights into how to enhance the effectiveness of
ALMPs going forward to catalyze job insertion. Critical success factors include (i) strategic
targeting of ALMPs and direct employment interventions to job-creating sectors; (ii) allowing
flexibility in the design of the programs to meet local needs; (iii) ensuring comprehensive
program monitoring; (iv) supporting beneficiaries with follow-up services through intermediation
with local associations, training centers, municipalities, entrepreneurship services and private
sector networks; and (v) partnering with or contracting out to local civil society and private sector
actors during design and implementation.


Conclusions

For labor outcomes to improve in Tunisia, developing a comprehensive jobs strategy would lay
the foundation for short- and medium-term reforms to promote sustained employment. In
2013, Tunisia launched the preparation of a 2013-2017 National Employment Strategy that was
still not finalized as of 2015. However, a renewed jobs strategy would include measures to
strengthen the supply and demand side jointly and in a targeted way. As part of this, the
modernization of labor policies will help improve the competitiveness of the Tunisian labor force.
In the short-term, strengthening delivery and evaluation of ALMPs for the most vulnerable will
be advantageous. Key medium- to long-term reforms include aligning contracts, wages, dismissal
rules, and public sector employment policies with international standards.

CHAPTER 3       INTEGRATING SOCIAL SECURITY FOR BETTER JOBS



Consolidating Tunisia’s social protection and labor system entails better connecting citizens to
social security benefits throughout the life cycle in a more equitable, sustainable way. Tunisia
currently does not have a national unemployment insurance program or policies to provide
services to workers who lose their jobs in the private sector. With an informality rate of nearly
45 percent, there are wide differences in social benefits between the public and private sector.
Social insurance in Tunisia mainly includes pensions, maternity benefits, disability benefits, and
emergency household loans. Since 2013, Tunisia’s key stakeholders have committed to
revitalizing social dialogue26 needed to implement a new vision for social security. The focus of
this chapter is on assessing options for pensions and health insurance to contribute to this
process, with a discussion of future considerations for unemployment benefits.


Pensions

Social insurance schemes in Tunisia are contributory and include two main schemes for public
and private sector workers. Public sector workers are covered by the Caisse Nationale de
Retraite et de Prévoyance Sociale (CNRPS, or National Pension and Social Contingency Fund),
including civil servants, the military, security forces, contractual workers, local authorities, and
employees of State-owned enterprises. Private sector workers are covered by the Caisse
Nationale de Sécurité Sociale (CNSS, or National Social Security Fund). The pensions system dates
from 1898, when a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system was established only for civil servants. Today,
the system is highly fragmented, spanning different pension schemes for various categories of
workers. The number of contributors as of 2012 stood at approximately 1.5 million for CNSS and
0.7 million for CNRPS.

CNRPS, created in 1985, covers risks associated with old age, invalidity, survivorship, and
sickness for civil servants. Family allowances, maternity and work injuries are fully paid by the
government and State-owned enterprises. The total contribution rate for CNRPS is 15.7 percent,
based on 8.95 percent on the part of the employer (government) and 6.75 percent on the part
of the employee.

CNSS covers most risks, but benefits vary across the eight sub-regimes for different groups of
workers and by fixed and open-ended contracts (which are limited). These regimes include (i)
salaried (non-rural) workers; (ii) salaried rural workers; (iii) improved salaried rural workers; (iv)
non-salaried workers; (v) Tunisian workers abroad; (vi) students; (vii) lower-income earners; and
(viii) writers and artists not covered by any other regime. The administrative boards of these
funds comprise tripartite representation by the State, employers (namely represented by UTICA),

and workers (namely represented by UGTT). The private social insurance sector (insurance
companies and mutual benefit organizations) remains very limited and primarily spans
complementary and optional health insurance. For CNSS, the contribution rate is 12.5 percent,
split between 7.76 percent on the part of the employer and 4.73 percent on the part of the
employee.

Coverage by the mandatory pension systems in Tunisia is one of the highest in the MENA region
but lags behind other comparable economies (Table 1). Only 50 percent of the current labor
force in Tunisia contributes to either of the two main schemes (CNRPS and CNSS as represented
by RSNA, its main scheme). After taking smaller schemes into account, the total coverage rate is
approximately 70 percent of the labor force. Approximately 37 percent of the working age
population (aged 15-64 years) comprises active contributors to pension schemes. In Tunisia, as
in Egypt and Morocco, the statutory retirement age is 60 for both men and women, which is
similar to the retirement age found in most countries in MENA of 60 years for men and 55 years
for women, but lower than the age found in Malta of 65 years for both men and women. Eight
countries in MENA have integrated pension systems, while in seven countries pension schemes
for private sector workers and civil servants are still separated, as is the case in Tunisia.

Among all contributors, more than 70 percent are part of CNRPS or RSNA, and the rest of the
pension programs cover less than 700,000 people. Table 2 below shows key characteristics of
the design and performance of the mandatory pension programs in Tunisia.27 Pension spending
in 2011 already represented 5.1 percent of GDP, revenues represented less than 4 percent, and
reserves, 3 percent.

  Revenues from contributions are estimated from the total number of active contributors multiplied by the
average wage and by the contribution rate of each program. Pension expenditures are the average pension
multiplied by the number of beneficiaries.

Wages and pensions benefits in the public sector are on average 30-50 percent higher than in
the private sector. The current distribution of average wages and average pension benefits by
age and gender for the two pension schemes (CNRPS and CNSS as represented by its main
scheme, RSNA) are shown in Figures 18 and 19. Projected benefits for both categories have been
modeled directly as benefit ratios or relative to the average wage, in the case of the disabled,
and as a ratio of new old age pension, in the case of survivors. Benefit ratios for both the new
disabled and survivors are set to remain constant over time. The average length of service of
new retirees is assumed to be constant during the simulation period. While wages are generally
similar by gender in the public sector, both wages and pensions can be up to 15 percent higher
for men than for women in the private sector, in some cases even more. More analysis is needed
to understand these differences in the future.

By the year 2018, under reasonable assumptions and with no reform, the deficit of both
schemes would represent almost 2 percent of GDP, and reserves in both schemes would be
completely depleted. Figure 20 and Table 3 present the overview and details, respectively, of
financial flows and reserves projected through 2018. CNRPS faces a deficit given that the
combination of its revenues and investment returns do not cover the expenditures. RSNA was
also showing a deficit in 2014, but still has enough reserves to finance expenditures. Unless
reforms take place, by the year 2018 both funds will likely continue to be in need of increased
levels of external financing. However, a reliance on public budget transfers has increasingly
become unsustainable.

Overall, both pension schemes are financially unsustainable as expected income flows are not
enough to cover expected expenditures. At 5.1 percent of GDP, total pension expenditures in
Tunisia (for all schemes of CNRPS and CNSS) are high for the countries’ level of income and its
demographic structure.29 Countries with a similar population structure and coverage rates as
Tunisia spend less than 4 percent of GDP.

Moreover, expenditures have been growing rapidly and there is already an aggregated deficit
of 0.2 percent of GDP deficit in CNRPS and 0.3 percent of GDP in RSNA. These deficits may be
underestimated due to possible underestimation of reported wages by firms, but nonetheless,
the deficit remains large. How this deficit will change over time will depend on, among other
factors, the evolution of the dependency ratios, the growth of wages, and indexation policies. In
the case of the CNSS, the deficit is relatively low and could be managed in the short term more
readily, but nonetheless remains a challenge in the medium to long term. In the case of the
CNRPS, the deficit is expected to increase more rapidly beyond 2018, reaching up to 1.3 percent
of GDP by 2020.

Challenges facing Tunisia’s pension schemes are multifaceted. While the challenge of the
private sector is largely to improve coverage and equity of pensions, the public sector scheme is
primarily faced with unsustainability. First, there is a fundamental misalignment between
contribution rates and benefits paid at various retirement ages for both schemes. As such, the
underlying principle of defined-benefit pension systems financed through a pay-as-you-go
regime no longer hold in the case of Tunisia, unless parametric reforms are implemented soon.
Second, with sluggish economic growth and over-absorption of workers into the public sector,
relying on public transfers to cover deficits makes it even more unsustainable. Finally, the existing
financing system and revenue generation policies of both pension schemes leave them ill
equipped to cope with increasing fiscal pressures. The challenges are exacerbated by the lack of
coordination and fragmented governance between the public and private sectors in terms of
benefit levels, contribution policies, and beneficiary identification.

The choice of reforms to address these challenges will need to be carefully assessed in terms
of impacts and tailored to Tunisia’s social dialogue climate. The climate remains complicated
by widely divergent views and underlying social value judgements on the roles of workers,
employers, and the state in financing. At the same time, there is emerging consensus on the
need for fundamental measures that can be undertaken to improve governance and portability
and to assess the collective impact of potential reforms.

A combination of parametric and structural reforms would help address these challenges
gradually over the short to long term. To avoid exacerbating fiscal challenges, Tunisia may want
to first strengthen the financial sustainability of both CNRPS and CNSS and improve coverage
among workers in the private sector, including vulnerable workers through social pension
schemes. Following these measures, reforms might be undertaken to consolidate the system in
the long term by improving portability and reducing fragmentation between regimes within
CNSS, fixed and open-ended contracts, and the public and private sectors.

As of 2015, Tunisia had already identified potential parametric measures to try to address
sustainability in the public sector, including an increase in the retirement age. Other short-
term measures include rationalizing entry into public sector employment and voluntary early
retirement. Over the mid-term, the reform of certain State-owned enterprises (SOE) might also
entail these types of measures. Over the long term, underlying financing and revenue generation
schemes should be assessed and examined in terms of more explicitly linking financing to


                                                 25
benefits, including policies related to financing through taxation, capitalization, and private
markets.

However, in order to guarantee a longer surplus in the systems, recommended reforms should
include a combination of measures as part of a coherent, short- to long-term reform package
so as to avoid jeopardizing long-term outcomes. For instance, only increasing the retirement
age without decreasing accrual rates will likely render the schemes even more unsustainable.
Given that reform options carry their respective trade-offs, careful evidence-based analysis of a
package of both short- and long-term measures and their net effect as a whole would best inform
future policy decisions.


Health Insurance

Despite sustained health improvements, Tunisia’s health care costs and the impact on workers
and households represent a growing challenge. Costs have been rising and regional disparities
in health have widened.30 Health care in Tunisia is financed through a mix of public and private
sources. Between 1980 and 2013,31 total health expenditure grew by over 100 percent from 3.2
percent to 7.1 percent of GDP. The system has been financed through a mix of sources since
2007, with the following levels in 2013: general governmental revenues (26.0 percent of total
health spending), CNAM (33.3 percent), private insurance (4.4 percent), and household out-of-
pocket payments (36.3 percent). Public spending on health decreased from 2.7 percent of GDP
in 1995 and 1.8 percent in 2013. Private expenditures accounted for 41 percent of total health
expenditures in 2013, approximately 87 percent of which were co-payments at the point of use
and 13 percent of which represented health insurance premiums. This level of out-of-pocket
spending has remained constant since reforms were undertaken to consolidate CNAM in 2007,
despite the need to reduce the burden on households.

To date, only 50 percent of the population is covered by the national health insurance fund,
although an additional 34 percent receive limited health care benefits through a non-
contributory social safety net program, Assistance Medical Gratuite (AMG) (Figure 21). Nearly
11 percent of the population remains uninsured. Health insurance is provided by a public fund,
Caisse Nationale d’Assurance Maladie (CNAM), created in 2007 following the merger of various
schemes. CNAM is financed by mandatory contributions from employees and public/private
employers; the contribution rate is 6.75 percent for employees and nearly 15 percent for
employers. CNAM provides health insurance through social security contributions for 3.3 million
civil and private sector employees and their dependents.

Social safety net beneficiaries receive health insurance cards that cover basic services through
Ministry of Health public providers (hospitals and health centers), managed by the Ministry of
Social Affairs. One program provides basic free services for poor households (AMG-1) and
another provides subsidized services for low-income households (AMG-2). Despite these
programs, beneficiaries often pay for primary care services and pharmaceuticals through out-of-
pocket payments due to long queues, inadequate quality, or a lack of medications in stock,
particularly outside of the capital and main cities. The fragmentation between CNAM, AMG-1,
and AMG-2 further widens regional and income disparities in access.

members using private services in 2011, up 20 percent from a 26 percent utilization rate in 2008

Out-of-pocket spending remains a burden on households, particularly in the private, informal
sector and among AMG beneficiaries. Approximately 12 percent of all households faced
catastrophic health care payments in 2006,34 which is higher than the international
recommended maximum of 5 percent. Household expenditures have risen due to the increasing
preference for private services owing to the poor quality of public services, spending on
pharmaceuticals, and significant co-payments that are incurred even under State-subsidized
schemes.

Provider payment policies have also contributed to increasing health care costs and
contributions on the part of workers, employers, and public transfers. Thirty percent of hospital
expenditure is financed through historically based global budget transfers from the Ministry of
Finance and 70 percent through fee-for-service billing and co-payments through CNAM, while
public primary care is funded directly through governmental revenues. Although CNAM has
agreements with certain private clinics and pharmacies to deliver services, contracting criteria
are based on basic commercial certification rather than on service delivery or provider
performance. Between 2008 and 2010, the government adopted a reform to roll out a basic
system of performance-based budgeting in several sectors including health, known as Gestion du
budget par objectif (GBO). Budgets are to be allocated according to performance indicators for
primary health care, regional hospitals, university hospitals, and functional agencies. As of 2011,
implementation was put on hold and is expected to resume following the establishment of a
permanent government in 2015.

Reducing out-of-pocket payments and fragmentation between CNAM and AMG regimes can
be achieved by strengthening efficiency and incentives within the financing model. In the long
term, merging AMG with CNAM and providing explicit subsidies through per-capita transfers
would broaden the pool among CNAM beneficiaries, reducing risk overall and expanding
coverage for both public and private services contracted by CNAM.


Unemployment Benefits

Alongside pensions and health insurance, the design of unemployment benefits is a key pillar
of social dialogue in Tunisia. Protecting income and access to health care for limited-duration
unemployment spells is needed to shield against shocks and stimulate job growth. While Tunisia
has only had very limited schemes, mainly in the form of severance pay for selected cases, its
2013 Social Contract calls for tripartite dialogue to institute a national scheme in the medium to
long term. Building the evidence base in the short term on potential policy impacts would be a
key input to guiding this dialogue.

Potential reforms for the Tunisian context will need to take into account fiscal impacts, labor
outcomes, and coherence with the level of and eligibility for other benefits, notably pensions,
health insurance, and social safety net programs. Some of these programs currently assist de
facto unemployed citizens either directly or indirectly. Therefore, coordination and identification
will be important. Unemployment insurance, benefits, or services can take on multiple designs,
be portable, be sourced through different contributory, taxation, or individual savings accounts,
other arrangements, or a combination thereof.

Several key factors will need to be evaluated with social dialogue partners in Tunisia.35
Important policy parameters to assess for an unemployment benefits scheme include technical

and social value parameters such as (i) the replacement rate, which defines the unemployment
benefit as a share of the previous wage of the unemployed while insured; (ii) the vesting period,
which defines for how many months an individual needs to contribute to the unemployment
insurance scheme to be eligible for unemployment benefit reception; (iii) the maximum number
of months the unemployed can receive the unemployment benefit; and (iv) societal tendencies
and preferences, including the profile of the unemployed, current coping mechanisms, and
behavioral impacts of various benefits. Unemployment benefits should be assessed in terms of
impacts such as (i) labor shares including the share of unemployed and the informal sector, (ii)
wages, (iii) fiscal impacts, and (iv) the ratio of insurance coverage of the unemployed.
Forthcoming collective work by tripartite actors aims to develop evidence-based options for
reforms.


Conclusions

Pension benefits and health insurance programs in Tunisia generally provide better coverage for
civil servants than for public sector workers. However, existing programs have increasingly
become unsustainable due to limited fiscal space and an inflated wage bill, particularly in the
public sector. At the same time, most public sector jobs are largely limited to larger cities and
more highly skilled workers. The quality of jobs in the private sector remains weak and little
incentive exists to seek formal private sector employment. The lack of a coordinated social
security system has therefore left lower-skilled workers and households in lagging regions
particularly at risk, exacerbating inequity. Building consensus and evidence of potential impacts
of reforms on poverty and social and labor outcomes will help define the contours of these
reforms as part of Tunisia’s social dialogue platform.

CHAPTER 4         INVESTING IN PRODUCTIVE SOCIAL SAFETY NETS



Although Tunisia has had social safety net (SSN) programs in place since the 1980s, its
expenditures are minimal in comparison to universal price subsidies on energy and basic
commodities. These expenditures remain largely inequitable and inefficient, siphoning away
financing that is needed to accelerate growth and strengthen social protection and labor systems
in Tunisia. During 2013-2014, social transfers accounted for approximately 7.3 percent of GDP
in Tunisia, comprising 6.9 percent of universal price subsidies and 0.4 percent of social assistance.
Among subsidies, approximately 1.8 percent of GDP was allocated to subsidies on basic
commodities (including cereals, tomato paste, oils, and paper); 0.4 percent allocated to
transportation; and the remaining 4.7 percent of GDP to energy (primarily electricity, liquid
petroleum gas, diesel, gasoline). Energy subsidies include both explicit subsidies to prices and
implicit subsidies to State-owned enterprises (SOEs) involved in the energy value chain. 36,37 With
energy prices having dropped by mid-2015, public expenditure on total subsidies fell from its
levels of 6.9 percent of GDP in 2014 and 6.5 percent of GDP by end-2015 to approximately 5.1
percent in 2016.38 Nonetheless, the inequity and lack of sustainability of the subsidy system
comprises efforts to reach the most vulnerable through programs that are more productive.


Benefit Incidence of Energy and Food Subsidies

Despite high spending, universal subsidies generally benefit the most well off
disproportionately.39 The distribution of benefits is determined a priori by the consumption of
these products. While food subsidies also benefit the poor, energy subsidies are particularly
inequitable. For electricity, the highest quintile consumes about 29 percent of the total benefits
versus 13 percent among the lowest quintile (Figure 24). For petrol and diesel, the shares of
benefits for the higher-revenue quintile amount to 67 percent for petrol and 59 percent for diesel
respectively. For LPG, 15 percent of the benefits go to the lowest quintile, while 21 percent go
to the highest. Overall, this distribution shows that energy subsidies tend to be pro-rich.

For all energy subsidies, the direct benefit per capita was 94 TND per capita per year on average
in 2013, of which 60 percent consisted of LPG subsidies and 29 percent of electricity subsidies.
For all energy subsidies, the fifth quintile (highest income) benefits from 139 TND in subsidies per
capita per year, versus 62 TND per capita per year among the first quintile (lowest income). All
direct benefits from energy subsidies amount to 162 million TND per year for the 20 percent of
the population with higher incomes, that is to say almost 627,000 households. The 20 percent
of the population with the lowest incomes, namely 400,000 households, consume 118 million
TND of energy subsidies per year.

Impact Assessment of Potential Reforms on Welfare and Growth

The impact of reforming energy subsidies on growth is expected to be positive, largely because
of the positive effect on investment (Table 4). The effect consists of an average annual increase
of 0.12 or 0.21 percent due either to the elimination of subsidies on LPG and petrol or the
elimination of subsidies on all products, respectively. However, this is an estimate to be
considered with caution because it assumes all savings would be reinvested directly into the
economy. It does not take into account the allocation of savings to finance other measures, such
as tax measures or other transfers to help mitigate the effects of higher prices of selected
products on vulnerable households.

Reforming subsidies would create the fiscal space needed to stimulate investment, and
including mitigating measures for households can promote equity. Investment is expected to
increase by 12.5 percent on average over the period under review following a reform of all energy
subsidies. This gain will result from an average decrease of 48 percent of the public deficit. The
increase in investments can be done directly via public investment, or indirectly via a reduction
of the public deficit, which benefits private investment. In addition, the effects are more sensitive
to reforms of diesel and electricity than to those of LPG gas and petrol.

In the absence of mitigation measures, household consumption is expected to decrease
following the lifting of energy subsidies and an increase in prices. The effect of an average of
-1.3 percent is driven by a reform of LPG and petrol subsidies and increases to 3.7 percent if all
subsidies are reformed. Over five years, the effect per year (compared to the previous year)
increases gradually if diesel and electricity are added. The effect varies with a decrease of -2.8
percent during the first year to reach a decrease of -4.6 percent during the fifth year compared

the textile industry, and telecommunication. This decline can in turn cause a rise in consumer
prices. Reducing LPG subsidies may also lead to an increase in the poverty rate by 1.8 percent,
based on a poverty threshold of 1,025 TND per capita (or almost US$2 per capita). For petrol, a
negligible impact is anticipated, due to its relatively limited use.

The savings resulting from the reform of subsidies may be used to finance targeted transfers
to households and sectors. The larger the number of eligible households, the more the use of
these savings for investment or tax measures to strengthen growth is reduced. For purposes of
illustration, removing all subsidies over a period of 12 months would require a total budget of
145 million TND as of 2013 to cover 20 percent of the population with the lowest incomes (Table
5). These transfers can be channeled by adapting Tunisia’s existing social safety net system, which
is discussed in the next section.

Performance of Social Safety Net Programs

Social safety net (SSN) programs in Tunisia currently comprise non-contributory social
assistance programs for poor households through unconditional cash transfers (UCT) and free
health cards (AMG) (Table 6). Benefits are provided through the National Assistance to Needy
Families Program, Program National d’Aide Aux Familles Nécessiteuses (PNAFN), managed by the
Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA). Households received a cash transfer of 100 TND per month in
2013 and 130 TND per month in 2015, accounting for approximately 20 percent of the poverty
line used to determine eligibility, which is 585 TND (approximately US$ 1.25 per day).

In addition, MOSA provides in-kind services such as social workers, childcare services, adult
learning, and disability assistance. Although poorer regions such as Tozeur and Siliana have a
high share of the local population receiving cash transfers and subsidized health cards (Figures
25 and 26), targeting efficiency is weak overall, with at least 60 percent of benefits leaking to the
non-poor (defined as US$2 per day). In 2012, the Government launched a program to

protection and labor (SPL) system consolidation.40

Eligibility for PNAFN is determined through categorical criteria assessed by local commissions
overseen by MOSA. Commissions of local authorities, who now include representatives of CSOs,
determine eligibility based on self-presentation and according to a list of categorical criteria.
Eligibility criteria include (i) self-declared (unverified) household revenue falling below the
poverty line, defined in PNAFN as 585 TND per year (US$1.25 per day), up from approximately
400 TND per year (US$0.75 per day) before the revolution; (ii) household size; (iii) number of
household members with a disability and/or chronic health condition; (iv) household living
conditions, such as dwelling and assets; and (v) the inability for the head of household to work
due to an impairment (physical or mental).

Results from analysis of benefit incidence and targeting efficiency using the Tunisia Household
Consumption and Budget Survey (HCBS) for 2005-2010 show that leakage in PNAFN is relatively
high at 40 percent. The system has been prone to accusations of corruption and a lack of
transparency and equity and in 2011, MOSA began the process of reforming the system. Based
on 2011 data from the PNAFN database (and complemented by data from household budget
surveys in italics):

      51 percent of beneficiaries are female (heads of households);
      57 percent are over the age of 60 (with an average age of 58 years);
      65 percent live in the 14 primarily western governorates comprising Tunisia’s lagging
       regions;
      The average household size of 5 persons; and
      Nearly 60 percent of beneficiaries (heads of households) have not completed primary
       education.

Nearly 13 percent of the population among the 20 percent with the lowest incomes (who are
largely under the 1,025 TND high threshold of poverty per capita per year, namely nearly US$2
per capita) are covered by social assistance. Figure 27 illustrates the rate of coverage of the
PNAFN and AMG2. AMG2 covers only 45 percent of the population of the first quintile. More
than 42 percent of the poorest (the first quintile) do not benefit from health coverage nor from
cash assistance. In terms of benefits granted, or "generosity" of the program, the cash transfer
represents 21 percent of the average expenditures for low-income households (Table 7).

The distribution of the beneficiaries of social assistance shows that 40 percent of all benefits
accrue to the lowest quintile, while 60 percent accrue to higher quintiles (Figure 28). PNAFN
generally covers a considerable proportion of the low-income population (80 percent have a level
of consumption that is lower than the national average). However, leakage to the non-poor
(lowest quintile) remains relatively high.

In terms of the non-eligible share of beneficiary households, the targeting of PNAFN benefits
is less efficient as compared to that of other similar programs in countries such as Turkey
(Figure 29) and Argentina. The coverage rate of the poorest population (of the first quintile) in
Tunisia seems to be low compared to Argentina, the Dominican Republic, and Sri Lanka. In these
countries, the coverage rate varies between 22 and 51 percent, against 12.6 percent in Tunisia.
At the same time, the generosity of the PNAFN is one of the highest within middle- and low-
income countries. These programs include unconditional cash transfers based on targeting
mechanisms such as the categorical methods, proxy-means testing (PMT), community methods,
geographical methods, self-targeting methods, or a combination of these.41

Impact Assessment of Targeting Reforms Using Proxy-Means Testing

A comparison of Tunisia’s current PNAFN distribution with what it would be were PMT adopted
shows that PMT can improve targeting (Figure 30). The cost-benefit ratio of the existing PNAFN
is nearly 0.4 versus 0.77 for the simulated PMT program. The PMT approach allows for broader
coverage of the eligible population and a better exploitation of budgetary resources. For
example, the application of PMT to grant aid would ensure the delivery of 78 percent of the
budget to the individuals with the lowest incomes versus 31 percent currently. Similarly, the PMT
approach would allow for the reallocation of social transfers to the most disadvantaged regions
(Figure 31).

Conclusions

Building on its well-established programs, Tunisia’s social safety net system can be
strengthened by reducing the reliance on inequitable universal subsidies, improving
identification and targeting, and building graduation mechanisms. Reforms will be needed to
redirect consumption subsidies while protecting households from the shocks of rising costs of
living through cash transfers and other forms of direct, targeted assistance. During the transition
period, the government has taken steps to strengthen targeting and establish comprehensive
information systems on beneficiaries and services. However, a clear strategy for subsidy and
safety net reform is needed that also addresses access to labor markets and human capital-
related services for safety net beneficiaries in the medium to long term.

CHAPTER 5 POLICY IMPLICATIONS: TOWARD A CONSOLIDATED SOCIAL PROTECTION AND
LABOR SYSTEM IN TUNISIA



In its shift from exclusive to inclusive growth, Tunisia’s social protection and labor system will
play a central role in promoting social inclusion for the most vulnerable and connecting citizens
to better jobs. The role of the public sector remains important in mobilizing financing and
ensuring that critical services are better targeted to lower-income and vulnerable regions. It will
also be vital in working more closely with the private sector as the main engine of job growth in
the future by ensuring that labor and social security conditions become more attractive. While
existing social protection programs provide more generous benefits for the middle- to upper-
income groups, the challenge is ensuring that they are able to cope with the growing needs of
the most vulnerable. Enhancing financial sustainability and the equity of service delivery remain
key challenges to realizing this goal.

Developing a consolidated social protection and labor system through short- to long-term
strategies would boost social inclusion in three important ways. Such a system would (i) boost
access to different public services for the poorest; (ii) facilitate labor market participation for low-
and semi-skilled, vulnerable groups; and (iii) spur growth by enhancing purchasing power in
lagging regions. Other country experiences such as that of Brazil, Chile, India, and Indonesia show
that consolidation of key programs takes time, but important steps in the short term can lay the
foundation for new trajectories.


A Pending Agenda

Since 2012, Tunisia has begun laying the foundations for a more effective, well-coordinated
system. The development of the Social Contract framework represents an important step
toward developing a coherent policy agenda. On the delivery side, the launch of the design of a
unique social identification system will help pave the way for greater coordination on targeting
and benefits across different levels of vulnerability (Figure 32).

Given Tunisia’s challenges, the pending agenda focuses on modernizing the system more
comprehensively. Key recommendations comprise three main types, namely: (i) enhancing
implementation and delivery platforms; (ii) strengthening institutional capacity and governance;
and (iii) improving financial sustainability. Specific recommendations are summarized in Table 8.

Over the short term, enhancing service delivery platforms can help improve implementation
and efficiency to reach the most vulnerable. Understanding how benefits are delivered,
distributed, duplicated, or entirely omitted across levels of vulnerability will be central to
consolidating the system as a whole. Unemployment has largely fallen on youth and women,
who are among the bottom 40-60 percent by income, with the vast majority (67 percent) of the


                                                  41
unemployed being low skilled in underserved regions. Nearly 30-45 percent of the employed
labor force either do not have contracts or do not contribute to social security, particularly among
the poorest 40 percent. Finally, among the poorest 20 percent, only 12 percent of Tunisian's
benefit from the national cash transfer program.

Enhanced delivery platforms can be achieved by:

   Developing public-private implementation systems for skills development and income
    generation mechanisms in key sectors with high employment potential for out-of-school,
    low-skilled, vulnerable populations, as part of a private sector-led jobs strategy;
   Introducing transparent targeting and monitoring systems for existing social safety net and
    active labor market programs;
   Developing platforms for digital payment mechanisms to replace postal transfers and
    enhance financial literacy among households; and
   Strengthening coordination of and promoting access to essential public services (notably
    nutrition, education, health, and water in Tunisia’s lagging regions) for social safety net
    programs.

Over the mid-term, strengthening institutional capacity and governance would help lay the
foundation for aligning social inclusion and job growth. ALMPs, pensions, and social safety nets
as currently designed and implemented are not reaching vulnerable groups in part due to
institutional fragmentation in terms of identification and eligibility. Financial inclusion and access
to social protection services remains weak most notably in lagging regions, where the delivery of
services is hampered by inadequate investments in skilled human resources and equipment.
ALMPs are also not adequately capturing and targeting firms’ skills needs in key sectors and
regions. Tunisia has started to create a unique identification system and introduce
interoperability between information systems for key social protection and labor programs as of
2013.

Stronger institutional capacity and governance within the system in Tunisia can be attained by:

   Rolling out unified social registry information, targeting, and unique identification systems;
   Consolidating the pension administration (CNSS and CNRPS) as well as health insurance
    mechanisms (CNAM and AMG); and
   Strengthening the social dialogue policy framework and evidence base for developing public-
    private partnerships for ALMPs, reform labor contracts, and redefining wage-setting
    mechanisms that more actively promote productivity.

Over the long term, although improving the financial sustainability of the overall system may
take time, building the evidence base and consensus for transformative reforms can be
achieved in the meantime. A high tax wedge and pending pension deficits impinges on the
quality of jobs and protection from shocks, and consumption subsidies crowd out spending on
other vital investments that could spur revenue generation. Pressures on fiscal space could be
supported in the medium to long term by redirecting savings from reforming inefficient
consumption subsidies and in the long term through comprehensive pension reform. Savings
could also be used to enhance mechanisms that promote access to services and coverage of
social safety nets.

Tunisia can therefore improve the financial sustainability of its system by:

   Developing supplemental resource generation models and greater portability for pension
    benefits (CNSS and CNRPS) that explicitly tie benefits to contributions and identify subsidized
    pension benefits;
   Aligning investment code and labor regulations with targeted schemes for unemployment
    benefits to improve the quality of jobs among the vulnerable self-employed and small and
    medium enterprises (SMEs) in lagging regions; and
   Reinvesting universal subsidies into public or private investments that stimulate job growth
    and improve the effectiveness of targeted social protection programs.
Conclusion: Building Systems, Connecting to Jobs

Looking ahead, Tunisia’s forthcoming National Development Plan for 2016-2021 provides an
important platform for financing a unified social protection and labor reform agenda. Overall,
consolidation in Tunisia entails enhancing delivery systems over the short term and realigning
policies on benefits, eligibility, and financing schemes over the medium to long term. Close
involvement of the private sector and civil society at the regional level will be critical to
identifying and targeting only the most viable opportunities for long-term inclusion and job
growth. Ultimately, modernizing its social protection and labor system will help Tunisia better
cope with new shocks and, importantly, reap the social benefits of its hard-fought political
transition.
