     MESSAGE FROM THE READ TRUST FUND PROGRAM MANAGER


     Over the past seven years, the READ Trust Fund program has provided financial and technical support to
     low-income countries to help them improve their students’ learning outcomes through the design,
     implementation, and use of more effective student assessment systems.

     The results of this groundbreaking partnership between the Russian Federation and the World Bank are
     impressive. At the global level, the program has produced many high-quality knowledge products and tools.
     At the country level, local teams have significantly increased their capacity to carry out and use the data from
     assessments to improve education quality and student learning.

     These results are due to the efforts of many dedicated individuals and teams. We are particularly grateful to
     the Russian Government for their generosity and foresight in supporting this critical aspect of the global
     education agenda; to the country teams who worked tirelessly to design and implement activities on the
     ground; to the World Bank staff and international experts who assisted them; and to the READ Council
     members for providing guidance and strategic advice along the way.

     As we head into a new era of Sustainable Development Goals that will require countries to measure and
     report on student learning, the work supported under the READ Trust Fund program will be an important
     resource upon which countries can draw.

     On behalf of the READ Trust Fund program team, I am pleased to present this final report on the key
     achievements and results of this pioneering program.

EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY
Established in October 2008, the Russia Education Aid for
Development (READ) program has been a collaboration
of the Government of the Russian Federation and the
World Bank that focuses on improving education quality
in low-income countries. The READ Trust Fund was a
part of this program, with an amount of US$32 million
to be executed over a seven-year period, 2008 to 2015.


Better Assessment for Better Learning
The READ Trust Fund’s main objective was to help low-income countries
improve their student learning outcomes through the design, implementation,
and use of robust systems for student assessment. It supported analytical
work and technical assistance to help countries:

 	establish systems or institutions – or strengthen existing ones – that
   formulate learning goals and carry out assessments of student learning;
 	improve existing or develop new instruments to measure student learning
   outcomes; and
 	strengthen existing or develop new mechanisms (policies) to use learning
   outcomes data to improve teaching and learning.


READ Trust Fund Organization and Structure
Under the guidance of the READ Council, a group comprised of key Russian
and World Bank officials, the READ Trust Fund supported work at both the
global and country levels. At the global level, the focus was on generating and
sharing knowledge and good practices in the form of tools, analytical reports,
and case studies. At the country level (in Angola, Armenia, Ethiopia, the
Kyrgyz Republic, Mozambique, Tajikistan, Vietnam, and Zambia), World Bank
teams and country stakeholders worked together to implement a set of READ
Trust Fund–supported activities that addressed gaps in the country’s existing
learning assessment system.

                                     The READ Trust Fund was organized around 12 main areas of program
                                     activity (see Figure 1). This report contains a detailed account of program
                                     achievements in each of these areas from 2008 to 2015. Together, the
                                     different sections provide a complete picture of program results and
                                     demonstrate the significant impact of the program.


                                     Key Program Achievements
                                     The World Bank’s Education Sector Strategy 2020 highlights the importance
                                     of “Learning for All.” The proven economic gains and poverty reduction tied
                                     to education are only obtainable when children actually learn. All actors in an
                                     education system need to know whether or not learning is taking place so
                                     that they can use this information to improve education quality.

                                     The main outcome of the READ Trust Fund program has been increased
                                     institutional capacity of countries to develop, carry out, and effectively use
                                     data from student assessments to improve education quality and student
                                     learning. Armed with information on how well students are performing,
                                     teachers, policy makers, and international donors alike are now better able to
                                     determine where to focus their energy and resources for the greatest
                                     improvement in learning outcomes.

                                     The activities supported by the READ Trust Fund program have had a
                                     significant impact on the work being carried out worldwide to strengthen

systems that measure learning outcomes. The activities and outcomes
achieved under the READ Trust Fund have been referenced in many high-level
conversations on defining the post-2015 development agenda in education
and on identifying effective ways to strengthen countries’ capacity to measure
learning outcomes.

For both the Russian Federation and the World Bank, the partnership through
the READ Program was groundbreaking. As a result of this innovative program,
many developing countries received valuable support in the area of student
assessment and several highly useful knowledge tools have been created.
The following summary captures the main program achievements at both the
global and country levels, broken down by each area of program activity.


Highlights of Global-Level Results
At the global level, the READ Trust Fund contributed an impressive body of
knowledge products on student assessment systems. There is now much
greater understanding among education policymakers and practitioners of
what it takes to develop an effective assessment system.

By the end of the program, nearly 60 countries had used the SABER-Student
Assessment tools developed under READ to analyze the status of their
assessment systems; more than 30 different knowledge products on
assessment topics had been published; and over 2,800 individuals had
benefited from trainings and learning events on the SABER-Student
Assessment tools.

Key partnerships had also been established with donors and education
practitioners working in the field of student assessment, such as the OECD,
UIS, Brookings Institution, and STEP Skills Measuresment program. These
strategic partnerships enabled READ to have a key role in several international
initiatives to develop new tools to monitor education quality and learning
outcomes. Through joint publications, co-sponsored events, and other
means of collaboration, the program partnered with more than 15 other
donors and organizations and READ was widely recognized as a leader in
pushing forward the education quality and learning outcomes measurement
agenda.

The main program achievements in each activity area at the global-level
include:

SABER-Student Assessment
 	A conceptual framework that identifies the key indicator areas for tracking
   the development of an effective system and 4 questionnaires and rubrics
   to collect and evaluate data on each of the assessment types – classroom
   assessment, examinations, NLSA, and ILSA – found in most assessment
   systems

Education Quality and Assessment in the Post-2015
Development Agenda
Through the joint efforts of Russia and the World Bank, the READ program
has made significant and recognized contributions to the Learning for All
agenda and increased global attention on the importance of education quality
and learning outcomes.

In the global discourse, the attention given to the importance of learning and
monitoring education quality continues to grow. In the post-2015 era, work to
establish strong systems for assessing learning outcomes is likely to expand.
In this regard, both the READ program and the eight countries supported
under the program are well positioned to play an important leadership role.
Having already experienced a six-year journey of activities and outputs at
global and country levels, the READ program offers an exciting and evidence-
based model to those who wish to learn how exactly to go about improving
and institutionalizing the way they monitor and use information on student
learning outcomes.
10	   FINAL READ Trust Fund Report 2008–2015




                                    FINANCIAL
                                    SUMMARY
                                    The READ Trust Fund was designed to support activities
                                    at both the global and country levels. Initially, the fund
                                    was set up to be executed only by World Bank staff.
                                    However, mid-way through the program, it was agreed
                                    to make it possible for some of the funds to be executed
                                    by recipient country governments. (Ultimately, the Kyrgyz
                                    Republic and Tajikistan were the only two countries with
                                    recipient-executed programs.)

                                    Global-Level vs. Country-Level Activities
                                    The US$32 million under the READ Trust Fund was distributed so that 35
                                    percent of the funds were set aside for global-level activities and 60 percent
                                    for country-specific work programs (see Figure 2). To allow sufficient time to
                                    complete a final evaluation of each country’s progress, all country-level grants
                                    were closed by October 2014. At that time, the balance of unspent funds
                                    (approximately US$950,000) was reallocated to fund key global-level activities
                                    and partnerships. The final percentages account for these additional funds at
                                    the global-level as the program nears completion.

                                    During the program’s first few years of implementation, the majority of funds
                                    were spent on developing global knowledge tools, capacity building activities,
                                    and agreeing on country-level action plans. While disbursements were initially
                                    greatest at the global level, rates of disbursements at the country level
                                    significantly increased in 2013 and 2014 (see Figure 3).


                                    Final Program Activities
                                    Over the course of the program, the Russian Ministry of Finance granted three
                                    different extensions to the original closing date – a one-year extension in 2011,
                                    a seven-month extension in 2014, and a six-month extension in 2015. The first
                                    extension accounted for initial delays at the country-level; the second extension
                                    allowed sufficient time to evaluate the impact of country-level activities; and
                                    the final extension is allowing the program to finalize a number of global-level
                                    knowledge products and fund some strategic partnerships. Table 1 includes
                                    a financial summary of all program activity through September 1, 2015.

GLOBAL-LEVEL
RESULTS
READ Trust Fund activities at the global level fell into four
main categories – SABER-Student Assessment, SABER-
Learning Standards, Global Knowledge Sharing, and Program
Coordination. These global-level activities centered on:

 	developing new knowledge products to expand the
   current understanding of what makes for an effective
   student assessment system;
 	partnering and knowledge sharing with other donors and
   education development practitioners; and
 	providing opportunities to share lessons across READ
   Trust Fund-supported countries and good practices in
   the field of student assessment more generally.

The work on SABER-Student Assessment and SABER-
Learning Standards is part of a larger World Bank initiative called
Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) (see
Box 1).


SABER-Student Assessment
SABER-Student Assessment makes available information and tools based on
the latest evidence for “what matters most” in creating effective assessment
systems. It involves:

 	classifying and analyzing student assessment systems around the world
   according to key criteria;
 	collecting information on these key criteria by administering a set of
   questionnaires in a particular country;
   producing country and regional reports to inform policy dialogue; and
 	
 	developing other products to add to the current knowledge base on how
   to develop and strengthen student assessment systems.

                 ollecting and Analyzing Data on Education Policies around the Globe
         Box 1. C

         The World Bank has created an open data tool that provides in-depth, comparative, and easily
         accessible data on education policies around the world. This tool, SABER, helps countries collect and
         analyze information on their education policies, benchmark themselves against other countries, and
         prioritize areas for reform, with the goal of ensuring that all children and youth go to school and learn.

         SABER aims to improve education quality by supplying policymakers, civil society, school
         administrators, teachers, parents, and students with meaningful data about key education policy
         areas, including early childhood development, student assessment, teachers, school autonomy and
         accountability, and workforce development, among others. SABER helps countries improve their
         education systems in three ways:

           Providing new data. SABER collects comparable country data on education policies and
          	
           institutions to allow governments, researchers, and other stakeholders to measure and monitor
           progress.
           Benchmarking education policies and institutions. Each policy area is rated on a four-point
          	
           scale, from “Latent” to “Emerging” to “Established” and “Advanced.” These ratings highlight a
           country’s areas of strength and weakness while promoting cross-country learning.
           Highlighting key policy choices. SABER data collection and analysis produce an objective
          	
           snapshot of how well a country’s education system is performing in relation to global good
           practice. This helps highlight the most important policy choices to spur learning.

         The World Bank, through SABER, has analyzed data from more than 100 countries to guide more
         effective reforms and investments in education at all levels, from pre-primary to tertiary education and
         workforce development.

                                             Conceptual Framework and Diagnostic Tools
                                             Work on the SABER-Student Assessment knowledge products and tools
                                             began in 2010. Initially, the focus was on creating a conceptual framework
                                             and identifying the policies, institutional arrangements, and practices that
                                             matter most in establishing effective assessment systems (see Box 2). The
                                             results of this work are summarized in the 2012 publication, “What Matters
                                             Most for Student Assessment Systems: A Framework Paper”, which provides
                                             policy makers, education ministry officials, development organization staff,
                                             and other stakeholders with an evidence-based framework and key indicator
                                             areas for building an effective student assessment system.

                                             Once established, the framework was used to develop questionnaires and
                                             rubrics for collecting and evaluating data on key characteristics of a country’s
                                             assessment system. The questionnaires and rubrics were organized around
                                             four types of assessment activity – classroom assessment, examinations,
                                             national large-scale assessments (NLSA), and international large-scale
                                                                                GLOBAL-LEVEL RESULTS   15



assessments (ILSA). Early versions of the questionnaires and rubrics were
piloted in Chile, New Zealand, and Uganda. Based on lessons learned from
this experience, the tools underwent minor revisions and fine tuning.

Since 2010, the questionnaires and rubrics have undergone three further
revisions. Each revision aims to improve the utility and validity of the data
generated by these diagnostic tools based on experience gained from
applying them, feedback from stakeholders and other end users, and the
latest research on what makes for an effective assessment system. In general,
the revisions have involved adding questions or expanding portions of the
rubrics to emphasize key criteria.

The conceptual framework for SABER-Student Assessment underpins all of
the work carried out under the READ Trust Fund program and has provided
program participants with a common language for discussing key issues,
requirements, and plans for building a more effective assessment system.
The key indicator areas identified by SABER-Student Assessment provided
the basis for the READ Trust Fund Results Framework, which was used to
track each READ Trust Fund–supported country’s progress in strengthening
its assessment system.

         Box 2. What Matters Most in a Student Assessment System?

         The SABER-Student Assessment framework is built on the available evidence base for what an effective
         assessment system looks like. The framework is structured around two main dimensions of assessment
         systems: the types of assessment activities, and the quality of those activities.
         Assessment types
            Classroom assessment provides real-time information to support ongoing teaching and learning
           	
            in individual classrooms. Classroom assessments use a variety of formats – including observation,
            questioning, and paper-and-pencil tests – to evaluate student learning, generally on a daily basis.
            Examinations provide a basis for selecting or certifying students as they move from one level of
           	
            the education system to the next. Examinations cover the main subject areas in the curriculum and
            usually involve essays and multiple-choice questions.
            Large-scale, system-level assessments provide feedback on the overall performance of the
           	
            education system at particular grades or age levels. These assessments typically cover a few
            subjects on a regular basis (such as every 3 to 5 years), are often sample-based, and use multiple-
            choice and short-answer formats. They may be national or international in scope.
         Quality drivers
            Enabling context refers to the broader setting in which the assessment activity takes place and
           	
            the extent to which that setting is conducive. It includes the policy framework for assessment
            activities, institutional structures, sources of funding, and the presence of trained assessment staff.
            System alignment refers to the extent to which the assessment is aligned with the rest of the
           	
            education system. It includes the degree of congruence between assessment activities and system
            learning goals, standards, curriculum, and pre- and in-service teacher training.
            Assessment quality refers to the psychometric quality of the instruments, processes, and
           	
            procedures for the assessment activity. It covers such issues as the design and implementation of
            assessment activities, analysis and interpretation of student responses, and the appropriateness of
            how assessment results are reported and used.

         Crossing the quality drivers with the different assessment types provides the framework and broad
         indicator areas shown in Figure 4. This framework is a starting point for identifying indicators that can
         be used to review assessment systems and plan for their improvement.

Country and Regional Reports
Using the data obtained from applying the SABER-Student Assessment tools
to a particular country, a report is produced that summarizes how well the
country’s student assessment system is performing and offers
recommendations for improvement.

In 2011, the SABER-Student Assessment tools were retroactively applied to
2009 data for READ Trust Fund–supported countries to produce country
reports and establish baselines against which to measure these countries’
progress in developing their student assessment systems. In 2014, upon
completion of the READ Trust Fund program, the benchmarking tools were
applied again to the eight countries to determine the progress made in
developing their assessment systems and to identify specific aspects of their
systems that had improved as a result of the activities supported under
READ. The final developmental ratings for each country are described in the
country-level section of this report. A full summary of the findings from the
benchmarking exercise are available on the READ website in the report,
“Russia Education Aid for Development Trust Fund Program: Results of the
Country Benchmarking Exercise, 2009-2014.”

In 2011, the SABER-Student Assessment team used an abbreviated version
of the questionnaires and rubrics to benchmark countries in East Asia and
the Middle East & North Africa (MENA). Summary findings for countries in
East Asia were made available in the report, “Strengthening Education Quality
in East Asia”, which was published in partnership with the United Nations
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). In the case of
the MENA countries, the application of abbreviated versions of the tools in a
few countries was quickly followed by application of full versions of the tools
in 17 countries, which allowed for the production of a detailed regional report
as well as individual country reports. This work was carried out in cooperation
with the Arab League Educational, Cultural, and Scientific Organization
(ALECSO) and UNESCO. The regional findings were published in the 2014
report, “Regional Mapping Report on Assessment in the Arab States”, which
is available in Arabic and English on ALECSO’s website.

From 2012 through 2015, there continued to be strong demand from countries
to use the SABER-Student Assessment tools to benchmark their assessment
systems. By the end of the READ Trust Fund program, in addition to the work
carried out on the eight READ Trust Fund-supported countries, the team had
collected data and produced country reports for 29 countries. In total, data
for student assessment systems in 51 countries is now publically available on
the SABER-Student Assessment website. (See Figure 5 for a list of all
countries and Appendix 4 for all country reports.)

                                    Case Studies
                                    As a way to build the evidence base on good practices in reforming and
                                    strengthening assessment systems, a series of case studies was
                                    commissioned early on in the READ program with the goal of finding out what
                                    countries around the world have done to improve their assessment systems.
                                    The case studies focused on different aspects of the quality drivers outlined
                                    in the SABER-Student Assessment conceptual framework. The first set of
                                    case studies looked at the enabling context in six countries – Australia, Brazil,
                                    Chile, New Zealand, Russia, and Uganda – and identified key drivers and
                                    choices that led to positive changes over time. A second set of six case
                                    studies focused on the uses of assessment information in Chile, The Gambia,
                                    Germany, Jordan, Russia, and Singapore.

                                    Each of the 12 case studies was presented at one of the READ Global
                                    Conferences, and most were further developed and published under the
                                    READ Working Paper series. Given some general interest expressed in
                                    Armenia’s efforts to strengthen their student assessment system, an
                                    additional case study was commissioned to capture the lessons learned from
                                    this READ-sponsored country’s experiences. By the end of the READ Trust
                                    Fund program, 11 case studies had been published, including two on Chile,
                                    two on Russia, and one each on Armenia, Australia (Queensland), Brazil, The
                                    Gambia, Jordan, New Zealand, and Uganda.


                                    Reviews and Research on Key Assessment Topics
                                    A portion of the global work program was dedicated to reviews and research
                                    on key topics and issues in the area of student assessment. As part of this
                                    work stream, the World Bank Education Note, “Measuring Learning – How
                                    Effective Student Assessment Systems Can Help Achieve Learning for All,”
                                    and the READ Working Paper, “Review of World Bank Support for Student
                                    Assessment Activities in Client Countries, 1998–2009,” were published.

                                    Other work included a review by the Inter-American Dialogue of learning
                                    assessment systems in Latin America. The findings were summarized in the
                                    2015 report, “What has Happened with Learning Assessment in Latin
                                    America? Lessons learned over the last decade”. The report examines
                                    changes in assessment systems in Latin America through an analysis of 1)
                                    institutional and organizational frameworks; 2) the dissemination and uses of
                                    assessment information by authorities, school officials and teachers, families
                                    and civil society; and 3) participation in international large-scale assessments.

                                    Two other reports were published in partnership with the Organization for
                                    Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as part of their PISA
                                    (Program for International Student Assessment) for Development initiative.
                                    The first of these reports, “Review of Component Skills Assessed and
                                    Contextual Data Collection Used in Relevant International Assessments”,
                                    looks at the similarities and differences among existing international, regional,

and household-based large-scale assessment programs. The second report,
“The Experience of Middle-Income Countries Participating in PISA,
2000-2015”, analyzes the experiences of non-OECD countries, particularly
low- and lower-middle income countries, in PISA. (See page 26 for further
details.)

                                    Training Sessions and Learning Events
                                    Since 2010, at least 36 different events were organized to train development
                                    practitioners, partners, and other donors on the tools and products developed
                                    under the SABER-Student Assessment program. (See Appendix 2 for a
                                    complete list of training sessions and learning events.) These events provided
                                    a platform for showcasing the work carried out and tools developed under
                                    the READ program, and for soliciting suggestions for improvement. They also
                                    produced greater visibility for the READ program on the international stage.
                                    Through these events, the SABER-Student Assessment team was able to
                                    reach more than 2,800 individuals. Add to this the general workshops and
                                    trainings on SABER that took place during this time period, and which
                                    included student assessment, and the total number of people reached
                                    surpasses 5,000. As a way to further expand the reach of the SABER-Student
                                    Assessment program, the training materials developed for face-to-face
                                    sessions were turned into an e-learning course for education policymakers
                                    and practitioners. It is expected that this e-learning course will be launched
                                    globally in 2016.
                                                                                 GLOBAL-LEVEL RESULTS   21



SABER-Learning Standards
In 2011, READ Trust Fund support was used to initiate background work for a
possible SABER domain on learning standards. The work was put out for
competitive bid and ultimately awarded to the American Institutes for
Research (AIR). Similar to the work carried out on SABER-Student Assessment,
the aim was to develop an evidence-based framework and set of tools to
benchmark learning standards policies and systems in countries around the
world. In 2013, given the close conceptual links between the topics of
assessment and learning standards, it was decided to incorporate the work
on the latter into the SABER-Student Assessment domain as part of the
broader suite of tools and products available in this area.


Conceptual Framework and Diagnostic Tools
In 2011, the AIR team completed a report on key characteristics of effective
learning standards based on their review of the existing global evidence base
and best practices. Subsequently, a set of questionnaires and rubrics were
developed that could be used to collect and evaluate data on these aspects
of a country’s education system. The tools allow for the collection of data on
content, process, and performance standards in the areas of Language Arts,
Mathematics, and Science. In 2012, the diagnostic tools were piloted,
reviewed, and revised and a user’s guide was created to guide the data
collection process. These products are being made available as part of the
suite of tools under SABER-Student Assessment.


Country Reports
The piloting of the tools involved the collection of data and production of
country reports for six countries: Armenia, Jordan, Mozambique, Nepal,
Peru, and Vietnam. The country reports summarize key findings and
recommendations derived from application of the diagnostic tools. These
reports are available as background material on the SABER website (www.
saber.worldbank.org).


Case Studies
To build the evidence base in this topic area, and to capture lessons learned,
a series of case studies were commissioned that describe what various
countries have done to develop and implement effective learning standards.
The six case study countries are Chile, India, Jordan, Namibia, New Zealand,
and Singapore. These case studies are being published as part of the READ
Working Paper series.

                                    Global Knowledge Sharing
                                    At the global level, the program focused on identifying opportunities to share
                                    lessons and best practices in student assessment with READ Trust
                                    Fund-supported and other developing countries. These activities included
                                    global conferences and regional workshops, partnerships and collaborations
                                    with others working on the topic of student assessment, and the development
                                    and dissemination of knowledge products on assessment. These activities
                                    enhanced the program’s work at the country level and increased overall
                                    awareness of good practices in assessment.


                                    READ Trust Fund Conferences and Regional
                                    Workshops
                                    The READ Council decided that the READ Trust Fund would hold an annual
                                    event to bring together everyone working directly on the READ program
                                    (including education officials from READ-supported countries, Russian
                                    officials and education experts, World Bank staff, and international assessment
                                    experts) to share experiences, discuss good practices, and learn more about
                                    Russia’s role as a donor in the area of education quality. (See Table 2 for
                                    additional details and Appendix 3 for summaries of each of these events.)

                                    The READ Global Conferences held in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2014 served as
                                    important milestones for the program. All four conferences were highly
                                    successful and greatly valued, in particular by READ-country participants. In
                                    2012 and 2013, in lieu of a stand-alone READ Global Conference, the READ
                                    Trust Fund co-sponsored annual conferences held by international
                                    assessment associations (the International Association for Educational
                                    Assessment [IAEA] and the Association for Educational Assessment in Africa
                                    [AEAA]) and organized READ Regional Workshops. This was done in order to
                                    forge closer connections with the broader assessment community and to
                                    provide opportunities for READ Trust Fund-supported countries to build
                                    networks with their regional neighbors. At all of these co-sponsored events,
                                    there were several panel sessions on READ Trust Fund and READ RAS
                                    activities.

                   Theme: “Developing a Vision for Assessment Systems”
                   Key messages:
                    	When children learn, nations prosper – countries cannot afford to postpone
                      making learning a national priority.
                    	Evidence – obtained through regular assessments of student learning – and
                      use of that evidence, is vital.
                    	Developing a system of assessment is important, i.e., creating an enabling
                      environment for assessment, ensuring alignment with the rest of the education
                      system, and paying attention to the quality of the instruments used to measure
                      student learning.

                   Location/Date: Nairobi, Kenya – October 4-6, 2010
                   Theme: “Strengthening the Enabling Environment for Assessment Systems”
                   Key messages:
                    	Leadership plays a vital role in building effective assessment systems.
                    	Establishing a strong assessment system requires focusing on the policies,
                      institutional arrangements, and financial and human resources for assessment
                      activities.
                    	Strengthening the enabling environment is fundamental to ensuring that
                      learning outcomes improve.


                   Third READ Global Conference*


                   Location/Date: Eschborn, Germany – October 23-26, 2011
                   Theme: “Using Student Assessment Results for Education Quality and Systems
                   Strengthening”.
                   Key messages:
                    	 Assessments provide a way to gather information on what students know,
                       understand, and can do and identify areas in need of quality improvements.
                    	 Assessment activities are only effective in improving education quality when
                       they are used in ways that inform policymaker decisions, help teachers improve
                       their teaching practices, and empower parents with the knowledge of how well
                       their children are actually learning.
                    	 (*This event was combined with the World Bank’s Education Conference for
                       Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and co-hosted by the German Development
                       Agency – GIZ.)

                             Objectives: The workshops were designed to encourage South-South knowledge
                             sharing across READ-supported countries. Specific objectives included:
                              	supporting the READ country teams to implement their action plans;
                              	providing READ country teams with an opportunity to discuss key challenges
                                faced during implementation of their action plans; and
                              	providing opportunities to share lessons learned and expertise across READ
                                country teams.

                             Location/Date: St. Petersburg, Russia – May 12-16, 2014
                             Theme: “Measuring for Success: The Role of Assessment in Achieving Learning
                             Goals”
                             Key messages:
                              	Measurement helps identify which initiatives are successful at achieving impact
                                – spending choices should be guided by the relative impact on learning.
                              	High quality national and international assessments allow countries to identify
                                gaps in performance and target resources where most needed.
                              	Classroom assessment by teachers is key – they need comprehensive training

Co-Sponsored Events
To achieve greater visibility for the READ program and build connections with
others working on assessment, READ occasionally partnered with other
organizations on assessment-related events. These collaborations provided
another platform for showcasing the READ work, generated additional
support from assessment experts and donors, and created greater visibility
for the program on the international stage.

  All Children Reading by 2015 – From Assessment to Action
 	
  Workshop: Co-sponsored by the READ Trust Fund, the Global
  Partnership for Education (GPE) (formerly known as the Education for All
  – Fast Track Initiative) and the United States Agency for International
  Development (USAID), this three-day event brought together country
  leaders, experts, and donors to discuss how countries can ensure that all
  children are able to read by the end of Grade 2. The workshop aimed to
  help the countries in attendance (Egypt, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Guatemala,
  Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Nicaragua, and South Africa), most of which had
  recently conducted an early-grade reading assessment, to devise clear
  strategies on how to use the assessment results to identify actions to
  improve learning outcomes in reading. This event took place in
  Washington, DC from April 12-14, 2010.

  Users and Uses of National Assessment Results Workshop:
 	
  Another partnered event was the workshop, “Users and Uses of National
  Assessment Results”, held on April 13–15, 2010 in Capetown, South
  Africa. The Africa Alliance for Learning and Education Results (Africa
  ALERT) brought together representatives from international organizations
  and senior policy makers and technical staff in charge of national
  assessments from nine African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho,
  Mauritius, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia) for
  a three-day workshop. Participants analyzed ways in which assessment
  results have been used for policy design, teacher professional
  development, enhancing school management, and informing parents
  and increasing public awareness, and then developed country-specific
  plans for ways to better use national assessment results.

  Benchmarking Education Systems for Results – East Asia
 	
  Regional Conference: The World Bank’s SABER Program partnered
  with organizations in East Asia to benchmark the region’s education
  systems. READ (which was the primary source of support for the
  benchmarking work on assessment) was invited to partner with the
  Korean government, the Nanyang Technological University, the UK
  Department for International Development (DFID), the Education Program
  Development Fund, and UNESCO to organize a conference in Singapore
  on June 21–23, 2010 at which the results of the regional benchmarking
  were presented. Bringing together international experts, representatives
  from donor organizations, and education policy makers and school

                                        administrators from 20 countries throughout the East Asia Region, this
                                        event provided an opportunity to build partnerships, promote assessment
                                        of education programs, and help countries define a framework for
                                        benchmarking.

                                      development community comes closer to finalizing the post-2015
                                      development agenda in education, there have been serious conversations
                                      about the possibility of a universal learning goal. In order to contribute to
                                      these discussions, and with the support of the READ Trust Fund, the
                                      World Bank hosted a symposium in November 2013 on the topic of
                                      “Assessment for Global Learning.” This two-day symposium brought
                                      together international assessment experts and policy researchers to
                                      review and discuss the existing menu of tools and approaches for
                                      monitoring and supporting student learning, and to explore how best
                                      they can be used or improved to meet the needs of the post-2015
                                      development agenda.

                                    Over the course of the program, the READ Trust Fund established a number
                                    of partnerships with other key players working in the area of student
                                    assessment. Partnerships with OECD on the PISA for Development initiative,

                                    Measurement Program allowed the program to leverage additional funds and
                                    play an influential role in several key international initiatives that also promote
                                    education quality and improved learning outcomes.

                                      Trust Fund, the World Bank and the Governing Board of OECD’s PISA
                                      have been working together to find ways to adapt the PISA tests so that
                                      low-income countries can more readily benefit from them. As a result of
                                      this collaboration, a new reading component skills assessment was
                                      developed and made available as an international option for the PISA
                                      2012 survey, of which both Poland and Peru were able to avail.

                                      PISA for Development. Through this initiative, OECD is piloting a modified
                                      version of the current PISA, one in which certain enhancements have
                                      been made for the developing country context. After initial discussions,
                                      six countries were selected to participate in the pilot: Cambodia, Ecuador,
                                      Guatemala, Paraguay, Senegal, and Zambia. READ Trust Fund support
                                      was used to finance a number of a key activities to launch the initiative,
                                      including hosting technical workshops, conducting capacity needs

      Technical    Workshops: In 2013 and 2014, READ provided support for
        three different PISA for Development technical workshops – one in
        Paris at OECD, one in Washington, DC at the World Bank, and one in
        Montreal at UIS. READ funds were used to support the participation
        of various country representatives at these events. During the
        workshops, country representatives, assessment experts, and
        international donors discussed the development of the testing
        instruments and possible ways to reach out-of-school 15-year olds.

        participating countries are meant to benefit from activities aimed at
        building their national capacity in assessment design, data analysis,
        and use of results for monitoring and improvement. During the initial
        phase of the project, an analysis was carried out of each country’s
        capacity and needs in these areas. The SABER–Student Assessment
        tools and PISA technical standards were used as guidelines for these
        analyses.

      Publications:   To help build the evidence base on ways to make PISA
        more relevant for a wider range of countries, READ support was used
        to commission two background reports. The first of these, “The
        Experiences of Middle-Income Countries Participating in PISA,
        2000-2015,” provides a systematic review of the experiences of 40
        middle-income countries that have participated in PISA over the
        years. The second report, “Review of Component Skills Assessed
        and Contextual Data Collection Used in Relevant International
        Assessments,” gives greater insight into possible ways of collaborating
        across different international assessments, including PISA.

                                         advances, 21st century labor market requirements have shifted from
                                         needing workers with educational qualifications for “life-time” jobs to
                                         needing workers with strong cognitive and socio-emotional skills who are
                                         able to develop the skills needed to do specific jobs that are constantly
                                         changing. In 2010, the World Bank launched the STEP Skills Measurement
                                         Program to support countries in implementing surveys of the skills levels of
                                         their adult populations. Through the use of household and employer
                                         surveys, the STEP program collects information on three types of skills:
                                         cognitive, socio-emotional, and job-relevant. By 2015, three rounds of
                                         STEP surveys had taken place with the participation of 17 different countries
                                         across the globe. In 2014, the READ Trust Fund team partnered with the
                                         STEP Skills Measurement team in several ways to advance this work.

     achievement levels, from policy issues to address when designing and
     carrying out assessments through test development, sampling, data
     cleaning, statistics, report writing, and the use of results to improve
     education quality. The entire series was translated into French,
     Portuguese, and Russian to facilitate its use in READ Trust Fund- and
     other World Bank-recipient countries. (Note: Russia’s Center for

                                      dissemination and communication strategy for a national assessment program and
                                      describes the preparation of the main report. It also highlights ways that countries
                                      have actually used the results of national assessments for policy making, curriculum
                                      reform, and monitoring of changes in achievement and other variables over time.

                                    education sector leaders, was established to provide guidance on the overall
                                    strategic direction and priorities of the READ program. The Council met nine
                                    times between 2009 and 2015. Initially, the meetings occurred on an annual
                                    basis, but as the program headed into the final phases of implementation, the
                                    frequency increased to accommodate discussions on next steps and the
                                    future of READ.

                                    These meetings were highly beneficial and resulted in a number of key
                                    decisions such as agreement on the READ Results Framework, reallocations
                                    of funds, approval of global-level work programs, an amendment to the
                                    administrative agreement to allow recipient-executed grants, preparations for
                                    the READ Global Conferences, and agreement on future areas of work for a
                                    possible second READ Trust Fund. While these meetings typically took place
                                    in either Moscow or Washington, DC, in 2012, a READ Council meeting was
                                    held in Hanoi, Vietnam to give Council members the opportunity to see READ
                                    Trust Fund-supported activities on the ground. READ Council members
                                    presided over each of the READ Global Conferences and also had the
                                    opportunity to hear directly from READ country beneficiaries during these
                                    events.

READ Trust Fund Technical Group Retreats
In the early stages of the READ Trust Fund, a Technical Group was formed to
help conceptualize the overall work program at the global and country levels.
This group, comprised of international assessment experts, supported the
development of global knowledge products, provided quality assurance for
program activities, and advised country teams during the diagnostic phase
and development of their action plans. While membership of the Technical
Group varied over time, it typically consisted of six to eight members, including
both World Bank staff and international assessment experts.

Two Technical Group retreats were held in 2009 and another was held in early
2011. These retreats were instrumental in providing opportunities to brainstorm
ideas, get advice on various global products, establish the overall program for
the READ Global Conferences, and create tools for use at the country-level,
such as the Self-Diagnosis tool.

Collaboration with READ RAS and CICED
From 2009-2015, the READ Trust Fund team organized a number of
partnership meetings with Russian authorities, READ RAS, and CICED to
identify program synergies and areas for collaboration. These opportunities
for information sharing across programs and frequent communication among
the different teams resulted in several collaborative efforts, including jointly-
organized international conferences, training sessions in Moscow on global
knowledge products developed by the READ Trust Fund, workshops and
sessions to promote the School Achievements Monitoring (SAM) and
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Literacy tools developed
by CICED, and opportunities to disseminate READ Trust Fund knowledge
products and incorporate them into READ RAS capacity-building activities in
Russia.

  Annual READ Global Conferences: The annual READ Global
 	
  Conferences led by the READ Trust Fund team brought together
  representatives across the entire READ program, including key education
  officials from all eight READ Trust Fund-sponsored countries, READ
  Council members, the READ Trust Fund Technical Group, international
  assessment experts working on READ activities, World Bank staff, and
  the READ RAS and CICED teams. Each year, a conference session was
  dedicated to the READ RAS and CICED teams so that they could present
  their achievements and share their expertise with other conference
  participants.

  2012 and 2013 IAEA Conferences: The IAEA Conferences provided
 	
  valuable opportunities to share the work being carried out under READ
  and connect this work to the broader global assessment community. In
  2012, both READ Trust Fund and CICED served as co-sponsors of the
  IAEA conference and jointly organized three panel sessions on READ
  activities.

  Training Sessions on SABER-Student Assessment Tools: In
 	
  collaboration with READ RAS, a series of workshops and talks on student
  assessment by members of the READ Trust Fund team were organized
  in Russia. On March 5-7, 2012, presentations on student assessment and
  the SABER tools were delivered to around 100 participants, including
  students, researchers, and faculty, at the Moscow Higher School of
  Economics and the Russian Training Center. On May 14-17, 2013, another
  member of the READ Trust Fund team delivered a series of presentations
  and trainings at the Russian Academy of Education’s Russian Training
  Center, the Moscow School of Higher Economics, and the Moscow
  School of Social and Economic Sciences. This time, the 142 participants
  included students, researchers, faculty, and education officials from
  Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and the Kyrgyz Republic.

 READ Trust Fund Global Knowledge Products: Significant effort
	
 was made to translate the global knowledge products developed under
 the READ Trust Fund into Russian and disseminate them among Russian
 partner organizations, such as the Russian Training Center and EAOKO.
 The READ Trust Fund encouraged broad participation by READ Countries
 in the EAOKO launch event in 2012 and made available knowledge
 products for dissemination at future EAOKO Conferences. Additionally,
 some of the research developed under the READ Trust Fund was further
 disseminated by being published in EAOKO’s peer-reviewed journal.




  Box 3. Russia’s Center for International Cooperation in Education Development (CICED)

  The READ Program consisted of two main components: the READ Trust Fund and READ Reimbursable
  Advisory Services (RAS). The primary objective of READ RAS was to develop the capacity of Russians,
  and CICED in particular, to engage in international development activities in the area of education.
  Since its inception in 2008, CICED has served as a network organization to bring together Russian
  expertise in assessment and quality management in education. Two of the key education quality
  assessment tools developed with CICED support were the School Achievements Monitoring (SAM)
  and the ICT Literacy tools.

   	SAM is designed to measure primary school students’ proficiency in the areas of mathematics,
     language, and science. The instrument is based on Vygotsky’s theory of learning and evaluates
     students’ competencies at three different levels – formal, reflexive, and functional. The SAM toolkit
     includes tests in the three subject areas, questionnaires for collecting background information,
     and recommendations on how to interpret and use the test results.
   	The ICT Literacy tool measures the ability of secondary school students to work effectively with
     information and use digital communication technologies to learn and solve problems. The test
     assesses students’ abilities in seven cognitive areas: definition, control, access, integration,
     assessment, development, and information transfer. Test takers must respond to a number of
     interactive tasks, based around real life situations that represent different levels of difficulty in the
     seven cognitive areas.

                                    Multiple actors worked on both the global and country-level activities under
                                    READ: eight READ Country Task Teams, READ Technical Group experts, the
                                    Student Assessment Team, and the READ Management Team. Regular
                                    video conferences, conference calls, and occasional retreats were organized
                                    to facilitate communication across these groups and to monitor the quality of
                                    program implementation.

                                    In addition to regular monitoring activities, program results and achievements
                                    were reported through published annual reports, bi-annual grant monitoring
                                    reports, and country presentations during the annual READ Global
                                    Conferences. In 2011, in an effort to demonstrate clear, measureable results
                                    at the country level, a READ Results Framework was established. This
                                    framework draws heavily on the work done under SABER-Student
                                    Assessment and identifies key indicators (e.g., clear policies, effective human
                                    resources) against which to measure progress in developing a country’s
                                    assessment system.

support – Angola, Armenia, Ethiopia, the Kyrgyz
Republic, Mozambique, Tajikistan, Vietnam, and
Zambia. Through a combination of Bank-executed
and Recipient-executed grants, each of these countries
received approximately US$1 to $4 million to support the
further development and strengthening of their assessment
systems. In each country, World Bank Task Team Leaders
and Country Teams worked closely with their respective
government counterparts to develop action plans and
implement a set of agreed-upon activities.

Creating a Results Framework
Establishing a sound assessment system is not easily accomplished within a
few years. Even the best-performing countries have taken decades to firmly
establish their systems and effectively use results in ways that improve overall
education quality. However, the development of the SABER-Student
Assessment tools made it possible to break down various aspects of this
task into manageable steps by identifying key indicators, defining levels of
development on each indicator, and describing what it takes to reach each
level.

In order for the READ Trust Fund to be able to demonstrate measureable
results, a results framework and key indicators against which to measure
progress were established. This framework draws heavily on the benchmarking
tools created under SABER-Student Assessment and summarizes key
indicators common across all four assessment types (see Table 5).


Monitoring and Tracking Progress
The SABER-Student Assessment tools were applied in all eight READ Trust
Fund-supported countries to establish baseline ratings against which to
measure progress. During the first phase of project implementation, the team
conducted a forecasting exercise to get an idea of the results one could
expect by the end of the READ Trust Fund program. When the country
programs reached completion in 2014, the SABER-Student Assessment
tools were applied again to determine the actual level of progress each
country had achieved in further developing their assessment system. Table 6
summarizes the findings of this exercise. (A detailed discussion of the findings
from this benchmarking exercise are available on the READ website in the
report, “Russia Education Aid for Development Trust Fund Program: Results
of the Country Benchmarking Exercise, 2009-2014.”)

The SABER-Student Assessment tools evaluate the overall level of
development of each assessment type (i.e., classroom assessment,
examinations, NLSA, and ILSA) and assign it a developmental rating (i.e.,
latent, emerging, established, or advanced). Within these developmental
ratings, there are a range of possible scores determined by the results in
different key indicators areas (e.g., clear policies, effective human resources,
assessment quality). While the overall developmental rating may not change,
the scores make it possible to track progress and capture movement within
a developmental rating.

                                                   Many of the READ Trust Fund-supported countries began with very latent
                                                   assessment systems or systems that were just emerging. A large portion of
                                                   activities were concentrated on laying important groundwork to systematize
                                                   and institutionalize assessment efforts. During the six years of program
                                                   implementation, many countries piloted new assessment tools – once these
                                                   pilots are brought to scale and operating regularly, the developmental rating
                                                   will be able to advance to the next level. In the meantime, examining the
                                                   changes in each country’s scores over time helps us to see the significant
                                                   impact of the READ Trust Fund program. In the following summaries of the
                                                   country programs, it is clear that all eight beneficiary countries were able to
                                                   develop parts of their assessment systems in significant ways and lay a strong
                                                   foundation for future work.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

When Angola ended its 25-year civil war in 2002, the country needed to
rebuild its education system from the ground up. During the long civil war,
many children did not attend school. The government has been dedicated to
improving its education system in three key areas: 1) expanding school
access; 2) improving the quality of education; and 3) strengthening the
efficiency and equity of the education system at all levels. Since 2002,
Angola’s primary education system has improved dramatically, but much
work remains to establish a strong overall system that ensures quality learning
outcomes. Similar to many other countries, although more children now have
access to school in Angola, many are not necessarily acquiring the expected
basic literacy and numeracy skills.

During the READ Trust Fund program, there was strong commitment from
the highest levels of government in Angola to improve the capacity of the
education system to monitor quality and measure student learning outcomes.
In 2009, at the beginning of the program, Angola’s education system had a
weak assessment culture, no full-time staff trained in assessment, and very
few resources for assessment activities. However, as a result of strong
support from the Ministry of Education, and with the help of READ funds, by
the end of 2014, the country was able to complete its first-ever national
assessment of early-grade reading and lay a strong foundation for future
work in this area.

                                    Program Objectives and Developmental Ratings
                                    The dual objective of the READ Trust Fund program in Angola was 1) to
                                    improve the capacity of the Ministry of Education to assess student learning
                                    outcomes, and 2) to develop a culture of evidence-based decision making. At
                                    the beginning of the program, the baseline diagnostic showed that most
                                    aspects of Angola’s assessment system were at a latent stage of development.
                                    With READ Trust Fund support, Angola chose to focus first on laying a
                                    foundation for NLSA. A key priority was to create a new Assessment Unit
                                    within the Ministry of Education capable of carrying out NLSA activities. After
                                    successfully implementing an early-grade reading assessment (EGRA)
                                    exercise, the Assessment Unit team used the results to inform the design of
                                    various interventions to improve outcomes in reading. By the end of READ, as
                                    demonstrated in Table 7, Angola had made significant progress in laying a
                                    strong foundation for future NLSA exercises.

Program Implementation
The READ Trust Fund program in Angola was implemented in three phases
with the support of three Bank-executed grants. A first grant for US$300,000
supported the diagnostic phase and the creation of an action plan; a second
grant for US$1,005,000 supported capacity-building activities and the
implementation of an EGRA; and a third grant for US$900,000 supported
various EGRA follow-on activities and foundational work in classroom
assessment. Due to the foundational work accomplished under READ, an
IDA credit for Angola’s Learning for All Project was able to leverage an
additional US$9,000,000 for further work on strengthening Angola’s student
assessment system.


Progress by Assessment Type and Key Indicator Areas
Angola’s progress under the READ Trust Fund program has been carefully
monitored using the READ Results Framework and SABER-Student
Assessment benchmarking tools. Table 8 indicates the baseline and end-of-
program scores for Angola based on the results of benchmarking exercises
carried out at the beginning and end of the program. The progress seen is
based on achievements in the key indicator areas being tracked under the
READ Trust Fund program. The activities that Angola carried out under each
key indicator area are described in the next section. Activities that benefited
more than one type of assessment activity are described under a general
category. Activities that benefited a specific type of assessment activity are
described under assessment-specific headings.

                                     Clear Policies
                                     Due to the success of EGRA, a decision was made to implement regular
                                     EGRA and NLSA exercises. Additionally, greater attention is being given to a
                                     policy mandating national examinations in grade 6, which was never
                                     implemented due to logistical issues. A five-year national assessment strategy
                                     for work in each of these areas is under development as part of the Learning
                                     for All Project.

                                     Strong Leadership
                                     High-level education officials, including Vice Ministers of Education and the
                                     National Director, consistently provided strong support for developing
                                     Angola’s assessment system and for the activities implemented with READ
                                     Trust Fund support. In 2010, a workshop led by three Vice Minsters was held
                                     to discuss and validate the findings and proposed action plan from the
                                     baseline diagnostic. This workshop included donor representatives and 100
                                     provincial-level education staff. The Vice Minister responsible for overseeing
                                     assessment activities met regularly with the Assessment Unit and led the
                                     Angolan delegations for several international events, including the 2011 study
                                     visit to Brazil and the READ Global Conferences. Additionally, a report using
                                     the findings from EGRA was produced by this Vice Minister for discussion
                                     with the Minister and Presidency.

                                     Regular Budget
                                     In 2010, a line item for assessment activities was created in the education
                                     budget. Since then, a regular annual budget of around US$1 million has been
                                     allocated to support the development of Angola’s assessment system.

                                     Strong Organizational Structures
                                     In 2010, as a result of the baseline diagnostic, the Ministry of Education issued
                                     a Ministerial decree mandating the creation of a new Assessment Unit. This
                                     unit, called the National Assessment System Technical Group (NASTG),
                                     included a dedicated team of 14 staff from various departments within the
                                     Ministry and was given the mandate to establish and develop the national
                                     assessment system. The five core team members from the National Institute
                                     for Research and Development of Education (INIDE) have been responsible
                                     for leading the group’s work. Under READ, the NASTG benefited from a large
                                     number of hands-on trainings and capacity-building activities. Initially, the
                                     majority of these trainings centered on EGRA. This training was later expanded
                                     to include examinations and classroom assessment. As a result of this

      to ensure quality primary education to all
      Angolan children.”

training, the NASTG was able to lead the preparations and implementation of
an EGRA, with the support of international consultants and World Bank staff.
The NASTG was allocated space within the Ministry, and government funds
have been used to provide them with the necessary equipment. Under the
Learning for All Project, this team has been given overall responsibility for
overseeing all assessment-related activities.

Effective Human Resources
The bulk of effort and funds under the READ program in Angola were spent
on training local staff and building capacity to carry out assessment activities.
These capacity-building activities were in the form of study visits to Brazil,
international conferences on assessment topics, national workshops, and
hands-on trainings. In total, more than 300 key education stakeholders now
have increased capacity to understand and implement assessment activities.

  Study Visits: In March 2011, 21 Ministry of Education staff traveled to
 	
  Pernambuco, Brazil to learn from the country’s assessment practices
  and quality improvement efforts. In order to share these lessons back
  home, a three-day conference, which included more than 150 participants
  from the Ministry of Education, provincial governments, and teacher
  training institutes, was held on the group’s return. This south-south
  collaboration with Brazil gave Angola some key insights on ways to
  develop their assessment system.

                                      assessment system and progress achieved to date under READ. At the
                                      final READ Conference in St. Petersburg, four members of the NASTG
                                      and the Director of INIDE participated in a panel session on the overall
                                      impact of the READ program in Angola. Additionally, in an effort to
                                      connect with the broader assessment community in Africa, four
                                      representatives from the NASTG participated in their first AEAA
                                      Conference in Arusha, Tanzania in 2013 and contributed to the panel
                                      session, “Improving education quality through stronger student

                                    In 2013 and 2014, the Carlos Chagas Foundation from Brazil began to work
                                    closely with the NASTG and other Ministry of Education staff to build their
                                    capacity in classroom assessment. In May 2013, the NASTG hosted a five-day
                                    workshop on classroom assessment and how it can be used to improve
                                    learning outcomes. The workshop was attended by two representatives from
                                    18 of Angola’s teacher training institutions throughout the country. As a result
                                    of the workshop, participants gained a better understanding of effective
                                    classroom assessment practices and tools. The workshop also provided the
                                    foundation for beginning the preparation of pre- and in-service teacher
                                    training modules on classroom assessment.




      “Our EGRA work showed us that it is extremely
      important for us to work with the teachers.
      Teachers should know how they can use the
      results and other materials so they can improve
      their work with individual students.”

Between April and October 2014, work on classroom assessment focused
on the development of learning standards and rubrics for Portuguese and
Mathematics and a training module on classroom assessment in these
subject areas for grades 4 and 6 teachers. Workshops to develop the tools
and build capacity were attended by the 14 NASTG members and 16 Ministry
of Education Portuguese and Mathematics Specialists from both the central
and provincial levels. The final workshop also included representatives from
the 18 teacher-training institutions in order to share the tools developed and
validate the grades 4 and 6 learning standards rubrics. In total, more than 50
people benefitted from these workshops.


Examinations

Effective Human Resources
In October 2013, a nine-day training workshop was conducted for the 14
NASTG members and 20 provincial education staff responsible for overseeing
provincial-level examinations. The purpose of the training was to further
develop capacity in the area of student assessment, with a focus on national
examinations. The workshop targeted the 20 provincial representatives
involved in the production of provincial-level examinations. The objectives of
the training were to help participants: 1) develop knowledge about external
assessments, how they are used, and how they can be implemented; 2)
deepen their understanding of how to design and implement assessments at
a national level; 3) learn about the development of other countries’ assessment
systems, with a focus on the types of assessments used and lessons learned;
and 4) learn how to develop and design assessment tools and items.

In October 2014, six members of the NASTG and six Ministry of Education
specialists in Portuguese and Mathematics traveled to Brazil to learn about
that country’s experience in implementing national examinations.

Effective Human Resources
In 2010 and 2011, a number of workshops were organized in Washington, DC
and Luanda to train the NASTG in the skills necessary to implement an EGRA.
In 2010, staff participated in three different workshops – on sampling, data
entry, and data cleaning and analysis – in order to prepare for the pilot
exercise. Following the pilot, in 2011, the team participated in another three
workshops to prepare for the full-scale EGRA. During these workshops, the
staff reviewed the EGRA instruments, created the final sample design, and
received additional training on data collection and software. A total of 75
teachers and teacher trainees were also trained in how to administer the
assessment. During the preparations for EGRA, more than 100 people,
including education authorities and members of teacher-training schools
from the 18 provinces of Angola, received training and started to build

                                    capacity in carrying out assessment activities. After completing the full-scale
                                    implementation of EGRA, members of the NASTG traveled to Washington,
                                    DC to present their experience and share lessons learned.

                                    Assessment Quality
                                    As part of their capacity-building activities, the Assessment Unit team was
                                    responsible for implementing EGRA on a national scale. In 2011, the team
                                    adapted the tools, created the sample, recruited and trained teacher trainees
                                    to implement the test, oversaw the pilot exercise in three provinces, and
                                    actively participated in the full-scale administration of EGRA in 144 schools
                                    throughout Angola’s 18 provinces. In 2012, the team worked on data cleaning,
                                    analyzed the data, and prepared a report with the final results. This report
                                    established the first baseline data on learning outcomes in Angola. A
                                    workshop was held with 100 provincial education staff members to share
                                    and discuss the results and identify actions for moving forward.

                                    Use of Results
                                    The EGRA results in Angola highlighted the need to improve the teaching and
                                    learning of basic literacy skills and to promote the importance of reading to
                                    parents and the society at large. In order to address some of the gaps
                                    detected by EGRA, the NASTG developed targeted materials for teacher-
                                    training institutions, teachers, and parents. Materials produced included 1) a
                                    “Caderno de Apoio” which emphasizes the importance of teaching literacy
                                    techniques to pre-service teachers; 2) a “Cartilha” of reading activities for
                                    primary school teachers to use in their classrooms to reinforce reading; and
                                    3) a flyer on the importance of reading with useful information for parents and
                                    caregivers. These materials are being used during teacher-training workshops
                                    and other events to address the issue of low literacy outcomes and to provide
                                    specific guidance on what can be done to improve. Work is also underway to
                                    create a series of short, public-awareness videos to be broadcast on national
                                    television as part of a national literacy campaign.

ILSA

Clear Policies
In 2013, Angola’s Ministry of Education decided to initiate participation in its
first ILSA by joining the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring
Educational Quality (SACMEQ). A formal agreement to participate was signed,
although a national policy on participation in this or any other ILSA has yet to
be created. Participation in SACMEQ is being carried out with funds from the
government’s own budget. Upon completion of a full cycle of SACMEQ, it is
expected that Angola’s overall developmental rating and score for ILSA
activity will advance.

Effective Human Resources
Twelve individuals from the NASTG and Ministry of Education have participated
in international meetings and three workshops organized by SACMEQ. These
workshops have covered general issues related to SACMEQ participation as
well as more focused technical discussion on topics such as item construction,
translation, and testing software.

Assessment Quality
Three members of the NASTG have overall responsibility for coordinating
SACMEQ in Angola. Under their guidance, testing instruments have been
developed in Portuguese for the three subject areas to be assessed –
Mathematics, Portuguese, and Life Sciences. SACMEQ is creating the
sample design and administration will take place in 2015.



CONCLUSION

The READ Trust Fund played a critical role in strengthening assessment activity
in Angola. The dual objective of the READ program in Angola was to improve
the capacity of the Ministry of Education to assess student learning outcomes
and to develop a culture of evidence-based decision making. This dual objective
was met. In addition, the success of READ directly led to an IDA credit of
US$75 million for the Angola Learning for All Project of which US$9 million is set
aside to finance further work on establishing Angola’s assessment system.

                                    COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                    Education has been a priority sector for public investment in Armenia since
                                    the late 1990s. The government has implemented a number of reforms to
                                    increase access and improve quality in the education system. However,
                                    despite significant improvements, the country’s education system still faces
                                    challenges in overall learning levels and in the size of equity gaps between
                                    rich and poor students.

                                    Armenia is committed to ensuring an efficient and effective allocation of
                                    resources in education. As a part of this commitment, serious effort has been
                                    given to creating new policies for Armenia’s system of measuring and
                                    monitoring learning outcomes. In order to effectively implement these policies,
                                    the capacity of key stakeholder groups must be improved so that they can
                                    carry out assessment activities in an appropriate manner and link the results
                                    to education policies, practices, and decision making. Through support from
                                    the READ Trust Fund, an extensive training program was carried out in
                                    Armenia to equip these key stakeholder groups with greater capacity in
                                    measuring and using data on learning outcomes.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, RATINGS, AND
PROGRESS (2011-2014)

Program Objectives and Developmental Ratings
The objective of the READ Trust Fund program in Armenia was to enhance
the country’s capacity to design, implement, and use robust national and
international assessment and examination systems; strengthen classroom
assessment practices; and provide channels for feedback, policy analysis,
and recommendations for actions to improve student learning outcomes. For
Armenia, the 2011 baseline results showed that while many of the necessary
policies were in place, there was a need to focus on capacity building and
improving implementation. With READ Trust Fund support, Armenia chose to
primarily concentrate on building capacity across all four assessment types.
By the end of READ, while the overall developmental ratings for Armenia’s
student assessment system remained the same, significant progress had
been made in strengthening the capacity of key stakeholders to effectively
implement assessment activities across the different assessment types.

*The benchmarking tool used to establish the baseline for classroom assessment measured policies, but did not capture the degree to which those
policies were implemented. Questions related to policy implementation were added to a later version of the tool. The original baseline rating for classroom
assessment in Armenia was retroactively adjusted (from Advanced to Established) to account for this change.




Program Implementation
Armenia was invited to become a READ-recipient country in 2011. Given the
shortened timeline compared to other READ-recipient countries, the READ
program in Armenia was implemented with the support of a single
Bank-executed grant. This grant for US$1 million supported the diagnostic
phase, capacity-building activities, designing and piloting assessment
instruments, and activities related to Armenia’s participation in TIMSS. In
2013, a decision was made by the READ Council to allocate an additional
US$400,000 under the grant to allow Armenia to carry out more of the
activities outlined in their action plan. In addition to the work funded by the
READ Trust Fund and regular support from the government, the Ministry of
Education and Science’s State Committee of Science funded a number of
initiatives during this period to strengthen the work of the Assessment and
Testing Center (ATC). Armenia also was a recipient of CICED’s small-grants
program, receiving US$20,000 to make improvements to Russian Language
testing instruments.

                                    Armenia’s’ progress under the READ Trust Fund program has been carefully
                                    monitored using the READ Results Framework and SABER-Student
                                    Assessment benchmarking tools. Table 10 indicates the baseline and end-of-
                                    program scores for Armenia based on the results of benchmarking exercises
                                    carried out at the beginning and end of the program. The progress seen is
                                    based on achievements in the key indicator areas being tracked under the
                                    READ Trust Fund program. The activities that Armenia carried out under
                                    each key indicator area are described in the next section. Activities that
                                    benefited more than one type of assessment activity are described under a
                                    general category. Activities that benefited a specific type of assessment

                                    In Armenia, the READ Trust Fund program supported a number of capacity-
                                    building activities. Through participation in international conferences on
                                    assessment topics and specialized training courses, more than 100 key
                                    education stakeholders have increased their capacity to carry out assessment
                                    activities.

  Conferences: Delegations from Armenia’s Ministry of Education and
 	
  other key agencies participated in a number of international events on
  assessment topics. These events included the 2011 and 2014 READ
  Global Conferences, the 2012 READ Regional Workshop, the 2012 and
  2013 IAEA Conferences, and the 2012 and 2013 EAOKO Conferences. At
  each of these events, delegations of key education officials and
  representatives from Armenia’s ATC delivered presentations on the READ
  Trust Fund program in Armenia and the progress achieved. Also, in 2012,
  the Head of the Training Department of the ATC attended courses as part
  of the Master’s program in Educational Evaluation and Assessment at the
  Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences in Russia. READ funds
  were also used to support the participation of one education official at a
  seminar on “Contemporary issues in planning and formation of rankings
  in education.” All of these events have enhanced Armenia’s understanding
  of key issues in assessment and further developed its capacity to carry
  out assessment activities.

  Master’s Course: To further institutionalize efforts to build assessment
 	
  capacity in Armenia, work was completed on developing a Master’s
  program in education that incorporates courses on student assessment.
  In 2013, a report on international best practices and an implementation
  plan with program specifications and course content for such a Master’s
  program was prepared and discussed with universities in Armenia. In
  2014, the content of the program was agreed upon by the Deputy Minister,
  and the State Linguistic University was selected through a competitive
  process to be a partner to Durham University in the United Kingdom in
  implementing the program.

Classroom Assessment

Effective Human Resources
The READ Trust Fund program supported efforts to improve classroom
assessment practices in Armenia, including the development of training
courses to ensure that teachers develop skills and expertise in classroom
assessment. In 2012, two reports were produced on this topic. The first
report identified and evaluated current opportunities for pre- and in-service
teacher training on classroom assessment in Armenia. The second report
outlined different options for revising/designing pre- and in-service teacher
training on classroom assessment in Armenia in order to address the
country’s needs and incorporate international best practices. Drawing on the
information in these reports, training courses on classroom assessment and
examinations were developed for both pre-service and in-service teachers.

                                      lecturers to deliver the training developed for pre-service teachers and
                                      enable them to lead the implementation of these new modules in their
                                      pre-service training institutions. The Ministry of Education and Science
                                      provided the training material to 10 universities that conduct pre-service
                                      teacher training, and two of these have agreed to pilot this new training
                                      program in their universities.

                                      In-Service Teachers: To pilot and further develop the training modules
                                     	
                                      for in-service teachers, three workshops were held for 25 Armenian
                                      teachers. These 25 lead teachers represented the 25 different high
                                      schools and general education schools included in the pilot. During these
                                      workshops, the lead teachers were trained as trainers for the in-service
                                      modules and then made responsible for delivering the training in their
                                      respective schools. Based on the success of the pilot, additional in-service
                                      trainings are expected to be implemented throughout the entire school
                                      system.

                                    Quality Assurance
                                    In an attempt to ensure quality, reduce the perceived level of malpractice
                                    associated with the current system, and increase public confidence in the
                                    integrity of the school leaving and university entrance examinations, a
                                    feasibility study was conducted on the possibility of introducing computer-
                                    adaptive testing (CAT) and computer-based testing for the Unified Examination
                                    in Armenia. As a part of this study, a number of reports were produced,
                                    including a report outlining the priorities of the Government of Armenia for the
                                    Unified Examination system and the goals the Government would like to
                                    achieve by introducing CAT to this system; a report on the definition, use, and
                                    implementation of CAT; and a report that outlines different scenarios and cost
                                    estimates for introducing CAT to the Unified Examination system. Additionally,
                                                                          COUNTRY-LEVEL RESULTS – ARMENIA   57



a background paper on the Georgian experience with CAT was completed to
inform Armenia’s possible adoption of this technology. Based on the
information provided, the Ministry of Education and Science and ATC are
discussing what actions to take to continue to improve the current system.

NLSA

Effective Human Resources
In the area of NLSA, an intensive training program on large-scale assessment
was developed and delivered to 45 participants from the ATC, universities,
and other units within the Ministry of Education and Science. There were six
different workshops in total, covering the following topics – general statistics,
item analysis, test and questionnaire development, and national assessment
for educational policymakers. Additionally, in 2013, a delegation of officials
responsible for large-scale assessment traveled to New Jersey to participate
in a tailored training provided by ETS. As a result of these trainings, the
capacity of existing specialists responsible for overseeing large-scale
assessment activities was enhanced.

Alignment with Learning Goals
The READ Trust Fund supported the application of the CICED-sponsored ICT
Literacy Test to grade 9 students in Armenia as a way to assess their
competencies in using modern information and computer technologies. In
2013, after adapting the tools to the Armenian context, a pilot of the test took
place. The results of the pilot were analyzed and adjustments made in order
to create the final version of the assessment for Armenia. In 2014, the ICT
Literacy Test was administered to a nationally-representative sample of 2,400
students from all regions of Armenia. The results of this survey are being used
to inform policy choices in the area of integrating ICT policies in education.




                                  “We think that the ICT testing will help us adjust
                                  our curriculum in that area. We saw that the
                                  schools and children most successful on those
                                  tests worked with ICT not only one hour a week
                                  but where ICT was integrated into other subjects
                                  and disciplines.”

                                    Assessment Quality
                                    In order to help Armenia expand its ongoing NLSA program, READ funds
                                    were used to support the design and development of a questionnaire and
                                    testing instrument to assess grade 8 students in the areas of Armenian,
                                    Literature, and History. This program, known as the Trends in Armenistic
                                    Subject Studies, underwent a pre-pilot in 2014. For the pre-pilot, the data
                                    were cleaned, a statistical analysis of the results was completed, and a final
                                    report prepared. The full pilot and main survey will be prepared after analysis
                                    and refinement of the instrument is complete. It is expected that the ATC will
                                    implement the main survey in 2015.

                                    With READ Trust Fund support, Armenia’s participation in the Trends in
                                    International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2011 was finalized and
                                    preparations were made for TIMSS 2015. The preparatory work for TIMSS
                                    2015 included tailored training for ATC staff and other assessment specialists
                                    by international consultants and experts from the Data Processing and
                                    Research Center of the International Association for the Evaluation of
                                    Education. The training covered topics such as using TIMSS data for
                                    secondary analysis and writing thematic reports with TIMSS data. The READ
                                    grant also supported the National Research Coordinator’s attendance at
                                    three planning meetings for TIMSS 2015.

                                    Use of Results
                                    TIMSS 2011 country results were discussed with the Ministry of Education
                                    and Science and ATC staff. An article with the results that was tailored to key
                                    stakeholders was published and disseminated to inform education policy
                                    making, curriculum, and teacher training.



                                    CONCLUSION

                                    Through support from the READ Trust Fund, an extensive training program is
                                    taking place in Armenia to equip various stakeholders with greater capacity
                                    in measuring and using data on learning outcomes. Through the training
                                    courses developed, both pre- and in-service teachers are acquiring the skills
                                    necessary to carry out formative and summative assessments in their
                                    classrooms and education officials tasked with implementing NLSA have
                                    greater capacity in areas such as such as statistics and item analysis. The
                                    effectiveness of Armenia’s assessment system will continue to improve as it
                                    develops a strong cadre of people across the entire education system with
                                    the requisite skills to implement assessment activities and use the results to
                                    inform their education practices.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa, with 80 percent of its
population living in rural areas. Although the education system in Ethiopia has
undergone impressive expansion, it still faces serious challenges, particularly
in the area of quality. The Government of Ethiopia sees education as a means
to eradicate poverty, but realizes that this will only occur if the education
system delivers a quality educational experience that promotes learning.

Since 2009, the main source of funding for general education in Ethiopia has
come from the multi-donor-financed General Education Quality Improvement
Program (GEQIP). Total funds available through GEQIP I and II reach nearly
US$1 billion. This program is expansive and covers nearly all aspects of the
education system, including the area of assessment. Some of the main
challenges for Ethiopia to overcome in the area of assessment have been the
lack of policies, unclear lines of responsibility, irregular funding, and low
technical capacity. The funds made available through READ were targeted to
support activities to strengthen existing institutions responsible for measuring
learning outcomes and to establish new ones where necessary. Through a
combination of these activities and work done by other donors, by the end of
2014, Ethiopia was able to significantly advance the development of its
assessment system.

                                                   Program Objectives and Developmental Ratings
                                                   The objective of the READ Trust Fund program in Ethiopia was to help
                                                   strengthen existing or develop new institutions for measuring and assessing
                                                   student achievement in order to improve education quality and student
                                                   learning outcomes. At the beginning of the program, the baseline results
                                                   indicated that for Ethiopia, both classroom assessment and ILSA activities
                                                   were at a latent stage of development, NLSA was emerging, and examinations
                                                   were established. Coordinating with other donors working on education,
                                                   READ Trust Fund–supported activities focused on further strengthening the
                                                   areas of classroom assessment, examinations, NLSA, and school inspection.
                                                   (School inspection contributes directly to education quality, but was not one
                                                   of the areas formally tracked under the READ Results Framework.) By the
                                                   end of READ, as demonstrated in Table 11, Ethiopia had made significant
                                                   progress in laying a strong foundation for classroom assessment and NLSA,
                                                   and also improved its system for examinations.

Program Implementation
The READ Trust Fund program in Ethiopia was implemented with the support
of two Bank-executed grants. The first grant of US$291,000 supported the
diagnostic phase. In addition to conducting an overall benchmarking exercise,
in-depth studies were conducted in the areas of examinations, NLSA, and
school inspection. The findings from these studies were used to develop
detailed action plans. A second grant for US$800,000 supported
implementation of the action plans, including developing formal policy
frameworks, establishing clear institutional arrangements, and building
greater capacity to carry out assessment activities. Although not included
initially, over time the Ministry came to recognize the importance of classroom
assessment and teacher guides, and training was subsequently provided in
this area as well. All of the activities completed with READ Trust Fund support
were designed to complement activities taking place under GEQIP I and II.


Progress by Assessment Type and Key Indicator Areas
Ethiopia’s progress under the READ Trust Fund program has been carefully
monitored using the READ Results Framework and SABER-Student
Assessment benchmarking tools. Table 12 indicates the baseline and end-of-
program scores for Ethiopia based on the results of benchmarking exercises
carried out at the beginning and end of the program. The progress seen is
based on achievements in the key indicator areas being tracked under the
READ Trust Fund program. The activities that Ethiopia carried out under each
key indicator area are described in the next section. Activities that benefited
more than one type of assessment activity are described under a general
category. Activities that benefited a specific type of assessment activity are
described under assessment-specific headings. Activities related to school
inspection also have been included.

                                    A number of workshops were held in Ethiopia with the purpose of drafting
                                    and endorsing new policy and procedural frameworks for each target area. In
                                    August 2010, a workshop attended by approximately 60 key education
                                    officials was held to discuss the findings of the NLSA in-depth review. In
                                    February 2011, a similar workshop was held to discuss the findings of the
                                    school inspection report. Once new policies and frameworks had been
                                    drafted in each area, a series of validation workshops were held to review and
                                    endorse them. The first of these workshops, conducted in October 2012,
                                    focused on reviewing the school inspection framework and guidelines. More
                                    than 20 representatives from the Ministry of Education and Regional Education
                                    Bureaus were in attendance. A joint review of the draft policy frameworks for
                                    examinations and NLSA was held in December 2013. Given the presence of
                                    the Minister of Education at this workshop, along with at least 35 other
                                    education department heads and officials from the Regional Education
                                    Bureaus, action was also taken to seek endorsement of a draft manual on
                                    classroom assessment for primary and secondary teachers. In March 2014,
                                    two final validation workshops took place – one to validate the school
                                    inspection framework and data collection checklist for Alternative Basic
                                    Education, and the other to validate the school inspection framework and
                                    data collection checklist for Early Childhood Care and Education. Again, each
                                    of these workshops was attended by at least 30 key education officials from
                                    the Ministry of Education and Regional Education Bureaus.

                                    As a result of these six workshops led by the Minister of Education and other
                                    high-level education officials, there has been greater awareness, leadership,
                                    and support to develop Ethiopia’s systems for assessment and school
                                    inspection. In total, more than 150 education leaders in Ethiopia have been
                                    actively engaged in carrying this work forward.




      “In Ethiopia, READ played a paramount role,
      especially in bringing about unified and [clearly]
      defined institutional arrangements for
      assessment.”
      – Ethiopian Delegation, Fourth READ Global Conference
                                                                          COUNTRY-LEVEL RESULTS – ETHIOPIA   63



Strong Organizational Structures
In order to establish clear institutional arrangements for assessment activities,
a new agency was created in 2012. This agency, the National Educational
Assessment and Examinations Agency (NEAEA), is autonomous, led by a
board, and responsible for both national examinations and NLSA. These new
institutional arrangements greatly improved the enabling context for carrying
out assessment activities in Ethiopia.

Effective Human Resources
Through participating in international conferences and workshops, study
visits, and specialized trainings, more than 400 education leaders and
practitioners in Ethiopia are now more aware of key issues in assessment and
able to implement assessment-related activities. Capacity-building activities
that benefited more than one assessment type include:

  Conferences: With READ Trust Fund support, nearly 100 staff members
 	
  working on NLSA, national examinations, and school inspection were
  able to participate in international events on assessment topics.
  Delegations of up to six staff members working in these areas attended
  each of the annual READ Global Conferences and the 2012 READ
  Regional Workshop in Mozambique. READ funds were also used to
  support Ethiopia’s participation in three other assessment-related events
  in Africa. The first of these was the 2010 Users and Uses of Assessment
  Information Workshop in South Africa. Then, in 2013, a small delegation
  represented Ethiopia at its first ever AEAA Conference, which was held in
  Arusha, Tanzania. Following this conference, a workshop (“The Role of
  Assessment in Quality of Education in Ethiopia: Challenges and the Way
  Forward” ) was held to share lessons learned from the event with more
  than 50 of Ethiopia’s education leaders. During this workshop, the
  decision was made for Ethiopia to become a full-time member of the
  AEAA. In 2014, Ethiopia attended its second AEAA Conference in
  Livingstone, Zambia with an even larger delegation of education officials
  and as full members of the association. These events were effective in
  connecting Ethiopia with the broader assessment community in Africa
  and creating additional professional networks for NEAEA and school
  inspection staff.

  Study Visit: In May 2012, five NEAEA staff participated in a study visit to
 	
  South Africa as a way to learn from that country’s assessment practices
  and identify lessons for Ethiopia. This south-south collaboration with
  South Africa gave Ethiopia some key insights on ways to operationalize
  their newly-created assessment agency, NEAEA.

                                      Training for NEAEA staff: To further build the capacity of NEAEA staff,
                                     	
                                      international firms and consultants were hired to provide targeted
                                      technical assistance and training in key areas. In the last half of 2012, 60
                                      NEAEA staff benefited from a month-long, in-depth training in areas such
                                      as item writing, sampling, test administration, data analysis, and reporting
                                      assessment results. This training was provided by ETS and primarily
                                      delivered long distance. Towards the end of the training, three senior staff
                                      from NEAEA traveled to ETS headquarters in Princeton, New Jersey to
                                      participate in an additional week-long leadership and technical training
                                      session. In 2014, another series of training events was provided by the
                                      American Institutes for Research. In April, a targeted training on sampling,
                                      data analysis, test equating, scaling, standard setting, and reporting was
                                      delivered to seven key technical staff working on NLSA; in August, 22
                                      NEAEA staff received training on item bank development and data
                                      analysis; and in September, a training on standard setting was attended
                                      by more than 150 education staff from NEAEA, the Ministry of Education,
                                      and the Regional Education Bureaus. NEAEA’s increased capacity in
                                      these areas has improved the overall quality of existing assessment
                                      activities.

                                    Assessment Quality
                                    In 2013, work began to determine what was needed to develop sustainable
                                    item banks for both the NLSA and national examinations. Having item banks
                                    in place would greatly enhance future activities in these areas through the
                                    provision of a secure source of pre-screened test items with known technical
                                    characteristics. With READ Trust Fund support, a scoping study on item
                                    bank development was completed in 2014. The work to develop an item bank
                                    is now continuing with the support of GEQIP.

Classroom Assessment

Clear Policies
In Ethiopia, the Curriculum Framework for K-12 outlines what students are
expected to learn at different grade levels. Under GEQIP, textbooks and
teacher guides for nearly all primary and secondary subject areas have been
made available. In 2014, a new manual with guidelines on classroom
assessment for teachers was created by NEAEA staff. This “Classroom
Assessment Manual for Primary and Secondary School Teachers” includes
guidelines such as scoring criteria and rubrics for grading student work. The
manual was validated in late 2013 during a workshop supported by the READ
Trust Fund.

Effective Human Resources
In January and February 2014, two rounds of a “training of trainers” were
conducted for 70 NEAEA, Ministry of Education, Regional Education Bureau,
University, and Teacher Training College staff on the manual for classroom
assessment. Later in 2014, workshops on the manual were also provided for
some teachers.

Assessment Quality
Classroom assessment was included as one of the five domains covered by
the School Inspection Framework, which was developed with the support of
the READ Trust Fund. Additionally, classroom assessment has been included
as a required component of teacher supervision and performance evaluations.
With the support of GEQIP, a manual with information on classroom
assessment and a related training module was developed for teacher
supervisors.

Examinations

Clear Policies
With the support of the READ program, a national policy framework for
national examinations was developed. An in-depth review of Ethiopia’s system
for national examinations was completed in 2011. Based on the findings and
recommendations of this review, a policy framework with guidelines for the
grades 8, 10, and 12 examinations was created and then adopted by the
Ministry in 2013.

                                    Clear Policies
                                    An in-depth review of NLSA activities was conducted in 2010. Based on the
                                    findings of this review, work began to establish a clear policy for activity in this
                                    area moving forward. In 2013, a policy and procedural framework for NLSA
                                    was authorized and adopted by the Ministry of Education and NEAEA. The
                                    policy framework includes guidelines on the governance of the NLSA, who
                                    and what should be assessed, the frequency of administration, and how
                                    results should be used and communicated to stakeholders.

                                    Regular Budget
                                    In the past, funding for NLSA activities was irregular and came on an ad-hoc
                                    basis from either the Ministry of Education or international donors. With the
                                    creation of the NEAEA in 2012, a dedicated line item for NLSA activities was
                                    added to the budget and this area now receives a regular annual budget.

                                    School Inspection

                                    Clear Policies
                                    At the beginning of the READ program, activities to monitor education quality
                                    in Ethiopian schools were mostly undertaken on an ad hoc basis and not
                                    institutionalized in the education system. Education leaders recognized the
                                    need to develop a more coherent national system for inspecting schools and
                                    monitoring education quality. In 2010, an in-depth review of school inspection
                                    practices in Ethiopia was completed. Drawing on the findings of this report, a
                                    policy framework, guidelines, and school classification standards were
                                    created to govern work in this area.

                                    Strong Organizational Structures
                                    With the support of the READ Trust Fund, a new directorate dedicated to
                                    school inspection was established within Ethiopia’s Ministry of Education in
                                    2012. This directorate includes 10 staff members fully dedicated to school
                                    inspection activities.

                                    Effective Human Resources
                                    In 2011, before the Directorate for School Inspection was established, three
                                    Ministry of Education staff went on a study visit to Ghana to learn how this
                                    country conducts its school inspections and to incorporate the lessons
                                    learned into the design of Ethiopia’s new directorate. In 2012 and 2013, after
                                    the Directorate for School Inspections was established, more than 60 Ministry
                                    of Education staff at the central and regional levels received training in how to
                                    implement and use the newly-created school inspection framework and
                                    guidelines.

   	the school is performing above the standard (grade 3)
   	the school is performing well above the standard (grade 4)

  Inspectors also make an assessment of the school as a whole, using the same
  scale




Assessment Quality
As part of the pilot of the new school inspection activities, nearly 28,000
schools completed a self-assessment exercise that measured school quality
against the standards in the school inspection framework. On-going school
inspection activities are now taking place with the support of GEQIP.



CONCLUSION

The objective of the READ Trust Fund program in Ethiopia was to help
strengthen existing or develop new institutions for measuring and assessing
student achievement in order to improve education quality and student
learning outcomes. As a direct result of the work accomplished under READ,
Ethiopia now has a new agency and a new Directorate within the Ministry of
Education, both of which are completely dedicated to monitoring education
quality and assessing student achievement. The policy frameworks, stable
funding, strong organizational structures, and trained staff together create a
strong foundation for work in the area of student assessment.

                                    COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                    The quality of education in the Kyrgyz Republic was dramatically impacted by
                                    the collapse of the Soviet Union. To reverse the decline in education quality,
                                    the government and development partners began working together to
                                    modernize the Kyrgyz education system. A number of reforms were
                                    implemented by the Ministry of Education and Science in an effort to
                                    strengthen the system and improve quality.

                                    Given all of these targeted efforts to improve education quality, the country
                                    was shocked when it received the results from the 2006 and 2009 PISA
                                    exercises and discovered that, in each instance, the Kyrgyz Republic ranked
                                    last out of all participating countries. The government realized that, in addition
                                    to collecting system-level data on learning outcomes, there was a serious
                                    need to actively monitor and support the education process in classrooms.
                                    With the support of the READ Trust Fund, the Kyrgyz Republic has been
                                    placing an even greater emphasis on regular, high-quality, formative
                                    assessment in the classroom. A new national assessment strategy highlights
                                    the importance of formative, summative, and system-level assessments all
                                    working together to reach the government’s goal of quality learning for all
                                    Kyrgyz children.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, RATINGS, AND
PROGRESS (2009-2014)

Program Objectives and Developmental Ratings
The main objective of the READ Trust Fund program in the Kyrgyz Republic
was to strengthen the capacity of institutions responsible for measuring
student learning outcomes, and improve the use of information from those
assessments to improve teaching and learning. At the beginning of the
program, the baseline diagnostic showed that examinations, NLSA, and ILSA
were all emerging, while the weakest area was classroom assessment. With
READ Trust Fund support, the Kyrgyz Republic chose to focus primarily on
classroom assessment, while making concerted efforts to continue
strengthening the other assessment areas as well. The main activities carried
out under READ included capacity building in classroom assessment,
developing a new school leaving examination for grade 11, administering an
NLSA in grade 4, and developing a new national assessment strategy. By the
end of READ, the Kyrgyz Republic had made the most progress in classroom
assessment. As demonstrated in Table 13, the level of development for this
area went from latent to emerging. While small improvements were also made
in the areas of examinations and NLSA, they were insufficient to change the
developmental ratings for these areas. The Kyrgyz Republic put on hold its
participation in ILSAs in 2009 (linked to its performance on PISA 2006 and
2009), and hence its progress in this area retreated from emerging to latent.
However, a recent decision was made by the Minister of Education and Science
to resume work in this area and the country will participate in PISA 2018.

                                    Program Implementation
                                    READ Trust Fund-sponsored activities in the Kyrgyz Republic were
                                    implemented with the support of two Bank-executed and one Recipient-
                                    executed grant. A first grant for US$350,000 supported the diagnostic phase
                                    and the creation of an action plan. The other two grants were a combination
                                    of a Recipient-executed grant for $1,650,000 and a Bank-executed grant for
                                    US$350,000. The Recipient-executed grant primarily supported capacity-
                                    building activities for classroom assessment, the development of a new
                                    school leaving examination, and the implementation of an NLSA in grade 4;
                                    the Bank-executed grant primarily supported supervision activities and
                                    participation in international learning events.

                                    Implementation of the READ Trust Fund program in the Kyrgyz Republic was
                                    seriously delayed due to the April 7 revolution in 2010. In 2011, the program
                                    began to get back on track and steps were taken to finalize the action plan
                                    and other activities started earlier. In early 2013, the action plan received the
                                    necessary parliamentary ratification and the program went into full-scale
                                    implementation. Despite this shortened timeline for implementation, all
                                    activities were successfully completed before the end of the READ Trust
                                    Fund program.

Progress by Assessment Type and Key Indicator Areas
The Kyrgyz Republic’s progress under the READ Trust Fund program has
been carefully monitored using the READ Results Framework and SABER-
Student Assessment benchmarking tools. Table 14 indicates the baseline
and end-of-program scores for the Kyrgyz Republic based on the results of
benchmarking exercises carried out at the beginning and end of the program.
The progress seen is based on achievements in the key indicator areas being
tracked under the READ Trust Fund program. The activities that the Kyrgyz
Republic carried out under each key indicator area are described in the next
section. Activities that benefited more than one type of assessment activity
are described under a general category. Activities that benefited a specific
type of assessment activity are described under assessment-specific
headings.

General

Clear Policies
In 2011, more than 40 representatives from all major stakeholder groups,
including the Ministry of Education and Science, the Kyrgyz Academy of
Education (KAE), the Educational Committee of the Kyrgyz Parliament, the
Educational Assessment Unit, education NGOs, and development partners,
participated in two workshops. These workshops were used to validate the
findings of the self-diagnosis exercise and agree on an overall vision for further
strengthening the country’s student assessment system.

Then, in 2014, a working group created under the Ministry of Education and
Science to oversee READ-funded activities, along with two international
assessment experts, came together to develop a new national assessment
strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic. This strategy document outlines a new
vision and roadmap for an enhanced national assessment system – one that
supports the government’s goal of improving learning for all Kyrgyz children.
The proposed strategy has been endorsed by the Ministry of Education and
Science for further discussion, along with the development of related policy
documents for each of the different types of assessment activities.

Strong Organizational Structures
In 2009, international experts conducted a detailed analysis of the two
institutions formally charged with the responsibility of carrying out assessment
activities – the National Testing Center (NTC) and KAE’s Education Assessment
Unit. The analysis assessed the strengths and weaknesses of these two
institutions and provided recommendations for further strengthening and
alignment. This report was a key input to the development of the final action
plan.

                                    Effective Human Resources
                                    Through READ Trust Fund support, representatives from the Kyrgyz
                                    Republic’s Ministry of Education and Science and key assessment institutions
                                    participated in a series of learning events aimed at deepening their
                                    understanding of key issues in assessment and the importance of monitoring
                                    education quality. These learning events included attendance at international
                                    conferences on assessment topics, a study visit, and specific training
                                    courses. As a result, a critical mass of education officials and assessment
                                    practitioners have increased capacity to carry out assessment-related
                                    activities.

                                      Conferences: READ funds enabled delegations of four to six key
                                     	
                                      education officials to participate in each of the annual READ Global
                                      Conferences, the READ Regional Workshop in 2012, two IAEA
                                      Conferences in 2012 and 2013, and two EAOKO Conferences in 2012
                                      and 2013. During each of these events, delegates delivered presentations
                                      on the progress achieved to date in further developing the Kyrgyz
                                      Republic’s assessment system. At the final READ Global Conference in
                                      St. Petersburg, the entire delegation participated in a panel session on
                                      the overall impact of the READ Trust Fund program and presented a
                                      short video demonstrating key achievements under the program in the
                                      Kyrgyz Republic.
                                                                COUNTRY-LEVEL RESULTS – KYRGYZ REPUBLIC   73



  Study Visit: In April 2011, a group of seven key education leaders went
 	
  on a study visit to the Central Institute for Test Development in the
  Netherlands where they learned how to use large-scale assessments to
  improve learning, and how to conduct independent, summative classroom
  assessments.

  Training Courses: From 2009–2014, between five and ten (depending
 	
  on the training session in question) assessment specialists from KAE and
  the Ministry of Education and Science participated in a series of trainings
  offered by the Russian Academy of Education’s Training Center and the
  Higher School of Economics in Moscow. Through these trainings,
  participants gained a better understanding of how to design an effective
  assessment system at both the national and subnational levels, and how
  to use computers to conduct psychometric analysis of test results.
  Representatives from the Kyrgyz Republic also traveled to Armenia to
  participate in a training on education quality and the use of assessment
  results.

Use of Results
In 2011, an in-depth secondary analysis of the Kyrgyz Republic’s results from
PISA 2006 and 2009 as well as its 2007 and 2009 NLSA exercises was
conducted by two international assessment specialists. This analytical work
aimed to identify the main factors underpinning the scores in Reading,
Mathematics, and Science and to provide recommendations for policy action.

Classroom Assessment

Clear Policies
In addition to system-level curriculum and learning standards documents that
outline what students are expected to learn, a manual with guidelines for
teachers on classroom assessment was developed in 2014. This manual,
created by KAE, includes guidelines for what should be assessed, uses of
assessment information, and formats for assessment questions and tasks.
More than 90,000 copies of these manuals were distributed during in-service
training sessions and provided to national and regional teacher-training
institutions to be incorporated into their training for pre-service teachers. This
manual and related training materials were also made available online to
support teachers in their use of classroom assessments.

                                    Effective Human Resources
                                    A key focus of READ Trust Fund-supported activities in the Kyrgyz Republic
                                    was to improve teachers’ capacity to carry out classroom-based assessments.
                                    In 2013, KAE developed a training program on classroom assessment for
                                    lead teachers and primary teachers. Two rounds of the five-day training for
                                    lead teachers were delivered to 53 lead teachers selected from all seven
                                    provinces. Then, in late 2013 and 2014, the lead teachers delivered 158
                                    different three-day training sessions for primary school teachers. By August
                                    2014, this training to ensure that teachers develop skills and expertise in
                                    classroom assessment had been delivered to more than 6,200 primary
                                    school teachers.

                                    Based on feedback from teachers, the training course materials were revised.
                                    In 2014, KAE authorized these materials to be formalized into a 10-hour
                                    training course for in-service teachers and a 60-hour training module for
                                    pre-service teachers. The teacher education curriculum was updated and
                                    these courses are now part of the regular curriculum for in-service and
                                    pre-service training institutes.




      “ [READ] helped us to develop tests [for] the
      new generation that allow us to identify
      students’ competencies and how well they can
      apply their knowledge in the practical world.”

Assessment Quality
With the support of the READ Trust Fund, an innovative program developed
by ETS to support teachers in conducting classroom-based assessments
was translated into Russian. This program, called CBAL, which stands for
“Cognitively Based Assessment of, for, and as Learning,” was adapted for
training on classroom-based assessment in both Mathematics and Reading.
Training was provided to NTC staff and a select group of teachers, with a view
to future adoption across the education system.

Examinations

Effective Human Resources
In order to develop a new school leaving examination for grade 11, international
and national experts were hired to train 15 NTC staff and 30 subject experts
on test theory, statistical analysis, item development, and test administration.
As a result of this training, a new school leaving examination was developed
for mandatory (Kyrgyz Language and Literature, Uzbek Language and
Literature, Russian, Mathematics, and National History) and optional (Biology,
Chemistry, Geography, Physics, and Foreign Languages – English, French,
and German) subjects in the national curriculum. Additionally, 100 school
administrators received training on this newly-developed school leaving
examination.

System Alignment
In the past, the school leaving examination was well-aligned with the official
curriculum. That curriculum was more knowledge-based and the examinations
focused primarily on memorization and the reproduction of knowledge.
However, in 2011, a new competency-based curriculum was introduced. This
curriculum requires a new approach to developing testing instruments that
will allow for the assessment of students’ competencies. With READ Trust
Fund support, the NTC worked to develop a new examination that is better
aligned with these ongoing curriculum changes.

Assessment Quality
In 2014, after a field trial to validate the new testing instrument, the examination
was piloted in 200 schools in the Talas Region. The NTC analyzed the results
of this pilot exercise and prepared a final report to share with schools,
teachers, and other stakeholders. Discussions are ongoing about these
potential changes and improvements to the existing school leaving
examination.

                                    Assessment Quality
                                    The Center for Educational Assessment and Teaching Methods (CEATM), an
                                    independent firm not linked to the Ministry of Education and Science, is the
                                    institution responsible for carrying out NLSAs in the Kyrgyz Republic. Building
                                    on previous NLSA rounds conducted in 2007 and 2009, and with the support
                                    of the READ Trust Fund, CEATM implemented another NLSA of Reading,
                                    Mathematics, and Science in grade 4. In 2013, CEATM worked together with
                                    primary school teachers and assessment experts in the Ministry of Education
                                    and Science to develop updated versions of the testing instruments and
                                    questionnaires. A pilot to validate the new tools was conducted in 20 schools
                                    from two different regions. Based on the results, the main survey instruments
                                    were finalized. In April 2014, the NLSA was implemented in a randomly-
                                    selected sample of 204 primary schools across the country. In August 2014,
                                    CEATM finalized the analysis of the results and prepared the final report for
                                    dissemination to key stakeholders. During previous NLSA rounds, few
                                    documents were available to the public on the more technical aspects of the
                                    NLSA exercise. The report produced for 2014 provides information on these
                                    technical aspects, including test specifications, item construction, analysis of
                                    the pilot results, and scoring criteria. This enhanced reporting improves the
                                    ability to ensure the quality of NLSA activities.

                                    Use of Results
                                    Although the Ministry of Education and Science supported the 2007 and
                                    2009 NLSA activities, the results were not optimally disseminated to the
                                    different stakeholder groups and rarely used in decision-making. In 2014,
                                    CEATM’s analysis of the results included disaggregation by subject, languages
                                    of instruction (Kyrgyz, Russian, and Uzbek), gender, school location, and
                                    region. In addition, secondary analysis of the questionnaire data for students,
                                    teachers, and school administrators was conducted to identify the key
                                    determinants that had the greatest effect on learning outcomes. This
                                    breakdown of results was used to determine concrete actions for the Ministry
                                    of Education and Science to take moving forward. Reports on these results
                                    were prepared in both Kyrgyz and Russian and delivered to regional education
                                    administrators, schools, and teacher training institutes. In addition to the
                                    official report, presentations on the results were delivered to schools and
                                    regional and local education authorities.

CONCLUSION

The READ Trust Fund program in the Kyrgyz Republic played a catalytic role
in promoting the importance of assessment and monitoring student learning
outcomes. The new strategy document provides a clearer vision and roadmap
for developing a national assessment system and KAE, the NTC, CEATM,
and teacher training institutions all have more clearly defined mandates. Due
to the training provided in classroom assessment, more than 6,200 primary
school teachers are better equipped to incorporate formative assessment
into their teaching practices. The new guidelines for teachers, other materials,
and training courses for both in-service and pre-service teachers better
ensure that teachers will develop the requisite skills and provide more regular
and systematic monitoring of learning in the classroom.

                                    COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                    Since 2000, Mozambique’s education system has undergone rapid expansion
                                    and the number of students participating in primary education has more than
                                    doubled. The education system has struggled to keep up with this demand,
                                    resulting in shortages of teachers and other resources that have negatively
                                    impacted education quality. The government’s vision for its education system
                                    includes access, equity, and quality goals and efforts have been made to
                                    establish a system to monitor learning outcomes.

                                    At the beginning of the READ Trust Fund, national examinations, NLSA, and
                                    ILSA were taking place in Mozambique, but they were irregular and failed to
                                    interconnect as a cohesive system. In addition, there was little evidence that
                                    assessment results were being used to improve education quality. With the
                                    support of the READ Trust Fund, the technical capacity of those responsible
                                    for designing and implementing assessment activities was greatly enhanced
                                    and a new classroom-based assessment tool for teachers was developed.
                                    Overall, the quality of assessment activities in Mozambique greatly improved
                                    during the lifetime of the READ program and there is now a culture within the
                                    Ministry of Education where assessment results are valued and used to
                                    inform policy dialogue and education reforms.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, RATINGS, AND
PROGRESS (2009-2014)

Program Objectives and Developmental Ratings
The objective of the READ Trust Fund program in Mozambique was to
improve the Ministry of Education’s technical and institutional capacity to
assess student learning outcomes. This included improving the quality of
assessment work, aligning assessment-related activities with national learning
goals, and helping to create a culture where assessment results are valued
by education stakeholders at all levels. At the beginning of the program, the
baseline diagnostic indicated that most aspects of Mozambique’s assessment
system were at an emerging level of development. READ Trust Fund–
supported activities primarily focused on building capacity within the Ministry
of Education for work in all assessment areas and developing a new
classroom-based reading assessment tool in grade 3. By the end of READ,
significant progress had been made in all assessment areas and, as
demonstrated in Table 15 above, the level of development of Mozambique’s
examinations program had even shifted to established.

                                    Program Implementation
                                    The READ Trust Fund program in Mozambique was implemented with the
                                    support of three Bank-executed grants. A first grant for US$460,000
                                    supported the diagnostic phase and the creation of an action plan; a second
                                    grant for US$2,031,937 supported capacity-building activities and the
                                    development and implementation of an early-grade reading assessment
                                    called Provinha; and a third grant for US$600,000 provided additional
                                    financing for Provinha-related activities as well as an impact evaluation to
                                    assess the utility of Provinha as a tool to monitor education quality. As a direct
                                    result of the capacity-building activities financed under READ, additional
                                    resources from the Education Sector Support Fund and other donors were
                                    made available to support assessment-related activities, including the
                                    implementation of a NLSA in 2013, and the purchase of new buildings and
                                    equipment for the examinations program.


                                    Progress by Assessment Type and Key Indicator Areas
                                    Mozambique’s progress under the READ Trust Fund program has been
                                    carefully monitored using the READ Results Framework and SABER-Student
                                    Assessment benchmarking tools. Table 16 indicates the baseline and end-of-
                                    program scores for Mozambique based on the results of benchmarking
                                    exercises carried out at the beginning and end of the program. The progress
                                    seen is based on achievements in the key indicator areas being tracked under
                                    the READ Trust Fund program. The activities that Mozambique carried out
                                    under each key indicator area are described in the next section. Activities that
                                    benefited more than one type of assessment activity are described under a
                                    general category. Activities that benefited a specific type of assessment
                                    activity are described under assessment-specific headings.

General

Strong Leadership
Leaders within Mozambique’s Ministry of Education have demonstrated
strong support for developing the country’s assessment system. In October
2009, a workshop was held with key Ministry of Education officials and
international partners to discuss and validate the findings from the baseline
diagnostic and agree on the way forward. Then in 2010, a second national
workshop was organized to bring together 50 Ministry of Education officials
from various departments, with a particular emphasis on those responsible
for planning, curriculum development, and examinations. This workshop
highlighted the need to establish a national assessment system with clear
linkages to the overall work of the Ministry, and to focus greater attention on
the institutional arrangements for various assessment-related activities.

Effective Human Resources
In Mozambique, a significant amount of support under READ was targeted to
building capacity within the Ministry of Education to carry out assessment
activities. These capacity-building activities took place in the form of
international conferences on assessment topics, study visits to Brazil, short
courses on assessment topics, and participation in a Master’s degree
program on Educational Management and Evaluation. This capacity building
and technical assistance provided to the Ministry of Education, and the
National Institute for the Development of Education (INDE) in particular,
directly contributed to being able to make a NLSA program technically
possible for the first time in Mozambique.

  Conferences: As a result of participating in several international learning
 	
  events, more than 50 representatives from Mozambique’s Ministry of
  Education, and INDE and the National Board of Examinations, Certification
  and Equity (CNECE) in particular, have a greater understanding of key
  issues and best practices in assessment. Delegations of five to six
  representatives from the Ministry of Education participated in each of the
  annual READ Global Conferences. At the final READ Conference in St.
  Petersburg, an eight-member delegation participated in a panel session
  on the overall impact of the READ program in Mozambique. In 2012, the
  READ Regional Workshop for Africa was held in Maputo and the team
  had the chance to directly share their experiences implementing Provinha
  with other African countries.



                                 “The Government’s vision puts quality and equity
                                 in basic education at the center of its education
                                 policy. Improvement in access cannot happen
                                 without a substantial improvement in quality.”

                                    READ funds were also used to support Mozambique’s participation in four
                                    other assessment-related events in Africa. In April 2010, several staff from the
                                    Ministry of Education participated in the Users and Uses of Assessment
                                    Information Workshop in South Africa and received training in how to
                                    effectively disseminate NLSA results. Then, in 2011 and 2013, representatives
                                    from INDE and CNECE traveled to Kenya and Tanzania to attend two AEAA
                                    Conferences. In both Kenya and Tanzania, the team had the opportunity to
                                    present papers on assessment topics, discuss regional challenges, and, in
                                    Tanzania, participate in a panel session on READ country-level results. In
                                    Kenya, the team also had the opportunity to visit the Kenya National
                                    Examinations Council to learn about its operations and processes for
                                    administering national examinations. Finally, in preparation for the impact
                                    evaluation supported under READ, a team traveled to Ethiopia to take part in
                                    the workshop, “Evaluating the Impact of Development Programs: Turning
                                    Promises into Evidence.” This workshop provided the six-member team in
                                    attendance with a general overview of impact evaluations and practical
                                    guidance on how to design the impact evaluation for Provinha. Following this
                                    workshop, a training program for 25 Ministry of Education staff directly
                                    involved with Provinha was held in Maputo in October 2012.

                                      Study Visits: In June and August 2010, 12 representatives from INDE
                                     	
                                      and CNECE traveled to Brazil to learn from the country’s experience in
                                      conducting assessments and making effective use of the results. During
                                      these visits, the participants were given opportunities to interact with
                                      assessment experts, school directors, and policymakers, and to make
                                      connections with potential providers of future capacity-building activities.

 	Short Courses: In 2011 and 2012, a team of around 15 staff from INDE,
   CNECE, and key universities participated in three short courses on
   assessment topics. The first two courses took place in Brazil and covered
   the topics of test design, item analysis, statistical analysis, and proficiency
   scale development. The third course took place in Maputo and covered
   the topics of data analysis, report writing, and dissemination strategies.
   These courses were intended to enhance the capacity of participants to
   the degree that they could carry out assessment activities with limited
   external support. As a result of their participation, team members were
   able to apply their newly-acquired knowledge to the development of a
   new classroom-based assessment tool called Provinha.

  Master’s Program in Educational Management and Evaluation:
 	
  With READ Trust Fund support, eight staff from the Ministry of Education
  (six from INDE and two from CNECE) and one staff member from the
  University of Eduardo Monlande completed a two-year Master’s program
  in Educational Management and Evaluation through the Centro de
  Politicas Publicas e Avaliação da Educação based in Brazil. This program
  included both distance and face-to-face learning. Between the start of
  the program in 2011 and its completion in 2013, the participants travelled
  to Brazil five times in order to participate in the face-to-face part of the
  course. As a result of this program, there are now several staff formally
  qualified in the design and management of national assessments.

Alignment with Learning Goals
In 2011 and 2012, the government worked with directors, teachers, and
development partners in six provinces to create and field test 70 education
quality indicators. Since then, the Ministry has been in the process of finalizing
these indicators and incorporating them into documents that summarize their
uses for a range of users. Additionally, in 2011, a blueprint for writing test
items for different topics in the national curriculum at grades 3, 5, and 7 was
created. A bank of more than 600 test items is now available to draw on for
various assessments, such as Provinha and the recent NLSA.

Classroom Assessment

Assessment Quality
During the study visit to Brazil, staff from INDE learned about an innovative
classroom assessment program that was being used to monitor early grade
reading skills. They decided to create something similar for Mozambique.
Applying the knowledge they acquired through various training activities,
INDE led the design and implementation of a new classroom assessment
tool, an early grade reading assessment for grade 3 called Provinha.
84	    FINAL READ Trust Fund Report 2008–2015




                                     The materials created for Provinha included a test kit with administration and
                                     interpretation manuals; a test booklet; a scoring guide; communication
                                     materials for parents, teachers, and school leaders; and results posters. After
                                     an initial pilot phase in two Maputo districts during 2011 and 2012, the
                                     program was scaled up to include an additional two districts in northern
                                     Mozambique in the Tete and Niassa Provinces. In 2013, 188 schools in these
                                     four districts participated in Provinha. In 2014, a fifth district from the Cabo
                                     Delgado Province was added and a total of 206 schools participated.
                                     Including the first pilot in 2011, Provinha was administered seven times – once
                                     at the beginning of each school year and again at the end in order to track
                                     student progress. Each time, the assessment was administered and scored
                                     by teachers and the results were intended to be used at the school level to
                                     improve teaching practices and student learning outcomes in reading.
                                     Follow-up workshops were organized with pedagogical directors to discuss
                                     the results and options for adjusting teaching practices accordingly.




      “Provinha as a tool proved to be very effective. It
      changed the attitudes of the teachers – the
      attitude toward their work and the attitude
      toward the subjects they needed to teach.”
      – Mozambican Delegation, Fourth READ Global Conference
                                                                  COUNTRY-LEVEL RESULTS – MOZAMBIQUE   85



In 2013, through support from READ and the Strategic Impact Evaluation
Fund (SIEF), an impact evaluation was set up to ascertain whether Provinha
had a significant impact on student achievement. Specifically, the evaluation
aimed to assess the utility of Provinha as a tool for 1) increasing teachers’
awareness about the strengths and weaknesses of their students; 2) helping
teachers adjust their teaching practices accordingly; and 3) improving their
students’ learning outcomes. In March and October 2013, Provinha was
administered in a total of 110 schools – 53 treatment schools and 57 control
schools across two districts. Based on the final results of this impact
evaluation, a decision will be made about whether or not to further scale up
the assessment.

Use of Results
Results from Provinha have been shared at the national level in the context of
the overall Education Sector’s Annual Meetings. The results and experiences
from Provinha are contributing to the overall debate on strengthening the
quality of students’ learning in Mozambique. Based on its success, INDE is
continuing to implement Provinha and contemplating the creation of a similar
instrument to support numeracy.

Examinations

Strong Organizational Structures
Through a combination of the READ Trust Fund and the Education Sector
Support Fund, targeted efforts were made to improve the system for
examinations. CNECE, previously just a unit within the Ministry of Education,
is now considered a “semi-autonomous,” permanent institution which is
accountable to an external board. In 2014, CNECE staff moved into new and
secure buildings equipped with up-to-date computers, software, and security.
Data-scanning technology was also made available in almost all provinces to
allow them to automatically capture examination results.

NLSA

Clear Policies
Prior to 2009, there was no policy guiding NLSA activities in Mozambique. As
a result of the efforts to strengthen Mozambique’s assessment system, in
2013, the Ministry of Education issued a new formal document that authorizes
NLSA activities. This Education Sector Strategic Plan and the accompanying
operation plan specify that NLSAs will assess grade 3 students in the areas
of Portuguese and Mathematics every three years.

                                    Regular Budget
                                    In 2010, following on a national workshop to discuss NLSA activities, a
                                    decision was made to create a line item for NLSA in the annual education
                                    budget. Since then, stable funding has been provided in the area of NLSA.

                                    Strong Organizational Structures
                                    INDE staff were responsible for NLSA exercises in 2000, 2006, and 2009.
                                    However, there was no unit within INDE exclusively dedicated to assessment.
                                    In an effort to further establish and institutionalize a system for NLSA, in 2010,
                                    a decision was made to reorganize INDE to include a unit with clear
                                    responsibility for overseeing national assessments.

                                    Between 2009 and 2013, major revisions were made to previous NLSA
                                    activities, including the test structure, items, administration, and logistics. The
                                    quality of the NLSA benefitted significantly from the large number of capacity-
                                    building activities made available to INDE staff under the READ Trust Fund.
                                    The NLSA implemented in 2013 was considered the first “official” NLSA in
                                    Mozambique. Data for this assessment were collected in 2013 and the initial
                                    findings were shared with all relevant stakeholders during a Joint Sector
                                    Review in 2014. NLSA results now feature prominently in the overall policy
                                    debate on the quality of education and possible reforms.



                                    CONCLUSION

                                    As a result of the READ program in Mozambique, the Ministry of Education’s
                                    technical and institutional capacity to assess student learning outcomes has
                                    vastly improved and assessment results are valued by education stakeholders
                                    at all levels. Between 2009 and 2014, the READ Trust Fund program
                                    contributed to a significant culture shift in how assessment data are collected
                                    and used to inform both 1) teaching practices at the classroom level and 2)
                                    the overall policy debate at the national level. The availability of nationally
                                    representative data on learning outcomes in grade 3 is helping to inform the
                                    overall policy debate on the quality of education and the types of interventions
                                    that are most likely to produce change. This type of information now features
                                    prominently in discussions between the Ministry of Education, development
                                    partners, and civil society organizations and has directly impacted the
                                    expansion of the current Education Sector Strategic Plan beyond 2016.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the ensuing civil war had a serious
impact on education quality in Tajikistan. Since the signing of a peace accord
in the late 1990s, the Government of Tajikistan has focused on rebuilding its
education system and ensuring the effective delivery of, and equal access to,
a high-quality education. While access to basic education has become nearly
universal, access to secondary and tertiary education has continued to show
significant disparities by both gender and income.

Part of Tajikistan’s mission to improve education quality and access has
included firmly establishing a NTC tasked with the responsibility of measuring
student learning outcomes, particularly at the interface between secondary
and university education. Although a NTC and university entrance
examinations previously existed, the system was deemed by most to be
flawed and the test results unreliable. The main objective of READ Trust Fund
support in Tajikistan was to increase the capacity of the NTC to implement
assessment activities, including a new Unified University Entrance Examination
(UEE) system. Through the creation of a centralized examination for admission
to all universities in Tajikistan, the government aimed to standardize testing
practices and procedures, reduce corruption, and give students more
equitable access to higher education. Based on the success of the pilot, the
new UEE was adopted into law in late 2014.

                                    Program Objectives and Developmental Ratings
                                    The objective of the READ Trust Fund program in Tajikistan was to increase
                                    the capacity of the NTC to oversee the sustainable introduction of the new
                                    UEE and eventually national grade-level assessments. At the beginning of the
                                    program, the baseline diagnostic showed Tajikistan’s overall assessment
                                    system to be at a latent to emerging stage in its development. Given the
                                    government’s strong interest in having a UEE, an additional, more in-depth
                                    diagnostic was conducted to evaluate the existing examinations system and
                                    better understand its strengths and weaknesses. Based on the results, a
                                    decision was made to use READ funds to provide tailored capacity building
                                    and support for the operationalization of the newly-established NTC and the
                                    development and introduction of the new UEE system. By the end of the
                                    READ Trust Fund program, the NTC was fully operationalized and the new
                                    UEE had been successfully piloted, adopted into law, and implemented for
                                    the first time on a national scale. While the developmental rating for
                                    examinations remains emerging, it is expected to move to established once
                                    additional rounds of the new UEE have been successfully conducted.

Program Implementation
The Government of Tajikistan’s plan to strengthen and operationalize the NTC
was supported through various funding streams, including the READ Trust
Fund (US$4.1 million), the World Bank (US$2.3 million), the Open Society
Institute (US$1.5 million), and the government’s own budget (US$.5 million).
The READ Trust Fund primarily supported the development of the new UEE
system, capacity-building activities, recurrent cost co-financing for NTC staff,
and the provision of equipment; the World Bank supported the design and
construction of the new NTC, in addition to the provision of furniture and
equipment; the Open Society Institute supported the initial preparations of
the UEE design and capacity-building activities for national experts and NTC
staff; and the government’s own funds were used to allocate land, provide
temporary space for the NTC, and rehabilitate regional offices. From
2009-2014, a total of US$8.4 million was provided to strengthen and
operationalize the NTC and develop the new UEE system.

                                     READ Trust Fund-sponsored activities in Tajikistan were implemented with
                                     the support of two Bank-executed and one Recipient-executed grant. A first
                                     grant for US$400,000 supported the diagnostic phase and the creation of an
                                     operations manual for the NTC; the other two grants were a combination of a
                                     Recipient-executed grant for $3,400,000 and a Bank-executed grant for
                                     US$300,000. The Recipient-executed grant primarily supported capacity-
                                     building activities for NTC staff; the development, pilot, and full-scale
                                     implementation of the new UEE; and the provision of equipment. The
                                     Bank-executed grant supported supervision activities and an evaluation of
                                     the new UEE system.

                                     In addition to their strong support and coordinated work to establish the new
                                     NTC, the Ministry of Education and Science and donors such as the World
                                     Bank (through funds from GPE) and USAID have been working to modernize
                                     the school curriculum. The government’s 2012 National Strategy for
                                     Educational Development indicated that the more traditional, knowledge-
                                     based system would be reformed to be more competency-based. As a part
                                     of this curriculum reform work, progress was also made in the area of
                                     classroom assessment.


                                     Progress by Assessment Type and Key Indicator Areas
                                     Tajikistan’s progress under the READ Trust Fund program has been carefully
                                     monitored using the READ Results Framework and SABER-Student
                                     Assessment benchmarking tools. Table 18 indicates the baseline and end-of-
                                     program scores for Tajikistan based on the results of benchmarking exercises
                                     carried out at the beginning and end of the program. The progress seen is
                                     based on achievements in the key indicator areas being tracked under the
                                     READ Trust Fund program. The activities that Tajikistan carried out under
                                     each key indicator area are described in the next section. Activities that
                                     benefited more than one type of assessment activity are described under a
                                     general category. Activities that benefited a specific type of assessment
                                     activity are described under assessment-specific headings.

General

Effective Human Resources
In addition to targeted activities to build the capacity of NTC staff to develop
the new UEE, several Ministry of Education and NTC officials had the
opportunity to participate in a number of international events on assessment-
related topics. These events included the annual READ Global Conferences,
a READ Regional Workshop, an IAEA Conference, and two EAOKO
Conferences. At the annual READ Global Conferences, delegations of four to
five key education officials each year delivered a presentation on the progress
achieved to date in establishing the NTC. At the final READ Global Conference
in St. Petersburg, the Deputy Minister of Education joined the delegation and
participated in a panel session on the overall impact of the READ Trust Fund
program in Tajikistan. In 2012, four NTC staff traveled to Kazakhstan to
participate in the IAEA Conference and share experiences with other
READ-sponsored countries during the READ Regional Workshop for ECA. In
2012 and 2013, a representative from the NTC also participated in the EAOKO
Conferences organized by CICED. As a result of their participation in these
international learning events, a critical mass of key individuals from Tajikistan’s
Ministry of Education and NTC have a greater understanding of key issues
and best practices in assessment.

                                    Alignment with Learning Goals
                                    Based on the 2012 National Strategy for Educational Development in
                                    Tajikistan, the Ministry of Education has been developing a new curriculum
                                    that moves away from the more traditional, knowledge-based approach to a
                                    more competency-based one. As part of this work, learning standards are
                                    being developed for all primary subjects in grades 1 to 4, including Tajik,
                                    Russian, English, Mathematics, Nature, Arts and Crafts, Physical Education,
                                    and Music and Singing. The standards clearly outline what students at
                                    different grades and age levels are expected to learn, and the desired
                                    performance levels. Based on these standards, guidelines for classroom
                                    assessment by teachers are now being developed.

                                    Examinations (UEE)

                                    Clear Policies
                                    At the beginning of the READ Trust Fund program, a NTC Master Plan of
                                    Action and UEE Operations Manual were drafted to ensure the appropriate
                                    regulatory and legal frameworks were in place. Through technical assistance
                                    provided under READ, the three-year Master Plan (which covered staff hiring,
                                    capacity building, procurement of equipment and materials, UEE piloting and
                                    final delivery, among other things) was periodically updated. In 2011, the NTC
                                    collected information from various universities and government institutions in
                                    order to finalize the UEE model and prepare the requisite regulatory and legal
                                    documents for the introduction and supervision of the UEE. These documents
                                    were subsequently adopted into law by the Government.

                                    Strong Leadership
                                    The NTC and the new UEE system are fully supported by the government.
                                    Two large workshops for leaders from the government, universities, civil
                                    society, and the development partners were held early on in the process –
                                    one for the launch of the UEE program in 2011, and another after completion
                                    of the full-scale pilot in 2013. Then, in December 2013, the President of
                                    Tajikistan officially inaugurated the new system. In 2014, the President and
                                    the President’s Office continued to demonstrate their strong commitment to
                                    the new UEE system by facilitating a mass-media campaign throughout the
                                    entire country. A series of workshops were also used to orient all municipal
                                    and district-level education officials to the new UEE system and help facilitate
                                    preparations for the first national implementation in 2014.

Regular Budget
Beginning in 2011, the government has provided an annual allocation of
US$100,000 in state funds to support the work of the NTC. With the approval
of the Ministry of Finance, the student enrollment fee for the UEE system was
piloted in 2013 and finalized in 2014. The fee was set at a level that would
ensure the financial stability of the NTC to conduct the UEE, including all
research and development costs. The fee mechanism worked smoothly
during the first national implementation in 2014. Starting in 2015, the NTC will
receive an increased state budget allocation to further ensure the sustainability
of the NTC and UEE operations.

Strong Organizational Structures
At the beginning of the READ program, the NTC had limited staff and no
office space. By the end of the READ program, a new NTC building and four
regional offices had been secured, the NTC had recruited 60 full-time staff,
and the NTC offices had been equipped with all essential Information
Technology (IT) and printing equipment. In 2014, a significant change was
made in the status of the NTC. The NTC went from being an institution of the
Ministry of Education and Science to coming under the direct authority of the
President of the country. As such, changes were made to the NTC’s Senior
Management, which further strengthened the NTC team in time for the
delivery of the UEE in 2014.

NTC staff and Ministry of Education and Science officials participated in a
variety of activities aimed at building their capacity to carry out assessment
activities and develop the new UEE system. With the support of other donor
funds, staff members participated in: 1) study trips to National Testing Centers
in Azerbaijan, Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey (5 to 8 staff on each trip); 2) a
series of trainings on assessment topics provided by the Russian Testing
Center (10 NTC staff); and 3) training in test development and data analysis
(40 NTC staff and national experts). Additionally, with READ Trust Fund
support, two prospective NTC staff traveled to the Kyrgyz Republic and one
NTC staff member traveled to Kazakhstan to receive training in procurement
and financial management.

In 2014, concentrated training was provided to ensure the successful
implementation of the UEE. Fifteen NTC staff received specific training on
security procedures; 60 district education staff received training on overall
UEE procedures; and nearly 1,600 registrars, administrators, and verifiers
received training on their respective tasks. This training resulted in the
successful registration of over 52,000 students at 21 different locations and
the equally successful administration of the UEE to over 46,000 students who
sat for the examination at 40 different locations.

                                    Alignment with Learning Goals
                                    To ensure that the new UEE aligned well with established university admission
                                    requirements, the NTC developed a database with information from 30
                                    universities (covering more than 400 specialties) about entrance rules,
                                    procedures, requirements, and admission plans. These data were analyzed
                                    and used to design the UEE. In January 2014, an official admissions plan, which
                                    included all universities and specialties covered by the UEE, the number of
                                    places available, language of instruction, and so on was published. Additionally,
                                    the UEE papers were carefully designed to correspond to the curriculum and
                                    learning standards established by the Ministry of Education and Science.

                                    Opportunities to Learn about Assessment Activities
                                    A public relations and communications strategy to introduce the new UEE
                                    was developed with READ Trust Fund support. At the request of the President
                                    of Tajikistan, this strategy was augmented in 2014 to use mass media as a
                                    way to broadly disseminate information about the NTC and UEE. By the end
                                    of READ, 221 articles had been published in local newspapers and posted on
                                    local and international websites, 45 films for different target audiences had
                                    been produced and broadcasted on national television, 247 television
                                    messages and 168 televised speeches had also been broadcasted on
                                    national television, and 12 press releases had been shared with 28 different
                                    national and international mass media agencies. At the end of READ, the
                                    NTC organized a conference to disseminate information on the 2014 UEE,
                                    discuss lessons learned, and clarify changes needed for the 2015 UEE.

                                    In 2013, a series of meetings took place with schools, parents, and students
                                    to inform them about the new UEE. Then, in 2014, 136 municipal authorities
                                    and district education officials were trained on the UEE by NTC staff using the
                                    Student Handbook and other materials. These officials then trained over
                                    3,500 secondary school directors who provided 36-hour orientation sessions
                                    to over 100,000 grade 11 students. The Student Handbook used during the
                                    training sessions was also made available on the NTC website.

Quality Assurance
In 2012 and 2013, the NTC carried out several quality assurance procedures
as part of the design and implementation of the new UEE. In May 2012, the
NTC designed a pilot version of the new UEE and conducted a series of
mini-pilots to test various aspects of the system, including the testing
instrument, registration, and administration. Then, in 2013, 7,000 grade 10
students participated in a full-scale pilot, which included the revised tests,
administrative, and security procedures. The pilot was deemed successful
and a decision was made to implement the new UEE system on a national
scale in 2014. In 2014, all UEE test items were approved by an expert
committee; the training provided to, and the performance of, the registrars
and administrators were carefully monitored for quality by NTC staff; and the
IT system was independently evaluated by a team of experts. In addition, at
the end of the pilot stage, the World Bank conducted an independent
evaluation of the procedures of the new UEE system to ensure their quality
and confirm that the new system was ready for full-scale implementation.



CONCLUSION

The READ Trust Fund-supported activities in Tajikistan revolutionized the
country’s university admissions system. Over the past six years, the new
model for the UEE system was carefully designed and piloted. Learning from
other countries’ experiences and international best practices, the NTC
followed a detailed, step-by-step process to introduce the new system.
Careful attention was given to such issues as creating the necessary legal
frameworks; hiring staff with the right skills and continuing to build their
capacity; constructing a secure building, equipped with an adequate IT
system; and ensuring that UEE test items were well designed and aligned
with university requirements. Based on the success of the pilot, the President
of Tajikistan formally adopted the new system into law in late 2013. The NTC
is now fully staffed with trained individuals who are capable of overseeing
assessment activities, and is financially stable due to examination fees and
contributions from the government. The new UEE system is standardized,
transparent, and merit based – and as a result, qualified students have a
more equal chance at obtaining entrance to university.

                                    COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                    Similar to its economy, Vietnam’s education system has improved at a
                                    remarkable pace. Having almost met the goal of universal primary education,
                                    government officials are now paying even greater attention to ensuring
                                    education quality. Vietnam’s vision for its education system is one that enables
                                    the country to become a globally competitive, knowledge-based economy.

                                    Vietnam’s education system is vast, including nearly 40,000 schools, one
                                    million teachers, and 20 million students. During the READ Trust Fund
                                    program, the government prioritized the measurement of learning outcomes
                                    and the monitoring of education quality in order to ensure that investments in
                                    education produced quality learning outcomes. Prior to READ, various
                                    assessment activities were already in place and departments tasked with
                                    assessment responsibilities were well-staffed. The challenges that Vietnam
                                    faced related more to 1) the size of its education system and the large number
                                    of key stakeholders that needed training in order to be able to effectively
                                    design and implement assessment activities, and 2) the need to transform its
                                    curriculum and assessments from knowledge- to competency-based. By the
                                    end of READ, a new competency-based assessment framework had been
                                    adopted, training programs had been developed for all key stakeholders, and
                                    the groundwork was laid for a new, competency-based curriculum.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, RATINGS, AND
PROGRESS (2009-2014)

Program Objectives and Developmental Ratings
The objective of the READ Trust Fund program in Vietnam was to strengthen
and improve the effectiveness of the country’s assessment system. The
program supported Vietnam to enhance its capacity to conduct systemic
assessments of learning outcomes and provide recommendations for actions
to improve student learning. At the beginning of the program, the baseline
diagnostic showed that the most developed part of Vietnam’s assessment
system was classroom assessment, which was only emerging. With READ
funds, Vietnam focused significant efforts on capacity building in a number of
assessment areas, and among a wide range of stakeholders, i.e., teachers,
school leaders, provincial departments, Ministry of Education and Training
(MOET) staff, teacher training colleges, and universities. Additionally, Vietnam
concentrated its READ support on developing and institutionalizing
competency-based assessment practices into their new general education
curriculum. By the end of READ, as demonstrated in Table 19, Vietnam had
made significant progress in all assessment areas and had built a strong
foundation for future activities.

                                    Program Implementation
                                    The READ Trust Fund program in Vietnam was implemented in two phases
                                    with the support of two Bank-executed grants. A first grant for US$350,000
                                    supported the diagnostic phase and the creation of an action plan; a second
                                    grant for US$2,650,000 supported the development of training programs and
                                    capacity-building activities for different stakeholders, the implementation of
                                    various surveys (i.e., Early Development Instrument (EDI)), improvements to
                                    classroom assessments and national examinations, and the design of a new
                                    curriculum and textbooks that incorporate competency-based assessment
                                    practices. In conjunction with these READ-funded activities, a number of other
                                    World Bank-funded projects and donors were working to advance Vietnam’s
                                    education system. Vietnam’s decision to participate in PISA 2012, and the
                                    team’s attendance at the initial meetings, were supported under READ, while
                                    the full cost of Vietnam’s participation in this exercise was supported by the
                                    Asian Development Bank. Also, additional rounds of NLSA activities were
                                    supported by the World Bank-financed School Quality Assurance project, and
                                    additional efforts to improve classroom assessment practices were supported
                                    by the Global Partnership for Education-financed Vietnam New School project.

                                    In 2013, after conducting a financial review of the entire READ Trust Fund
                                    program, the READ Council decided to reallocate US$1 million of the funds
                                    originally awarded to Vietnam under their second grant (US$3.5 million) to other
                                    READ countries. This was an effort to better balance the amount of money
                                    allocated to each country under the program, taking into account the time
                                    remaining and various countries’ absorptive capacity. In 2014, given Vietnam’s
                                    significant progress, and available funds remaining under the READ program,
                                    the country was reallocated US$150,000 to finalize remaining activities. Hence
                                    the total amount of Vietnam’s second grant ultimately came to US$2,650,000.

Progress by Assessment Type and Key Indicator Areas
Vietnam’s progress under the READ Trust Fund program was carefully
monitored using the READ Results Framework and SABER-Student
Assessment benchmarking tools. Table 20 indicates the baseline and end-of-
program scores for Vietnam based on the results of benchmarking exercises
carried out at the beginning and end of the program. The progress seen is
based on achievements in the key indicator areas being tracked under the
READ Trust Fund program. The activities that Vietnam carried out under each
key indicator area are described in the next section. Activities that benefited
more than one type of assessment activity are described under a general
category. Activities that benefited a specific type of assessment activity are
described under assessment-specific headings.

General

Clear Policies
With READ Trust Fund support, a study and series of workshops took place
in 2010 to review Vietnam’s existing assessment policies, regulatory
framework, and practices in examinations and classroom assessment. The
results of this review indicated a lack of coherence and consistency across
the system and a need for new assessment frameworks to help improve the
quality of national examinations and assist teachers in conducting classroom
assessment activities. In a second series of workshops in 2010 and 2011, the
Department of Education Testing and Accreditation worked with the Primary
and Secondary Education Departments, primary and secondary schools,
and assessment experts to develop new assessment frameworks aligned
with the curriculum, along with first-semester, end-of-year, and high school
entrance and graduation tests. Assessment frameworks and tests were
developed for Vietnamese and Mathematics in grades 1–5; Science in grade
3; History and Geography in grades 4–5; Vietnamese and Mathematics for
high school entrance; and Vietnamese, Mathematics, History, Geography,
Physics, and Chemistry for high school graduation. Guidelines for teachers
and a policy and regulatory framework to support the new frameworks and
tests were developed and officially adopted by MOET in 2011. During
2012-2014, the implementation of these new policies, assessment
frameworks, and first-semester and end-of-year tests were monitored and
reported on.

                                     Strong Leadership
                                     Leaders within MOET demonstrated strong support for further developing
                                     the country’s assessment system. In December 2009, at the beginning of the
                                     READ program, a workshop was held with all key education stakeholders to
                                     discuss and validate the findings from the baseline diagnostic and agree on
                                     an action plan. Key leaders remained actively engaged throughout the entire
                                     program by organizing and participating in yearly READ-Vietnam Conferences,
                                     leading workshops to review and endorse new assessment policies, and
                                     overseeing activities to develop assessment training programs. This
                                     demonstration of strong leadership and support for assessment activities
                                     contributed to significant improvements in Vietnam’s student assessment
                                     system.

                                     Effective Human Resources
                                     A significant amount of the support provided to Vietnam under READ was
                                     focused on building capacity within MOET to carry out assessment activities.
                                     Several of these capacity-building activities took the form of international
                                     conferences on assessment topics, study visits, and training courses.
                                                                      COUNTRY-LEVEL RESULTS – VIETNAM   101



 Conferences: Representatives from MOET gained a better understanding
	
 of key issues and best practices in assessment as a result of participating
 in several international learning events, such as the annual READ Global
 Conferences, the 2012 READ Regional Workshop in Kazakhstan, and the
 2012 and 2013 IAEA Conferences. At each of these events, one
 representative from the five- to six-member Vietnamese delegation
 delivered a presentation on the development of Vietnam’s assessment
 system and progress achieved to date under READ. At the final READ
 Conference in St. Petersburg, all six members of the delegation
 participated in a panel session on the overall impact of the READ program
 in Vietnam. Immediately following these international events, Vietnam
 typically organized its own internal READ-Vietnam Conferences – each
 involving around 50 participants from universities, colleges, research and
 management institutes, local education departments, and different
 departments of MOET – to share lessons learned, discuss the overall
 work program, and share the findings of any recent activities.

 Study Visits: To assist Vietnam’s ongoing efforts to institutionalize
	
 competency-based assessment practices into their new general
 education curriculum, two study visits were organized. In 2013, 16 MOET
 and university faculty leaders traveled to South Korea to meet with
 Curriculum Department staff and learn how assessment practices had
 been included in that country’s new curriculum. The entire South Korean
 curriculum was also translated into Vietnamese. In 2014, another
 delegation of 16 MOET and university faculty leaders traveled to the
 United States to learn about the newly-developed common core
 standards and related assessment activities. As a result of these study
 visits, Vietnamese policymakers and curriculum developers have a better
 understanding of international best practices in curriculum reform and are
 better equipped to incorporate lessons learned into their own ongoing
 reforms.

                                          requisite knowledge to perform their expected role in assessment
                                          activities. According to a 2012 review of Vietnam’s existing education
                                          training programs, teachers and education officials received almost no
                                          systematic training in the area of assessment. To address this, a general
                                          competency framework for educational assessment was developed and
                                          a variety of training programs were created.

                                           •	    2012, a general competency framework was developed that
                                              outlines expected skills and knowledge in assessment for five key
                                              stakeholder groups (pre-service teachers, in-service teachers,
                                              Masters students, education managers, and MOET assessment
                                              specialists). In 2013, nine workshops, with a total of nearly 300
                                              representatives from MOET, universities, and school leaders, were
                                              held to discuss and validate the overall framework and the proposed
                                              training modules.

                                              framework, five training modules were developed for the different
                                              stakeholder groups. Given the large number of individuals that
                                              needed to be trained in certain groups, a two-day workshop was
                                              organized with nearly 100 education officials to explore the possibility
                                              of eventually delivering one or more of these training modules through
                                              e-learning. In 2014, face-to-face versions of the training programs
                                              began to be piloted across all five stakeholder groups. By the end of

                                              had benefited from 26 different training workshops that were delivered
                                              by assessment experts, the General Department of Testing and
                                              Accreditation, and Hanoi National University of Education.

System Alignment
The overarching framework that embraces all assessment reforms in Vietnam
is the new competency-based general education curriculum under
development by MOET. A taskforce assigned by MOET to prepare the new
curriculum includes representatives from the National Institute of Educational
Sciences and education experts. With the support of READ funds, an
International Advisory Board, comprised of six leading international education
experts, was established to help MOET 1) review its current curriculum and
identify how good assessment practices could be integrated into the new
curriculum; 2) review its current textbooks and benchmark Vietnam’s
Mathematics and Language curricula to those of top-achieving countries;
and 3) improve the capacity and skills of curriculum developers.

In July and September 2014, a series of technical assistance workshops on
curriculum and assessment were conducted for Vietnam’s education leaders,
curriculum developers, and textbook writers. The International Advisory
Board members reviewed different types of standards, including learning
standards; how teachers should communicate assessment results and use
this information to improve their teaching; and how assessments should be
aligned with curriculum. These workshops provided excellent opportunities
to discuss the substance of the ongoing education reforms in Vietnam,
including the implications of competency-based education, problem-solving,
self-directed learning, teamwork, etc.

Classroom Assessment

Clear Policies
As a direct result of READ support, MOET now has formal, system-level
documents that provide guidelines for classroom assessment at both the
primary and secondary levels. These documents include guidelines for what
should be assessed and the uses of assessment information. In addition to
these guidelines, a variety of system-wide resources are available to teachers
in the area of classroom assessment. For example, at the primary and
secondary levels, documents that outline what students are expected to
learn in different assessment domains at different grade levels and the
performance levels that they are expected to reach at different grade levels
are available to all teachers. In addition, student textbooks as well as teacher
guides and test frameworks are available at the primary and secondary levels
to support classroom assessment activities.

Use of Results
To assist in efforts to monitor education quality, MOET recently developed an
Education Quality Management System for primary education. The database
was designed to collect learning results and school-level data.

                                     Effective Human Resources/Quality Assurance
                                     In 2012, two workshops were organized with the intended purposes of
                                     increasing capacity to develop test items and improving the quality of
                                     university entrance examinations. As a result, nearly 200 representatives from
                                     high schools, universities, and MOET have increased their capacity to develop
                                     high-quality tests.

                                       From May 3–5, the Department of Testing and Accreditation hosted a
                                      	
                                       workshop for 140 participants from high schools and universities across
                                       the country. The purpose of the workshop was to 1) train participants in
                                       how to write and analyze test items, and 2) review the current assessment
                                       frameworks and validate proposed multiple-choice items. As a result,
                                       item writers are better equipped to write test questions that align with the
                                       intended purpose of the examination.

                                       The second workshop to discuss issues related to the reliability and
                                      	
                                       validity of the results of university and college entrance tests was held
                                       from May 25–27. Over 50 participants were in attendance, including
                                       representatives from various departments within MOET, universities, and
                                       high schools. The purpose of this workshop was 1) to enhance
                                       participants’ understanding of testing theories, use of assessment
                                       frameworks, item writing, and item analysis skills; and 2) to identify ways
                                       to improve the current process for developing university and college
                                       entrance tests.

                                     Quality Assurance
                                     The Department of Testing and Accreditation collected test items and results
                                     for the 2008-2014 high school graduation and university entrance examinations
                                     in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Foreign Language in order to conduct
                                     analysis of the data using IRT. The purpose was to help determine the
                                     reliability of the examination results and identify item-level characteristics
                                     such as difficulty, discrimination, and fit. The database of test items collected
                                     for this analysis will possibly be used in the future to create an item bank. In
                                     May 2014, a workshop was organized to share initial findings and concerns
                                     about the validity and reliability of the high school graduation and university
                                     entrance examination results. As a result of these discussions, a decision
                                     was made by MOET that these two examinations will be merged into one in
                                     the near future.

Effective Human Resources
Drawing on the experience of the assessment expert on the International
Advisory Board, a series of in-depth trainings in psychometrics were
conducted to further train six technical experts in the areas of test design and
data analysis. Additionally, training in test design was provided to around
eight different groups of subject experts. This training was provided in order
to improve the quality of Vietnam’s NLSA activities.

Assessment Quality
With READ support, a series of research activities was conducted to fill
existing information gaps on learning outcomes in different areas of the
education system and to increase the ability to use evidence in
decision-making.

  Trends in Assessment: Following the self-diagnosis of Vietnam’s overall
 	
  assessment system in 2009, it was recommended that further in-depth
  analysis be conducted to determine the fiscal and human resources
  allocated for assessment activities, and to better understand the use of
  assessment data and the feedback loops among students, teachers,
  and education managers. Reports on the findings of these studies were
  completed in 2011 and used to identify potential constraints in the current
  system and ways to improve the use of assessment information moving
  forward.

  EDI Survey: With READ Trust Fund support, an EDI survey was
 	
  conducted in 2012 to measure the school readiness of preschool children
  in Vietnam. The EDI tool measures various developmental domains in
  children, including physical development and well-being, language and
  cognitive development, and socio-emotional development. To carry out
  the survey, ten early childhood education experts and education officials
  were trained in how to adapt the tool to Vietnam and how to conduct
  trainings for the 154 provincial and district officers who then trained
  preschool teachers to complete the questionnaires. After a pilot exercise,
  the instrument was rolled out in April 2012 to a population of 8,400
  five-year-old children in 400 preschools in 54 of the 63 provinces in
  Vietnam. In 2013, a complete report of the findings in English and
  Vietnamese was prepared and disseminated during a launch event for
  the World Bank-financed School Readiness Promotion Project. Drawing
  on the experience and capacity built during the initial EDI survey, MOET
  used its own funds to implement another round of the survey in 2014.

                                      	
                                       Institute of Education Sciences conducted a review of potential biases in
                                       the development of the new curriculum that might further marginalize
                                       vulnerable groups, such as ethnic minorities, females, and children with
                                       disabilities. The study reviewed international practices in this area as well
                                       as the school experiences of ethnic minority children in Vietnam. The
                                       findings were used to develop a bias-avoidance framework for curriculum
                                       developers and other stakeholders.

                                     ILSA

                                     Clear Policies
                                     With support from the READ Trust Fund, Vietnam registered to participate in
                                     its very first ILSA, PISA 2012. A team of Vietnamese officials participated in an
                                     introductory course in 2009, and then a second training in Hong Kong SAR,
                                     China in 2010. (Funding to cover all other costs of PISA implementation was
                                     provided by the Asian Development Bank.) A formal agreement to participate
                                     in PISA 2012 was signed by the Vietnamese government and, although a
                                     national policy on continued participation in ILSAs has yet to be created,
                                     preparations have already been made for Vietnam to participate in the next
                                     round of PISA in 2015.

                                     Strong Organizational Structures
                                     The Center for Education Quality Evaluation, the same unit responsible for
                                     NLSA activities, was designated by MOET as the unit responsible for
                                     managing Vietnam’s participation in ILSA activities. This unit has permanent
                                     staff with prior training in assessment and the skills necessary to carry out
                                     ILSA activities. Additionally, a National Steering Committee was created to
                                     provide the requisite leadership for Vietnam’s participation in PISA.

                                     Assessment Quality
                                     The Center for Education Quality Evaluation ensured that Vietnam’s
                                     participation in PISA 2012 was successful and that the country met all
                                     technical standards required to have its data published in the final report.
                                     Vietnam’s results were released in early December 2013.

                                     Use of Results
                                     Vietnam’s performance on PISA 2012 was literally astounding. Results
                                     showed that, although Vietnam is a lower-middle income country, its students
                                     are performing at a level similar to peers in Germany and Austria, and above
                                     the OECD average in all three subjects – Mathematics, Sciences, and
                                     Reading. With support from the READ Trust Fund, Vietnam conducted further
                                     analysis of its PISA results to identify areas in which curricular reforms would
                                     be necessary to ensure that students graduate from secondary school with
                                     21st century skills. PISA 2012 results were disseminated in the country and
                                     the results have been used to monitor education quality, hold the government
                                     accountable, and inform education policy reforms.

CONCLUSION

The READ Trust Fund played a critical role in strengthening Vietnam’s overall
student assessment system. By the end of READ, the ground work had been
laid for its new competency-based curriculum, a new competency-based
assessment framework had been fully adopted, and training programs had
been developed for all key stakeholders. In addition, Vietnam’s education
leaders had access to a wealth of new information on learning outcomes that
would allow them to make more evidence-based decisions about ongoing
education reforms. As demonstrated by the PISA 2012 results, Vietnam’s
education system is on track to becoming a strong system that produces
high-quality education results.

                                     COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                     Over the past few decades, Zambia has undertaken numerous education
                                     reforms with an eye to attaining universal primary education and improving
                                     education quality. Enormous progress has been achieved in school access
                                     and Zambia has nearly met the goal of universal primary education. At the
                                     same time, serious concerns remain about education quality and learning
                                     outcomes. According to the 2012 NLSA, less than 40 percent of learners in
                                     grade 5 are acquiring even the most basic literacy and numeracy skills.

                                     Zambia’s Ministry of Education has been committed to monitoring the quality
                                     of learning and to using assessment results to make evidence-based reforms.
                                     The activities that comprised the READ Trust Fund program in Zambia were
                                     focused on strengthening the capacity of institutions responsible for
                                     measuring student learning outcomes and on ensuring that findings from
                                     assessment activities are used to improve teaching and learning. As a result
                                     of strong support from the Ministry of Education and READ funding, by the
                                     end of 2014, the country had strengthened and successfully expanded its
                                     NLSA program, improved the quality of its examinations, and been selected
                                     by the OECD to be one of six pilot countries for the PISA for Development
                                     initiative.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, RATINGS, AND
PROGRESS (2009-2014)
Program Objectives and Developmental Ratings
The objective of the READ Trust Fund program in Zambia was to help
strengthen the capacity of the institutions responsible for measuring student
learning outcomes and to ensure that findings from assessments are used to
improve teaching and learning. At the beginning of the program, the baseline
diagnostic showed Zambia’s assessment system to be established in the
area of examinations and at an emerging level of development for the other
three assessment types. With READ Trust Fund support, Zambia opted to
target specific areas within each assessment type that would address key
weaknesses and create a foundation for future development. These included
quality reviews of current assessment activities, further capacity building of
staff, and better use of assessment results to improve overall education
quality. By the end of READ, as demonstrated in Table 21, Zambia had made
significant progress in the area of NLSA. Progress was also seen in building
teacher capacity to conduct classroom assessments, the further strengthening
of the examinations system, and the laying of a foundation for ILSA activities.

                                     Program Implementation
                                     The READ Trust Fund program in Zambia was implemented in three phases
                                     with the support of two Bank-executed grants at the country-level as well as
                                     global-level funds to support its involvement in the PISA for Development
                                     initiative. A first grant for US$300,000 supported the diagnostic phase and the
                                     creation of an action plan; a second grant for US$2,113,500 supported capacity-
                                     building activities, in-depth studies of current assessment practices, efforts to
                                     effectively disseminate the results of the 2012 NLSA, and the development of
                                     assessment frameworks and examinations syllabi. In 2013, with the support of
                                     the READ Trust Fund, Zambia was selected as one of six pilot countries in the
                                     PISA for Development Initiative. During this third phase, nearly US$575,000 of
                                     global-level funds were used to cover a large share of Zambia’s participation
                                     costs, including the participation of Zambian representatives in international
                                     meetings. Other costs associated with Zambia’s participation are being covered
                                     by the government’s own budget and direct budget support provided by DFID.


                                     Progress by Assessment Type and Key Indicator Areas
                                     Zambia’s progress under the READ Trust Fund program has been carefully
                                     monitored using the READ Results Framework and SABER-Student
                                     Assessment benchmarking tools. Table 22 indicates the baseline and end-of-
                                     program scores for Zambia based on the results of benchmarking exercises
                                     carried out at the beginning and end of the program. The progress seen is
                                     based on achievements in the key indicator areas being tracked under the
                                     READ Trust Fund program. The activities that Zambia carried out under each
                                     key indicator area are described in the next section. Activities that benefited
                                     more than one type of assessment activity are described under a general
                                     category. Activities that benefited a specific type of assessment activity are
                                     described under assessment-specific headings.

General

Strong Leadership
High-level education officials, including the Minister, Permanent Secretary,
and representatives on the National Assessment Steering Committee
consistently provided strong support for developing Zambia’s assessment
system and the activities implemented with READ Trust Fund support. In
2010, a workshop led by key education officials was held to discuss and
validate the self-diagnosis findings and proposed action plan. In 2013, the
Permanent Secretary played a key role in the film produced for national
television on the 2012 NLSA results and the Minister led the event to launch
the film. Additionally, these key education leaders and Heads of Department
all participated in the media event organized to launch PISA for Development
in Zambia.

Strong Organizational Structures
The institution responsible for the majority of assessment-related activities in
Zambia is the Examinations Council of Zambia (ECZ). The baseline diagnostic
found that the lack of an adequate IT system at ECZ hampered its ability to
effectively store and retrieve data from previous assessments and to conduct
further analyses. With the support of READ, an audit of ECZ’s IT systems was
conducted in 2012 and actions identified that ECZ could take to improve its
IT policies, practices, hardware, and software. Subsequently, due to the
improvements made, ECZ was able to conduct secondary analysis of the
data available in the areas of examinations and NLSA.

Effective Human Resources
The majority of READ funds in Zambia were spent on training ECZ staff,
Education Standards Officers, other representatives from the Ministry of
Education, and teachers to build their capacity to carry out assessment
activities. Taking into account both general capacity-building activities (such
as international conferences on assessment topics and national workshops)
and also capacity-building activities targeted to specific assessment types
(classroom assessment, examinations, and NLSA), more than 1,600 key
education stakeholders now have increased capacity to understand and
implement assessment activities.




                                 “The READ program helped us to redefine our
                                 horizon . . . we are able to think of better ways
                                 of doing things, improve the quality, disseminate
                                 information well, and move as a team. “

                                       Conferences: READ supported the participation of more than 35 ECZ
                                      	
                                       and Ministry of Education staff in various international conferences on
                                       assessment topics. These events included the annual READ Global
                                       Conferences, AEAA Conferences in 2011 and 2013, IAEA Conferences in
                                       2011 and 2012, and the READ Regional Workshop in 2013. Delegations
                                       of five to six government representatives participated in each of the READ
                                       Global Conferences. At each of these events, the Zambian delegation
                                       delivered a presentation on the development of Zambia’s assessment
                                       system and progress achieved to date under READ. At the final READ
                                       Global Conference in St. Petersburg, the entire delegation participated in
                                       a panel session on the overall impact of the READ program in Zambia.

                                      In an effort to connect with the broader assessment community,
                                     	
                                      representatives from ECZ also participated in a number of IAEA and
                                      AEAA Conferences. In 2014, Zambia served as hosts of the AEAA
                                      Conference and a panel session was organized to discuss the SABER-
                                      Student Assessment tools and the results of the READ program in Africa.
                                      Additionally, a representative from Zambia was invited to deliver a
                                      presentation at the World Bank’s high-level symposium, “Assessment for
                                      Global Learning,” which took place in Washington, DC. As a result of their
                                      participation in these events, education officials in Zambia have a greater
                                      awareness of best practices in student assessment and how to address
                                      common assessment challenges.

  Training for Education Standards Officers: According to a study
 	
  conducted in 2011, over 75% of Standards Officers in Zambia had never
  received training related to their job as school inspectors and had a very
  limited understanding of assessment practices. To build capacity in this
  area, in early 2013, ECZ organized several three-day workshops on the
  principles of assessment and school inspection to train all 360 Standards
  Officers in the country. ECZ intends to offer similar workshops every two
  years.

Classroom Assessment

Effective Human Resources
At the beginning of the READ Trust Fund, a study was conducted on existing
teacher capacity in assessment. This study clearly identified a need for
teachers to receive more systematic training in this area. In 2013, through a
series of consultations with representatives from the Teacher Education Unit
and Teacher Training Institutions, a decision was reached to develop and
incorporate a course on assessment into the existing curriculum at all teacher
training institutions. The course outline has been agreed upon and work is
underway to further develop the course materials. The course is designed to
ensure that pre-service teachers learn the requisite skills and are capable of
using assessment results to support teaching and learning in their classrooms.

System Alignment
In 2014, the Ministry of Education developed a teacher’s guide on school-
based assessments in reading for grades 1-4. In addition, another teacher’s
guide, which outlines what students are expected to learn and the level of
performance they are expected to reach in reading at each grade level was
developed. These guidelines are meant to help teachers carry out classroom
assessments and ensure students are learning the literacy skills outlined in
the national curriculum.

Examinations

Effective Human Resources
In the area of examinations, capacity-building activities primarily focused on
strengthening ECZ’s current assessment practices. In order to ensure quality
and meet the growing demand for additional examination setters and
markers, ECZ delivered a series of workshops to train more than 1,200
teachers and other Ministry of Education staff. Additionally, a study visit to
Barbados was organized to introduce ECZ staff to some innovative ideas for
using ICT that could be used to improve their existing system.

                                       Training for Examination Setters and Markers: Over the past several
                                      	
                                       years, Zambia’s education system has expanded dramatically. Due to an
                                       increasing number of students enrolled in the system and registering to
                                       take the examinations in grades 7, 9, and 12, there was an immediate
                                       need for ECZ to train many additional question setters and markers. With
                                       the support of the READ Trust Fund, in 2011, a series of trainings was
                                       conducted. A total of 161 question setters received training in test design,
                                       construction, and item writing. Then, another training session on how to
                                       mark examinations and detect and report cheating was delivered to over
                                       900 markers. After the completion of the examinations cycle in early
                                       2012, it was evident that the quality of the examinations was much
                                       improved as a result of having many more trained staff. Based on the
                                       success of the first series of trainings, an additional training took place in
                                       2012 to train more than 100 question setters for Zambian languages.

                                       Study Visit: To learn from the Caribbean Examinations Board, a team of
                                      	
                                       ECZ staff traveled to Barbados in 2011. During this study visit, the team
                                       gained a greater understanding of how to use ICT in assessment, create
                                       item banks, improve candidate registration procedures, and use social
                                       media to distribute study materials and mitigate examinations malpractice.
                                       As a result, ECZ now has a very active Facebook page, communicates
                                       regularly with the public, and makes materials available to students online
                                       via its website.

System Alignment
Zambia’s inherited its examinations system from the United Kingdom. In
2014, in order to improve the alignment of their examinations with Zambia’s
current curriculum and national learning goals, 20 ECZ and Ministry of
Education staff received a week-long training in how to develop an assessment
framework and syllabi for key subject areas – English, Mathematics, and
Science. This training enabled ECZ staff to more closely examine what their
examinations are intended to measure and to identify possible improvements
to the current system. The new assessment framework and syllabi for the key
subject areas are now available on ECZ’s website for students to use to
prepare for their examinations.

NLSA

Effective Human Resources
Drawing on the results of the in-depth technical review of the NLSA program,
a number of capacity-building activities were organized to enhance ECZ’s
ability to conduct NLSA exercises. These targeted trainings allowed ECZ to 1)
improve the quality of its ongoing NLSA program which measures learning
outcomes in Literacy, Mathematics, Life Skills, and Local Languages for
grade 5; and 2) develop a new NLSA for grade 9 in Mathematics, Life Skills,
Local Languages, and Science.

  University Course: In 2011, two ECZ staff responsible for carrying out
 	
  NLSA activities attended a statistics course at the University of Michigan.
  This course covered the topics of sampling, basic and advanced statistical
  analysis, and report writing. Prior to the course, ECZ lacked the capacity
  to conduct its own sampling. As a result of the training, ECZ is less reliant
  on other government departments and can carry out their work more
  efficiently.

  Trainings: A series of trainings were designed to fill knowledge gaps

  among ECZ staff responsible for NLSA activities. With the support of an
  international assessment expert, 30 ECZ staff received training in key
  areas, such as how to use SPSS and IATA software packages to perform
  data analysis, Item Response Theory, and report writing. ECZ’s increased
  capacity in these areas greatly enhanced their analyses of the 2012 NLSA
  grade 5 results and the design of the new NLSA for grade 9.


                              “We used to share the [NLSA] findings in one thick
                              report which was not effective. But under READ,
                              we produced a video that was played on national
                              television . . . and we also produced brochures
                              with specific messages to [key] stakeholders.”

                                     Assessment Quality
                                     To improve the quality of the NLSA in grade 5, an in-depth technical review
                                     was conducted by an international assessment expert in 2012. This review
                                     helped identify possible areas for improvement to the NLSA and in which
                                     ECZ staff would benefit from additional training. It also highlighted
                                     improvements that could be incorporated into the design of the new NLSA in
                                     grade 9. The review was completed in early 2013 and followed by a series of
                                     training workshops for ECZ staff in the area of NLSA.

                                     Use of Results
                                     Although ECZ had been conducting regular NLSA activities, it struggled to
                                     disseminate the results in ways that optimized their use to inform policy and
                                     teaching practices. Prior to 2013, ECZ primarily relied on the issuance of one
                                     large technical report to communicate NLSA results. With the support of the
                                     READ Trust Fund, ECZ and key education stakeholders came together to
                                     devise a broad-reaching communications plan for disseminating the results
                                     of the 2012 NLSA in ways that would raise awareness about learning
                                     outcomes across the country and motivate people to take action.

                                     Each activity in the communications plan was designed to reach specific
                                     audiences. These communication materials included:

                                       Film: A 10-minute film about the NLSA results, entitled “Are Zambia’s

                                       citizens and aired on broadcast television.

                                       administrators, and policymakers were printed. This brochure highlighted
                                       the main NLSA findings and recommendations for action by key
                                       stakeholders.

                                       fractions and phonics (two of the weakest areas, according to the NLSA
                                       results), was developed for use in teacher in-service trainings.

                                     In September 2013, an event was organized to launch these materials and
                                     engage in a national dialogue on the actions needed to strengthen Zambia’s
                                     education results. This event was led by the Minister and included nearly 100
                                     representatives from all education departments, international donors, and
                                     several media outlets. As a result, greater attention is being paid by all key
                                     education stakeholders to the introduction of reforms that will improve the
                                     quality of education in Zambia.

The Teacher Education Unit worked closely with ECZ on identifying the
teachers and key messages to highlight in the case study videos. Following
the official launch event, all of the Teacher Resource Centre Coordinators and
Provincial Officers came together to participate in a training on how to use the
DVD and accompanying discussion guide for in-service teacher training. All
stakeholders agreed that accompanying the NLSA results with a list of
concrete actions that teachers can incorporate into their teaching practices
was a good strategy and should be continued in the future.

Effective Human Resources
In 2013, through the support of the READ Trust Fund, Zambia was selected
to be one of six pilot countries to participate in the PISA for Development
initiative. In order to draw upon and further strengthen the organizational and
human resource capacity developed under READ, it was decided that this
initiative would be led by ECZ. The PISA for Development initiative is being
designed to include a strong capacity-building component and several
peer-to-peer learning activities. With READ support, one to two ECZ
representatives have been able to participate in all three of the international
workshops organized to discuss the development of the PISA for Development
tools with the other pilot countries, donor groups, and the OECD.

                                     Opportunities to Learn about Assessment Activities
                                     In February 2014, with READ Trust Fund support, an event was organized to
                                     officially launch Zambia’s participation in PISA for Development. This event
                                     was led by the Permanent Secretary for Education and included nearly 100
                                     representatives from various departments within the Ministry of Education,
                                     ECZ staff, and donor partners. OECD representatives were in attendance to
                                     deliver presentations on the overall goals of the program, the expected
                                     benefits of country participation, and examples of lesson learned from other
                                     countries that have participated in PISA. This event successfully engaged a
                                     range of key stakeholders and began a national dialogue on how the PISA
                                     results might be used to informed education policies in Zambia.



                                     CONCLUSION

                                     The objective of the READ Trust Fund program in Zambia was to help
                                     strengthen the capacity of its institutions responsible for measuring student
                                     learning outcomes and to ensure that findings from assessments are used to
                                     improve teaching and learning. As a direct result of the work accomplished
                                     under READ, Zambia has strengthened the capacity of more than 1,600 ECZ
                                     and Ministry of Education staff to carry out assessment activities. The national
                                     campaign to disseminate the 2012 NLSA results greatly improved the use of
                                     assessment results to inform education practices and more attention is being
                                     given to improving the quality of education in Zambia.

                     feedback, homework assignments, student presentations, diagnostic tests, and
                     end-of-unit quizzes). Provides “real time” information to support the teaching-
                     learning process.

Educational          A group of interconnected policies, structures, and practices for the generation
Assessment System:   and use of information on student learning or achievement.

National/            Also referred to as “large-scale assessments” or “large-scale surveys.” Designed
International        to provide data on the achievements of students in a curriculum area, aggregated
Assessments:         to provide an estimate of achievement levels in the education system as a whole at
                     a particular age or grade level. Involves the administration of achievement tests
                     either to a sample or a population of students. Teachers and others may be asked
                     to provide background information which, when related to student achievement,
                     can provide insights on how achievement is related to factors such as household
                     characteristics and levels of teacher training.

“Public” or          Tests that measure individual student achievement in relation to an official
“External”           curriculum or other formal body of knowledge and skills. Results are used, alone
Examinations:        or in combination with other information, to make highly consequential decisions
                     about individual examinees, such as promotion to the next grade or admission to

                                     Structure
                                     READ Country delegates were the primary audience for the conference.
                                     Country delegations, World Bank education task teams, and international
                                     assessment experts were seated at roundtables to encourage active
                                     participation and interaction. The materials were presented in English,
                                     Russian, and Portuguese and slides were projected in English and Russian.
                                     Each presentation was followed by ample time for discussion. The first two

                                     identifying key takeaway messages for their countries. On the final day, each
                                     country delegation delivered a presentation on their country’s goals for
                                     assessments, followed by a panel discussion.

                                     Outcome
                                     The conference marked an important milestone for READ, as it was the first
                                     occasion for the seven READ countries to interact with each other, the donor,
                                     and international experts. The main objectives for the conference were
                                     achieved. It consolidated READ countries’ commitment to the assessment
                                     agenda, spurred their desire for more knowledge and interaction with each
                                     other and with international experts, created visibility for Russia as an
                                     important donor in education, developed a strong reputation for the READ
                                     program, and positioned the World Bank and Russia in a strong leadership
                                     role in the area of assessment. According to feedback from the READ
                                     countries and the Russian government, the conference was highly successful
                                     and made significant strides in moving forward the READ agenda. All

THIRD READ GLOBAL CONFERENCE – 2011




The World Bank held a joint Third READ Global Conference and Sixth World
Bank ECA Education Conference in Eschborn, Germany on October 23–26,
2011. The event was hosted at the headquarters of the Deutsche Gesellschaft
für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and was sponsored by READ, the
World Bank’s education division for the Europe and Central Asia Region
(ECA), and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and
Development (BMZ). This event brought together over 160 participants
comprising delegations of high-level education officials from 21 countries
(AFR – Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Zambia; EAS – Vietnam;
and ECA – Albania, Armenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Georgia,
Kosovo, the Kyrgyz Republic, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro,
Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, and Tajikistan), Russian officials
and education experts, World Bank staff, GIZ staff, and international
assessment experts. All in all, there were more than 38 countries represented
at this international event.

Objectives
The key objective of the conference was to help READ-supported and ECA
countries to strengthen their ability to use assessment results in meaningful
ways that ultimately leads to improvements in education quality. The
conference helped participants develop a better understanding of how to:

 	use assessment results to improve education policy and practice at
   national/sub-national and school levels;
 	support efforts to help teachers and other educators understand how to
   interpret assessment data; and
 	involve students, parents, and public stakeholders in monitoring learning
   outcomes in their schools and communities.

                                     Additionally, the conference provided participants with an opportunity to
                                     learn lessons from other countries’ experiences with the use of student
                                     assessment results. Site visits with local stakeholders that use student
                                     assessment results highlighted the practical, concrete ways that Germany is
                                     using assessment data to improve its student learning outcomes.

                                     Key Messages
                                     Under the theme, “Using Student Assessment Results for Education
                                     Quality and Systems Strengthening,” the 2011 conference focused on
                                     ways to use data from various assessment activities (international and national
                                     large-scale assessments, examinations, and classroom assessments) to
                                     strengthen education systems and improve learning outcomes. Assessment
                                     activities are only effective in improving education quality when they are used
                                     in ways that inform policymakers’ decisions, help teachers improve their
                                     teaching practices, and empower parents with information on how well their
                                     children are learning. Key overall messages that emerged during the
                                     conference included the following:

                                      	Classroom assessment has a high potential for increasing achievement
                                        and reducing learning disparities but is underdeveloped, poorly
                                        understood, and inadequately utilized in most education systems.
                                      	Different kinds of assessments provide critical information for different
                                        purposes, including supporting pedagogy, monitoring learning levels,
                                        benchmarking school or district performance, certifying competencies,
                                        ensuring accountability, and strengthening the education system, but few
                                        countries examine, use, and disseminate the results adequately.
                                      	One of the biggest challenges countries face is weak capacity and
                                        expertise to analyze assessment results, communicate results, and use
                                        results to drive improved and equitable learning.

                                     Structure
                                     As a combined event, the conference was structured to meet different donor
                                     needs. The first half of the conference was intended for a broad audience, open
                                     to all conference participants. These plenary sessions covered universal themes
                                     such as using assessment results to improve overall education quality; reporting
                                     large-scale assessment results in ways to ensure equity; good practices and
                                     lessons learned from a series of case studies on uses of assessment results;
                                     and techniques to effectively use classroom assessment results. On the
                                     afternoon of day two, the conference divided into READ-only and ECA-only
                                     sessions. Participation in the READ-only sessions was limited to those directly
                                     associated with the READ program. These sessions were intended to provide
                                     an opportunity for Russian representatives, READ country government
                                     delegations, and World Bank staff to report back on the progress achieved thus
                                     far and discuss any challenges impeding their progress. After a series of site
                                     visits on day three, READ participants were brought back to participate in
                                     country clinics in which they examined their country’s benchmarking report and
                                     reflected on ways they could improve the use of assessment results.

Outcome
This year’s conference provided a unique opportunity to expand the reach of
the previous two conferences to include a much broader audience and
expose many new countries to the important work being carried out under
the READ program. The conference successfully brought together a large
number of assessment experts and high-level education leaders and focused
their attention on the critical importance of improving education quality. READ
countries reported their early successes and left the conference motivated to
press forward and ramp up their efforts. According to evaluation forms from
conference participants, the conference was deemed a success by all who
participated. All conference materials are available on the READ Trust Fund
website (www.worldbank.org/readtf).

                                     READ Regional Workshop for ECA
                                     The READ Regional Workshop for ECA was a one-day side event during the
                                     IAEA Conference. The READ Trust Fund global team invited assessment
                                     practitioners and others implementing READ-supported activities in four of
                                     the eight READ countries to participate in the workshop. The 34 participants
                                     at the September 19 workshop included delegations from Armenia, the
                                     Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Vietnam, in addition to World Bank staff
                                     and representatives from CICED.

                                     The primary objective of the workshop was to create an interactive environment
                                     that allowed the country teams to engage in South-South knowledge sharing.
                                     The objectives of the workshop were to i) support the four participating READ
                                     country teams in moving forward with the activities outlined in their READ
                                     action plans; ii) provide participating READ country teams with the opportunity
                                     to discuss and resolve key challenges in relation to those plans; and iii) provide
                                     an opportunity for the sharing of lessons learned and expertise across the
                                     four READ country teams. To encourage active participation, each team
                                     came prepared to discuss their experiences in a variety of assessment areas.
                                     Topics discussed included:

                                      	Large-Scale Assessment, with a dual focus on (i) successful participation
                                        in international large-scale assessment exercises and (ii) reporting and
                                        using assessment information from large-scale assessments
                                      	Classroom Assessment, with a focus on teacher training models
                                      	Examinations, with a focus on ensuring quality and combating malpractice
                                      	Higher-Order Thinking Skills, with a focus on approaches to assessing
                                        these skills

                                     The country teams were eager to discuss and share experiences with each
                                     other. For example, based on their own prior experiences, Armenia and the
                                     Kyrgyz Republic were able to provide valuable advice to the Vietnamese
                                     team, who were participating in their very first PISA exercise. It was
                                     encouraging to see the countries build off each other’s experiences and
                                     share lessons learned. All presentations and workshop materials have been
                                     posted on the READ Trust Fund website (www.worldbank.org/readtf).

READ Regional Workshop for Africa
The READ Trust Fund hosted a three-day READ Regional Workshop for
African countries in Maputo, Mozambique from December 3–5. The workshop
focused on supporting four country teams – Angola, Ethiopia,
Mozambique, and Zambia – in moving forward with activities being funded
under the READ Trust Fund program, providing them with the opportunity to
discuss and resolve key challenges/issues in relation to those plans as well
as share lessons learned and expertise. The 37 participants included country
teams of between 5 to 10 assessment practitioners implementing READ
activities, World Bank staff, and representatives from the Russian embassy.

The workshop was designed for country delegates to take on a very active
role, driven by their specific assessment interests and needs as they pertained
to READ. The workshop sessions included the following focal areas:

 	Examinations, with a focus on ensuring quality and combating malpractice 
 	National Large-Scale Assessment,  with a focus on disseminating and
   using assessment information
 	National Large-Scale Assessment, with a focus on how to train staff to
   improve assessment design and implementation
 	All assessment types, with a focus on planning and monitoring.

To encourage knowledge sharing across countries, each delegation was
asked to select one of the topics to be discussed during the workshop and
prepare a presentation, which highlighted their experiences, lessons learned,
and challenges in this area. Workshop participants were also given the
chance to visit schools in Maputo to discuss Provinha – a written, early-grade
reading assessment that was designed as part of the program of READ Trust
Fund–supported activities in Mozambique. The workshop proved to be a
valuable opportunity for READ-supported countries to present their work,
solicit feedback, and share lessons. All materials from the workshop are
available on the READ Trust Fund website (www.worldbank.org/readtf).

                                     AEAA AND IAEA CONFERENCES – 2013




                                     In lieu of a stand-alone READ Global Conference in 2013, the READ Trust
                                     Fund combined efforts with two large assessment associations – the AEAA
                                     and IAEA. Each of these associations organizes an annual conference to
                                     bring together assessment experts from across the globe to discuss key
                                     issues and the latest developments in the area of measuring student learning.
                                     The READ Trust Fund sponsored the participation of the four READ countries
                                     from Africa (Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Zambia) at the AEAA
                                     Conference in Tanzania and the other four countries (Armenia, the Kyrgyz
                                     Republic, Tajikistan, and Vietnam) at the IAEA Conference in Israel.

                                     Sharing READ Trust Fund Results
                                     At both of these events, panel sessions were organized to present the work
                                     being carried out under the READ Trust Fund program. These sessions
                                     began with some introductory remarks on the key role that assessment plays
                                     in the “Learning for All” agenda and how the SABER-Student Assessment
                                     tools can help countries further develop their systems to monitor learning
                                     outcomes. Then, a representative from each READ-sponsored country
                                     shared specific examples of activities that have led to measurable
                                     improvements in their assessment systems. Through these sessions, the
                                     program was able to communicate and link READ’s key messages and
                                     results to the bigger community of international assessment experts.

                                     Disseminating Knowledge Products on Student Assessment
                                     These two events drew many of the world’s leading experts in assessment
                                     and provided a tremendous opportunity to disseminate and share the
                                     products developed under the READ Trust Fund. Expo stands with more
                                     than 20 different READ-supported products on student assessment were
                                     organized for each event, and more than 1,000 copies of various READ
                                     publications were distributed.

                                     Recognizing Russia’s Contributions in the Area of Education Quality
                                     At the AEAA Conference, there were over 400 participants from more than 22
                                     African countries. At the IAEA Conference, there were nearly 370 participants
                                     from 45 countries across the globe. By partnering with assessment
                                     organizations like AEAA and IAEA and sharing the innovative work being
                                     accomplished under the READ Trust Fund, Russia has become widely
                                     recognized as a key player in the area of student assessment.

FOURTH READ GLOBAL CONFERENCE – 2014




Overview
The Fourth Russia Education Aid for Development (READ) Global Conference
took place from May 12-16, 2014 in St. Petersburg, Russia and focused on
the theme of “Measuring for Success: The role of assessment in achieving
learning goals.” The conference provided an opportunity to explore a variety
of learning goals – for further study, work, and life – and the role that
assessment plays in monitoring and achieving them. The conference also
allowed the countries participating in READ to discuss their achievements
under the program and how these serve as a foundation for attaining learning
goals and ensuring success for their children. Each country team led a
session at the conference to highlight their successes under READ. Teams
also showcased their results at a READ exposition event.

In total, 122 participants from 19 countries attended the 2014 conference,
including representatives from the eight READ countries (Angola, Armenia,
Ethiopia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mozambique, Tajikistan, Vietnam,
and Zambia); global experts in the areas of assessment and learning; World
Bank and other international agency staff; and government officials.

In the opening session, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, the
World Bank, and the country teams recognized the efforts of the many people
who conceived, launched, and implemented the READ program and its
activities. Since its inception, the program has provided an important link
between assessment theory and practice, and helped inform policy dialogue
on education quality and learning.

                                     Key Messages
                                     During the conference, international experts and country representatives
                                     shared their experiences in “measuring for success” at the classroom,
                                     national, and global levels. There were three main takeaways from this
                                     discussion:

                                      	Measuring for Success: Resources should be allocated to initiatives that
                                        make the most impact on learning. Measurement helps identify which
                                        initiatives are successful at achieving impact. Spending choices should
                                        be guided by the relative impact of initiatives on learning as opposed to
                                        just the volume of spending involved.
                                      	Role of Assessment: Assessment plays an important role in achieving
                                        learning goals. Classroom assessment by teachers is key in this regard.
                                        For teachers to effectively use classroom assessment as a tool for
                                        improving student learning, they need comprehensive pre- and in-service
                                        training on this topic that includes a focus on learning goals and how to
                                        collect evidence of student learning
                                      	Achieving Learning Goals: Large-scale assessments are effective tools
                                        for measuring progress toward learning goals at the system level.
                                        High-quality national and international assessments allow countries to
                                        identify gaps in performance or the acquisition of key skills so that policy
                                        makers can target resources where most needed.

                                     Outcome
                                     The conference concluded with the Russian Federation, World Bank, and
                                     READ country delegates reiterating their appreciation for the opportunity to
                                     come together to learn and share. The Russian Federation and the World
                                     Bank emphasized their commitment to supporting countries in building their
                                     capacity to measure learning; the country delegates expressed their gratitude
                                     for this support, and also praised the conference program, speakers, and
                                     discussions, which they found to be very informative and relevant.
