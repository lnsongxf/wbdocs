THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the eco nomy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        Obtain project clearance from Fire Department

        According to the Rescue Act of 2010, obtaining fire safety
        clearance for the building project from the National Rescue
        Service Agency or a local government rescue service should take
        10 days. However in practice it takes 30 days. If the building
   1    project does not conform to the fire safety rules, the Rescue             30 days                no charge
        Service can decide to give on average five workdays to eliminate
        deficiencies.

        Agency: Fire Department



        * Obtain project clearance from Environment Department

        The Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental
        Management System Act entered into effect on April 3, 2005,
        providing legal bases and procedures for assessing likely
        environmental impact, organization of eco-management and
        audit schemes, and the legal bases for awarding eco-labels to
        prevent environmental damage.

        The environmental impact shall be assessed upon application for,
        or application for amendment of, a development consent (a
   2    building permit or a permit for the building use), if the proposed        29 days                no charge
        activity, which is the basis for the application for, or the
        amendment of, the development consent, potentially results in
        significant environmental impact. A person who proposes an
        activity and intends to carry it out shall organize an
        environmental impact assessment and carry all the resulting
        expenses.

        It is up to the local municipality to decide whether it is at all
        necessary to assess the environmental impact of the project.
        There are two types of grounds for requiring an environmental
        impact assessment to be carried out. First of all there are
Doing Business 2016                     Estonia                                                            28

                                                                              Time to
No.    Procedure                                                                        Cost to complete
                                                                             complete
      instances in which it is obligatory to conduct environmental
      impact assessment. The hypothetical warehouse project should
      not qualify under this category. The second category is such that
      the local municipality is required to consider whether an
      environmental impact assessment is needed or not and if the
      local municipality decides that it is necessary, it must give
      reasons for such a decision. The hypothetical warehouse project
      might qualify under this category if for example considered to be
      (a part of) an industrial area development. Besides the fact that it
      is in hands of municipality to make a decision, there are no clear
      definitions on what does not exactly fall into category of projects
      that do not qualify for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). It
      is likely BuildCo would need to obtain a clearance but not the full
      scale EIA approval.

      The Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental
      Management System Act established a term of 30 days for
      issuing a decision to approve the environmental impact
      assessment report. The time may vary from 30 days to 1 year for
      actual EIA approval both from Municipality and Environmental
      Supervisory Authority. It would also include a period of public
      hearing. However, since we are just getting a project clearance
      for a relatively simple project, the procedure should be
      completed within 30 days.

      Agency: Environment Department



      * Obtain project clearance from Health Care Department

      A clearance for the building project from the Health Care
      Department is not required. However, this authority may be
      consulted by the local government before granting or refusing
      the building permit. In practice, the local government may ask
      the applicant to personally communicate with these authorities.
3     There is no time limits for such communication. Further, the           28 days       no charge
      Health Care Department has the right to perform state
      supervision over compliance with occupational health
      requirements when the warehouse is put into use.

      Agency: Health Care Department



      * Obtain project clearance from Labor Inspections
      Department

      A clearance for the building project from the Labor Inspections
      Department is not required by law in the stage prior to approval
      of the building permit. However, this authority may be consulted
4     by the local government before granting or refusing the building       27 days       no charge
      permit. In practice, the local government may ask the applicant
      to personally communicate with these authorities. The Labor
      Inspectorate has the right to perform state supervision over
      compliance with occupational safety requirements during
      construction and when the warehouse is put into use. According
      to Occupational Health and Safety Act, Paragraph 13, the

      employer is obliged to notify the local department of the Labor
      Inspectorate in writing or in a format which can be reproduced in
      writing before commencing activities. The notification can also
      be made also via the Customer Portal of the Labor Inspectorate
      (https://eti.ti.ee/login/index?redir=true).

      Paragraph 26 provides that after receiving the notification, an
      inspector has the obligation to carry out an inspection. The
      employee of the Labor Inspectorate must set up the time of
      inspection with the owner of the building, but in extraordinary
      situations, the inspector has the right to commence supervision
      without informing the employer in advance.

      Agency: Labor Inspections Department



      Obtain building permit

      To obtain a building permit from the Municipality, BuildCo must
      submit an application for a construction permit and construction
      design documentation. According to the Building Act, the local
      government must approve or refuse the issuance of a building
      permit within 20 days from the date on which the application for
      the building permit and the building design documentation are
      submitted. The Municipality conducts internal consultations with
      various departments and agencies. However in practice, BuildCo
      is likely to follow up with these authorities.

5                                                                         25 days       EUR 585
      Since June 2009, an energy certificate for the new building must
      be included in the application. The energy audit is assumed to be
      conducted by the engineers of the newly built warehouse.

      Prior to construction, BuildCo must notify the Municipality that
      construction will begin.




      Agency: Municipality



      Receive on-site inspection by Municipality

      During construction, the Municipality may monitor the work to
      verify compliance with the requirements. If the construction does
      not comply with the applicable rules and regulations, the            1 day        no charge

      According to the amendment of Building Act from January 1,
      2008 Estonian Technical Surveillance Authority may carry out
      state surveillance on construction sites, in addition to the
Doing Business 2016                     Estonia                                                           30

                                                                            complete
      surveillance exercised by the Municipality. Before the building is
      being used or in case of an emergency in a building that is
      already in use, the Estonian Technical Surveillance Authority does
      not have to inform the owner about the inspection beforehand.
      In other situations, the owner must be notified at least 24 hours
      in advance.

      The number of inspections is not limited by law -- it is up to the
      discretion of the Technical Surveillance Authority. However it
      should comply with the principles of good administration
      practices. The costs of the evaluation services, of the expert
      assessment of building design documentation and of the
      evaluation of construction works ordered to verify conformity to
      the requirements are borne by the Technical Surveillance
      Authority. If it is established that the construction works or
      building design documentation do not conform to the
      established requirements, the owner of the construction works
      has to compensate the Technical Surveillance Authority for the
      costs of the evaluation services ordered to verify conformity to
      the requirements, including the costs of expert assessment or
      evaluation.

      Agency: Technical Surveillance Authority



      Apply for permit of use and request final inspection from
      Municipality

      The local municipality has discretion as to which agencies can be
      engaged in the inspection before the permit to use the building
      is issued. According to the law, the local municipality must issue
      a permit to use the building (or issue a refusal to not use the
      building) within 20 days from the date on which the last
8     document necessary for the issue of the permit is submitted.          25 days        EUR 64
      However, in practice it takes longer. BuildCo would have the
      right to file an action to the administrative court in case the 20-
      day limit is not respected. In practice though few companies file
      lawsuits against the authorities.

      * Receive final inspection from Municipality and obtain

      The date and the time of the final inspection is agreed between

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
