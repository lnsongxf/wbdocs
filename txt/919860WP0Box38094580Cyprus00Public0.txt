THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number

        Submit an application for electricity connection to Electric Authority
        of Cyprus and await an estimate of connection fees

        The customer can apply either in person (at any customer service
        location) or by email. The forms for the application are available on-line.
        Most of the applicants download the form on-line and apply in person
        since they can get a follow-up number. In the application, the customer
        needs to provide contact information, description of the location of the
        premise (land plot number), and provide a copy of the title deed or lease
        agreement. The customer will also need to explain the load requirements
        and justify the need for the requested load. Finally, they have to provide
        an expected time of connection. Usually, the customer applies for the
        connection just before starting the construction of the building since the
        process can take some time.

        After the external inspection by the utility (see next procedure), the
        inspector will prepare the “quotation of terms” (estimate). Before
        sharing the estimate cost with the customer, the Electric Authority of
        Cyprus submits the application for clearance and approval to several
        government authorities including: telecom, sewerage, public works,
        municipality, archeological department and fire brigade. At this point
        the utility also obtains an excavation permit. After all these clearances
        are received, the utility will notify the client and provide him with the
        estimate.

        The estimate of the connection fees can be paid at any customer service
        of the utility.

      An applicant can request an internal wiring inspection at any customer
      service of the utility.

      Inspectors from the utility evaluate compliance of the internal wiring with
      safety regulations. After the inspection, the inspector issues a certificate
      of compliance. During the inspection, the certified in-house electrician
      should be present. Typically, insurance companies in Cyprus will ask for a
4     copy of this certificate before ensuring any building.                       26 calendar days            EUR 0

      The electrician who did the internal wiring submits a signed notification
      to the utility upon completion in which they guarantee it has been
      carried out according to the regulations. During the inspection the utility
      also does tests of the installed external installation. The meter is installed
      at this point.

      File the contract at the Department of Lands and Surveys

      The deposition of the contract of sale with the Department of Lands and
      Surveys is mandatory under The Contract Law, Cap.149 as amended (Law
      no.99(I)/2013) and applies to all sales contracts that are signed from the
      date of the entering into force of the law, 9th of September 2013 and
      onwards. Furthermore, in pursuance with the Law No. 81 (I)/2011, the
      buyer is given 6 months from the date of signing the contract of sale to
      deposit it to the District Land Office of the district where the property is
      situated.



      The objective of this reform is to protect the parties interests, especially
      the buyer's in case of violation of the agreement. In particular, the             1 day          EUR 50

      deposit of contract serves the following objectives:

      1) It prevents the seller from selling the same property twice.

      2) If the seller does not perform his obligations ( i.e.he does not come to
      the land registry to transfer the property), the buyer can apply to the
      court which issues a decision requiring the Department of Lands and
      Surveys to transfer the property to the absence of the seller - what is
      called "specific performance" of the contract ( i.e. if the seller refuses or
      fails to comply with his contractual obligations) etc

        sale agreement. If the assessed price is higher than the paid amount
        stated in the purchase agreement, an inspection will be conducted by
        staff from the land registry. This valuation is required in order to prevent
        fraud (i.e. state in the sale agreement a lower amount in order to pay less
        transfer fees).

TRADING ACROSS BORDERS
In today’s globalized world, making trade between          WHAT THE TRADING ACROSS BORDERS

burdensome customs procedures, inefficient port
operations and inadequate infrastructure all lead to        Documents required to export and import
extra costs and delays for exporters and importers,         (number)
stifling trade potential. Research shows that                Bank documents
exporters in developing countries gain more from a
                                                             Customs clearance documents

Doing Business measures the time and cost                    Obtaining, filling out and submitting all the
(excluding tariffs and the time and cost for sea             documents
transport) associated with exporting and importing a

standard shipment of goods by sea transport, and
the number of documents necessary to complete the            Customs clearance and inspections

of trading across borders is determined by sorting
their distance to frontier scores for trading across         Inland transport and handling
borders. These scores are the simple average of the          Customs clearance and inspections
distance to frontier scores for each of the component

indicators. To make the data comparable across
economies, Doing Business uses several assumptions           Official costs only, no bribes
about the business and the traded goods.
