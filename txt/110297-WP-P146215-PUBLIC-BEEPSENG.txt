EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys 2013 (BEEPS or
Enterprise Surveys) conducted by the World Bank provides new opportunities to better
understand obstacles to female entrepreneurship in Turkey and thereby develop more
focused policies to improve it. The last BEEPS for Turkey, conducted between January
2013 and May 2014, covers 1,344 enterprises that employ at least 5 people and operate
in industry or services all around Turkey. Those who are identified as “the top manager”,
“the main decision maker” and “owner/one of the owners (by any share in the capital)
of the enterprise” in the survey are referred to as the “leader of the enterprise” for the
purpose of this study. The main findings of the study based on this identification are as
follows:

Enterprise Profiles

Compared to those led by men, enterprises led by women are:

     More owned by foreign capital,
     More part of a larger company,
     Similar in terms of formal type (i.e. legal structure),
     More concentrated in textile, clothing, chemical products manufacturing
      industries but less in machinery, electronics and vehicles manufacturing as well as
      construction and services other than trade,
     More located in the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions but less in the Aegean
      region and particularly few in Eastern Anatolia,
     Established more recently,
     Medium scale in terms of employment and sales.

Enterprise Leaders

Compared to their male counterparts, female leaders are slightly older and slightly
fewer of them are married. Although exploring entrepreneurship opportunities is the
main reason for leaders of both gender to establish their business, necessity driven
entrepreneurship plays a bigger role for female entrepreneurs.




                                                                                        4
Enterprise Performance

Regarding the relative performance of enterprises led by men and women:

      Employment gap: Enterprises led by women employed, on average, 27% less
       people (9.7 staff) than those led by men in 2013,
      The employment gap between male and women-led enterprises is relatively low
       due to the fact that enterprises led by women are concentrated in sectors with a
       higher average enterprise size and are more owned by foreign capital, which have
       on average, more employees than domestically owned enterprises,
      However, the fact that enterprises led by women are younger, contributes to the
       employment gap,
      Employment growth: In terms of employment growth over the 2010-2013 period,
       there is no significant difference between those enterprises led by men versus
       those led by women,
      Women-led enterprises are concentrated in sectors that recorded a better
       employment performance over 2010-2013,
      In contrast, being more owned by foreign capital had a negative effect in the
       relative employment performance of women-led enterprises over this period,
      Sales gap: Enterprises led by women had an average of 54% more sales (TL 2.03
       millions) than those led by men in 2013,
      Some part of the sales gap in favor of women-led enterprises originates from the
       fact that women-led enterprises are more concentrated in sectors with higher
       average enterprise sales,
      Comparative sales figures of women-led enterprises are negatively affected by
       being younger (established later).

Business Environment Constraints

Compared to those led by men, enterprises led by women:

    Do not perceive most business environment issues as bigger obstacles for their
     operation,
    Apply less for operating licenses and it takes significantly more time for them to
     obtain it though the reasons for that are not clear,
    Benefit more from state-owned banks and non-bank financial institutions for
     securing loans.

I. INTRODUCTION
It is well documented that participation of women in economic life in Turkey is too low
both compared to that of men in the country and that of women in countries of similar
per capita income2. This gender gap in economic participation is observed not only in
participation in the labor market, but also in entrepreneurship. Although women in
most countries lag behind men in entrepreneurship, the gap is particularly large in
Turkey3.

Achieving gender equity in economic life is one of the main areas covered by the Turkey
Country Partnership Strategy of the World Bank Group. One of the projects that the
Bank has been implementing together with the Ministry of Family and Social Policies to
this end is the “Increasing Women’s Access to Economic Opportunities”. This study aims
to contribute to the project by identifying and analyzing gender aspects of
entrepreneurship in Turkey.

The Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPS or Enterprise
Surveys) of the World Bank provide an opportunity to better understand obstacles to
female entrepreneurship in Turkey and thereby develop more focused policies to
improve it. The most recent BEEPS for Turkey, conducted between January 2013 and
May 2014, covers 1,344 enterprises that employ at least 5 person and operate in
industry or services all around Turkey. The survey analyses enterprises in Turkey by
employee size (of 5+ enterprises), geographical region and sector.

In addition to the main survey that includes questions about the business environment,
a separate module on gender was included in the 2013 Turkey survey. The purpose of
the gender module was to get a better understanding of the profiles and performance
of enterprises led by women as well as the profiles of what we define as women
company leaders. Questions that are included either in the main or gender module and
are considered useful for the purpose of this study are given below:

     What is the gender of the top manager of the enterprise?
     What percentage of the enterprise belongs to women?
     Is the top manager the owner or one of the owners of the enterprise?
     Is the top manager the main decision maker at the same time?

     her/him?
    How did the main decision maker join the enterprise/ What is the reason for
     joining the enterprise?

Dataset and Methodology

The method followed to define “female entrepreneur” is a very critical step in the study.
The first criterion for this is the female ownership in the enterprise. A quick analysis of
this variable shows that out of 1,315 enterprises to be used in the analysis, 26.5% of
them (25.3% once sampling weights are applied) are at least partially owned by women.
At first glance, this is a quite satisfactory ratio with positive implications for women
entrepreneurship in Turkey. On the other hand, a deeper analysis reveals that analysis
based on women ownership might be misleading. This is because, only in 16 of 1,315
enterprises women have an ownership share above 50% and in an additional 10
enterprises they have an ownership share of 50%. Moreover, only 6 enterprises in the
sample completely belong to women. In the bulk of enterprises surveyed, women either
do not have any ownership or have only a nominal ownership.

These findings pose the following problem for the study: Neither decisions taken nor the
performance of enterprises with a nominal female ownership can be attributed to
women. The number of enterprises with at least equal female participation in
ownership (%0.6) is very low to conduct any sound analysis. Because of these two
reasons, identifying female entrepreneurs based on ownership in the enterprise is not a
plausible option.

Instead, the gender of the manager, gender of the decision maker and female
ownership are used together to define and identify “female entrepreneurs” in this
study. In the dataset, the top manager of 87 of 1,315 enterprises is a woman. In 79 of
these 87 enterprises, the female top manager is also the main decision maker. Finally, in
70 of these 79 enterprises the top manager is also the owner or one of the owners of
the enterprise. We define these 70 women as “women leaders”, these 70 enterprises as
“women-led enterprises” and consider this to be the main category of analysis. This
corresponds to 5.3% of all enterprises in our sample.

In contrast, we find that 890 of 1,315 enterprises are led by men, when this definition is
applied. For comparison purposes, we define a third category of enterprises: “women
enterprises” – namely enterprises with any share of female ownership. 349 enterprises


                                                                                         7
in the survey fall in this category. On the other hand, we do not consider defining
enterprises with male ownership as a forth category of comparison to be useful. This is
because such a category would include almost all enterprises in the dataset since only 6
enterprises in the dataset completely belong to women.

Although the figure we find for the share of women-led enterprises (5.3%) is quite low,
it is consistent with the documented gender gap for entrepreneurship in the world and
particularly in Turkey. Using Household Labor Force Surveys, Ökten (2013) reports that
7.4% of all business owners in Turkey are women. Although the exact ratio changes by
country, in almost all countries analyzed in the literature, business owners are
overwhelmingly male (Georgellis and Wall, 2005; Minniti et al., 2005; Kim, 2007;
Sabarwal and Terrell, 2008; Minniti and Naude, 2010).

There are two caveats of our dataset: (1) The BEEPS sample excludes enterprises with
less than 5 employees. As such findings may not reflect profiles of women-led and
women-owned start-ups. (2) The selected women-led enterprises sample largely
excludes the category of women-owned enterprises, which is a more common definition
for similar research and has been more widely studied in Turkey.

Finally, before analyzing the 2013 Survey in detail, it is useful to compare 2008 and 2013
surveys in terms of basic indicators relating to female participation in the economy. A
first analysis of the 2013 Survey reveals that female participation in the economy
decreased over the period of 2008-2013 both for employment and entrepreneurship. In
the 2008 survey, 12% of enterprises were women-led. In contrast, the survey of 2013
found that only 5% of enterprises were women-led. In addition, the share of enterprises
with female ownership decreased from 41% to 25% over that period. Finally, according
to both surveys, the share of women in all employed people decreased from 25% to
22% over the period (World Bank, 2014)4.

The outline of this study is as follows: The second section compares profiles of
entrepreneurs led by men versus those led by women. So, the basic characteristics of
enterprises are compared by gender of the leader. The third section compares the
profiles of the company leaders themselves. The forth section analyzes performances of
enterprises by gender of the leader and finally the fifth section analyses the perception
of business environment constraints by gender of the business leader.

4These figures indicate a surprising negative trend for female entrepreneurship and economic participation in Turkey.
There is an ongoing effort that aims to reveal whether any issues during the implementation of the Survey by the
contractor is the reason for such a surprising finding.

II. COMPANY PROFILES – CHARACTERISTICS OF ENTERPRISES BY
GENDER OF THE LEADER
This section looks at how enterprises led by men and those led by women differ with
regards to foreign ownership in their capital, legal type, sector and geographical region
in which they operate, age, employment and sales volume.

Foreign Ownership

Patterns of foreign capital in the ownership of enterprises are given in Figure-1. In this
Figure, those enterprises with a minimum 50% of foreign capital are categorized as
“foreign-owned”, and others are categorized as “domestically-owned”. Figure-1
demonstrates that 26% of enterprises led by women in the sample are foreign-owned.
In contrast, only 1% of those led by men are foreign-owned. Comparing women-led
enterprises and enterprises with women share: The corresponding share of foreign
capital in enterprises with women share is only 6%. As such, more women-led
enterprises have foreign ownership compared to both men-led enterprises as well as
enterprises with women share.




Findings in Figure-1 lead to the question of whether enterprises led by women are local
offices or subsidiaries of multinational corporations. This is studied in Figure-2. In the
Figure enterprises are classified both on the basis of the gender of the leader and the
foreign/domestic ownership. It is noteworthy that almost half of the enterprises led by
women and which are at the same time foreign-owned are part of a larger company. On
the other hand, only 1% of enterprises led by men and which are at the same time
foreign-owned, are part of a larger company. As for domestically-owned enterprises,
incidence of being part of a larger company is slightly more frequent among those led by
men (9%) relative to those led by women (6%).


                                                                                        9
Legal Type

Figure-3 provides legal types of enterprises by gender of the leader. In general, there is
not a big difference between legal type of enterprises led by men and women. More
than 50% of enterprises led by men or women are in the form of shareholding
companies with no shares
traded. Sole proprietorship
follows with a share of around
30%. 2% of enterprises led by
women and 1% of those led by
men are in the form of
shareholding companies with
traded shares. Comparing
women-led enterprises and
enterprises with women share:
As has been observed with
previous         characteristics
examined, enterprises with women share demonstrate very different characteristics in
terms legal type as well. 76% of enterprises with women share are shareholding
companies with no shares traded. In contrast, only 9% of enterprises with women share
are in the form of sole proprietorship.

Sector Distribution

Next, we investigate sector distribution of enterprises. There is a high number of studies
in the literature documenting that female and male business owners are concentrated
in different sectors. Klapper and Parker (2010) reports that women-owned businesses
are more in labor intensive sectors such as trade and services. Singh and et al. (2001)
documents that women-owned business are concentrated in sectors with lower profits.
Both Menzies et al. (2004) and Morris et al. (2006) find that only a slight portion of
women-owned businesses operate in sectors with high-growth prospects and
technology intensive. Analyzing household labor force surveys, Ökten (2013) documents
that female owners are more concentrated in financial services, and social and
education services in the Turkish Economy but less in construction, transportation and
manufacturing industry.




                                                                                       10
Following the literature review on the subject, Figure-4 demonstrates sector distribution
of enterprises in BEEPS. It is striking that almost half of women -led enterprises operate
in two sectors. 24% of enterprises led by women operate in textile and clothing
manufacturing and 22% of
them operate in chemicals and
chemical               products
manufacturing5.
Concentration of women-led
enterprises in these two
sectors are far above the
concentration of men-led
enterprises.     In    contrast,
women-led enterprises are far
less       concentrated        in
machinery, electronics and
motor vehicles manufacturing, construction, and services other than wholesale and
retail trade compared to those led by men. The level concentration of women and men-
led enterprises are close to each other in other manufacturing and wholesale and retail
trade services.

Findings presented in Figure-4 are somewhat different from the findings of Ökten (2013)
for Turkey and studies mentioned above for other countries. The share of female
enterprises operating in the services sector (27%) is much lower than those reported in
other studies. The reason for this discrepancy is assumed to be a result of the fact that
only enterprises with at least 5 employees are included in this study. Therefore, a high
share of services enterprises are excluded from this study relative to manufacturing
enterprises because average employee size of retail trade services enterprises are, on
average, lower than others in the economy.

Geographic Distribution

Figure-5 presents the correlation between gender of the leader and the geographical
region of enterprises. In this Figure, two official regions - Eastern Anatolia and
Southeastern Anatolia - are covered under the Eastern Anatolia category. All other
regions in the Figure correspond to official regions with the same name. For all three


5Within the chemical products manufacturing sector are base chemicals, paints, agricultural chemicals, explosives,
pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, cleaning items and items made of plastic and rubber.


                                                                                                               11
enterprise types, particularly for those with women share, the Marmara region, which
includes Istanbul, is the one with the highest share of enterprises led by women by a
large margin.

Enterprises led by women are concentrated more in Mediterranean, Black Sea and
                                                               Marmara relative to those
                                                               led by men. Enterprises led
                                                               by women and those led by
                                                               men        are       equally
                                                               concentrated in Central
                                                               Anatolia. Enterprises led by
                                                               women          are       less
                                                               concentrated than those
                                                               led by men in the Aegean
                                                               and Eastern Anatolia. The
                                                               difference is particularly
                                                               striking in the Eastern
Anatolia region. 7% of all enterprises led by men are located in this region. The share of
the region in all enterprises led by women is only 0.4%. Finally, relative to those led by
men, enterprises with women share are equal or less concentrated in regions other than
Istanbul but significantly higher concentrated in Istanbul (52 vs. 63%).

Age of Enterprises

Figure-6 compares average age of enterprises led by men and women. The mean and
median age of enterprises led
by women are 6 years (32%)
and 7 years (42%) lower than
mean and median age of those
led by men, respectively.
Enterprises with women share
have similar average age with
those led by men. While
interpreting these numbers, it
should be remembered that
they are computed using a
dataset composed of enterprises with at least 5 employees. If enterprises with less than



                                                                                         12
5 employees had been included in the dataset, average enterprise age could be
expected to be lower for all three types of enterprises in the Figure.

Enterprise Size By Number of Employees

It is commonly reported in the literature that women-owned businesses are smaller in
terms of employees than those owned by men (Dureitz and Henrekson, 2000; Klapper
and Parker, 2010). Turkey is
not an exception to this.
Compared to those owned by
men,            women-owned
businesses in Turkey are
concentrated in employment
levels less than 10 (Ökten,
2013). Figure-7 analyzes the
case for Turkey using BEEPS
data.      Enterprises     are
categorized into 3 groups by
employment level. Those employing between 5 and 19 are classified as “small”, those
employing between 20 and 99 as “medium” and those more than 99 as “large”
enterprises.

The Figure yields some interesting findings. Relative to enterprises led by men, women-
led enterprises have a lower concentration not only in large but also in small-sized
enterprises. 8% of all enterprises led by men but only 2% of women-led enterprises are
large by employment. In contrast, medium-size enterprises have a high representation
among women-led enterprises (36%). Comparing women-led enterprises and enterprises
with women share: It is also noteworthy that the share of small-size enterprises is the
lowest for enterprises with women share. In conclusion, women-led enterprises are
mostly medium sized while those with women share are mostly small.

In order to provide a more complete analysis of enterprise size, employment
distributions of enterprises by gender of the leader are given in Figure-8. The vertical
axis shows the density and the horizontal axis shows the number of employees in
logarithmic scale. The density is proportional to the number of enterprises that fall in
that specific employment level6. The Figure demonstrates very clearly that the peak of

6Since only enterprises with at least 5 employees are included in the analysis, the Figure horizontally starts from the
value of 1.6, which is the logarithm of 5.


                                                                                                                    13
the line that represents women-led enterprises is at the right of the peak of the line that
represents men-led enterprises. This roughly implies that male leaders are concentrated
in small-size enterprises relative to female leaders. On the other hand, there is no
women-led enterprise in the sample above the log employment level of 6, which
corresponds to 400 in normal
scale. This indicates that male
leaders are also concentrated
in large-scale enterprises
relative to female leaders. Put
differently, female leaders in
the     sample     are     more
concentrated in medium-size
enterprises.       Findings in
Figure-8 are similar to findings
in Figure-7. Moreover, Figure-
8 demonstrates that enterprises with women share are the largest among types of
enterprises compared. On the other hand, based on previous studies in the literature, it
would be safe to claim that concentration of female leaders would move towards
smaller enterprises, if enterprises with less than 5 employees had been included in the
sample.

Enterprise Size by Sales Volume

In this last section, female and men-
led enterprises are compared based
on their sales volume in Figure-9.
Previous studies in the literature
report that enterprises owned by
women have lower average sales
volume (Chaganti and Parasuraman,
1996; Minniti, 2009). To begin with,
Figure-9 provides sales categories of
enterprises.     3     categories    of
enterprises are defined by their sales figures: i. small: those with lower than TL 5 million
sales annually, ii. medium: more than 5 million and less than 50 million sales, iii. large:
more than 50 million sales. Relative to enterprises led by men, enterprises led by
women are less represented in the large and small sales categories. There is no women-


                                                                                         14
led enterprise with 50+ million sales in the sample. The concentration of women led
enterprises in the medium sales category is similar to the concentration of these
enterprises in the medium employee size category documented in Figure-7. Lastly,
enterprises with women share have the largest concentration in the large sales category
by a large margin.

A more detailed analysis of the sales volume of enterprises, sales distributions of
enterprises by gender of the leader is provided in Figure-10. Sales volume on the
                                                         horizontal axis is shown in log
                                                         Turkish Lira in year 2013
                                                         values. It is obvious in the
                                                         Figure that the lowest sales
                                                         volume among enterprises led
                                                         by women are higher than the
                                                         lowest sales volume among
                                                         enterprises led by men. At the
                                                         same time, the highest sales
                                                         volume among women-led
                                                         enterprises is much lower than
                                                         the highest sales volume
among men-led enterprises. In other words, women-led enterprises are more
concentrated in medium scale sales relative to those led by men.

On the other hand, enterprises with women share behave more like women-led
enterprises on the lower end of the sales scale but like mend-led enterprises on the
higher end of the sales scale. Moreover, the peak point of the distribution line for this
category is at the right of both, the one for women led and male led enterprises. In
general, findings in Figure-10 are consistent with the findings documented in Figure-9.

Summary of Findings

    Women-led enterprises are more foreign-owned (compared to men-led
     enterprises).
    Those foreign-owned and women-led enterprises are to a large extent part of a
     larger legal entity (e.g. a group of companies or a holding structure).
    There is no significant difference between women and men-led enterprises in
     terms of formal enterprise type.



                                                                                      15
    Women-led enterprises are more concentrated in textile and clothes
     manufacturing, chemical products manufacturing but less in machinery,
     electronics and motor vehicles manufacturing, construction, and services other
     than trade.
    Women-led enterprises are more concentrated in the Mediterranean and Black
     Sea regions but less in the Aegean region and particularly sparsely represented in
     Eastern Anatolia.
    Average age of women-led enterprises is significantly lower.
    Women-led enterprises are more medium-size enterprises in terms of
     employment and sales volume.

III. LEADER PROFILES - PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LEADERS
BY GENDER
This section aims to answer questions on whether there are significant differences in
education, marital status, and number of children as well as motivation for
entrepreneurship and previous jobs of female and male leaders.

Education

First, Figure-11 provides information about the educational attainment of leaders. The
share of those having a secondary degree or less among all leaders of that specific
gender is the same for both genders (58%). However, within the group of “secondary or
less”, the share of the
secondary school category is
higher among female leaders
(43%) than its share among
male leaders (37%). A similar
situation in favor of female
leaders is also observed at
the higher end of the
education ladder. Although
the share of female and male
leaders with a bachelor’s
degree or more in all leaders of each gender is the same (42%), the share of women
with a master’s or higher degree (17%) is almost three times as much as the share of
men with a master’s or higher degree (6%). Based on these findings, it can be concluded


                                                                                    16
that the average educational attainment of female leaders is higher than that of male
leaders in Turkey. This result is consistent with Ökten (2013), who reports using
household data that although the share of female owners is only 7% in all owners,
women have a 15% share among owners with a university or higher degree.

Marital Status

Basic civil properties of male and female leaders are given in Figure-12. On average,
female leaders are 1.6 years older than their male counterparts. A slightly lower share of
female leaders are married and they have, on average, 0.1 less child than male leaders.

                       Figure-12: Basic Civil Properties of Leaders
             Age                          Mean                 Median
             Female Leader                44.8                  44
             Male Leader                  43.2                  44

             Married?                      Yes                    No
             Female Leader                 87.2                  12.8
             Male Leader                   93.7                  6.3

             Number of Children           Mean                 Median
             Female Leader                1.35                   2
             Male Leader                  1.25                   2

Findings that there is a higher share of older and unmarried women among female
leaders are important from the policy perspective as this might indicate social norms
and discrimination in the work life against married women particularly for rising to
leadership positions. This might further indicate that marriage and children might be a
deterrent factor for women leaders.

Motivation for Entrepreneurship

Figure-13 and Figure-14 provide insights into how leaders differ in terms of motivation
for and means of joining/founding their enterprise. Figure-13 indicates that the majority
of both male and female leaders joined their enterprises by establishing them. Joining
the family company is the second most common path for leaders of both genders. On
the other hand, 5% of male leaders joined their enterprise by buying company shares. In
contrast, this avenue for joining the enterprise is nonexistent for female leaders in the
dataset surveyed.




                                                                                       17
In parallel to the findings in Figure-13, Figure-14 reveals that majority of both male and
female leaders joined/established their enterprise to explore entrepreneurship
opportunities. This is followed by joining their company as part of a family tradition or
family business as the second most common motivation. A number of studies in the
literature document that exploring entrepreneurship opportunities is the main
motivation for women and men to establish a company (Ljunggren and Kolvereid, 1996;
Shabbir and Di Gregorio, 1996; Maysami and Goby, 1999; Werner and Kay, 2006).

Previous Employment

Lastly, Figure-15 shows the employment status of male and female leaders before
joining/establishing the enterprise. 47% of female leaders and 57% of male leaders were
formal     wage      employees
before starting to work at
their current enterprises. 15%
of both male and female
leaders were self-employed
formally.      The       biggest
difference between male and
female leaders are observed in
informal self-employment. In
contrast to only 12% of male
leaders, 25% of female leaders
were self-employed informally
before starting to work at their current enterprises. Moreover, in contrast to only 1% of
male leaders, 8% of female leaders were unemployed.




                                                                                       18
Summary of Findings

    Female leaders are slightly older and the share of married leaders among them is
     lower relative to their male counterparts.
    Exploring entrepreneurship opportunities is the major motivation for leaders of
     both genders for establishing a business.
    Need-based entrepreneurship might be more common among female leaders
     than male leaders.

IV. PERFORMANCES OF ENTERPRISES BY GENDER OF THE LEADER
It is frequently reported in the literature that the performance of businesses owned by
women is worse than the performance of those owned by men in terms of basic
business indicators such as profitability, sales and growth (Hisrich and Brush, 1987;
Loscocco and Robinson, 1991; Bosma et al., 2004; De Mel et al., 2009). It is shown in
section 2 of this study that women-led enterprises in the sample in Turkey are
concentrated in the medium category in terms of employment and sales levels. Using an
econometric analysis, the relation between performance of enterprises and gender of
the leader is examined in more detail in this section.

Employment Performance

The results of this regression is given in Figure A-1 in the Appendix. The coefficient of
interest, gender dummy, in specification (I) takes a value of -9.7. This means that
women-led enterprises, on average, have 27% less employees (9.7 staff) than men-led
enterprises. Following this first specification, variables representing sector, geographical
region, foreign ownership status, legal type and age of enterprises are added to the
regression.

In specification (II), the estimate coefficient for the gender variable increases to 22,
meaning that average employment of women-led enterprises is 22 people fewer than
the average employment of men-led enterprises operating in the same sector. As the
employment differences in favor of men-led enterprises increase significantly once
comparison is conducted within sectors, we can conclude that women-led enterprises
are more concentrated in sectors with higher average employment. We can also
conclude that this situation helps women-led businesses keep the employment
differential at a relatively low level (9.7).




                                                                                         19
Similarly, once the comparison is conducted within specific foreign ownership categories
(i.e. those domestically owned are compared with each other and those foreign-owned
with each other) the employment difference increases to 33.9 (specification IV). This
result indicates that the general employment differential between women and men-led
enterprises is limited (9.7) because women-led businesses are more foreign-owned,
which, on average, have higher employment than domestically-owned enterprises. In
other words, if the ownership status of women and men-led businesses were same,
then the employment difference would be much above its current level in favor of men-
led enterprises. This means that the low employment differential between women and
men-led enterprises is driven by the difference in ownership status of women and men-
led businesses. On the other hand, once region and legal type variables are added
separately in Specification (III) and (V), the value that the gender dummy takes, does
almost not change. This is quite an expected result because as seen in Figure 3 and
Figure 5, men and women-led businesses do not differ significantly in regional
distribution and legal type.

Lastly, the age of the enterprise is added to the analysis in Specification (VI). This time
the value that the gender dummy takes decreases to 5.9 from 9.7. That is, once women
and men-led enterprises of similar age are compared, women-led enterprises have an
average of 5.9 fewer employees. This finding is not surprising because the age variable
in the same column takes a value of 0.67 and Figure-6 demonstrated that women-led
enterprises are significantly younger. In other words, one year of additional enterprise
age is associated with an average of 0.67 more employees. Part of the measured 9.7
employment difference between men and women-led enterprises is related to the fact
that women-led enterprises are younger. If women-led enterprises were similar to men-
led enterprises in enterprise in terms of age, the employment differential would be
smaller. In other words, the employment differential between women and men-led
enterprises is further driven by the age of women-led versus men-led enterprises.

Sales Performance

As the second topic in this section, the same regression analysis is repeated for the sales
volume of enterprises. The results are given in Figure A-2 in Appendix-2. Specification (I)
indicate that in year 2013, sales volume of enterprises led by women were on average
TL 2.03 millions (54%) higher than the average sales volume of enterprises led by men.
Once women and men-led enterprises operating in the same region, of the same foreign
ownership category and of the same legal type are compared, respectively, in
Specifications (III), (IV) and (V), we do not observe a significant deviation from the


                                                                                        20
original coefficient (TL 2.03 millions) we got in specification (I). Consequently, these
variables do not have a significant role in explaining the sales volume differences
between men led and women led enterprises.

On the other hand, once sales of men and women-led enterprises are compared in
specification (II), the sales differential in favor of women-led enterprises decreases to TL
0.92 million, implying that women-led enterprises are more concentrated in sectors
with higher average sales volume per enterprise. In other words, if men and women-led
enterprises had similarly been distributed across sectors, we would have expected the
sales differential to be smaller in favor of women-led enterprises. It seems that the sales
differential between women and men-led enterprises is driven by the difference in their
respective sector concentration.

However, once enterprise age is taken into account in specification (VI), the average
sales differential rises to TL 2.62 millions. Moreover, the estimated coefficient in the
same column for one year of additional age is TL 0.17 million. This shows that if women-
led enterprises had a similar average age as men-led enterprises, the sales differential
would have be higher in favor of women-led enterprises. The sales differential seems to
be in addition driven by the difference in the average age of women-led enterprises
versus men-led enterprises.

Employment Growth

A detailed analysis of employment and sales performance of women and men-led
enterprises are undertaken in previous subsections of this section. However, making
inferences regarding success of male and female leaders based on these results can be
misleading. This is because, size or sales of an enterprise at a point of time reflects the
cumulative effort made throughout all life of an enterprise. Therefore, it is not possible
to attribute the current performance of an enterprise only to the last decision maker of
it. To a large extent, a specific piece of information in the survey allows us to deal with
this issue. For most enterprises in the dataset, employment in year 2010 is also
recorded7. Therefore, it is feasible to measure the employment performances of
enterprises over the 2010-2013 period and relate this performance to the leader of the
enterprise in 2013.




7Although there is also a variable indicating sales volume of enterprises in year 2010, this information is missing for
most enterprises in the dataset.


                                                                                                                   21
Based on this background, a new series of regression analysis are conducted in the form
given in Appendix-3. The dependent variable in this regression is employment in 2013
and the explanatory variable of interest is the gender dummy as has been before. On
the other hand, this time, employment of enterprises in 2010 year is included in all
specifications. This specification allows us to compare 2013 employment levels of
women and men-led enterprises with similar employment levels in 2010. Therefore, the
gender dummy in this specification captures employment growth of women-led
enterprises relative to that of men-led enterprises over the period.

According to results provided in Figure A3 in Appendix 3, the variable representing 2010
employment takes a value of 1.06 in all 6 specifications. This means that if a specific
enterprise employed 1 more person than another enterprise in 2010, we can expect the
former to employ 1.06 more in 2013. Put differently, the employment gap across
enterprises increased slightly over the 2010-2013 period in favor of already large
enterprises.

Results of specification (I) in Figure A-3 shows that women-led enterprises employed, on
average, 0.07 fewer persons in 2013 than men-led enterprises with the same
employment in 2010. This coefficient is both very small and not statistically significant.
Although the magnitude of the estimated coefficient slightly increases and changes the
sign once geographical regions and enterprise age are added in Specifications (III) and
(VI), respectively, the estimated coefficient remains statistically insignificant.

However, adding a sector variable in Specification (II) results in a decrease in the
estimated gender coefficient to -1.65. This implies that employment growth of women-
led enterprises did not lag behind the employment growth of men-led enterprises over
the 2010-2013 period because women-led enterprises are concentrated in sectors that
recorded better employment growth over the period.

At the opposite end, once foreign ownership is taken into account in Specification (IV),
the estimated gender coefficient becomes statistically significant: 1.63. This indicates
that if the foreign capital category of men and women-led enterprises had been similar,
women-led enterprises would have recorded significantly higher employment growth
than men-led enterprises. This is because, women-led enterprises are more foreign-
owned and this type of enterprises underperformed in employment growth over the
2010-2013 period.




                                                                                       22
Summary of Findings

      In the year 2013, the average number of employees of women-led enterprises
       was lower by 27% than that of men-led enterprises (9.7 staff).
      The employment gap stayed relatively low because women-led enterprises are
       concentrated in sectors with larger enterprise size and they were more foreign-
       owned enterprises. These have on average a larger average size than
       domestically-owned enterprises.
      In contrast, the employment gap widened because women-led enterprises are on
       average younger than men-led enterprises.
      Women-led enterprises had, on average 54% more sales volume than men-led
       enterprises (TL 2.03 millions).
      A main contributor to this sales differential was that women-led enterprises are
       concentrated in sectors with large sales volume per enterprise.
      As in the case of employment, being younger had a negative effect on the sales
       performance of women-led enterprises relative to those led by men.
      There is not a significant difference between men and women-led enterprises in
       terms of employment growth over the period of 2010-2013.
      Once again, being concentrated in sectors that recorded higher growth rates
       contributed to employment growth performance of women-led enterprises
       relative to men-led enterprises.
      However, being more foreign-owned had a negative effect on the relative
       employment growth performance of women-led enterprises as average
       employment growth of foreign-owned enterprises was lower than that of
       domestically-owned enterprises over the period.

V. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT CONSTRAINTS BY GENDER OF THE
LEADER
This section aims to clarify whether enterprises led by women face more constraints
than those led by men.

Overall Outlook

Figure-16 demonstrates the percentage of enterprises that declare each of 9 constraint
types as a serious obstacle by the gender of the enterprise leader8. Surprisingly, all of
the 9 constraints in the Figure seem to be less important obstacles for women-led
enterprises relative to men-led enterprises. Tax rates are the most cited obstacle by
enterprises of both genders. Tax rates as a major business environment constraint are
followed by (mal-) practices of informal competitors, political instability, corruption and
(cumbersome) tax administration.




Biggest Obstacle: Tax Rates

This subsection ranks business obstacles by following a more direct approach. Figure
17a and Figure 17b are generated using the results for the survey question “which is the
biggest obstacle for your current business operations?”. According to these Figures,
current tax rates are considered to be by far the biggest obstacle by both men and
women-led enterprises with a ratio of 37% and 38%, respectively. This finding is

8Survey respondents were asked to pick among 5 choices: No obstacle, minor obstacle, moderate obstacle, major
obstacle, and severe obstacle. Figure 16 makes use of the sum of those responded major or severe obstacle.


                                                                                                          24
consistent with that found in Figure 16. Where men-led and women-led enterprises
differ in their perception of the biggest business constraints they face is in the area of
informal competitors, political instability and transportation as well as access to finance,
corruption and electricity. Political instability is considered a more important obstacle by
women-led enterprises (17%) than men-led enterprises (11%). Transportation is another
constraint that is perceived to be a bigger problem for women-led enterprises (8% vs.
4%).




On the other hand, the share of women-led enterprises that cite access to finance,
informal competitors, corruption and electricity as the biggest obstacle is slightly lower
than that of men-led enterprises that cite these constraints as the biggest obstacle.

Operating Licenses

The share of women-led enterprises that applied for operating license over the last two
years is less than half as much as the share of men-led enterprises (Figure 18a).

 Figure 18a: Enterprises Applied to Obtain an Operating License in the last 2 years (%)
                     Men Led                                   Women Led
                       13.8                                         5.2

Moreover, it takes significantly more time to obtain an operating license by women-led
enterprises (Figure 18b). So not only do less women-led enterprises apply for operating
license, it also takes them on average much longer to obtain them.




                                                                                         25

Access to Finance

There is vast literature that compares external financing opportunities provided to male
and female business owners. A number of studies report that financing opportunities
from commercial banks are limited for female entrepreneurs relative to male
entrepreneurs and this imposes a significant obstacle to the growth of female
businesses (Aronson, 1991; Carter et al., 1997; Watson, 2002; Muravyev et al., 2007;
Sabarwal and Terrell, 2008; Demirgüç-Kunt et al., 2008). On the other hand, some other
studies in the field claim that there is not a considerable difference between male and
female entrepreneurs in the access to external finance. (Buvinic and Berger, 1990;
Aguilera-Alfred et al., 1994; Baydas et al., 1994; Neumark and McLennan, 1995;
Coleman, 2000; Carter and Shaw, 2006). In this section we aim to clarify the case for
Turkey. It should be noted that as our sample includes enterprises with at least 5
employees, our findings may not reflect the access to finance situation at the start-up
phase.

In Figure-20, sources of working capital of enterprises are given by gender of the leader.
Internal funds are the major source of working capital for enterprises led by both
women and men. Internal funds are followed by bank borrowing with a working capital
share of 17% in women-led enterprises and 16% in men-led enterprises. Although
financing from suppliers is the third source of financing for both genders, it is a much
more important source for women-led enterprises (10%) than for men-led enterprises
(5%). It should be noted that borrowing from suppliers might be a sector driven
mechanism rather than being driven by the gender of the leader. Finally, sources other
than these three account for 2% to 3% of all working capital. Borrowing from relatives
and credit from micro finance institutions are included in this group. In summary,
sources of working capital do not differ significantly by gender of the leader.




                                                                                       26
Figure-21 demonstrates that 38% of enterprises led by men and 45% of enterprises led
by women have an active line of credit or loan from a financial institution. As for the
type of institution granting the loan, the share of private banks is 76% and 67% for male
and female led enterprises, respectively. In contrast, the share of state-owned banks is
slightly higher for loans received by women-led enterprises (28%) than those received
by men-led enterprises (23%). Moreover, while 2% of all loans received by men-led
enterprises, are from non-bank financial institutions, 5% of loans received by women-
led enterprises are from non-bank financial institutions. As the last point in this section,
Figure-23 shows that 26% of men-led enterprises and 27% of women-led enterprises
with an active loan were required to show a collateral for receiving the loan. So women-
led enterprises are subject to the same collateral requirement, although at start-up
stage they may have more difficulties than men providing to banks an acceptable
collateral registered in their names.

Summary of Findings

    Most business environment constraints do not pose a bigger obstacle for the
     operations of women-led enterprises relative to those led by men. Differences
     are much nuanced.
    Women-led enterprises apply less for operating licenses and it takes significantly
     more time for them to obtain it.
    There is no significant difference between men and women-led enterprises in
     accessing external finance except that state-owned banks and non-bank financial
     institutions are more important sources of loans for women-led enterprises
     relative to those led by men.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
The topic of women entrepreneurship in Turkey has been relatively well-studied, albeit
largely within the context of micro-entrepreneurship and access to microfinance. Where
studies have looked at larger businesses, the focus has been almost exclusively on
women-owned enterprises. Anecdotally, we know that in Turkey, female ownership of
enterprises is often only nominal and associated with family businesses. Thus,
“nominally” women-owned enterprises do not necessarily reflect the characteristics and
challenges faced by women in Turkey who are de-facto co-owners and leaders of
businesses (what we refer to as “women-led enterprises” and “women leaders”). This
paper aims to bring a novel aspect to the existing body of research by zooming on what
we hope to be a more meaningful definition of women-entrepreneurs, i.e. women who
are not only de-facto (co-)owners but also top-managers and decision makers in their
business. By applying this lens, we get a more accurate picture of the “true”
representation and position of women entrepreneurs in the Turkish economy, their
characteristics, business performance and the challenges they face. With this more
nuanced understanding, we hope to inform more meaningful policy debates around
women entrepreneurship Turkey.

Our first interesting finding is that women’s active participation in entrepreneurship in
Turkey is much lower than commonly believed. The share of women-led enterprises
(5.3%) is much lower than the more commonly referenced data point of enterprises
with women share, which represent a good 25% of enterprises in Turkey. The
implication of that finding is that with such a low level of active participation in




                                                                                      28
entrepreneurship, the issue of supporting women entrepreneurship in Turkey becomes
even more pressing.

Our second interesting finding is that unlike commonly believed, much more women-led
enterprises are medium-sized, foreign-owned and part of a larger company group than
men-led enterprises. The implication of that finding is that there seems to be a certain
type of business structure - and possibly a business culture - (i.e. foreign ownership,
company conglomerates) that is favorable to women-led enterprises. Our study does
not provide insights into the causal links between this type of business structure and the
prevalence of women-led businesses. Does this type of business structure and
associated culture foster women-led enterprises? Here, more research is needed. We
have also learnt that significantly less women-led than men-led enterprises are small or
domestically-owned, unlike commonly believed. Indeed, in addition to the micro-
enterprise space, the domestic small-scale business segment in Turkey has been
commonly believed to be a space with high concentration of women enterprises. This
may mean that hitherto focus on supporting small-scale women entrepreneurs might
not have translated into bringing very large numbers of women into this segment. As
such, the impact of such programs needs to revisited. With the bulk of women-led
enterprises concentrated in the medium-sized enterprise segment, it would also be
important to understand what is constraining further growth of these medium-sized
women-led enterprises and keeping them from graduating into large enterprises. The
focus of the research in this area has been on understanding barriers such as access to
finance and capacity constraints. Further research on growth barriers for women-led
enterprise is needed.

Our study has confirmed some of the commonly assumed characteristics of women’s
enterprises. Women-led enterprises are indeed younger and concentrated in the coastal
regions of Turkey. They are also more concentrated in light manufacturing such as the
production of textile, clothes- and chemical products (assumed to mean cosmetic
manufacturing) and less so in heavy industries like machinery, electronics, vehicles
manufacturing or construction. Sector and geographic concentration of women
entrepreneurs is problematic when these sectors are associated with low economic
value. The implication of this finding is that sector concentration - depending on the
sectors - can limit economic contributions and benefits to women-led enterprises. This
invites further research into the economic benefits of actively supporting and
incentivizing women enterprises and women-led enterprises to move into other, higher-
value sectors and strategically important high-potential regions such as the currently


                                                                                       29
heavily supported region of Eastern Anatolia. Also, further research is needed to clarify
whether lack of skills and knowledge about non-traditional (heavy industry) sectors
among women play a role in this situation.

Our study has also confirmed some of the commonly assumed characteristics of women
business leaders. Female company leaders are indeed slightly older than male
counterparts with a higher level of education and with fewer of them married. Also,
necessity to create a livelihood (as opposed to entrepreneurial opportunity) seems to be
a stronger driver for women to establish their business than it is for men. These findings
are consistent with widely held beliefs about women entrepreneurs in Turkey. These
prevailing characteristics (age, education and family status) are likely to be the result of
underlying social and cultural norms that might be deterrent factors for aspiring and
existing women business leaders. Policy options to address some of these social barriers
could include better public childcare support facilities and regulation that encourages
affordable private-sector provided child care services.

We have also gained some insights into patterns of company performance with some
good understanding of the underlying factors driving performance differences between
women and men-led enterprises. Unlike often believed, women-led enterprises do not
necessarily create more jobs than men-led enterprises. In fact, they have 27% less
employees. Yet, as often referred to, they do indeed have significantly higher sales than
men-led enterprises (54%). These performance differences are driven by the
concentration of women-led enterprises in specific sectors (with higher average sales)
and their predominantly younger company age (employing less staff).

Our study did not look into whether some of the performance differences are driven by
a differential impact of business constraints on women-led versus men-led enterprises.
The overall take away however is that differences in how women and men-led
enterprises perceive business constraints are small. Unlike commonly believed, women-
led enterprises are not experiencing greater business environment constraints across
the board and business environment issues are therefore unlikely to be a driver of
performance gaps. Most notably, women-led enterprises seem to actually experience
less corruption than men-led enterprises. That said however, there is one particular
issue that stood out as problematic for women-led enterprises: far less women-led
enterprises apply for operating licenses and it takes them much longer to obtain them.
Further research is needed to better understand if there is gender-based differentiation




                                                                                         30
or even discrimination that affects the issuing of operations licenses to women-led
enterprises and what the business impact of that is.

Finally, the findings point to state-owned banks and non-bank financial institutions as
the prevalent sources of loans for women-led enterprises, as opposed to private sector
banks. Commercial banking of women entrepreneurs is a space that is being increasingly
studied but is still attracting few Turkish banks. In the perception of private sector
banks, women entrepreneurs remain a high-risk, unappealing and un-bankable
borrower group. There is a range of policy options that can be further debated to
address this issue, including regulations that reduce collateral requirements, simpler
legislation and procedures for SME loans and sanctions against the use of women’s
loans by male family members.

In sum, our findings do not explain the reasons underlying prevailing patterns of
enterprise size, sector and geographic concentration among women-led enterprises or
patterns of age, education and family status among women business leaders. But the
findings help take a more nuanced look at women entrepreneurship in Turkey, revisit
some prevailing misconceptions and associated women support strategies and consider
further research needed to better understand the underlying reasons that are driving
these patterns.
