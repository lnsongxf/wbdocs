THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

which had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100,
with 100 representing the best performance (the frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2015 report for
more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of such
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

        The application file is transmitted to the following agencies for review
        and approval:
        • Urban Planning Authority (Direction de L’Urbanisme), for assurance of
        compliance with urban planning regulations
        • Cadastral Office, for review of the cadastral excerpts

        closely follows up on the application status, the permit can be obtained
        in 30 days. By law, the official deadline is 30 days. Once the 30 days
        have passed, BuildCo requests a provisional authorization while
        awaiting the Ministry of Housing (Ministre de l’Habitat) decree that

        the correct one or if it should be downgraded or upgraded. There are no
        online forms. However, if a person sends an email, with the correct
        attachments, it is considered a valid opening of the application as well.

        recommended that someone from the customer's side is present for this
