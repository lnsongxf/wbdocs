THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

       (CoR 15.1 A-E) to be lodged at the Companies and Intellectual Property
       Commission (CIPC) upon registration. These forms are available for
       download from the CIPC’s website.

      o If an incorporator is a juristic person, a power of attorney is required
      for the representative authorized to incorporate the company and sign
      all related documents.
      o If another person incorporates the company and signs all related
      documents on behalf of any of the incorporators and initial directors, a
      power of attorney and certified ID copy of the person is required.
      o If a name was reserved before filing of incorporation documents, the
      valid name reservation document is necessary.

      If a proposed name is rejected, the company may still be registered and
      the registration number then becomes the name of the company at
      incorporation. An approved name may then be submitted later.
      Application to reserve a name (Form CoR 9.1) costs ZAR 50 if done
      electronically and ZAR 75 if submitted manually. The applicant of a
      name reservation must be the same applicant for the new company
      registration documents, and will need to include a certified copy of
      their ID. The incorporation fee is ZAR 100.

      Businesses with annual taxable turnover of more than ZAR 1,000,000
      must register for VAT. The application for the registration of VAT is
      done on a VAT 101 form. CIPC and the South African Revenue Service
      are linked electronically. Once a company is incorporated the relevant
      South African Revenue Service office is advised and an income tax
      number is allocated to such entity.                                          12 days         no charge

      The company must also register as an employer by means of an "EMP

      withholding taxes applicable to the taxpayer including PAYE (Pay as you
      Earn, i.e. employees' tax), UIC (Unemployment Insurance Contributions).
      The employer is compelled to register as an employer in terms of
      paragraph 15 of the 4th Schedule to the Income Tax Act. Any employer
      who is liable to register with SARS for the payment of employees' tax is
      also required to register with SARS for purposes of paying

      unemployment insurance contributions. An employer does not have
      discretion whether to register with SARS or the Unemployment
      Insurance Commissioner (Department of Labor), as the liability of the
      employer to register and pay employees' tax and the Skills
      Development Levy will determine with whom an employer must be
      registered for UIC purposes. Skills Development Levy is a type of labor
      mandatory contribution which an employer has to pay to the South
      African Revenue Service. It is levied at 1% of gross salaries.

      With regards to VAT applications, SARS assesses the viability of the
      business as part of the registration process. The company must appoint
      a public officer in terms of section 246 of the Tax Administration Act,
      No. 28 of 2011 and must advise the relevant SARS office of the full
      name, residential and postal address of such person. This person must
      be a resident of South Africa. SARS also carries out a physical inspection
      of the business premises and performs an interview with the public
      officer (or the tax practitioner authorized to carry out the registration
      process) before the VAT registration application is processed

      SARS introduced additional verification procedures for VAT registration
      with effect from 13 November 2008 in an attempt to combat fraud.
      These requirements include 1) applications must be submitted in
      person or by a duly authorized and registered tax practitioner, 2)
      applications must be accompanied by proof of identity, bank particulars
      and documentation substantiating the physical business address.

      Await completion of the external connection works by Eskom

      Eskom is in charge of the works up to the Meter Kiosk. Beyond the
      Meter Kiosk falls under internal retic of the customer.

      The utility obtains an excavation permit at the Route Agency.
      Meter installation will be done, irrelevant if customers' internal retic is
      done or not. However the final connection is done after Eskom have
      received the Compliance Certificate.

      In our case the following technical specifications of connection will most
      likely apply:
      Supply size: 150kVA is the standard size closest to 140kVA
      Feeder Voltage: 11kV and Customer takes supply at 400Volts
      Network Type: Underground

      The following scope of works carried out by Eskom will most likely apply:

      • Mount a new 150kVA 11kV transformer on pole
      • Label the new transformer
      • Install MV fused links
      • Install a new LPU 150kVA meter-kiosk at the customer's boundary
      • Terminate a 150mm sq 4C Cu cable onto the LV side of the transformer
      to the meter-kiosk.
      • Lay 15m of 150mm sq 4C Cu cable from the transformer and terminate
3     it to the new meter-kiosk.                                                   165 calendar days    ZAR 456,625
      (It is the customer’s responsibility to: lay own cable from his distribution
      kiosk to Eskom's meter-kiosk and to provide a termination kit.)

      Only the meter and meter kiosk are provided by Eskom free of charge.
      The rest are based on actual costs. Eskom provides the material. If for
      any reason the customer has to purchase the material not from Eskom,
      specifications are provided and have to be adhered to. In addition to the
      cost of works and material the customer has to pay the security deposit
      which is refundable on termination of the supply by customer less any
      amounts owing to Eskom if any. While the supply is active, Eskom has
      the right to revise existing deposits as per specific supply agreement
      between individual customer and Eskom. Eskom pays interest rate on
      deposits equal to the rate of the National bank. However, in most cases
      the security deposit against consumption is usually by means of a Bank
      Guarantee ie not hard cash.

      Testing of the connection: Once the connection part has been
      completed, an arrangement for outage (process which includes quality
      check and testing) has to be made. It entails communication with the
      affected customers if anywhere supply point is shared e.g. minisub
      connection, arrangement for required staff to be dispatched/work order.
      The cost of the inspection is included in the costs of the external
      connection works.

        electrician does the inspection, issue Compliance Certificate and submit
        it to Eskom.
        Eskom will require a Certificate of Compliance signed by a registered

What are the details?
The indicators reported here are based on a set of
                                                                 STANDARD PROPERTY TRANSFER
specific procedures—the steps that a buyer and seller
must complete to transfer the property to the buyer’s
name—identified by Doing Business through

       A conveyancer prepares the transfer deed

       A conveyancer prepares the deed of sale and drafts the transfer deed. He
       obtains the power of attorney, appointing him to appear before the
       Registrar. The service of an attorney / conveyancer is mandatory for the
       registration of the land. A conveyancer is an attorney who is permitted in
       terms of the Attorneys Act to perform specialized duties with regard to
       the conveyance of immovable property. The Deeds Registries Act                                   Transfer fee: ZAR
       empowers only conveyancers to prepare deeds of transfer and in doing                                24,750 for a

       Obtain a rates clearance certificate from the local authority

       The transferring conveyancer obtains a rates (taxes) clearance certificate
       from the local authority, on behalf of the seller only if in Johannesburg.
       Section 118 of the Local Municipality Act states that any act of
       transferring property must be accompanied by a rates clearance from              1 to 2 weeks
       the local authority. However, the local authority will only check the last      (simultaneous       Included in
   2
       24 months--this is sufficient for the transfer to legally take place. If any   with procedures      Procedure 1
       taxes are owed from previous years, the seller is not exonerated--the             3, 4 and 5)
       taxes will still have to be paid by either the seller or the new owner as
       per agreement.

      * The conveyancer prepares and collects all the required
      documentation

      The conveyancer, before lodging the documentation with the deeds
      registry to transfer the property to the new company, must also conduct
      a company search at the Companies and Intellectual Property
      Commission Office to ascertain the directors of both companies. All
      conveyancers are linked by internet to this authority and can perform the
      check online. Usually conveyancers will also ask clients to present them
      with such documents anyway. In so doing, the conveyancer will: •
      Peruse the memorandum and articles of association of the companies to
      confirm the powers to acquire and alienate immovable property. The
      founding documents of the seller will be the Memorandum and Articles
      of Association. If the buyer company was formed before 1 May 2011, its          10 days
      Memorandum and Articles of Association will be perused. If the buyer        (simultaneous       Included in
3     company was formed after 1 May 2011, its Memorandum of
                                                                                with Procedures 2     Procedure 1

      compliance with the Financial Intelligence Center Act by obtaining proof
      from the companies of the physical/business address and Tax/VAT
      registration number with the South African Revenue Services. The
      conveyancer will also request this information from the clients before
      proceeding, and the check is done automatically at the time of paying
      transfer duty (Procedure 3)--if a company does not have or quotes an
      incorrect Tax/VAT number, it will not be possible to pay transfer duty
      and the process will halt • Section 115 of the Companies Act 71 2008
      states that a company may not dispose of all or the greater part of its
      assets except through a special resolution

      * Obtain an electrical compliance certificate

      This certificate is not required by the land registry. The Health and
      Environment Act of 1993 makes it mandatory for anyone who wants to
      sell anything that includes electrical wiring to have an Electrical
      Certificate of Compliance. It is common practice for the seller to obtain    1 week           ZAR 1000- 1500

      in. However, there will always be a clause in the sale agreement that
      refers to the Act, who should obtain it and who bears the cost.
