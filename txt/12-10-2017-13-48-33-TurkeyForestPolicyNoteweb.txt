     very few areas characterized by low migration and high poverty in Turkey – hence the lower number in the sample.

Note: Both gross and net forest product collection income are presented to facilitate the comparison between different income sources. In particular, income from agriculture and livestock
sales which is gross income (the cost for agriculture and livestock production is not collected in the survey) is directly comparable with forest collection gross income. Among the 1,336
households who reported collected forest products, there were 89 HH (4.7 percent) reported losses, i.e. negative net collection income over the past 12 months. Total income is the
summation of the 8 income items from 1.a Gross forest collection income to 8. Other income, but not including 1b.

UNFF: The United Nations Forum on Forests aims
to promote the sustainable management of the
world’s forests and strengthen long-term political
commitment amongst the member states to this
end. A Collaborative Partnership on Forests is
affiliated to the forum. The partnership consists
of 14 international organizations that are involved
in various ways with forest related policy, among
them the FAO, the World Bank and ITTO as well
as the secretariats for the conventions on climate,
biological diversity, and desertification. The
purpose of the partnership is to support the work
of the UNFF and to foster closer cooperation and
coordination on international forest-related issues.

The United Nations forest instrument adopted
in 2007, formally known as Non-Legally Binding
Instrument on All Types of Forests, or NLBI,
provides countries with a framework for promoting
sustainable forest management. The Instrument
articulates a series of agreed policies and measures
at the international and national levels to strengthen
forest governance, technical and institutional
capacity, policy and legal frameworks, forest sector
investment and stakeholder participation.

national conditions         Rapid industrialization and urbanization have been taking place in Turkey over the last
                            30 years.

                            Turkey is responsible for only 0.7 percent of the global emissions since the industrial
                            revolution.

                            Energy imports have a significant share in Turkey’s account deficit. Turkey has to use

Planning Process            Turkey may revise this INDC in accordance with changing circumstances.

                            Turkey supports its INDC through a national climate change policy which includes;

                            Turkey’s INDC was prepared in a participatory approach through multiple stakeholder
                            meetings and by analytical studies conducted for 1 year.
