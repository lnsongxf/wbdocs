National Large-Scale Assessment
Questionnaire
INTRODUCTION



Dear Colleague,

Thank you for joining us in our efforts to collect data on student assessment systems around the world. We are
excited to work with you. Your efforts are an important contribution to the SABER program, and a valuable input
into the SABER-Student Assessment domain in particular.

What is SABER?

The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) is an evidence-based program of the World Bank to help
countries systematically examine and strengthen the performance of their education systems. The World Bank
launched the SABER program to support the implementation of its Education Strategy 2020. The initiative is being
led by the Education Global Practice of The World Bank. Information on SABER can be found at
http://go.worldbank.org/NK2EK7MKV0.

What is SABER-Student Assessment?

SABER-Student Assessment is one of the domains of the SABER program. The purpose of SABER-Student Assessment
is to benchmark student assessment systems in developed and developing countries with the goal of promoting
stronger assessment systems that contribute to improved education quality and learning for all. The World Bank is
committed to supporting countries in their development of more effective student assessment systems; SABER-
Student Assessment is a key component of this support.
The SABER-Student Assessment domain uses standardized questionnaires to collect information about a country’s
assessment system in the following areas: Classroom Assessment, Examination, National-Large Scale Assessment,
and International Large-Scale Assessment. The data collected with these questionnaires are used to benchmark the
country’s assessment system, indicating the level of development (latent, emerging, established, or advanced) of
each assessment type.

What is Your Role in the SABER-Student Assessment Data Collection Efforts?

As the person responsible for collecting the data needed to complete the SABER-Student Assessment questionnaires
for a particular country, you have an important role. The information you collect will be used to benchmark the
country’s assessment system, produce a report that describes the strengths and weaknesses of this system, and
generate policy options for the country to consider. The information that you collect will also be made publicly
available on the SABER website.

We are here to support you in your data collection efforts. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have
questions.

FOCUS OF THE SABER-STUDENT ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRES

Each SABER-Student Assessment questionnaire focuses on a different facet of the assessment system:

Classroom Assessment Questionnaire: Allows for the collection of system-level (for example, country) information on
classroom assessment policies and practices for both primary and secondary education and public and private schools.
The first section of the questionnaire focuses on enabling factors and quality assurance procedures that support
classroom assessment activities while the second section inquires about the uses of classroom assessment information.

Examination Questionnaire: Allows for the collection of system-level (for example, country) information on examination
programs for both primary and secondary education and public and private schools. For each program, the
questionnaire collects data on overall characteristics (section 1), as well as the specifics of the last few examination
rounds (sections 2 and 3). (A separate questionnaire should be answered for each examination round for which data are
being collected.) The last section of the questionnaire applies only to systems that do not have an examination program
in place; it collects information that is relevant for developing such a program in the future.

National Large-Scale Assessment (NLSA) Questionnaire: Allows for the collection of system-level (for example, country)
information on NLSA programs in primary and secondary education. For each NLSA, the questionnaire collects data on
overall characteristics (section 1) as well as the specifics of the last few rounds (sections 2-4). (A separate questionnaire
should be answered for each NLSA round for which data are being collected.) The last section of the questionnaire
applies only to systems that do not have an NLSA program in place; it collects information that is relevant for developing
such a program in the future.

International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA) Questionnaire: Allows for the collection of general information on a
system’s participation in one or more ILSAs during the last decade ( section 1) as well as the specifics of the last few ILSA
rounds (sections 2 and 3). (A separate questionnaire should be answered for each ILSA round for which data are being
collected.) The last section of the questionnaire applies only to systems that have not participated in an ILSA in the last
10 years; it collects information that is relevant for future participation in such assessments.

BEFORE STARTING DATA COLLECTION

Before you start completing this SABER-Student Assessment questionnaire, please:
 Identify the point person on the SABER-Student Assessment team with whom you will work to complete this
  questionnaire. You can get this information from the country Task Team Leader (TTL) with whom you have been
  communicating regarding the SABER-Student Assessment initiative.

 Confirm with the country TTL the level at which you will be completing this questionnaire. The questionnaire
  asks for information at the “system level. ” In most instances, this will mean the country or national level.
  However, it may, as required, also be used to refer to state, provincial, or other levels of the system. Please
  answer all questions with regard to the chosen level of the system, as confirmed by the country TTL, even
  though this level may not be the “national” level specified in the National Large -Scale Assessment (NLSA) title
  and acronym.

 Familiarize yourself with the layout of this questionnaire. This questionnaire has five sections. Section 1 asks
  for general information about a key NLSA program in existence at the system level. Sections 2 to 4 ask about a
  specific NLSA round that already took place or is currently in progress in the context of t he NLSA program
  described in Section 1. Section 5 is to be completed for systems in which an NLSA program is not currently in
  place.

 Familiarize yourself with the format of the questions. Response options for questions that employ the “drop-
  down” function in the electronic version of this questionnaire are listed in full in Annex 1.

 Confirm with the country TTL the name of the NLSA program for which you will be collecting detailed
  information. In order to obtain as accurate a picture as possible of activity under this NLSA program, it is
  recommended that you complete a set of up to four questionnaires on the program, one for each of the three
  most recently completed rounds, plus any round currently in progress.

 Identify key individuals you will contact who have primary knowledge of the NLSA program(s) and access to
  relevant information. Please provide information on the individuals who contributed to answering this
  questionnaire in the “Respondent Contact Information” section. You are also expected to use o ther sources of
  information (for example, reports, documents) as necessary. Please utilize multiple sources of information to
  validate your responses.

 Consult official sources. Responses to certain questions require information as published in official sources (for
  example, written policies, guidelines, or equivalent). Please refer to the relevant documents to provide the
  requested information.
 Carefully read the definitions provided and keep them in mind as you answer the questionnaires. This is
  important to ensure the comparability of data collected across countries and education systems.

 Answer every question unless otherwise indicated. Each question has a “Comments” section. Please use this area
  to provide additional information supporting your answer selection. For a question to which you do not know the
  answer, indicate “Do not know” and note the efforts that you made to obtain the requested information.

COMMONLY USED TERMS


During your data collection efforts, you may come across certain terms. Please find below definitions of commonly-used
assessment terms.

Classroom assessment: The process of collecting, synthesizing, and interpreting information on student learning to aid
in classroom decision making, support future student learning (that is, formative assessment), or judge student
performance at a specific point in time (that is, summative assessment). Primarily carried out by teachers and students
in their classrooms, it encompasses grading or scoring of student work, informal observations of students, oral quizzes,
peer-to-peer assessment, student self-assessment, and end-of-year testing.

Curriculum: The body of material that operationalizes learning standards or goals and guides their translation into
classroom instruction. Includes teaching materials, student learning materials, and learning activities.

Cutoff score: A value on a score scale that sets the boundary between one category and another. For example, the
cutoff score for reaching a proficient level of achievement might be set at 500 points on an 800-point scale. Two or more
cutoff scores can be used to define several categories or performance levels on a scale (for example, advanced,
proficient, needs improvement).

Data processing: The procedures for capturing data (for example, scanning), cleaning data (for example, treating
multiple responses to a multiple-choice question as incorrect), computing scores (for example, computing mean
performance on different tests), and running statistical procedures (for example, computing precision of individual
scores, classifying students into performance levels).

Data reporting: The process of producing communication tools (for example, reports, brochures, online resources) and
communicating assessment results to the public, key stakeholders, or individual students.

Examination: A high-stakes assessment, the results of which are typically used to certify students (for example, for a
secondary school diploma) or select them into further education (for example, university entrance examination). Usually
covers the main domains (behaviors, competencies, knowledge, and skills) of the school curriculum, typically organized
into subject areas (for example, language arts, mathematics). Usually involves standardized administration of a test(s) to
a cohort of students under strict security conditions. School-based assessment is a special type of examination that uses
assessments generated, designed, and/or administered in schools and evaluated by students ’ own teachers. School-
based assessments typically involve some form of external moderation or standardization that ensures at least a
minimum acceptable level of comparability across different schools.




                                                                                                                        4
International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA): Measures student performance with the aim of comparing overall
performance levels across countries or education systems. Information is collected using standardized procedures on
nationally-representative samples of students at a particular age or grade level. Typically provides information on
related or contributing factors that may affect student performance. Results can be used to inform both education
policy and practice. The best-known ILSAs include the Latin American Laboratory for Assessment of the Quality of
Education [Laboratorio Latinoamericano de Evaluación de la Calidad de la Educación ] (LLECE), Programme for the
Analysis of Education Systems [Programme d'analyse des systèmes éducatifs de la CONFEMEN ] (PASEC), Progress in
International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Southern and
Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ), and Trends in International Mathematics and
Science Study (TIMSS).

Inter-rater reliability: Refers to the consistency with which independent scorers rate student work. For example, two
scorers may be asked to rate the essay responses of students. A simple way to compute the inter-rater reliability is by
calculating the number of times the two scorers independently assig n the same rating to a student’s essay, divided by
the total number of essays rated. The reliability coefficient will vary between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating perfect inter -
rater reliability.

Item bank: Pool of questions, items, or tasks that can be retrieved for the preparation of a test or, in some instances,
use in classroom instruction. Typically, the questions, items, or tasks are classified by subject area, instructional
objectives, skills, and difficulty level, among other groupings. These classifications make it possible to retrieve questions,
items, or tasks with known characteristics and build tests that match given test specifications. It also makes it possible
for teachers and students to retrieve those that match their pedagogical and learning needs.

Learning standards: An outline of what is valued, recommended, or required for educators to teach and for students to
know and be able to do. Meant to provide clear expectations for students and enable better preparation and
communication among teachers, principals, parents, and education system leaders. They typically include three
components: content standards (what students should know and be able to do), process standards (the cognitive skills
that students should master, such as reasoning, problem solving, analyzing, and synthesizing), and performance
standards (the degree to which students are expected to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in order to be
considered successful learners).

Moderation : The process of establishing comparable standards for evaluating student responses to assessment
questions, items, or tasks in order to ensure that the data are valid and reliable for the intended purposes. In schools, it
involves groups of teachers reviewing examples of student work, discussing the extent to which these meet the
expected standard, and coming to agreement on the level of attainment represented by each example. The group may
comprise staff from the same school, from different schools, or across authorities.

National Large-Scale Assessment (NLSA): Measures student performance with the aim of describing overall
performance levels in the education system as a whole. Usually covers the main domains (behaviors, competencies,
knowledge, and skills) of the school curriculum or what is deemed important for life in modern society (for example,
language arts, mathematics, problem solving, and use of technology). Usually involves standardized administration of
tests to a sample or population (census) of students at a particular age or grade level. Typically provides information on
related or contributing factors that may affect student performance levels. Results can be used to inform both education
policy and practice, and consequences may be attached to the results.


                                                                                                                            5
NLSA administration: The procedures required to contact schools, register participating schools and students, train
proctors, and administer the NLSA to students.

NLSA design: All of the processes that lead to the construction of the final, official NLSA test. These include creating the
NLSA framework; developing questions, items, and tasks; assembling them into test booklets; piloting them; and
selecting among them for the official NLSA administration.

NLSA framework: Also referred to as the NLSA specifications or blueprint (there is considerable variation in how these
terms are used by different people), the NLSA framework provides an understanding of what is being assessed (domain)
and an outline to guide the development of tests. Typically it provides a definition of the domain; describes the specific
content and skills to be measured; and indicates the number of questions, items, or tasks to be included in the NLSA
test. This information is usually summarized in a table of specifications or test blueprint. Usually based on a learning
standards or curriculum document.

NLSA program: An NLSA with purposes and objectives consistent with those outlined in the “Definitions” section of this
questionnaire and for which resources (for example, human, fiscal, and other) are being allocated. For the purposes of
this questionnaire, you will be collecting data on a specific NLSA program.

NLSA round: One full cycle of the NLSA (that is, design, administration, data processing, and results reporting). For the
purposes of this questionnaire, you will be collecting data on an NLSA round within a specific NLSA program.

Performance level: Involves classifying and describing student performance on a test in terms of the corresponding
degree of competence in the domain (that is, subject area, behavior, skill) being tested. Performance levels define the
knowledge and skills that students must typically demonstrate to be considered at a particular level of competence (for
example, advanced, proficient, needs improvement) in the domain.

Private schools: Schools that are not fully owned, operated, and financed by the government. These include
independent private schools (schools that operate completely separate from any government contracts, ownership, or
finance), government-funded private schools (schools that are privately operated but receive payments or subsidies
from the government), and privately managed schools (the state contracts with nongovernmental organizations to
manage publicly-owned schools).

Public schools: Schools that are owned, operated, and financed by the government.

Reliability: An indicator of the consistency and precision of test scores across replications of a testing procedure. When
test scores are perfectly reliable, they do not contain error. In other words, an individual’ s test score would be exactly
the same if he or she took a test several times (assuming that no new knowledge or skills were acquired between test
administrations). In classical test theory, the reliability coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represent s a test in which
test scores are entirely inconsistent (for example, a test where all students guess randomly on all items), and 1
represents a test in which test scores are entirely consistent (for example, a test that measures students’ knowledge
with no error).




                                                                                                                             6
Sampling: The process of selecting units within a population with the purpose of gaining knowledge about the overall
target population. For instance, in large-scale assessment exercises, samples of students (that is, the units), in particular
grade levels or age bands are selected in order to gain knowledge about all students in those grade levels or age bands
in the country (that is, target population). The sampling process comprises several stages, including defining the target
population, specifying the sampling frame, selecting a sampling technique, determining the sample size, and
implementing the sampling plan. Sampling techniques that use representative samples of the population allow for the
computation of statistics and making inferences about the target population.

Stakeholder: A person or collective entity that has an interest or concern in education, such as students, parents,
teachers, policy makers, business leaders, teacher unions, parent organizations, nongovernment al organizations, and
the media.

7.   Are there officially-mandated reviews to ensure that the NLSA measures what it is intended to measure?

     A review to ensure that the NLSA measures what it is intended to measure occurs when a group of individuals (for
     example, a committee or review panel) come together to discuss the extent to which the NLSA adequately covers a
     desired set of knowledge, skills, or competencies (as outlined in learning standards, a curriculum, or other document)
     and to identify areas where changes are needed in order to bring the test into greater alignment with this desired set
     of knowledge, skills, or competencies. An external review occurs when all of the individuals conducting the review are
     external and/or independent of the NLSA unit; an internal review occurs when all of the individuals belong to the
     NLSA unit; a combined internal-external review occurs when there is a combination of individuals from the NLSA unit
     and others who are external and/or independent from the unit. Regular reviews are scheduled to take place on a
     predictable schedule (for example, every 3—5 years); ad-hoc reviews do not follow a predictable schedule.

          a.   ☐    Yes
          b.   ☐    No      Go to question 9

     If non-mandated reviews take place, please specify in the “Comments” section below whether they are internal or
     external, whether they take place on a regular or ad-hoc basis, and the nature of the reviews.
