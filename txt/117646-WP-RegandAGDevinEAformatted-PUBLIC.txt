Hong Kong, China; Singapore; Taipei, China; and the
Republic of Korea, undertook a process of socioeconomic
development that took centuries to achieve in Western
Europe. The dramatic improvement in the quality of life
that    accompanied      this    remarkable    economic
transformation has virtually abolished extreme poverty in
these societies. More recently, a number of developing
countries in South East Asia have also made impressive
progress in economic development. Despite the effect of
the 1997-98 financial crisis, poverty among East Asian
developing countries went down from 38% in the 80s to
11% on average in the 2000s (Figure 1).

1980s – thanks to the household responsibility system,
the liberalization of markets and rapid technological
change – was largely responsible for the precipitous
decline in the official rural poverty rates, from 33 percent
in 1978 to 11.1 percent in 1984 and 3.7 percent in 2000
(Christiaensen 2007). The reduction in poverty was 3.5
times higher from GDP growth originating in agriculture
than from GDP growth originating in industry or services.
This was largely thanks to the relatively equal distribution
of land (Ravallion and Chen 2007). Rapid agricultural
development is likely to remain an important pathway out
of poverty for many of Vietnam’s poor as well (van de

EBA data feature two types of indicators. Legal indicators
reflect the number of regulatory good practices that
countries enact to correct market failures. Conversely,
efficiency indicators measure the transaction costs
regulations impose on businesses. Disaggregating the
overall scores into these two components highlights how
regulatory shortcomings in East Asian economies pertain
mostly to the legal dimension (Figure 6). This is
particularly acute in Myanmar, Thailand, and the
Philippines. For example, Vietnam has one of the most

Agricultural machinery
Agricultural machinery is another agricultural input where
countries often rely on imports. Cumbersome tractor
import procedures increase the cost of agricultural
machinery and discourage its use. In Lao PDR and
Myanmar importers are required to obtain an import
permit for each individual tractor shipment. Conversely,

impose individual import permits – the practice which
streamlines import procedures and trade. Further,
regulation can ensure performance, durability and safety
of agricultural machinery through quality standards and
certification procedures – many of which are harmonized
internationally. In Malaysia and the Philippines, the law
requires tractors to be equipped with protective structures
and seatbelts to ensure operations safety. Cambodia,

regulate tractor standards which undermines technical
reliability and poses safety threats to farmers.

Water allocation
Water withdrawals for agricultural use account for 90% of
total renewable water resources in East Asia with Vietnam
and Cambodia reaching more than 94%. Regulating
water use permits effectively allows farmers to access
water while ensuring better management of scarce
resources. In Thailand and Myanmar water use permits                  ICT regulation score
are not regulated, which increases the risk of insufficient
water supply for future crop cycles. Vietnam and the
Philippines, on the contrary, enact advanced regulatory
frameworks which promote efficient water use by allowing
water permit transfers among farmers.
