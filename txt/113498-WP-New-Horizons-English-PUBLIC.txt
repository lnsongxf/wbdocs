 Executive Summary



 Africa is a region with enormous potential for private investors. It is a continent in transition, with rapid urbanization, increasing

 stability, a young and growing population, expanding internet connectivity, rising incomes, and shifting consumption patterns. Taken

 together, these enduring trends have created an abundance of commercial opportunities across the continent and turned the region

 into a place that investors cannot afford to ignore.

The abundance of opportunities across Sub-Saharan Africa, and

the appetite of institutional investors to take advantage of them,

stand in stark contrast to the limited approaches available to

finance projects. Businesses and investors in Africa are searching

for new methods to underwrite potentially profitable ventures on

the continent.


Increased availability of commercial bank financing and funds,

along with the slow but steady growth in domestic capital

markets and other sources of commercial financing, are all

encouraging signs. These already play a major role in supporting

the growth of private business in Africa and they will become

increasingly critical in coming years. But given the rapidly

 A Role for the Private Sector in Basic Human Development
 Good health, education and nutrition are the foundations of human development. It is difficult to care for domestic or rural household responsibilities,

 hold a job, or care for a family if you are malnourished, sick, or lack relevant skills and knowledge. Expanding access to health and education services

 and improved nutrition is a central element in any strategy to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality. In developing countries, the poor often turn to

 private sector health and education providers for access to services, as well as food and other basic needs.

 •	 The World Bank estimates that over 50 million children are out of school in Sub-Saharan Africa. Governments have committed to achieve

     ‘education for all’ by 2030; to do so additional capacity will need to be created for 127 million students.

 •	 Sub-Saharan Africa bears 24 percent of the global burden of disease but only accounts for 1 percent of global health expenditures. The supplies of

     both health care workers and hospital beds are short of demand.

 •	 Over 165 million children under the age of five are stunted, and over 80 percent of malnourished children live in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

     Extreme poverty is exacerbated by chronic malnutrition, or stunting, in children under the age of three.

Raising Private Equity Funds Focused on African Opportunities

While only about 1.0 percent of global private equity goes to Africa, PE financing is gaining a foothold and PE funds raised a record $4.0 billion in 2014 to

invest on the continent.


Helios Investment Partners used an equity injection from a development bank to attract investors who likely would have otherwise hesitated to expose

capital to the many risks and obstacles that Africa presents. Africa lacks an institutional investor base with a long-term market view, so development

banks can serve as a pillar of market investment that brings others along during good times, and can also play a countercyclical role by remaining

involved when other investors flee.
