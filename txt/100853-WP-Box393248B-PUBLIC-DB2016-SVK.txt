THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

      connection and in addition, for the excavation of the road, prior consent
      of the road administrator (usually a municipality) is required.

      In case of a simple hook up customer needs to buy material only for
      his/her share of the grid (that begins behind the off-take point of the
      connection/electrometer).

      The material is available more than 50% of the time.

      to the Office for inspection of the safety. The Office for inspection of the
      safety issues its statement on the status of the electricity wiring in the
      building and this statement is then submitted by the warehouse owner

outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                              At the beginning, the debtor filing for restructuring (reorganization) (in our case
                               the Mirage´s management) instructs an insolvency representative to prepare a
                               restructuring opinion. Once the positive restructuring opinion is prepared, the
                                     debtor shall file for restructuring within 30 days. The court commences
                                   restructuring proceedings within 15 days of the filling of the petition and
                             publishes a notice in the Commercial Journal (within 2-5 working days). Then the
                                 court approves the restructuring within 30 days of the commencement and
                               notice is published in the Commercial Journal and an insolvency representative
                              who prepared the opinion is appointed as trustee. Creditors shall submit proofs
                              of debt within 30 days of the approval of the restructuring. Within 10 days after
                               the deadline of the submission of proofs of debt, the trustee prepares a list of
                              creditors. Then the 30-day period for rejection of claims runs after the deadline
                                of the submission of proofs of debt. The trustee convenes the first Creditors´
                              Meeting (which is to elect a Creditors’ Committee) within 30 days of the court´s
                                   approval of the restructuring. The meeting should take place between the
                             second and the seventh day after the deadline for the rejection of proofs of debt.
 Time (in                           The restructuring plan is being prepared and has to be submitted to the

years)                          Creditors´ Committee (CC) for approval within 90 days of the approval of the
                                   restructuring by the court. This deadline may be extended by 150 days. A
                              creditors´ committee may ask the debtor or trustee to modify the plan within 15
                                days of receipt. If the CC does not approve the plan, the trustee has to file for
                              bankruptcy. If the plan is approved by the CC, the Approving Creditors´ Meeting
                               votes on the plan within 30 days from the receipt of the request to vote on the
                                    plan. Then the court approves the plan within 25 days of its approval by
                             Approving Creditors´ Meeting. Again, the court may reject the plan and then the
                                proceeding is converted into bankruptcy. In its decision on the declaration of
                              bankruptcy, the court also appoints the trustee and the decision is published in
                              the Commercial Journal. Creditors submit proofs of claim to the trustee and the
                              court within 45 days of the declaration of bankruptcy. The trustee convenes the
                                 first Creditors´ Meeting within 55 days of the declaration of bankruptcy. The
                              meeting should take place between the 15th and 20th day after the lapse of the
                             30-day period for registration of claims. The bankruptcy proceedings usually take

would have had before this approach was adopted in

very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
