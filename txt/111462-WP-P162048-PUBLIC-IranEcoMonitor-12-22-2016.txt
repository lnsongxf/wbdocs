2   IRAN ECONOMIC MONITOR: TOWARDS REINTEGRATION
  BOX 1  •  Iran’s Post Sanctions Automobile Industry

  The total domestic automobile production in Iran is dominated by two major producers; Iran Khodro (IKCO) and SAIPA, which account for more than 90 percent
  of the total domestic production. These two firms are subsidiaries of the state-owned Industrial Development and Renovation Organization. Both companies
  assemble European and Asian cars under the license, as well as their own brands. IKCO and SAIPA account for 44 percent and 43 percent of market share,
  respectively. Traditional export destinations for Iranian automobiles include Algeria, Azerbaijan, Cameroon, Ghana, Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan, Senegal, Syria, Sudan
  and Venezuela.
  Iran’s automobile industry has suffered substantially from the adverse effects of international sanctions since 2007; production in the industry fell by
  approximately 50 percent from USD 1.4 million in 2011 to USD 0.7 million in 2012.a The sharp decline in output accompanied by a substantial fall in exports
  share from 6.7 percent in 2012 to 2.5 percent in 2015, demonstrates the challenge faced by the car industry in Iran.

  With the intensified sanctions on Iran’s economy since June 2013, the global ranking of the automobile industry in Iran fell from 17th in 2008 to 21st in 2015;
  however, Iran’s auto industry still produces more cars than countries such as Italy, Austria, Australia, and the Netherlands due to its large capacity. Iran’s auto
  industry ranked 13th in world sales of passenger cars in 2015.
  The massive currency depreciation in 2012–2013 adversely affected the competitiveness of the car industry because most intermediate inputs and
  technology are imported from abroad. The replacement of Chinese manufacturers for the western partners such as Peugeot and Renault under the sanctions
  could not reverse the sharp decline in the production. As a result, domestic production fell from 1.4 million in 2011 to 0.78 million in 2012, dropping below 1
  million units for the first time in 2007.
  After the initial shock in 2012–13, the sector bounced back rapidly, with its 2014–15 growth at five times that of the industry average, explained partly by
  the reforms introduced in the sector. Currently, the industry substantially contributes to government’s revenues; almost 25 percent of the sales revenue of the
  industry is allocated to government-sponsored enterprises and organizations, mostly in the form of tax revenue.
  Against this background, with the lifting of sanctions in January 2016 and the opening up the markets to foreign investors, it is expected that car production
  and imports will rebound gradually and reach 1.6 million in 2016, leading to increased employment in the sector. The considerable layoff of 30–50 percent
  that had started in 2013 as a result of sanctions is expected to reverse with the lifting of sanctions. In fact, almost a week after the agreement with P5+1,
  PSA (French car manufacturer) signed a EUR 400 million (50:50) joint venture with IKCO, which allows Iran to produce 100,000 vehicles per year in 2017,
  and is expected to double within a year, while for Peugeot it could mean more than 450,000 vehicles.b Furthermore, Renault-Nissan is expected to restart its
  operations in the country and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ (FCA) Fiat division will set up a joint venture with IKCO.
  Currently, major producers in Iran suffer from lack of liquidity and need financing to expand and update their facilities. In response to this problem, measures
  have been taken to ease access of producers to trade finance through domestic commercial banks and the capital market. Access to international bank
  loans after the removal of sanctions will likely give a major boost to the industry too. In March 2016, President Rouhani announced plans to privatize the car
  industry and encourage joint ventures in order to make the Iranian automotive industry more technologically-advanced and internationally competitive. More
  importantly, Iran aims to remove government protection for domestic car producers. In addition, addressing complicated regulations, and fragmented supply
  networks would help attract foreign investment to the industry.

4   IRAN ECONOMIC MONITOR: TOWARDS REINTEGRATION
  BOX 2  •  Gender Paradox of Iranian Women’s Labor Force Participation Rate

  Iran constitutes a prime example for the “MENA gender paradox”, a term coined by the World Bank, which refers to the puzzle of the female labor force
  participation rate remaining very low in spite of the significant decline in fertility. Indeed, while Iran’s fertility rate has fallen sharply and the average number
  of years of schooling for women has expanded by 40 percent in only one generation, the female labor force participation rate remains at a quarter of the
  male labor force participation rate (Figure 2.1). This comes in spite of the emergence of labor saving home appliances, which are known to have been widely
  adopted in Iran. The relatively high return to women providing child care and child education appears to be the most plausible reason for this outcome.

  This has triggered a public debate in Iran about whether or not public spending on women’s education bears positive economic returns. A study by Salehi
  and Taghvatalab (2016) finds compelling evidence of positive economic returns.a The study finds that, while women’s education has no effect in the time use
  of their husbands, more educated women have a higher propensity to stay longer in the labor market as well as spending more time on child care and child
  education, than their less educated counterparts. This is complemented by the finding that domestic work declines by the level of education of women. As
  such, the evidence indicates strong positive returns for society.
  A stronger pace of job creation could also support a rise in the female labor force participation rate. The female unemployment rate is twice as high as their
  male counterpart (Figure 2.2). A steadier pace of job creation could effectively induce a higher female participation rate as women who have given up their
  employment search efforts and have become inactive re-enter the labor force.

10   IRAN ECONOMIC MONITOR: TOWARDS REINTEGRATION
BOX 3  •  Determinants of Iran’s Current Account Balance (CAB)

To identify the contribution of additional drivers, a model is used that explains the CA as a function of national saving and investments as well as trade
competitiveness related factors.a The parameters are estimated using ‘model-averaging’ methodology, which addresses the frequently overlooked problem
of uncertainty with respect to the true model that best describes the determination of the current account balance. The estimated model performs well on
average—the difference between the three year averages of the CAB predicted by the model and the observed CA is small throughout the period (Figure 3.1).
The model also fits well the most recent CA deterioration. The key drivers of the CA balance are shown in Figure 3.1 and are summarized below:
1.	 As expected, oil production has the largest absolute contribution. However, aside from oil production growth over 2003–05, the relative changes in its
    contribution across the three-year period before economic sanctions are small; at around 0.15 percent of GDP (Figure 3.1). Economic sanctions resulted
    in a significant drop in oil production, which had a strong negative effect on the CA over 2012–14.
2.	 The volatility of oil prices significantly contributed to the volatility of the CAB. Rising oil prices led to a surplus in the CA by more than 1.5 percent of GDP
    in the mid-2000s and again over 2010–12. The 2015 fall in oil prices had the largest negative impact (–3 percent of GDP) on the decline in the CAB
    over 2013–15.
3.	 A relatively persistent real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciation over the second half of 1990s and 2000s (with the exception of 1999 and 2003)
    had a negative impact on the CA. The most recent depreciation of the nominal and real exchange rate in contrast had a positive impact on the CAB that
    partially compensated the fall in oil exports over 2012–14.
4.	 The reduction in both current and capital expenditure of the government after 2008 contributed to the CA surplus and the impact is stronger in case of
    the current expenditure.
Looking ahead, the volatility of the CA is expected to remain given the dependence of the economy on oil exports. In terms of the CA drivers, removal of
economic sanctions should lead to a higher volume of oil production and oil exports; however the total effect of oil exports in the CA is conditional on the
dynamics of oil prices. Assuming the average price of crude oil of 43 USD and 53.2 USD in 2016 and 2017 respectively, and expected increase in average
oil production to 3.7 and 4.2 mbpd, the model estimates suggest improvements in the CA to around 3 percent of GDP and 4 percent of GDP, respectively.
Strong fiscal and monetary policies and policies to ramp up FDI will be instrumental in improving the CAB. Lifting of sanctions and higher growth may open
the room for future increase in the government expenditures whose contraction over the sanctions period counteracted the fall in oil exports in the CAB. In
particular, an increase in capital expenditures would have a smaller negative impact on the CA and would not offset improvements in the CA driven by the oil
sector. Recent nominal and real depreciation contributed positively to the CA. An expected increase in oil exports may alleviate the need for stronger nominal
depreciation from the current account sustainability perspective. Inflation stabilization and a successful disinflation strategy should also reduce the pressures
on the foreign exchange market. The limited positive impact of FDI inflows on the CAB implies that increased efforts are needed to promote foreign investment
in Iran in sectors that contribute directly or indirectly to exports. This includes policies towards stimulating FDI inflows in tradable, export oriented sectors,
including oil, as well as a better understanding of the linkages between FDI in upstream, non-tradable sectors, and the performance of exporting firms.

Figure 23 shows the main contributors to poverty
changes in 2012–2014. In contrast to 2009–2012, the
role of benefits completely reversed. It seems that due
to high inflation the real value of benefits diminished
and that was the key factor behind increase in poverty.                                                                                                                         Source: Authors’ calculation using HEIS 2008–2014.

Thus, the size of social assistance per capita dropped
by 38 percent in real terms between 2012 and 2014.                                                                                                                              the bottom of the distribution was mostly benefiting

behind the decline and increase in inequality.

     WHAT IS PM2.5 AIR POLLUTION?

     Fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 air pollution, is defined as fine inhalable
     air particles with diameters of 2.5 micrometers (or microns) and smaller.
     PM2.5 poses the most severe health impacts because they can get deep
     into the lungs and even into the bloodstream. The infographic below
     illustrates the size of PM2.5 relative to that of hair, sand and PM10.
     Most PM2.5 particles form in the atmosphere as a result of complex
     chemical reactions in the presence of sunlight. In addition, they are often
     emitted directly from power plants, industries and automobiles. Fine
     particulate matter may also be emitted directly from a source such as
     construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires.

  BOX 4  •  Air Pollution is Reversible – Evidence from other Country Experiences

  Unlike other negative environmental externalities, air pollution is reversible. London, Paris, and New York, all cities which suffered greatly from severe air
  pollution a couple of decades ago have cleaned up their air owing largely to decisive policy actions. On most days in recent years, these megacities remain
  within the WHO air pollution guidelines for what is considered healthy. There are also more recent examples of decisive policy action leading to air quality
  improvements, including Chile and Peru (to name but two examples):
  Chile, from 2003–2010, launched an urban transportation project with the objective to improve Santiago’s air quality through reducing local air pollutants
  by expanding the public transportation system. As part of the project, interventions included reducing the emissions from public buses, increasing the use
  of bicycles, implementing up-to-date emission testing, developing business schemes for operation of the public transportation system, monitoring the bus
  systems, and implementing overall traffic planning. In large parts due to this comprehensive transportation program, PM2.5 air pollution concentrations
  reduced by more than half from the early 1990s to the early 2010s.
  Peru, from 2009–2011, launched an air pollution and transportation program, which included improvements in vehicle emissions, fuel quality, and air quality
  monitoring systems. The objective of the program was to build a constituency for air pollution control that takes an active interest in shaping air pollution
  control activities. In large parts due to the project, PM2.5 levels decreased by almost half from 2009–2012 in the metropolitan Lima-Callao area. The
  improved air quality was particularly beneficial for poor persons, as they were more severely affected by the air pollution than non-poor persons.
