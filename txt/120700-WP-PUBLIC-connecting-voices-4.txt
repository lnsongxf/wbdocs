Connecting Voices (CV) Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is a
regional initiative and partnership that promotes governance and
improved financial management practices in the public and private
sectors. The ultimate aim is to support the demands of citizens
throughout the Arab World for jobs, better governance, a voice in
public affairs, and social and economic inclusion as reflected in the
World Bank’s MENA Regional strategy. CV MENA plans to seize on the
windows of opportunity available in the region. It will support capacity
building in the area of governance, facilitate the development of a
professional community, as well as the sharing and transfer of
knowledge both within countries and within the region as a whole. CV
MENA will help foster greater transparency and accountability, thereby
engendering enhanced public trust. In addition, building public and

Strategic Objectives
Every year, governments across the MENA
region spend billions of dollars for the
provision of key public programs and
services      to      foster     socio-economic
development. However, the results indicate
uneven outcomes across countries, sectors
and over time. Thus, both governments and
parliaments are now considering new ways
to: (i) improve the allocative efficiency of
scarce public resources to priority policies
and services; (ii) strengthen the operational
efficiency of public expenditures and               along the service delivery chain. In many         countries as a potential lever to address

was organized by the Governance Global
Practice Team at the World Bank Office in
Beirut in coordination with the Public-Private
Partnership Cross Cutting Solutions Area
(GPCDR-PPP-CCSA). The event provided a
platform to expose clients to best practices
on PPP procurement, particularly in projects,
sectors, and countries with upcoming PPP
operations, as well as in countries that are
exploring the possibility of utilizing PPP
arrangements and are interested to learn
more about the approach and the legal
framework to support it.

The Importance of PPP for the MENA Region:
This workshop came at an important time for
MENA countries. Meeting the exponentially
growing demands for infrastructure will
continue to strain the pocketbooks of MENA
governments in the coming years.3 In the
Mashreq       countries,4   the     required
infrastructure investment for electricity
alone is estimated at US$ 130 billion by
20205. Quite simply, the public budget will
not be able to meet these needs by itself.
Therefore, PPP is becoming an important
project financing option for governments in
MENA to respond to the large financing
needs to improve infrastructure and service
delivery in water, energy, transport, solid
waste management and others. In some
cases, the public sector budgetary
constraints can mean that the only               investors in Africa found that the                 (BOOT). Other sessions focused on a general

and implementing decentralization is a
complicated process as it is multidisciplinary,
comprehensive, and involves multiple
stakeholders. It could also be risky as it could
cause potential problems such as
macroeconomic         instability,   increased
regional inequality and conflicts, declining
service levels, increased corruption and elite
capture. Therefore, developing a design and
implementation strategy is critical and the
result must be country specific. In practice,
decentralization is very diverse, and
pathways may have similar triggers and
threats depending on the country’s
development status, as illustrated in Table 1.

         Numerous Reform Attempts, but Limited Results

The MENA region has seen the rise and fall
(and rise again) of State-Owned Enterprises
(SOEs) beginning as early as the 1950s. SOEs
play a dominant role in the region,
accounting for 20-25 percent of economic
value added and close to 30 percent of total
employment. SOEs span a wide array of
sectors including tourism, manufacturing,
transport, banking, public utilities, and retail,
to name a few.

Given the central and strategic role that SOEs
play in the social, political, and economic
fabric of the region, maximizing their
performance and efficiency could be a
potential entry point to addressing
challenges, such as high unemployment,
limited fiscal space, and lack of                           (iv) Increasing transparency       through   permanent or well-staffed structure. Most

perspective on what it has to offer, consider
the challenges and opportunities associated
with IR and understand the practical aspects
of implementation. With that in mind, this
article will consider three facts that many
companies may not know about IR.


Fact #1: IR Is All About Value

One critical purpose of integrated reporting
is to allow organizations to communicate to
investors and other key stakeholders about
value creation over time. Let’s take a
moment to clarify that IR should not be
confused with sustainability reporting, which
provides      detailed     information     on
environmental, social and governance
performance to a variety of interested
stakeholders such as customers, suppliers,
employees, regulators, and others. An
integrated report, is intended primarily for
providers of financial capital, and offers a
holistic view of the company and its value
creation potential into the future. IR covers
elements of sustainability reporting to the
extent that management considers them                A foundation for integrated thinking.            how they are focused on investing in

                                                  Remittances in MENA
Remittances to the Middle East and North Africa region will slow
considerably in 2015, rising 1.1 percent to $53 billion. The modest
growth this year follows a surge in 2014 of 7.7 percent, the fastest
growth amongst all regions, largely due to a strong 10 percent growth
in inflows to Egypt, the world’s 6th largest recipient in 2014 with $20
billion received. Lebanon saw a 13 percent increase in remittances to
$9 billion in 2014, making it the world’s 10th largest recipient for the
year. Looking ahead, continued low oil prices could reduce
remittances from the GCC countries in the medium-to-long term. In
the short term, however, significant foreign exchange reserves and
strong fiscal positions could support current spending, thus delaying
the negative impact of low oil revenues on migrant employment.
Remittances to the region are expected to grow to $55 billion in 2016
and $57 billion in 2017. Conflicts in the region are resulting in
international displacement and forced migration across borders, and
remain a major risk factor to the outlook for remittances in the region.     World Bank Press – April 2015

What is the future of Sustainability
Reporting?

Sustainability reports are stand-alone
reports — currently disconnected from the
financials.     However,      as     economic,
environmental and social issues have an
impact on a company’s ability to operate and
generate profit, it appears necessary to
ensure an alignment of business reporting
with business strategy. This helps to show
the      linkage    between       sustainability
performance and business value. To reach
this point, sustainability reporting needs to
move from a view that essentially shows the
relationship between a business, society, the
economy and environment to a more
integrated vision that can help stakeholders
understand how this relationship is being
managed, as well as the impact that this may
have on the creation of value and
sustainability of a business. Some advocates
of sustainability reporting believe that the
next step for sustainability reporting is for
this information to be combined into an
‘Integrated Report.’ As defined by the

individuals. Thus, the simple fact of setting
up an institutional structure does not mean
that behaviours and practices will change.

agency integrating Customs and taxation is

cooperate. The fact that post-clearance

Rule of Law Definitions
The rule of law is a multifaceted concept that
has taken time to gel. In their recent survey
of the rule of law and development,
Trebilcock and Daniels differentiate between
“thick” and “thin” definitions. With thick
definitions, the rule of law is viewed as the
backbone of a just and open society. The
“open-access order” theory of North, Wallis,
and Weingast (2009) provides a good
example: the rule of law ensures open
access and equality of opportunity for
individuals in the political, economic, and
social domains. Thin definitions of the rule
of law focus more on specific laws and
institutions, as well as on their beneficial
effects on economic outcomes. These rules
do not have to be just or promote open

                                 to the Palestinian Authority
PRESS RELEASE (source: World Bank.org)
WASHINGTON, May 20, 2015– The World Bank transferred today an amount of about US$77 million to the Palestinian Authority from the
Palestinian Reform and Development Plan Trust Fund (PRDP-MDTF), a multi-donor budget support mechanism administered by the Bank. The
funds contributed by the governments of Norway, Australia, Japan, Kuwait and the United Kingdom, will help support the urgent budget needs
of the Palestinian Authority (PA), providing inter alia support for ongoing macroeconomic and public financial management reforms. The World
Bank PRDP Trust Fund was established on April 10, 2008, through an agreement signed between the World Bank and the Palestinian Authority.
It is a central component of a World Bank’s effort to support the ongoing Palestinian Reform and Development Plan. Currently, the PRDP-MDTF
donors are the governments of Australia, France, Kuwait, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Japan. With the new tranche release, the PRDP-
MDTF will have disbursed about US$1.36 billion.

and Tunisia. The trade balances for these countries could improve by
up to 2 percent of GDP. The oil exporters will likely run larger fiscal
and current account deficits or their surpluses will shrink substantially.
“Oil importers will benefit from lower import and fuel subsidy bills,
while exporters—some of whom depend on oil for 80 percent of their
income—will lose export and fiscal revenues,” said Shanta Devarajan,
World Bank Chief Economist for the Middle East and North Africa
region.

The report, Plunging Oil Prices, focuses on the implications of low oil
prices for eight developing countries, or the MENA-8 (oil importers:
Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia; and oil exporters: Iran, Iraq, Libya
and Yemen) and the economies of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries, who play a major role in providing funds in the form of aid,
investment, tourism revenues and remittances to the rest of the
countries of the region.

   Centrality of Governance in Sustainable Development
The recognition that governance is a
key element in sustainable economic
development has been gaining in
ascendance. As part of a recent
World Bank Group reorganization into
14 Global Practices (GPs) and 5 Cross-
Cutting Areas, governance has
assumed a central role. The new
Governance Global Practice (GGP) is
the largest of all of the new GPs,
bringing together professionals in

               Senior Director - Governance Global Practice

By Manuel Vargas,
Lead Financial Management Specialist

CV MENA: Please share with us some of your
reflections as a leader of this new global
practice in these first few months.
Mario Marcel: I would say that when I came
onboard, I felt the weight of the responsibility
because the Governance Global Practice
represented one of the most substantial
changes from the previous structure of the
World Bank. Therefore, we had a number of
challenges that perhaps other GPs did not
have in terms of building a cohesive team,
creating an agenda, and updating the Bank's
narrative on governance issues. I would say
that during this time, even though there were
so many things that were necessary in terms
of dedicating time to organization, resources
and so on, I became very impressed with the
reach of the Bank across different countries,
regions, and cultures— and by the wealth of
knowledge that our staff have. I have worked
with very capable teams in different places,
but in terms of being able to have a deep
discussion on many governance issues, I feel
that the response that I am getting from our
Bank colleagues is extremely heartening.

CV MENA: The two goals of the World Bank
are to end extreme poverty and to boost
shared prosperity. How do you see the links

                                                    development does not necessarily come from           this basic principle.
Mario Marcel: I would say that the

Global Practice goes beyond these three
functions. It comprises eight different groups
because we also have colleagues joining us
from the Legal Department, the World Bank
Institute, and others. So, there is actually a
large diversity. In terms of our global
footprint, you will see that we are also the
most decentralized of all 14 GPs. To me,
diversity and decentralization are two very
positive elements. However, they are also
important challenges because in order to
build cohesion and make diversity and
decentralization work for better outcomes,
we need ways of building dialogue and
knowledge inside of the Global Practice. This
has been the focus of a lot of my attention
over these first few months. I think that one
important part of this is building a new

community?
Mario Marcel: I would say that one of the
problems that the governance agenda has had
over time is that it tends to be subject to
certain waves. It ascends in the development
agenda, and then a few years later it goes
down again. I have seen that, over time, one
of the big challenges that we face is how to
build a consistent governance agenda that is
able to withstand these trends, that is, how
we can remain engaged in a more systematic
way over time. Regarding the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), many actors in
this process have been very actively
supporting the inclusion of governance. I
foresee that governance will have a much
greater role and recognition that it had with
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
This will be a great opportunity to update our
agenda, and to maintain awareness about
working on governance issues in a sustainable
way, so that it does not get lost or replaced in
years to come.

                Perspectives from World Bank Management
CV MENA recently reached out to World Bank senior management to better understand their perspectives on governance — what it is and
   why it matters. We received responses from around the region, reflecting local, regional and international perspectives on the issue.

From 2003-2011, public expenditure in
Libya was high by international standards.
At 39 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) on average during 2003–05 (and 35
percent in 2008), consolidated public
expenditure was among the highest in the
world.      This level of public spending
exceeded levels recorded in economies in
transition in Eastern Europe and Central
Asia, as well as in fast-growing Middle East
and North African (MENA) countries, such as
Algeria and Tunisia. However, due to the
ongoing nature of political turmoil over the
past few years, development budget

The PIM diagnostic revealed substantial
weaknesses      in    Libyan     institutional
arrangements for public investment
management. As provided in the diagnostic,
Libya is experiencing a significant degree of
fragmented institutional arrangements. An
integrated approach to public investment
ensures that an appropriate balance
between recurrent and development
expenditure is achieved within expenditure
programs and that operating and
maintenance costs of investment proposals
are not forgotten. An integrated approach
needs to be introduced at four levels4, the
first two of which have implications for the

covered a broad array of personal status

perspective of gender equality.
Women’s rights within the household
improved on two levels. The first was that
husbands and wives were provided ‘joint
responsibility’ in family matters, making
both de jure heads of the household.
Theoretically, this could provide a basis for
wives to exert more influence in household
decision-making. The second was that
women were no longer required to be
obedient to their husbands, a concept which
had been a key element of the earlier law
and continues to exist in other family codes
in the region. Obedience had been used as a
justification for husbands to, among other
things, forbid wives from working, traveling,
controlling their own incomes and acquiring
economic assets. Failure of a wife to display
obedience had been legal grounds for a wife
to lose access to her alimony – financial         before and during marriage, since the              in 2010. In this context, the burden of

discontent. In the aftermath of the revolution, these subsidies became
important for people's subsistence, but were also a very heavy burden
for the state budget. Since then, the Libyan government has been
confronted with the necessity of reforming subsidies in a politically
and socially complex environment. The Paper uses household survey
data to provide a distributional analysis of food and energy subsidies
and a simulation of the impact of subsidy reforms on household well-
being, poverty, and the government's budget. Despite the focus on
direct effects only, the results indicate that subsidy reforms would
have a major impact on household welfare and government revenues.
The elimination of food subsidies would reduce household
expenditure by about 10 percent and double the poverty rate while
saving the equivalent of about 2 percent of the government budget.
The elimination of energy subsidies would have a similar effect on
household welfare, but a larger effect on poverty. Government
savings would be almost 4 percent of the budget. The size of these
effects, the weakness of market institutions, and the current political   To read the full report, see:

strengthen audit quality for audit firms of all
sizes (in particular, small and medium
practices [SMPs]) throughout Morocco and
Tunisia, the World Bank MENA Governance
Global Practice recently facilitated a
Workshop on “The Evolving Field of Audit

cooperation with the International Forum of
Independent Audit Regulators (IFIAR) and
the Conseil Supérieur de l’Ordre des Experts-

With greater budget transparency worldwide, new opportunities have
emerged for broader, more effective public participation to help
influence budgetary outcomes. Budgets are key documents that lay

and resource allocation, particularly at local levels. Budget
transparency is a prerequisite for public participation and
accountability.

“Establishing a budget from a revenue perspective is essential” said
Mrs. Olfa Soukri, parliamentarian and rapporteur to the finance
committee within the House of People’s Representatives. “Citizens
need to be able to access budget details per project and ministry but
more importantly per region, governorate and district.”

Program and Performance Budgeting (PPB)
is a useful tool in enabling the alignment of
the national budget with a country’s
strategic priorities and policies. Performance
and output indicators can measure the
extent to which government organizations
pursue value-for-money principles. The PPB
is particularly significant for meeting the
demands         of     accountability      and
transparency, whereby line ministries can be
held accountable for program delivery and
achieving targeted results within the
approved program budget.

2014 specified minimum budget allocations                                                           program budgets for all related expenditures

‫‪The Equal Access and Simplified Environment for Investment in Egypt‬‬
‫‪project aims specifically at addressing regulatory, institutional and‬‬
‫‪governance issues that have plagued private sector dynamism in Egypt‬‬
‫‪for years. The current context and the strong will of the government‬‬
‫‪authorities to address these longstanding regulatory reforms offers a‬‬
‫‪unique opportunity for making progress in these areas.‬‬

‫‪A new window of opportunity for ambitious reforms. Egypt’s Cabinet‬‬
‫‪recently approved significant amendments to the Investment Law, a‬‬
‫‪long awaited reform. It is an important step in the right direction to‬‬
‫‪improve the business climate and level the playing field for investors.‬‬
‫‪Effective implementation of the amended law will be essential. The‬‬
‫‪World Bank Group is preparing this Technical Assistance project to‬‬
‫‪support the Ministry of Investment and the General Authority for‬‬
‫‪Investment (GAFI) to implement their mandates under the new law.‬‬
‫‪GAFI aims to reduce stifling bureaucracy and room for discretion in the‬‬
‫‪licensing and permitting process and land allocation for new‬‬
‫‪investments. Most importantly, the law aims to empower GAFI to act as a one-stop shop for investors and to empower it to seek the necessary‬‬
‫‪approvals from various agencies that investors need to obtain. The Project aims to support GAFI in becoming the national platform facilitating‬‬
‫‪business entry, licensing, and access to investor information at the sub-national level through its One-Stop Shops and GAFI Information Portal.‬‬
‫‪This would entail addressing GAFI’s processes and interfaces with all of the involved regulators, i ncluding primarily the Industrial Development‬‬
‫‪Authority, but also other line ministries and local authorities involved in licensing. Further, it would involve developing an information technology‬‬
‫‪system to deliver business entry, licensing services, and investor information, as well as capacity building and technical assistance to support the‬‬
‫‪GAFI in this enhanced client-facing role, particularly of its one-stop shops.‬‬

In the context of volatile international oil
prices, Kuwait more than ever is seeking
ways to achieve greater efficiency and
improved outcomes for its investment
spending. At the request of the Ministry of
Finance, the World Bank conducted a
comprehensive review of the Capital Project
Implementation Cycle (CPIC).
The review and findings which were
collected over a 3-year period (2011-2014)
and cover all sectors except petroleum and
defense were a joint effort between the
Bank and the government. The Report is
particularly timely given the strong emphasis
placed in Kuwait’s National Development
Plan, “Strengthening the implementation of
capital projects is a critical step for achieving
Kuwait’s national goals of improving social
and physical infrastructure to encourage
more effective service delivery and
productive employment,” said Nadir

             Kuwait to Test and Translate the Public Expenditure and
              Financial Accountability (PEFA) Upgrade into Arabic

Kuwait has decided to use the upgraded PEFA testing version in
cooperation with the World Bank and the PEFA Secretariat. His
Excellency, Khalifa Hamada, Kuwait’s Undersecretary for Finance said,
“We have been examining the PEFA methodology for some time and
consider that the upgraded version is most suited to our needs as part
of our PFM strengthening initiative. It will also be useful for
monitoring progress against our PFM goals.”

Kuwait will be one of the first Arab countries to apply the upgraded
framework. It will join a select group of countries from Europe and
Central Asia, Africa, South America, South Asia, the Caribbean and the
Pacific Islands which will use the testing version in 2015.
The Kuwaiti government has also decided to sponsor the preparation
of the upgraded PEFA Framework document in Standard Arabic
language. His Excellency, Khalifa Hamada commented, “In addition to
applying the PEFA methodology in our own country, we would like to
help people in other Arabic speaking countries to understand and
                                                                           At present we only have official English, French and Spanish language

An Introduction to Integrated Reporting
There are growing expectations that
organizations, both public and private, are
responsible for more than the primary
objectives for which they were created. They
must operate— and be perceived to
operate— in a manner that is responsible,
ethical, and sustainable, that minimizes
negative impacts on the environment, that
takes into consideration the varied needs of
a spectrum of stakeholders, and that
positively contributes to the communities in
which they operate and the planet more
generally. As sustainable value creation

                   Jobs or Privileges: Unleashing the Employment Potential of the Middle East and North Africa. MENA Development Report.
                   The World Bank.

                     This report maintains that Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries face a critical choice in their quest for higher private
                     sector growth and more jobs: promote competition, equal opportunities for all entrepreneurs and dismantle existing
                     privileges to specific firms or risk perpetuating the current equilibrium of low job creation. The report shows that policies
                     which lower competition in MENA also constrain private sector development and job creation. Chapter one analyzes the
                     dynamics and determinants of job creation and tests whether the fundamentals of job creation in MENA are similar to those
                     in fast growing developing and high income countries. Chapter two shows how different policies in MENA countries shaped
private sector competition and thus the firm dynamics associated with job growth identified in chapter one. Chapter three documents past
industrial policies in MENA and compare the experiences in MENA with the experiences of East Asian countries, highlighting how the differences
are linked to policy objective, design, and implementation. Chapter four analyzes how privileges to politically connected firms result in policy
distortions that undermine competition and constrain private sector growth and jobs in MENA. The report concludes by laying out the
implications for policy of the various findings and lays out the specific areas for policy reform to the roadmap for more private sector growth
and jobs in MENA.

                    Islamic Banking Opportunities across Small and Medium Enterprises in MENA. International Finance Corporation, IFC
                    Advisory Services in MENA.

                      There is a huge demand for Islamic products by SMEs in the MENA region and, according to this study, approximately 35
                      percent of such businesses remain excluded from the formal banking sector because of a lack of Shariah-compliant products.
                      In order to reach out to SMEs demanding Islamic products, and as part of IFC’s initiative to enhance its SME investment and
                      advisory services offerings to Islamic financial institutions, we needed to better understand the market from both the
                      demand and supply sides in order to identify any gaps or niches where IFC could assist and add value. IFC commissioned a
                      study in nine countries of the MENA region to better understand the demand and supply for Islamic banking products (both
asset & liability products and other banking services) in the SME sector. The countries chosen for this study are: (1) Iraq, (2) Pakistan, (3) Yemen,
(4) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, (5) Egypt, (6) Lebanon, (7) Morocco, (8) Tunisia, and (9) Jordan. The scope of the study was to: (i) identify the
countries in the MENA region facing gaps in financing and banking needs of SMEs in the Islamic products space; (ii) conduct a supply side
benchmarking to review current capacity of financial institutions to offer Islamic products to this sector; (iii) conduct a demand side
benchmarking to identify key SME customer needs for Islamic products and see how well they are currently being served; and (iv) review the
current enabling environment and readiness levels of banks in terms of the regulatory framework and Shariah compliance. The study reiterates
several of the now well researched and documented reasons for the lack of access to finance for SMEs. However, more importantly, the study
reveals that, there is a potential gap of $8.63 billion to $13.20 billion for Islamic SME financing, with a corresponding deposit potential of $9.71
billion to $15.05 billion across these countries. This is due to the fact that several un-served and underserved SMEs do not borrow from

conventional banks, owing to religious reasons. This potential is a “new to bank” funding opportunity, which is still untapped, as banks and other
financial institutions lack adequate strategic focus on this segment to offer Shariah-compliant products.

                       Regional Economic Outlook: Middle East and Central Asia—Learning to Live with Cheaper Oil amid Weaker Demand.
                       International Monetary Fund.

                        A large and possibly persistent decline in oil prices, and slower-than-projected growth in the euro area, China, Japan, and
                        Russia, have substantially altered the economic context for countries in the Middle East and Central Asia. The appropriate
                        policy response will depend on whether a country is an oil exporter or importer. A common theme, however, is that these
                        developments present both an opportunity and an impetus to reform energy subsidies and step up structural reform
                        efforts to support jobs and growth. Lower oil prices have weakened the external and fiscal balances of oil exporters,
                        including members of the Gulf Coperation Council (GCC). Large buffers and available financing should allow most oil
                        exporters to avoid sharp cuts in government spending, limiting the impact on near-term growth and financial stability. Oil
exporters should prudently treat the oil price decline as largely permanent and adjust their medium-term fiscal consolidation plans so as to
prevent major erosion of their buffers and to ensure intergenerational equity. Outside the GCC, a source of risk in Algeria’s banking syste m is
the public banks’ extensive and direct exposures to large state-owned enterprises in various industries, which are subject to fiscal strains as a
result of lower oil prices. Yemen is at high risk because its banks are highly exposed to government debt against the backdrop of a weak fiscal
position and limited financing options. Selected oil-importing countries (such as Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon) for which remittances are a major
source of liquidity could experience tighter liquidity conditions if remittances decline.

                  Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Globalization of Democracy. Francis Fukuyama

                  This is the second volume of the bestselling landmark work on the history of the modern state. Taking up the essential question
                  of how societies develop strong, impersonal, and accountable political institutions, Fukuyama follows the story from the French
                  Revolution to the so-called Arab Spring and the deep dysfunctions of contemporary American politics. He examines the effects
                  of corruption on governance, and why some societies have been successful at rooting it out. He explores the different legacies
                  of colonialism in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, and offers a clear-eyed account of why some regions have thrived and
                  developed more quickly than others. And he boldly reckons with the future of democracy in the face of a rising global middle
                  class and entrenched political paralysis in the West.


                  The Shifts and the Shocks: What We’ve Learned and Still Have to Learn from the Financial Crisis.
                  By Martin Wolf. Penguin Press.

                  From the chief economic commentator for the Financial Times, The Shifts and the Shocks is the tour d’horizon of the new world
                  economy. Wolf is one of the most farseeing and imaginative economic commentators. Wolf makes us see how partial and
                  confused our view of the economic events of the last five years has been. No other book offers such a thoroughly global
                  perspective, nor one that understands the connection between the macroeconomics and the financial system with Wolf’s level
                  of sophistication and insight. It is not a book for those looking for a cheerful prognosis on the future of the European Union, or
                  any number of other vital issues hanging fire, and it offers solutions that will seem extremely radical to some, but neither is it
without hope. The new global economic order is lifting tens of millions of people out of poverty and creating new winners and losers at an
unimagined scale and pace. It’s simply high time, indeed past time, for our economics to keep pace with our economy. Now, with The Shifts and
the Shocks, it has.

               The Contextual Drivers of Social Accountability
This publication fills an important knowledge gap by providing guidance on how to assess contextual drivers of
social accountability effectiveness. It aims to strategically support citizen engagement at the country level and for
a specific issue or problem. The report proposes a novel framing of social accountability as the interplay of
constitutive elements: citizen action and state action, supported by three enabling levers: civic mobilization,
interface and information. For each of these constitutive elements, the report identifies 'drivers' of contextual
effectiveness which take into account a broad range of contextual factors (e.g., social, political and intervention-
based, including information and communication technologies). Opening the Black Box offers detailed guidance on
how to assess each driver. It also applies the framework at two levels. At the country level, the report looks at
'archetypes' of challenging country contexts, such as regimes with no formal space or full support for citizen-state
engagement and fragile and conflict-affected situations. The report also illustrates the use of the framework to
analyze specific social accountability interventions through four case studies: Sierra Leone, Pakistan, Yemen, and
the Kyrgyz Republic.
