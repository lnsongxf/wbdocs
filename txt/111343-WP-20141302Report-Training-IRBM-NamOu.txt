provinces and 17 districts) from the Nam Ou                  The meeting provided an important forum for
River Basin to discuss IRBM issues. The main                 provincial and district authorities to share
objective of the meeting was to introduce the                information and ideas regarding IWRM, current
purpose and scope of the training, proposed                  and planned natural resource developments,

was for members of the TWG, DWR and IFC to
describe their expectations for the overall
program and to identify priority activities to be
undertaken in the basin.

Luang Prabang Training Workshop

A technical training program was conducted
from October 1-2, 2013 in Luang Prabang to
provide background information on IRBM, CIAM
and to assist with preparation of a Nam Ou River
Basin Profile.

Participants included water resource managers
and environmental staff from the three provinces
and 17 districts in the Nam Ou River Basin (plus
DWR staff from the central government).
General understanding of water resource
management concepts among participants was
limited, and for many this was their first
introduction to IRBM and CIAM.

Participants discussed the linkages between
social issues, livelihoods and environmental
impacts on water resources; the need for
relevant stakeholders to be involved in the
planning and management of water resources;
and, ways to promote better water management       Figure 4: Participants map out key resources in

 Following the Luang Prabang workshop, a 2-day
 hands-on field training program was conducted
 for all participants on the Nam Ou River at Nong
 Khiaw in the villages of Ban Sopvanh and Ban
 Park Bak, Ngoi District. Aquatic environmental
 sampling techniques were demonstrated in the
 field, including physical (water and sediment
 quality) and biological (fisheries, benthic
 invertebrates) sample collection. Social data
 collection tools were also applied, including
 seasonal calendars, historical timelines, and
 community mapping techniques that used
 traditional ecological knowledge.                          Figure 5: Participants practice taking water

Conclusions and Recommendations
General

      The training workshop program was
       successful in meeting its overall
       objectives, and laid a foundation for
       future cooperation with key stakeholders
       in the Nam Ou River Basin.
      The workshop demonstrated that
       provincial and district authorities can
       benefit from IFC expert team advice
       through direct ‘on-the-ground’ technical
       support. Future training and capacity
       building activities should maximize time
       spent in the field, and include more
       hands-on       training    relevant    to
       preparation of the Nam Ou River Basin       Figure 8: Participants share their lessons learned,

Nam Ou River Basin Profile

The following is recommended by IFC for
development of the Nam Ou River Basin Profile:
         Agreement      on    the     proposed                        be included (e.g., impacts from
          methodology and process for the River                        hydropower, mining, irrigation, etc.);
          Profile development (e.g., purpose of
          the profile, review background data                         Study area boundaries must be agreed
          sources, develop TOC, collect data,                          upon (watershed boundaries, not
          write report);                                               provincial boundaries for data collection

         Relevant   secondary      data   and
          documents should be provided by DWR;                        The River Basin Profile will be prepared
                                                                       to    international   standards    (IFC’s
         Involvement of other sectors and                             Performance Standards) and addresses
          government ministries (and the private                       key issues in the Nam Ou Basin,
          sector) in the River Basin Profile review                    including    Integrated    River   Basin
