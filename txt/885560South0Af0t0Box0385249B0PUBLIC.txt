I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in South
        Africa perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in South Africa regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in South Africa;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in South Africa;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in South Africa; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in South Africa.

       Use data to help inform the South Africa country team’s strategy.



II. Methodology
In June and August 2012, 481 stakeholders of the World Bank in South Africa were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office
of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial department, or
implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-supported
projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based
organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based
groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 69
stakeholders participated in the country survey (14%).

Respondents received questionnaires via post or email and returned it accordingly, or completed
questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents were asked about:
general issues facing South Africa, their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World Bank’s
effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s
future role in South Africa, and the Bank’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified
throughout the survey report.

II. Methodology (continued)
A. General Issues facing South Africa: Respondents were asked to indicate their three most
   important development priorities in South Africa.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in South Africa, Bank staff preparedness, the
   extent to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda, agreement
   with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an
   effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on
   which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest
   values and greatest weaknesses in its work, with which groups the Bank should collaborate
   with more in South Africa, and how they attribute slow or failed reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve sustainable development results in South Africa, the Bank’s
   level of effectiveness across thirty-four development areas, such as economic growth and
   basic education, the extent to which the Bank meets South Africa’s need for knowledge
   services and financial instruments, and their level of agreement with a series of statements
   regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s “Safeguard Policy”
   requirements being reasonable.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge products and research and to rate the effectiveness and quality of
   the Bank’s knowledge products and research, including how significant a contribution it
   makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. The Future Role of the World Bank in South Africa: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in South Africa in the near future, their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding Eskom, and to indicate what the Bank should
   do to make itself of greater value in South Africa.
F. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate where they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data polic y.
   Respondents were also asked to indicate their level of agreement that they know how to find
   information from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
G. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in South Africa, and their geographic location.

In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 54 respondents who completed the survey in FY 2006.
Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample

Current Position

       For further analyses, the small number of respondents from bilateral agencies were
        combined with those from multilateral agencies, respondents from private foundations
        and faith-based groups were combined with those from NGOs, respondents from the
        financial sector/private banks were combined with those from the private sector, and the
        few respondents from the media were included in the “Other” category.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in South Africa, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-four specific areas
of effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.
       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in South Africa. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at crime and violence;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at agriculture and rural development; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at energy.
             Of note, the areas determined to be key drivers of the Bank’s overall effectiveness
              in the FY ’06 country survey were:
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to strengthen the social protection
                    sector;
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to reduce poverty; and
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to bring about economic growth.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in South
        Africa, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results. The
        area determined to be the key driver from these analyses was:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth.

Attributing Slow or Failed Reform Efforts

       Respondents from most stakeholder groups indicated that slow or failed reform efforts
        should be attributed to poor coordination with development partners, the Government
        working inefficiently, an inadequate level of citizen/civil society participation, and
        inadequate capacity in Government; however, employees of ministries were more likely
        to attribute slow or failed reform efforts to the World Bank working slowly or the World
        Bank not being sensitive enough to political/social realities on the ground.

outreach and programs that support development in South Africa. The World Bank commissioned an
