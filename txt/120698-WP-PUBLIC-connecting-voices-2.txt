Connecting Voices (CV) Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is a regional initiative and partnership that promotes governance and improved finan-
cial management practices in the public and private sectors. The ultimate aim is to support the demands of citizens throughout the Arab World for
jobs, better governance, a voice in public affairs, and social and economic inclusion as reflected in the World Bank’s MENA Regional strategy.

CV MENA plans to seize on the windows of opportunity currently available in the region. It will support capacity building in the area of financial
management, facilitate the development of a professional community, as well as the sharing and transfer of knowledge both within countries and
within the region as a whole. CV MENA will help foster greater transparency and accountability, thereby engendering enhanced public trust. In
addition, building public and private sector financial management capacity will also help attract and provide comfort to much-needed foreign direct
investment in the region.

Box 1: Bangladesh: A Public-Private Partnership for Local Government Audits

Integrating social accountability with traditional forms of public sector accountability, such as the independent annual external audit, was a key
innovation in the World Bank-supported Bangladesh Local Governance Support Project (LGSP). However, the Comptroller and Auditor General
(C&AG), who has the constitutional mandate for the external audit of public sector institutions in Bangladesh, was not able to fulfill the responsi-
bility with regard to Union Parishads (rural local governments). Capacity constraints meant that the C&AG could not implement the annual exter-
nal audit in a regular and timely manner.

The project supported the C&AG in addressing this issue through the preparation of an “Audit Strategy” that resulted in a public-private partner-
ship between the C&AG, the Ministry of Local Governments, and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh. As a result, services of
auditors from the private sector were procured on a contractual basis. They were to be responsible for implementing the annual external audit of
Union Parishads, with the C&AG providing the quality assurance of the overall audit process.

The outcome of this innovative approach was that the annual external audit of the Union Parishads began to be implemented within a reasonable
time period after the close of the financial year. The audit report was made available to the local government and its stakeholders, thereby en-
hancing the overall framework of local accountability.

  Three Types of Obstacles to Governance Reform

The first obstacle is the lack of political         will.
Political will to pursue governance reform exists when there is support from enough political leaders to pursue the
policy change. Necessary conditions include: a sufficient set of political actors representing a broad-based constit-
uency, a common understanding of a particular problem on the public agenda, genuine intent of political leaders
to support reform, and a commonly perceived potentially effective policy solution. The challenge in securing politi-
cal will by removing or deflecting resistance from the “iron law of oligarchy,” whereby there is a persistence of
power elites, a persistence of bad rulers, and persistence of bad rules.5 Communication can play a critical role in
securing political will. Organized groups can pressure policymakers and government officials through public inter-
est lobbying by the following means: rallies and demonstrations by a broad cross-section of society to air issues,
backroom negotiations with targeted policymakers to uncover hidden interests, framing the issues by the mass
media to mobilize political will and provoke the nation’s leaders into action.

The second obstacle is the challenge           of developing organizational will.
Organizations and institutions are often averse to change or, at best, they move change at a glacial pace. The mid-
dle managers in the organization have been described as “a layer of clay through which nothing passes.” Commu-
nication approaches that create a sense of urgency for change, engage the entire organization in moving forward
and develop trust among the leaders, middle managers and the staff will help mitigate the hazard of feeble organi-
zational will. Appreciative inquiry, an approach described by Kevin Barge (2008, p. 198) allows middle managers to
comprehend the urgency for change, empowers them as equal partners, provides them a pathway for change and
addresses their concerns regarding vulnerability.

The third obstacle is the absence         of public will.
Public will translates into public support which results in policy change and reform. There are many reasons why
public will is stifled, voiceless, or simply absent among the people, government officials and policymakers. Reforms
oft en occasion long-term benefits to many, but also provide short-term gains to a few elite groups. If the costs of
reform are known but the benefits are not well understood, potential “losers” with access and representation in
the political system can oppose and derail the reform. This dilemma is well described by Gaetano Mosca (1939)
Mosca proposed that “The domination of an organized minority over the unorganized majority is inevitable. The
power of any minority is irresistible as against each single individual in the majority, who stands alone before the
totality of the organized minority. At the same time, the minority is organized for the same reason that it is a mi-
nority.”

"Ongoing regional tensions, together with a challenging (albeit slightly improving) external environ-
ment, have hit the economies of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region hard. Economic
growth is slowing, fiscal buffers are depleting, unemployment is rising, and inflation is mounting in sev-
en of the region’s most vulnerable economies-- Egypt, Tunisia, Iran, Lebanon, Jordan, Yemen and Libya.

Short-term policy actions such as increasing public sector wages and subsidies—aimed at reducing so-
cial tensions--exacerbate the situation, which is driven by long-standing structural weaknesses, includ-
ing labor market rigidities, complicated and opaque regulations, infrastructure deficiencies, regressive
and inefficient subsidies, and inadequate social safety nets. While these countries face an unstable
political and macroeconomic environment, the growth slowdown after the Arab Spring creates a
unique opportunity to address these structural problems to both create fiscal space and restructure
the economy towards job creation and inclusive growth."

"Development assistance models tend to focus on limiting the power of elite actors through institu-
tional means like anti-corruption bodies or formal legal and judicial institutions. Unfortunately, in too
many cases, powerful elites are able to ignore or capture these institutions. Aid effectiveness can be
enhanced by shifting the focus to the interests of elite actors, identifying where the interests of certain
elites might be served by advancing selected reform, and working to draw those elites into alliance and
collective action with others. This is easier said than done. Advancing reforms will still involve a strug-
gle against powerful actors defending the status quo. But the chances of success are brighter when
other powerful elites are on the reform side. In this context, it is important to understand the interests
of powerful elite groups, and identify scenarios where they have a shared interest in advancing a set of
particular reforms."

Governance has been an explicit part of the
Bank’s developmental agenda since the latter
part of the 1990s, although elements of good
governance have always played a role in the
institution’s work on development. These
ranged from project-focused work on financial
management and procurement to the various
sector governance components embedded in
many of the Bank’s adjustment and sector
operations since the 1980s. More recently, the
Bank has evolved toward a more explicit ac-
knowledgment that inefficiencies and weak-
nesses in the institutional environment have a
direct impact on the achievement and the
quality of development results.

In MENA, governance is a critical part of the
regional strategy and plays an important role
at the sector and topical levels in all four pillars
of the regional strategy (Figure 1). A credible
system of ‘good governance’ has various di-
mensions which, in broad terms, include:

•    Political accountability, which refers to             legislative oversight though parliaments          and private agencies and the use of feed-
     political competition including broad-                with independent oversight institutions           back mechanisms from citizens such as
     based political parties, adequate trans-              such as Supreme Audit Institutions, Anti-         citizen report cards, surveys, etc. An ef-
     parency and regulation of party financing,            Corruption Agencies, etc.                         fective private sector interface is also es-

•    Effective public sector management is another key dimension
     with a focus on a strong and results-oriented public administra-
     tion, ethical leadership and safeguards regarding assets, conflict of
     interest rules, effective financial management, procurement, and
     regulatory agencies.                                                    FIGURE 4

     likely to improve service delivery and greatly enhance the effec-

Governance Challenges
While not an exhaustive list, these dimensions provide a set of basic
principles and mechanisms that comprise the foundation of good gov-
ernance. Most countries in the world have varying strengths and weak-
nesses relating to governance systems, such as weak institutions and
procedures, low performance, poor quality of services, inefficient pub-
lic spending and low capacity. Other ‘breakdowns might include exces-
sive administrative discretion and malfeasance, political corruption, the
broader issue of state capture, patronage, nepotism, secrecy and in-
formation asymmetry.                                                         Source: World Bank Fourth Regional Working Group on Civil Service

                        the Budget Contract
                   between Citizens and the State

“Although it might not suffice, a key to restoring public trust is to balance citizen ex-
pectations and government capacity. When citizens expect more from a government
than it can effectively deliver, they cannot be confident that politicians and political
institutions will fulfil their part of the bargain. Each country has to find its own way,
consistent with its political orientation and economic condition, in aligning capacity
and expectations. Some countries will aim to dampen expectations by reducing the
footprint of the state and withdrawing from or curtailing some responsibilities; others
will strive to upgrade government capacity by improving performance and expanding
their revenue base. All will have to shift some risks and costs to households or enter-
prises; if they do not, new budget contracts will not be sustainable.”

7    - Deal with Ongoing PFM
Reforms: It’s Complicated!
In most cases, ongoing PFM reforms need to
be dealt with even as new PFM reform is be-
ing planned. It may be tempting to pretend
that such reforms do not exist or to banish
them to a parallel universe where they will not
affect the new PFM reforms, but this is rarely
a realistic approach. Successful ongoing re-
forms could be incorporated in the new “ba-
sics first” reform, even if they are beyond the
basics. Nonetheless, in some cases, tough
choices will need to be made to terminate,
delay, or modify ongoing reform elements if
their costs outweigh their benefits, or if they
are too flawed to be saved. Of course, such
choices may not be easy, as they often mean

istry of Finance
The Ministry of Finance usually leads the de-
sign and implementation of the country’s
financial and fiscal policies and operations.
However, the ministry is not the sole player. In
designing and implementing successful PFM
reform, it is crucial to understand and take
into account the relationships among the dif-
ferent players in PFM reform (see figure 1). At
the central level are the central finance agen-
cies (CFAs)—not a single organization, but a
group of ministries and agencies, of which the
Ministry of Finance is the key player. The allo-
cation of roles and responsibilities among CFA
members varies substantially from country to
country (e.g., centralized versus decentralized
structures). As Dressel and Brumby explain,
CFAs operate in the country’s wider political
economy context, and their activities are
shaped by several institutional interfaces—
formal political institutions, administrative
institutions, civil society, and external actors—
as well as by such structural constraints as
climate, level of development, degree of eth-
nic fragmentation, and availability of natural
resources (see figure 1).                           PFM reforms—which should be considered              form actions to the risk environment. Third,

                                The Handbook is a virtual encyclopaedia of public financial management, written by topmost experts,
                                many with a background in the IMF and World Bank. It provides the first comprehensive guide to the
                                subject that has been published in more than ten years. The book is aimed at a broad audience of aca-
                                demics/students, government officials, development agencies and practitioners.It covers both bread-
                                and-butter topics such as the macroeconomic and legal framework for budgeting, budget preparation
                                and execution, procurement, accounting, reporting, audit and oversight, as well as specialist subjects
                                such as government payroll systems, local government finance, fiscal transparency, the management of
                                fiscal risks, sovereign wealth funds, the management of state-owned enterprises, and political economy
                                aspects of budgeting. The book sets out numerous examples and case studies describing good practice
                                in public financial management, and is highly relevant for use in both advanced and developing coun-

conseils régionaux qui transmettent ensuite
leurs conclusions au conseil national.
Lors de l’entrevue, M. Hdid était fier
d’annoncer que le Maroc est le premier pays
africain qui a adopté cette norme. L’OEC en
collaboration avec la FIDEF vont partager
l’expérience Marocaine sur l’implémentation
de l’ISQC1 avec les membres de la FIDEF.

Did You Know?
Every day in the Arab world there are [1]:
    •    100 million google searches. That is 70,000 days’ worth of knowledge
         creation and sharing, if each google search takes just under a minute.
    •    36,000 new Facebook users register online. That’s more than the number
         of people born in the region per day.
    •    A staggering 60 days’ worth of Youtube videos is uploaded.
         That’s around the same amount of content aired by the region’s leading TV stations.
    •    10,832,000 tweets per day. That’s more than triple the content of all
         Arabic newspapers printed every day.
    •    37,095,955 Facebook users below the age of 30.[2] That’s more than
         4 times the total number of students enrolled in universities across the Arab world.

                                                   The Lebanese Association of Certified Public Accountants (LACPA) is founded by virtue of decision

                                                   1964.

                                                   of the Lebanese laws.
                                                   LACPA, an active member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), has committed

CV MENA: Why is the development of peer
review and quality assurance so important to
the accountancy profession?
Being aware that they are subject to higher
professional oversight controls that may affect
their careers, auditors are driven to develop
their professional knowledge and practice and
maintain a high level of professionalism in
their audit reviews so as to avoid the risk of
giving a subjective opinion and contradicting
the basic principles of auditing.

CV MENA: What are the biggest challenges
facing peer review in general and in Lebanon
in particular?

We at LACPA see four main challenges:
•   The first challenge, at the international
    level, is not understanding the true
    meaning of peer review and believing
    that it aims at administering discipline in-
    stead of enhancing performance, causing
    auditors to oppose the concept of control
    and supervision over their work.

                              Public Sphere
Accountability Happens in the Public Sphere
       The public sphere is a space between state and civil society. In this space government and citi-
       zens exchange information and services: Citizens communicate their demands to the govern-
       ment and, if satisfied with how these are met by the government, reward legitimacy to the
       government in office. The government provides rules, regulations, and public goods and ser-
       vices to the citizens. The mere delivery of services without accountability is insufficient to
       achieve good governance.

What is the Public Sphere?
         Citizens are stakeholders in the public sphere. Effective communication among the stakehold-
         ers promises to raise the citizen voice and thereby strengthen accountability. Th e public
         sphere, represented by information and communication processes, is the architecture of rela-
         tionships and interactions among different political actors. Drawing on a wide range of applied
         and academic sources, here is a visual representation of the democratic public sphere.

CV MENA: How can the Bank and the GCC
enhance their cooperation given the unique
role the Bank plays amid the multitude of
actors providing advisory services to the GCC?

NM: I do not see the Bank competing with
other advisory service providers (mainly
consultants). To the contrary, the Bank
provides advisory services in areas of its core
mandate, and quite often we convey to our
clients the need to obtain consultants to
undertake specific tasks. The Bank’s global
outreach allows it to benefit from best
international experience and to offer capacity
building        and        support         with
implementation. The Bank’s partners also
appreciate its convening power.
Because of its developmental mandate, the
Bank’s engagements are usually long-term and
go beyond specific transactions. Unlike private
sector consultants who are usually profit-
oriented, the Bank prides itself on playing the
honest broker role, as well as providing
unbiased      and     neutral     development
