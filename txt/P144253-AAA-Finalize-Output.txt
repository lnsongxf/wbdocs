                                   FOREWORD

The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (MoDWS) administers the National Rural
Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan - Gramin (SBM-G)
through which support is extended to the States for implementing water supply and
sanitation schemes in rural areas. In an attempt to meet the Government of India’s
Twelfth Five Year Plan, which is based on the theme of ‘Faster, Sustainable and More
Inclusive Growth’, and its own Strategic Plan for ‘ensuring drinking water security and
sanitized environment in rural India’, MoDWS is implementing Neer Nirmal Pariyojna
through the NRDWP and assistance from the World Bank through the Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Project (the Project) in the four low income States of Assam,
Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh.

The Project adopted an integrated planning, designing, implementing and managing
water supply and sanitation schemes aiming at achieving sustainable water sources;
equitable distribution of water; water security at household, village and Gram Panchayat
levels; open defecation free villages; and clean and hygienic surroundings. The Project
also aimed at improving institutional capacity till Gram Panchayat (GP) level to facilitate
and scale-up community-driven, decentralized RWSS service delivery.

The purpose of this Manual is to facilitate achieving all of the above by introducing the
key concepts and providing practical guidelines for planning, designing, construction,
operation and maintenance (O&M) of rural water and sanitation services. This Manual
can at best serve as a general reference and guide. It will provide to the technical persons
a ready reference for their use and be an aid to the non-technical persons to participate in
the processes. However, the readers may consider them always in relation to their own
specific requirements, adapting and applying them within the context of their actual
situation. This is a dynamic document to be periodically updated to include new
technologies and practices.
I am sure this Manual will be of immense help to all the stakeholders for implementing
reliable, sustainable and affordable rural piped water supply and sanitation services under
the Neer Nirmal Pariyojna. I am pleased to acknowledge the valuable contributions of all
the four States and the World Bank in preparing this Manual and hope that the experience
from use of this Manual will be helpful in bringing out an updated version in course of
time, which could be useful for other states as well.

1.5.   Overview of Existing Institutional Arrangements

        The current RWSS institutional setup is highly centralized, with the State level
        Department of Water Supply and Drainage (DWSD) / Public Health Engineering
        Department (PHED) /UP Jal Nigam (UPJN) being responsible for planning,
        construction and maintenance of water supply schemes. The state government has
        established the State Water & Sanitation Mission (SWSM) for planning and policy
        making and District Water & Sanitation Missions (DWSMs) in all districts for
        implementing the Sector Reform Project (SRP), the Swajaldhara program and the Total
        Sanitation Campaign (TSC). In all the four Project states, the existing institutional
        structure also assigns overlapping roles and responsibilities for policy-making, planning,
        implementation and management, to the same organization-i.e. the technical agency
        (PHED in Assam, Bihar, DWSD in Jharkhand and UPJN in UP). As the head of the
        technical agency, the Principal Secretary to the Government also plays the role of policy
        making (except in UP where the technical agency Jal Nigam is housed in a different
        department)
        In addition, in UP state, the existing structure needs to be revisited, removing the
        separation between rural water and sanitation and integrating them under a single line of
        command as is practiced in most other states.

1.6.   Who can Use the Manual

       This Manual is meant for the following categories of users: Gram Panchayat/GPWSC
       functionaries involved in planning, designing, implementing, operating and managing the
       project, Govt. agencies and consultants, Agencies / persons involved in technical
       administration of the project, Non-government Organization and Support Agencies. ,
       Besides this, the Manual can also be used as a guide for conducting training programs for
       the personnel from the above agencies.

1.7.   Limitations of the Manual

       The use of the Manual is limited to the World Bank Assisted Rural Water Supply and
       Sanitation Project with the project philosophy, design criteria and site-specific conditions
       of the single and multi-village schemes of four low income states namely, Assam, Bihar,
       Jharkhand and UP, , and of India. This manual is a step to start the project activities.
       Learning from the project implementation, the guidelines contained in this manual will be
       modified as necessary.

                         2. EXISTING WATER SUPPLY STATUS

2.1.   Assessment of Water Supply Situation

       In the project states, many of the habitations are provided with water supply with hand
       pumps, mini water supply scheme, piped water supply schemes with ground water source
       and a few piped water supply schemes with surface water source. These schemes have
       been executed by the State Technical Department and some of these schemes have been
       handed over to the respective GPs for O&M. Some of the rural water supply systems are
       not functional or working below their designed capacity due to the following reasons:

           Depletion/failure of sources
           Water quality problems
           Leakage in pipelines & OHSR
           Pump set failures and power problems
           Depletion of ground water tables
           Poor maintenance by GPs due to funds constraint, lack of technical knowhow and
            lack of interest
           Non Payment of user charges towards the water consumed by the Village
            Communities also no independent source of income.

       In view of above, there is a need to assess the status of the existing water supply system
       and to estimate the rehabilitation needs so that the systems will become fully functional.
       Rehabilitation works have to be identified to facilitate integration of the proposed works
       with the existing works or system. The strategy shall be to identify the rehabilitation need
       of schemes into immediate and long term. In the immediate needs, there is no major
       investment but small additions and proper management may revive the schemes. Some of
       the works that could be included shall be:

           Immediate repairs to pump sets
           Rectification of leakages in pipelines and valves
           Effective supervision of water supply works

       In the long-term, substantial additional investments are to be made to upgrade the
       existing system to the desired level. Some of the works that could be included are:

           Selection and provision of additional sources in the existing water supply schemes
            where quality and quantity of water availability is inadequate
           Modifications to existing pipelines/pumps or provisions of new pipelines/pumps in
            case of existing pipelines and pumps are inadequate to cater the designed water
            demand
           Strengthening/restoration of existing storage tanks or provision of new higher
            capacity tanks/additional tanks to cater for additional storage capacity to meet the
            designed demand
           Additions and extensions of the existing distribution system or provisions of new
            distribution system where there is no pipeline network or existing pipeline network is
            inadequate or pipes are rusted/broken

                Scope and extent of ground water recharging measures required for ensuring the
                 source sustainability
                Provision of House Connections with or without meters as the case may be (For large
                 MVS, 24x7 supply domestic meters are essential).

                                    3. WATER SUPPLY PRINCIPLES

       The chapter contains the basic design criteria of Single Village Water Supply Scheme
       (SVS) and Multi-Village Water Supply Scheme (MVS) to provide safe and adequate
       quantity of drinking water at individual household level.

3.1.   Design Period

       The rural water supply schemes are to be designed for ultimate period of 30 years.

       Design period requirement for various project components are given below:

       1: Water Source:
          a. Underground water:                    15 years
          b. Surface Source:                       30 Years
       2: Intake Works of surface Source:          30 years
       3: Raw Water Storage Tanks:                 30 years
       4: Pump house and civil works:              30 years
       5: Pumps and Machinery:                     15 years
       6: Water Treatment units including          15 years (With space for capacity to meet
          ground level clear water reservoir:      ultimate design period of 30 years)

       7: Elevated Clear Water Reservoir:          15 years
       8: Transmission Mains:                      30 years
       9: Distribution system:                     30 years
       10: Land:                                   30 years.

3.2.   Population Forecast

       Census Population of Year 2011 will be considered for forecasting the design population.
       The Base year shall be reckoned at commissioning of the schemes, prospective year will
       be 15th Year, and ultimate year will be 30th Year with respect of Base year. Ultimate year
       population will be used for design of intake, rising main, gravity main and distribution
       system. Prospective year population will be used for design of Water Treatment Plant
       (WTP), ground level/elevated clear water reservoir and pumps. In view of decreasing
       trend of rural population growth as noted in the Census 2011, the states will review this
       aspect and adopt a realistic district wise decadal growth rate for arriving at design
       population. References may be made to the various methods adopted in CPHEEO
       Manual and a sample presented at page 39-41 of 48 of Annexure-3 (Volume-2) of this
       Manual for projecting the population forecast.

3.3.   Per Capita Water Demand and Demand Projection

       For the projects, the rate of per capita demand of water shall be taken as 70 lpcd at
       consumer end. Bulk supplies to Institutions/Commercial/Industrial; if any, shall be
       considered extra. The water demand projection shall be done by multiplying the
       population projections with the per capita water demand for the respective year.

       (b) road network: Length and width of roads, road carpet details, road levels, culverts
       details, (c) storm water drains - cross section of all drains type of drains i.e. CC, Brick,
       etc.

3.6.   Preparation of GIS Base Map

       The base mapping in water and sanitation sector require the spatial present information
       which would be collected from different source at different scale for various field e.g. (i)
       administrative data (ii) project data including water sources using GPS (iii) water
       distribution network (iv) drainage network data (v) land base features like road network
       (vi) meteorological data (vii) social data etc. These data if required is correlated through
       field verification.

       The basic task would be to compile-update-organize the data, after relevant quarries and
       analysis in suitable GIS format, for generation of various thematic maps. The major task
       would be to integrate the spatial and non-spatial i.e. descriptive information of
       geographic feature in the data base management system (DBMS). The generated
       information will be subjected to analysis considering various problems viz. social,
       economic, ecological, environmental, administrative, weather, agricultural etc. with the
       help of Spatial Analysis functionality of GIS software.

3.6.1. Usefulness of GIS Maps in Comparison to Conventional Maps

       The advantage that GIS gives in comparison with conventional maps is that one can
       change the appearance of the information to any style as required. In conventional
       mapping a large amount of time and effort are spent to depict the physical features. The
       flexibility of GIS adds an extra dimension to this process, one can change the appearance
       depending on exactly what message is required to convey. Below are few advantage of
       having GIS maps over previous paper maps:

       1)   GIS maps are scalable, flexible and multiuser
       2)   It has advantage of integrating other secondary data
       3)   It is dynamic and reflects the changes over time and scale without much effort

Chapter-3                                                                                  Page 3-3
                                                                           Water Supply Principles


       4)   It is much easier to update changes in geographical features over the period
       5)   It can efficiently store the data of any scale. In real sense it can accommodate, stored
            and manipulate data.
       6)   It can provide the result of different analysis, linking with other features
       7)   GIS maps are cost effective resulting into greater efficiency
       8)   It provides better decision making by use of spatial analysis, network analysis, least
            cost method and analysis of hot spot etc.

       The concerned state department shall have to hire an agency carrying out the GIS base
       map preparation.

       Total station survey drawings shall be prepared on AutoCAD and converted to GIS. The
       Data Acquisition and processing for GIS base maps includes the data as described at para
       3.5 of this chapter.

       Various GIS software’s like: Map Info, Arc view and Micro station shall be used for
       preparation of GIS based Map.

3.7.   Attributes of Drinking Water

       The drinking water shall be:

           Free from disease producing organisms
           Colourless and clear
           Palatable, i.e. free from odours,
           Preferably cool
           Soft (not hard)
           Not causing scales or corrosion.
           Free from objectionable substances such as hydrogen sulphide, iron, and Manganese
            etc.
           Unpolluted by substances in quantities that are toxic or have adverse physiological
            effects and available in adequate quantities.

3.8.   Quality of Water – Physical, Chemical and Biological

       The objective of safe drinking water supply is to provide water free from pathogenic
       organisms, clear, palatable and free from undesirable taste and odour, of reasonable
       temperature, neither corrosive nor scale forming and free from minerals which could
       produce undesirable physiological effects.

       For indian conditions the physical and chemical quality of drinking water should be in
       accordance the recommended guidelines presented in Table 3-1.

3.8.1. Virological Quality

            Drinking water must essentially be free of human enteroviruses to ensure negligible risk
            of transmitting viral infection. Any drinking water supply subject to faecal contamination
            presents the risk of a viral disease to consumers. The following Table 3-3 shows the
            guideline criteria based upon likely viral content of source water and the degree of
            treatment. It is also necessary to disinfect the distribution system to guard against any
            contamination in distribution system.

                        Table 3-35: Recommended Virological Quality of Drinking Water

                          Type of Source                                         Recommended Treatment

3.8.2. Water Quality Standards and Significance-Norms for Acceptance

            The quality of drinking water affects health of the consumers because certain diseases
            and toxic chemical compounds may be transmitted by water. Experience has shown that
            community health and supplied water qualities are directly related to each other and that
            an improvement of water qualities of drinking water supply is followed by an
            improvement in the community’s health. Hence, the water supply systems shall provide
            water that is safe and available in adequate quantity. A water supply engineer is expected
            to know what diseases are waterborne, what toxic chemicals are and how they get in to
            water supplies.

       For water testing the samples should be collected in following manner:

       i) Properly labelled ultimate requirement of sampling bottles to avoid any error
       ii) No significant change in samples between time of collection and conducting water
            analysis and samples should be dispatched to lab under iced conditions as soon as
            practicable
       iii) Samples should be examined within 24 hours after collection
       iv) De-Chlorination of sample is a prerequisite for bacteriological examination
       v) No contamination should take place while collecting the sample prior to examination
            especially for bacteriological tests. For taking sample of water from a tap on
            distribution system, allow the water to run for 4 to 5 minutes thereby cleaning of
            service pipe
       vi) The water sample shall be collected and its data sheet should be filled up along with
            sample for onward submission to water quality testing lab.

       Quantity of Sample

       i) For physical and chemical examination – Two samples of two litters in colourless or
           pale green bottles
       ii) For bacteriological examination- 250ml sterilized glass bottles provided with ground
           glass stopper.

3.9.2. Water Quality Surveillance

       Laboratories with adequate facilities and manned by qualified personnel are essential for
       inspection and evaluation of the suitability of water supplies for public use as well as for
       controlling the water treatment process. The ultimate aim of laboratory examination of
       water is to ensure that potable water conforming to the drinking water standards is
       supplied to the consumers.

            a) Objective

                 i)     To ascertain the quality of water in various rural water supply schemes (tube
                        wells or surface source based) as well as in the distribution network.
                 ii)    To examine physical, chemical and bacteriological quality to establish whether
                        the drinking water is fit for human consumption and meets the standards as laid
                        down in IS:10500 [List of all concerned IS codes of water supply & sanitation
                        with latest amendments have been annexed at Annexure-13 (Volume-2)].

            b) Location for sampling

                 Selection of location for sampling should indicate true representative samples

                        Selected consumer location at random
                        In addition to above, raw water source and treated water should also be
                         analyzed in case of surface source based water supply schemes.

            c) Type of sampling

                 Generally, for drinking water quality monitoring, grab samples should be preferred.

            d) Frequency of sampling

                 Mainly depends on population served, size, source and type of the scheme is as
                 shown in Table 3-4.

3.9.3. Review of Source Water Quality

            After the water quality report is received the parameters may be compared with the
            standards and if the water satisfies the standards up to the tolerance limit the same source
            can be accepted. If water parameters does not satisfy the prescribed standard, suitable

                                                                           Water Supply Principles


       treatment shall be recommended. If fluorides/ Arsenic / Iron and any other Heavy Metals
       are present in excess of permissible limits then other source should be explored. For
       further details on water quality CPHEEO Manual may be visited.

       Adequately equipped analytical laboratory with competent analysts is an important and
       an integral part of any water quality monitoring and surveillance programme. The
       analytical determinations of different physical, chemical and bacteriological parameters
       must be carried out most efficiently and accurately. However, the laboratory
       infrastructure need shall necessarily depend upon the level of analysis desired, location
       and other support facilities available.

       Realizing the need to institutionalize water quality monitoring and surveillance system,
       Government of India in Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission has formulated
       an implementation plan based on three-tier structure or catchment area approach where
       existing resources available with grass root level education and technical institutions
       would be utilized. In case of need , these institutions should further be strengthened by
       providing additional resources.

       a) Village Level

            Water Quality Surveillance (WQS) must exist at the village level. Water quality
            monitoring is a felt need of the people, as in rural areas they perceive water which is
            clean, palatable and free from odour as safe quality water, though it may contains
            chemicals up to rejection limits. To make the WQS programme more effective, field
            kits for both chemical and bacteriological analysis are to be provided to all 10+2
            schools having science stream or in the primary rural Health Centres. These field kits
            would mainly indicate the presence of turbidity, pH, hardness, chloride, fluoride, iron,
            residual chlorine and bacteriological quality. The field kit will be basically meant for
            qualitative assessment of water and would help to identify unsafe drinking water
            supply system immediately. In case, water is unfit for drinking, samples would be
            sent for detailed investigations to the district labs.

       b) District Level

            One Lab at each District which can provide actual values of various water quality
            parameters is required,

       c) State Level

            One State Level water quality testing laboratory is required which has to be
            considered as apex institute to decide actual values of the quality parameters in case
            of discrepancies between values intimated by more than one laboratory.

            Further, for facilitating effective water surveillance programme, a mobile water
            testing laboratory should also be proposed under the control of RWS&S as this would
            help in identification of source of contamination as well as for identifying new
            potential water sources, besides it would also impart training to village and district
            level laboratory staff. The mobile laboratory would be fully equipped to carry out on
            the spot analysis of water and would be equipped with small fridge, hot air oven,

            water bath and incubator. This will also help in assessing water quality during fares
            and at the time of epidemics in the area.

            To summarize, Water testing laboratory should be stationed at Divisional
            Level/District Level; However Water testing Kits should be available at Gram
            Panchayat Level.

3.10. Types of Sources for Water Supply

       After estimating the required quantity of raw water for the proposed water supply scheme
       it is necessary to identify a nearby water source / sources, which may be able to supply
       the required quantity and quality of water. If the available sources don’t supply required
       quality and quantity of water, then it is necessary to choose another water source at some
       other distant location. Another important consideration should be the long term
       sustainability of the source.

       Nature provides water through various sources which can be grouped into:

       a) Surface sources such as Ponds, Lakes, Rivers, Streams, Canals, Storage reservoir and
          Oceans
       b) Sub Surface Sources such as Bore wells, Open wells, Springs, Infiltration wells and
          Infiltration galleries.

3.10.1. Surface Waters

       Schemes based on surface water sources shall be designed only where:

           Ground water is insufficient or having quality problem such as fluorides and / arsenic
            contamination (Higher than the permissible limit). When ground water source is not
            sustainable based on quantity adequacy to meet the design period demand or on the
            likelihood of gradual water quality deterioration as per available data of the area
           Since the cluster of villages requiring surface water has to be large to make the
            scheme viable, some en-route villages (Which do not have quality problem) can also
            be clubbed with the surface scheme. However, with increasing number of villages,
            communication problems may affect operation and maintenance.

3.10.2. Artificial Impounding Reservoirs (Storage and Sedimentation Tanks)

       In case of rivers, canals, dams and lakes necessary permission to withdraw required
       quantity of water must be obtained from the respective authority. Water if drawn from
       canals which need annual closure on account of maintenance or otherwise construction of
       impounding reservoir to meet the requirement of water for that period will have to be
       provided. Impounding reservoir will also be needed, in case of non-perennial rivers and
       or where river discharge reduces considerably during dry weather to meet the full
       requirement of the water supply scheme.

       Components” may be referred.

                                                                         Water Supply Principles


3.11. Types of Water Supply Schemes

       As per the Project proposals all water supply schemes are classified into following four
       categories:

           Single Habitation Schemes (SHS)
           Single GP Scheme (SGS)-these would have more than one habitations but all within
            the same GP
           Small MVS-covering a few GPs (typically 2-4)
           Large MVS- covering many GPS (typically 5 or more).

3.11.1. Single Habitation/GP Water Supply Schemes (SHS/SGS)

       The piped water schemes (PWS) will be provided with local ground water source such as
       deep bore wells. The schemes will involve pumping from the bore well, construction of
       service reservoirs and piped distribution networks for providing house connections to all
       households. The small schemes will adopt disinfection with addition of bleaching powder
       solution. For all SHS/SGS, house connection cost will be included in project with saddle,
       ferrule and 10 m long MDPE pipe; however GI pipe will be used only in rocky strata.
       Surface source from the nearby canal / river if available can also be used with provision
       for treatment arrangement as prescribed by CPHEEO manual in case where ground water
       is not there of desired quality and quantity. Solar power will be provided wherever power
       is not available or is unreliable.

3.11.2. Small and Large Multi Village Water Supply Schemes (MVS)

       Where the locally available ground water has quality and quantity problems, multi village
       water supply schemes with surface water as sources like river, ponds, lake etc. will be
       proposed where the water will be conveyed from long distances. These schemes may
       cover more than one GP and will involve construction of water treatment plant, service
       reservoirs for each GP/Habitation and piped distribution networks to provide house
       connections to all households. All MVS schemes will use disinfection mechanism based
       on chlorination systems. Bulk flow meters (For details refer Chapter-10 (Volume-1) on
       “Distribution System”) will be provided at the inlets of each village/GP’s OHTs. For all
       MVS also, house connection cost will be included in project with saddle, ferrule and 10 m
       long MDPE pipe; however GI pipe may be used only in rocky strata with appropriate size
       of pipe (15 mm) and ferrule.

       Wherever high cost large MVS is proposed to serve peri-urban, large villages and large
       number of GPs, all households will be provided with metered connections and cost
       included in the project which will ultimately lead to 24x7 water services. Wherever
       consumer meters are provided these will conform to latest IS standards and will be
       provided with 5 years guarantee. Gaseous chlorinating plant can be considered for Large
       MVS ensuring the gaseous chlorine cylinders chain for smooth and adequate supply.

       There would be stand-by arrangements of pumps as per the Guidelines of CPHEEO
       Manual on Water Supply & Treatment. Dedicated power supply will be provided for all
       the large MVS. Provision of diesel generating sets will be considered carefully in view of
       the high cost of diesel.

3.11.3. Pumping Hours

       Ground Water: 8-16 Hours of pumping shall be proposed and Surface Source Based
       Schemes: 16-22 Hours of pumping shall be proposed.

3.12. Source Selection

3.12.1. Ground Water

       Scientific selection of water sources is more important for the project area since the
       ground water table has been depleting very fast. Hence, the locations selected for water
       sources shall be amenable for recharging ground water into the aquifers. The presence of
       underground fractures in the geological formations will encourage seepage of water into
       the aquifers. The deeper the fractures better will be the yield. Hence, while doing the
       geophysical survey for selection of location of source (Bore well), particular attention is
       required to this aspect. The technology has progressed and now there are more reliable
       methods for conducting geological and geophysical investigations with instruments
       working on Very Low Frequency (VLF).

       The exploration methods that can be adopted to locate the ground water are:

           Geological Methods: Demarcating the boundary between lithological units, faults,
            fractures, fissures, formation characteristics, lineaments & dykes, intrusive and shear
            zones
           Remote Sensing Techniques: interpretation of satellite images to locate lineaments
            and other structural discontinuities, mapping of various hydromorphic unit,
            vegetation, soil and land use and land cover categories
           Geophysical Methods: Surface geophysical surveys using electrical resistivity,
            electromagnetic, seismic and magnetic methods to delineate the weak and water-
            saturated zone. These methods include Geo-physical exploration and geomagnetic
            method.

       For more details, Para 5.2.4.3/Page 57 to 61 CPHEEO Manual on Water Supply &
       Treatment may be referred.

3.12.2. Surface Source

       For detailed information on source selections, Para 5.2.7 Pages 96 -98 of CPHEEO
       Manual on Water Supply & Treatment may be referred:

       The selection of Water sources shall depend upon the quality and sustainability of water
       on long term basis.

3.13. Assessment of Yield

       Ground Water/Sub-surface Source: An accurate assessment of the yield of the source is
       essential to decide which source can be dependable. The yield of bore wells is to be
       assessed preferably in the lowest seasonal water level conditions. Care should be taken
       that the water pumped out is led away from the source and does not re-enter the source.
       The drawdown and discharge are measured and the results tabulated from which the yield

Chapter-3                                                                                 Page 3-14
                                                                               Water Supply Principles


             is assessed. Bore well yield is assessed on the basis of sand free discharge obtained at
             around 4.5m drawdown (Refer IS: 2800). The safe yield for pumping plant design is
             taken as 60% of assessed yield. For detailed procedure of assessment of yield, Chapter-6
             (Volume-1) on “Technical Guidelines-Water Supply Components” and IS: 2800 Part-
             2 may be referred.

             Surface Source

             In the case of canals, the levels at which water can be made available and the quantum of
             water and the period for which the canal is flowing are used to assess the sizes of various
             components of the water supply scheme. Adequate storage of raw water for the period of
             canal closure is provided.

             In case of other surface sources namely springs/small streams (Gadhera) shall normally
             be measured for three consecutive years of the driest season and lowest discharge shall be
             adopted. If summer discharge (April to May) for a particular scheme is available for one
             year only, but it has to be prepared because of urgency, then only 50% of driest discharge
             should be taken for utilisation. If the data is available for two years then 75% of
             minimum discharge may be taken. (Source: As per prevalent practice in Uttarakhand).

3.14. Treatment

             Ground Water

             Water source with presence of Fluoride and Arsenic shall be rejected and safe water
             source meeting quality and quantity requirement shall be selected. Treatment for
             disinfection is provided.

             Surface Water

             It may require conventional treatment consisting of sedimentation, filtration and
             disinfection. The treatment proposed for water shall be such that it is easy to manage the
             O&M by the village community. The following need to be considered wherever WTP is
             required:

                 Slow Sand Filters (For details, refer Chapter-8 (Volume-I)
                 Rapid Sand Filters and dual media: declining rate will be provided for MVS
                 Use of Tube Settlers instead of clari-floculators for capacity up to 30 MLD for
                  MVS8
                 Roof over filter beds will not be provided to all filters
                 Chemical dosing: dosing pumps will be provided in WTP
                 Preferred instrumentation in WTP: Alternative flow, measurement with calibrated
                  weirs
                 Manometers for loss of head
                 Operation of valves - manual, pneumatic and electrical – however manual operation
                  is preferred up to 30 MLD
                 Recycle of back wash water shall be provided.

       a)   Specific Treatment Plants

            Suitable Eco-friendly RO plants for treatment of water with iron contamination
            problems can be provided wherever required. However to ensure sustainability, the
            maintenance contracts for these plants will include supply, installation and repairs or
            replacement for the guarantee period of five years.

            Disinfection of drinking water: It shall be carried out by Gaseous chlorinators for
            large MVS (Surface source based). Bleaching Powder dozers will be used for
            SHS/SGS and or on-site generation of Hypo solution with electronic dosing pumps
            as described under Chapter-8 (Volume-1) on “Water Treatment”. Since the
            chlorinators, electro chlorinators and other such disinfection equipment are quite
            often found out of order even in urban areas, all equipment like, bleaching powder
            dozers, electro-chlorinators and gaseous chlorinators shall be procured as per design
            provided in DPR. Contract shall include operation and maintenance by the contractor
            for at least 05 years.

       b) Alternatively

            Promotion of Non-Conventional Water treatment technologies: (Cascade Aeration +
            Baffle/Pipe Mixing +Gravel Bed Flocculation + Tube settler +Filtration); The Baffle
            Mixing and Gravel Bed Flocculation have been the alternatives of Flash Mixing and
            Flocculation. There is no electro/mechanical components involved in Baffle mixing
            and Gravel bed flocculation, hence leads to energy saving as compared to Flash
            Mixing & Flocculation.

3.15. Transmission Lines and Rising Mains

       Conveyance of water may be by gravity flow and/or pressure. Pipelines used for
       transmission of water, normally follow the profile of the ground surface closely.

       Gravity pipelines have to be laid below the hydraulic gradient. All pumping mains will be
       designed using the concept of economical size and class of pipe checked for surge
       pressures as provided in the CPHEEO manual.

       Common terms of pressure

           Working Pressure: Working pressure may be defined as the actual pressure (including
            abnormal pressure such as water hammer) to which the pipe will be subjected during
            its operation
           Test Pressure: Test Pressure may be defined as the maximum pressure, which the pipe
            can withstand without any leakage when tested for hydrostatic pressure in accordance
            with the standard methods of testing
           Interrelation ship between the above mentioned 02 Pressures varies with the material
            of pipe which can be referred in the respective IS Code.

3.15.1. Pumps

       Pumps shall be provided for all ground water based schemes/surface water based

       Pump Room

       Pump Room is provided to accommodate the pump sets, accessories of pump sets,
       electrical meters, pressure gauges, chlorination plants and any other materials. The Pump
       Room should be planned considering space allocation, convenient placement and other
       requirement for the above. For more details, Chapter-7 (Volume-1) on “Pumping
       Station-Electro-Mechanical Appliances/Equipment” may be referred.

3.15.2. Pipe Appurtenances

       In order to isolate the pipeline sections for tests, inspections, cleaning, repairs and
       efficient functioning of the distribution network system, a number of appurtenances such
       as sluice valves, scour valves, air valves, reflux valves, expansion joints, anchorages etc.
       are provided at suitable places in the pipe network.

       Type of valves: (a) Gate valves will be used for online. (b) BF Valves for control of
       inlet to service reservoirs and control on branches of MVS; (c) Air Valves: IS: 14845;
       and (d) Dynamic valves wherever required. Dismantling joints will be provided for all
       Gate valves and BF valves.

3.15.3. Service Reservoirs

       Capacity of Service Reservoir shall be calculated keeping in view the pumping hours and
       hence the realistic availability of electricity and water supply hours. Normally in rural
       areas electricity is available in shifts on rotation basis. Pumping hours will vary as per
       availability of electricity. However rate of pumping shall never exceed the safe yield
       (60% of Tested Yield) in case of ground water sources. Hence, before fixing the capacity
       of Service Reservoir, the required capacity should be worked out to balance the pumping
       rate and supply rate for worst-case scenario on the basis of mass curve subject to
       minimum of 8 hours of average daily demand. The staging of tank shall be kept such that
       the minimum residual pressure at the farthest point in the village is at least 7m. If
       elevated lands are available at a reasonable distance, ground level reservoirs can also be
       proposed for storage of water.
Chapter-3                                                                                 Page 3-17

       Water Level Indicator in Service Reservoirs: Float type water level indicator will be
       used for SHS/SGS and Float type /ultrasonic water level indicator will be provided for
       MVS.

       Stairs: Stairs to go up will be in RCC dog legged/spiral and stairs to enter OHSR will be
       in SS/RCC/Aluminium. All hand rails will be in RCC.

3.15.4. Distribution System

       As 100% individual house connections are proposed then pipe network in the form of
       loop system be preferred as far as possible.

       System design shall ensure that water is supplied to all households simultaneously
       without the need for operation of sluice valves. Depending on topography of the village
       the distribution system is divided into high level or low level zones or separate feeders
       from service reservoir are laid for high level and low level areas. Wherever difference
       between residual heads at households located high level and low level areas is more than
       5 meters separate feeders shall be provided directly from the service reservoir to the high
       level and low level areas. Orifice plate may be provided to reduce excessive residual
       heads for supply to low lying areas where separate feeders cannot be provided.

       For SHS/SGS, the distribution system may be designed for supply of 6 hours/day with
       peak factor of 4 or for supply of 8hrs/ day with peak factor of three. In MVS the supply
       will be for ≥ 8 Hours/day taking peak factor of 3 and with terminal pressure of 7 meters
       at household. The distribution system is designed using Loop network and whatever
       commercially manufactured sizes are arrived for the required flows and residual heads
       the same pipes are used. Minimum size of distribution system should be of 63 mm (OD)
       which may be cross checked so as to ensure minimum velocity of 0.6 m/s to prevent
       silting in distribution system. This criteria of minimum velocity as 0.6 m/s be cross
       checked for all other pipe sizes also.

       Depth and Width of Trench required for laying the pipe

       The pipes shall be laid with a minimum cover of 1.0 m. However, in narrow streets where
       deeper excavation may cause danger to the stability of foundations of adjoining
       structures, depth may be reduced to 60 cm with protective measure to safeguard pipe line.
       The width of trench required to lay pipes shall be outer diameter+30 cm and wider trench
       shall only be excavated near the coupler joint. Practice of measuring the uniform width of
       trench based on wider trench width at points of collar joints shall be discouraged. So that
       cost of the excavation could be reduced.

3.15.5. House Connections

       All house connections must be provided only on the distribution system pipes and no
       connections will be given from the rising mains or bulk conveyance/feeder mains. There
       will be no public taps since all households are to be provided with house connections and
       their cost, with saddle, ferrule and 10 m long MDPE pipe will be included in project. In
       case of reorganization, rehabilitation, revitalization schemes, existing connections will be
       replaced with new house connections. This is to prevent illegal connections and loss of
       water.

Chapter-3                                                                                 Page 3-18

3.15.6. Pipe Material

             Pipe represents a large proportion of the capital investment in a water supply scheme.
             The pipe material to be used in rising, transmission and distribution network shall be
             selected not only from the point of view of durability but also on life and overall cost
             which includes beside the pipe cost the installation and maintenance cost necessary to
             ensure the required function and performance of the pipe line throughout its design life
             time. Also selection of material and class of pipe should be based on specific design
             requirements including the local condition and its use. However, it will be governed by
             State Pipe Policy9.For further detailed analysis for selection of pipe material (refer to
             CPHEEO Manual on Water Supply & Treatment Clause 6.3.1 & Table 6.7).

             In case of Ductile Iron pipe, appropriate pressure class of pipe will be chosen depending
             on the total head including static head (pressure) and likely water hammer head as per
             design. Normally DI pipe is used in rising (pumping) mains.

             In case of DI Pipe with welded flange K-9 pipe shall be used. K-7 or K-9 pipes may be
             used depending on total head including water hammer, size of pipe and service conditions
             (Refer IS: 8329). For gravity/feeder mains, HDPE Pipe (PE 100) Class 6 Kg/cm2 and for
             distribution network PVC Class (6 Kg/cm2)/HDPE pipe (6 Kg/cm2) are preferred. GI
             pipes can be used in rocky strata only but it is vulnerable to corrosion and encrustation.

                  Preferred pipe material for pipe connections in Service Reservoir: DI – K 7 is
                   preferred for all pipe connections. However State Pipe Policy shall prevail.

3.15.7. Flow Meters

             Consumer Water Meters and Bulk flow Meters: In most of the water supply schemes
             in India complaints regarding excess readings as well as none functioning of meters are
             reported. Details regarding quality of meter as well as on installation of meter have been
             given at Chapter-10 (Volume-1) on “Distribution System”. Problems associated with
             metering arise particularly in the case of intermittent supply which is common in India.
             Many types of meters register air flows, which can lead to over-registration of
             consumption, especially in systems with intermittent supply, when water supply is re-
             established and the incoming water pushes air through the meters. Some types of meters
             become less accurate as they age and under-register consumption thus leading to lower
             revenues, unless they are being replaced regularly. Deliberate or incidental occurrence of
             human errors is also quite common in meter reading and billing. In several schemes
             consumer bills are based on monthly flat fees. Rational basis will be to issue bills based
             on actual consumption. Due to non-functional meters, billing is not based on real-time
             consumption but based on estimates of past or predicted consumption which results in
             lack of control over the water consumption. The new water meters for the project will
             have confirmed to IS: 779 to be tested through a third party and the supplier has to give a
             guarantee of five years and maintain the water meters during the guarantee period. Since
             most of the GPs have no meter readers on their rolls, the task of meter reading and billing
             can be included in the contract for supply, installation and maintenance of meters for 5
             years.

       The Bulk flow meters will conform to IS: 2373, with 5 years guarantee. The scope of
       work for Supplier will be supply and installation including repairs or replacement up to
       the guarantee period of five years. Since most of the GPs have no meter reader on their
       rolls, the task of meter reading and billing can be included in the contract for supply,
       installation and maintenance of meters for 05 years.

3.16. Provision of SCADA

       Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is a computer aided system which
       collects, stores and analyses the data on all aspects of O&M. SCADA will be provided in
       all large MVS, while for small MVS simple automation shall be provided. The details are
       provided at Chapter -11(Volume-1) on “SCADA and Automation”.

3.17. Provision of Solar System

       Alternative power supply for meeting the requirement during power failure has been
       suggested in the PIP. It may not be possible to provide total energy demand for MVS
       through solar system. In case of SHS/SGS where the power requirement is small
       alternative energy source could be a solar power system. The details of the solar system
       for small installation have been furnished in Annexure-09 (Volume-2). The solar system
       shall provided based on the technical guidelines of Ministry of New and Renewal Energy
       under Rajiv Gandhi Solar Mission.

                        4. PRELIMINARY PROJECT REPORT

       This chapter describes the preparation of Preliminary Project Report (PPR) for a rural
       water supply scheme, which is essential to arrive at a techno-economical option in
       consultation with the rural community.

       Before preparation of PPR, Water Safety and Security Plans are also to be prepared.

4.1.   Water Security Plan

4.1.1. Objective

       The objective to prepare and implement of water security plan is to ensure drinking
       water security through measures of improving/augmenting the existing water sources
       and conjunctive use of ground water, surface water and rain water harvesting based on
       village water budgeting. The plan must be prepared in accordance with NRDWP
       guidelines.

4.1.2. Integrated Approach

       1.   In order to achieve water security integrated approach shall be adopted by revival of
            traditional systems (Existing dug well if any, hand pump, tanks, ponds etc.),
            conjunctive use of surface and ground water. Rain water harvesting both at the
            community level and at the household level will ensure in reduction of risk and
            vulnerability. Conjunctive use means the use of existing sources for other than
            drinking, cooking requirements
       2.   For all ground water based water supply schemes (existing/new), ground water
            recharging mechanism should constitute an integral part of the system design (as
            suggested in NRDWP Guidelines-2013, Para 5 )
       3.   Excess rain water at the household and community level should be recharged into
            the aquifer wherever feasible as per Chapter-12 (Volume-1) on “Ground water
            recharge”, which will not only improve ground water quality but will also ensure
            its adequacy
       4.   Factors which have contributed to the rapid deterioration of the water supply
            facilities resulting in non-availability of the designed service are: (i) over
            dependence on ground water causing depletion of ground water levels which also
            increases the incidence of quality problems (ii) sources going dry leading to systems
            become defunct due to competing demands of ground water from other sectors (iii)
            poor recharge (iv) large scale deforestation (iv) lack of protection of catchment
            areas (v) heavy emphasis on creation of new infrastructure instead of adequate
            attention to the maintenance of existing systems (vi) lack of ownership of water
            supply systems and sources by the rural community and poor operation and
            maintenance (viii) neglect of traditional water sources, systems and management
            practices
       5.   Various studies indicate that current farming practices waste at least 60 % of the
            water. Thus, there is enormous scope for water budgeting and social regulation of
            water uses for ensuring fresh water availability for drinking on a sustainable basis.

Chapter-4                                                                               Page 4-1
                                                                        Preliminary Project Report


4.1.3. Community Participation

       It is necessary that the water security plan be prepared with the full participation of the
       community. The demographic and physical features of the village shall be captured
       during the preparation of the preliminary project report. Other information such as: (i)
       ownership of traditional water sources (ii) information regarding existing condition
       including need for additional works, shall be gathered during the visit to the village and
       consultation with the community. The community capability shall be assessed along with
       their desire/need about the project.

4.1.4. Preparation of Water Sources Inventory

       (i)    Hand Pumps

              This will include details of hand pumps [India Mark-II& III, shallow hand pumps]
              their location, the water quality based on test results, usages of water drawn from
              them, and their present condition. Depending upon the water quality as per available
              test results, the identification of the hand pumps shall be done, which can be used as
              an alternative source of water supply during temporary failures of the proposed
              piped water supply system. Such failures do occur on account of disruption of
              electricity; when for a few days the community can draw water from these sources.
              It is, therefore, necessary to identify such hand pumps and the works required to
              make them useful for acting as alternative sources of water supply during such
              disruptions.

       (ii)   Dug Wells/Sanitary Wells

              All dug wells (Pucca and Kuccha) should be inspected, especially those which do
              not go dry during summers and their location, depth of water in the well, condition
              of well structure, present usage of water drawn from them and any appurtenance
              provided for facilitating the drawal of water etc. be noted and water quality be got
              tested of such wells. Any well which could be categorized as sanitary well and
              whose water is used for drinking also need additional attention for deciding repair
              and modification to make them alternative source of water supply at the time of
              temporary failures for ensuring village water security. The sanitary well should have
              followings:

              1.   Proper masonry lining although the depth of well
              2.   Well should have raised platform for drawing water and bathing on that
                   platform should not be allowed
              3.   There should be proper drainage all around the well and waste water should
                   not be allowed to stagnate near the well
              4.   Wall should have proper covering so that dust and leave etc. do not enter into
                   well
              5.   There should be arrangement for drawing of water with wheel pulley
              6.   The well water is disinfected with pot chlorinator
              7.   Some villages may have step wells, baories and other traditional water
                   structures which according to the community information might have helped
                   in providing water during severe droughts. Works necessary to protect these
                   be identified and provided for in the water security plan.

       (iii) Village Ponds and Tanks

               Details of all such ponds and tanks [Ponds with pucca structures] to be gathered
               showing their locations, their usages for bathing and washings, sources for drinking
               and bathing of animals be recorded as in most of the villages these meets domestic
               water demand other than that for drinking .The need for their repairs specially of
               those which do not go dry during summers and are owned by the community be
               identified. Some of these may need de-silting, repairs and interception of village
               waste water to avoid their pollution.

       (iv) Springs

               Some villages may have springs also which provide drinking water for a large part
               of the year. The quality of water be got checked and in case it is free from any
               harmful constituents; these need to be protected and their water should be
               disinfected for any bacterial pollution. Their summer discharge is measured.

       (v)     Rivers and Streams

               Some of these may be perennial and some seasonal, their location distance from the
               village habitation, discharge during summers and the water quality be recorded. In
               some systems these may the sources for raw water supply on account of which
               necessary intake works will be constructed. The community may be using these for
               various purposes specially if for irrigation, there should be an understanding with
               the concerned authority about the minimum flow which will be kept at the intake
               point all the year round and the understanding with the concerned authorities such
               as owner and State Pollution Board so that no upstream pollution will be caused.

       (vi) Dams and Reservoirs

               At times some of the proposed water supply works may draw their raw water
               requirement from such sources. It is necessary that there should be an agreement in
               between the concerned authority to ensure required quantity of water supply even
               during the driest period; since these works also supplies water for irrigation and
               there is conflict regarding meeting water demand of various sectors especially
               during the drought period. The minimum water demand for the project area to be
               met for present demand and future water demand as well.

4.1.5 Monitoring

       The detailed inventory of various existing water structure will make it possible to work
       out plans so as to rehabilitate them to ensure water security in case of any break down in
       the system. As such it is necessary to monitor the status of various water structures.
       Observations pertaining to discharge, quality, depth of water table etc. should be taken
       once in a year at a fixed period so that the results could be compared and any
       deterioration in the utility could be timely detected for remedial measures.

            Ground water used for freshwater drinking supplies can be easily overexploited by
            other competing users like irrigation, industry, etc. When this happens it can become
            contaminated with salt water, fluoride or other gynogenic contaminants which make it

            unsuitable for use. Water available in rivers and lakes is sometimes polluted, making it
            harmful to plants, animals and people. Sustainability and safe sanitation practices are
            the forerunner for safe drinking water supply. Thus for any comprehensive water
            security plans, the preparation and implementation of the sustainability of source is very
            much required.

4.1.6 Sustainability Measures

       Introduction

       Water sustainability mean is the water availability to meet both current and future
       requirement. Sustainability measures include the following two main factors:

       a.      Withdrawals of large amounts of ground water that overstress the aquifers be
               prohibited
       b.      Fixed pumping schedule that minimizes negative impacts of over pumping of
               aquifers should be clearly adhered to.

       Along with the above measure there is need for increasing the recharge to ground water
       system with the following: (For more details, refer Chapter-12 (Volume-1 ) on “Ground
       Water Recharge”)

       1.      Through injection well
       2.      Recharge shafts/wells by tapping storm water.
       3.      Rapid infiltration ponds

4.1.8 Checklist/ Guidelines on Sustainability of Village Drinking Water Supply Schemes

       The climate, topography, geology, hydrology, hydrogeology, geomorphology, source
       water availability including its quality as well as legal control and social and economic
       factors govern the efficiency of various types of ground water recharging interventions
       that provide strength and sustainability to rural drinking water supply schemes.

       Various factors that influence Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) are listed below:

       1.     Influence of climatic Hydrology &Geo-morphology
       2.     Understanding of the components of Water Balance of area under recharge
       3.     Hydro-geomorphological factors
       4.     Geological conditions
       5.     Hydro-geological conditions
       6.     Source water availability
       7.     Ground water level data

4.1.9 Water Balance Study

       Recharge is rather difficult to be measured directly. Setting up of a quantitative water
       balance study is the only approach to understand annual availability and distribution of
       source water over time and space.

       The water balance is thus to be determined over watershed and for a village. Regarding
       methodology, it may be mentioned that the amount of water that seeps into watershed is
       the difference between rainfall that a watershed would receive and the sum total of water
       as evapotranspiration, surface runoff; base flow and component of change in storage that
       goes out of a watershed. Whereas rainfall and run-off is measured with use of rain-
       gauges &river-gauges, the base-flow is determined using stream hydrographic data.
       Evaporimeters are used for measuring evaporation. The change in ground water storage
       can be determined with use of ground water level and aquifer specific yield data
       determined from aquifer pumping tests of unconfined ground water. Similarly for


Chapter-4                                                                                 Page 4-7

       confined ground water the data on change in piezometric surface & aquifer storage
       coefficient is needed for calculating change in storage of confined aquifers.

       The recharge would depend upon amount of evaporation and silted-up sediment volumes
       of reservoirs. The studies would demand following methods to be used:

       1.   Measuring periodic water level changes in storage reservoir & ponds and calculating
            volumes of water.
       2.   Monitoring of ground water levels through observation wells & calculating recharge
            with use of data on specific yield of aquifers in the vicinity of water conservation and
            harvesting structures.

            To make more clarity, the flow diagram of preparation of Water Security Plan has
            been depicted as below:

       wise water security map.

4.2.   Water Safety Plan

       A Water Safety Plan will also be a part of this village water security plan using scientific
       planning tools i.e. remote sensing / GIS in conjunction with watershed. This water safety
       plan can be prepared specific to a scheme as per standard methods, prescribed for it. The
       water safety plans are primarily made to prevent contamination of water source, to treat
       the water to reduce or remove the contaminants. Developing a water safety plan would
       involve conducting hazard analysis of the water supply scheme, identification of the
       control measures, defining operational limits, establishing monitoring system,
       establishing corrective actions and incident response, establishing record keeping and
       validation and verification.

       A copy of safety plan is to be attached with the PPR. The Project is designed for
       equitable water distribution through emphasis on 100% house connections with adequate
       quantity and pressure in the habitations covered. Infrastructure investments under the
       Project cover not only new but also rehabilitation of schemes, and strengthening and
       recharging of the water sources.

       In a demand based approach, the village expresses its demand for a water supply scheme.
       Preliminary discussions have to be held with the community about the likely water source
       for the project. Based on the likely water source, alternate options have to be given to the
       community based on capital cost and O&M cost. This is done by rough cost estimates of
       various components.

4.3.   Reconnaissance Survey

       A support agency consisting of social scientist, consulting engineer, geologist and the
       community shall go round the village for collecting the data required for preparation of
       the PPR. During the reconnaissance, the functioning of the existing water supply scheme
       is studied and the rehabilitation needs are noted. For the proposed scheme, the location of
       the water source is to be identified with the consent of the community. The ground water
       availability and quality of water may be ascertained by studying the water table in the
       existing sources and discussion with the community. Then the population estimation is to
       be done in consultation with the community. The future population may be assessed
       considering all the possible expansions.

       A preliminary survey is to be done to assess geographical plans, contour plans and other
       related geographical and hydrological details. The site inspection should be made to
       identify the units of water works such as treatment units, service reservoirs, pumping
       main, distribution system. The highest ground level, the lowest ground level and lengths
       of various components of pipeline have to be approximately assessed. During the
       reconnaissance the nature of terrain and soil condition are noted and alignment for the
       drain leading to the disposal point is also identified and noted on the map. The source of
       power supply, financial aspects of the community is to be assessed. At the end of the
       reconnaissance, the extent of rehabilitation and scope of the proposed scheme along with
       the concept shall be formulated.

       After collecting the field data, approximate sizes are arrived at an approximate cost for
       investment and O&M costs are worked out for various technology options for providing
       water supply, sanitation, roads and drains. Approximate rates for pipelines, water storage
       tanks, filtration units, ground water recharging structures are considered while preparing
       the line estimates based on the previous experience. Hence, a near reasonable line
       estimates for capital cost and O&M cost can be arrived at so that the community can take
       an informal decision. After that a PPR is prepared consisting of the executive summary,
       salient features, line estimates, capital cost and O&M cost for various technology options.
       The PPR will be presented to the community in a Gram Sabha, where various technology
       options will be discussed and the community will choose the most suitable options which
       are affordable to them (with respect to water supply and village sanitation). The land
       required for the implementation of the scheme should also be identified and acquisition if
       necessary shall be completed before detailed scheme report is too finalized.

6.2.3. Soil Investigation

       For selection of type and design of foundation of the various structures such as reservoirs,
       buildings and pipe lines, sub-soil investigation is required. For foundation design of such
       structures trial pits shall be taken to a depth of 2 to 3 meters to assess the nature of soil.
       Bearing capacity of soil is determined by field tests and laboratory tests. Soil samples are
       collected and tested in laboratory to correlate the results obtained in the field. The safe
       bearing capacity (SBC) is the maximum pressure (load) which the soil can carry safely
       without the risk of shear failure.

       The trial pits for pipelines shall be of size 1m x 1m and for a depth of about 1m to note
       the nature of soil preferably at 500 m intervals.

       The SBC of soil may be determined by Two Methods:

             Laboratory Test
             Field Test

6.2.3.1.Laboratory Tests

       The SBC from laboratory test parameters may be determined through Undisturbed Soil
       (UDS) samples (IS 6043- determination of bearing capacity of shallow foundation). The
       other laboratory tests are: Unconsolidated un-drained tri-axial shear test (As per IS: 2720
       (Part-11)); consolidated drained direct shear test (As per IS: 2720 (Part-13)) and
       unconfined compression test (As per IS: 2720 (Part-10)).

6.2.3.2.Field Tests

       Field test can be performed by the following three methods:

            Standard Penetration Tests (SPT): conducted in the boreholes at every change in
             stratum or at intervals of not more than 1.5 m whichever is less. The tests are
             conducted by connecting a split spoon sampler to a rod and driving it by 45 cm using
             a 63.5 kg hammer falling freely from a height of 75 cm. The tests are conducted in
             accordance with IS: 2131
            Plate Load test (PLT): Shall be conducted in a pit at an elevation of the proposed
             foundation level under the worst estimated conditions by using square or circular
             plate of 300 mm, 450 mm or 750 mm size. The test plate shall be placed over a fine
             sand layer of maximum thickness 5 mm, so that the centre of plate coincides with the
             centre of reaction girder/beam, with the help of a plumb and bob and horizontally
             levelled by a spirit level to avoid eccentric loading. A minimum seating pressure of
             70 g/cm2 shall be applied and removed before starting the load test. Apply the load to
             soil in cumulative equal increments up to 1 kg/cm2 or one-fifth of the estimated
             ultimate bearing capacity, whichever is less

       For more details IS: 1888 may be referred.

            Static Cone Penetration Test (SCPT): The static cone penetration is a specialized
             penetration test to obtain a profile of soil resistance with depth. The test was
             conducted in general accordance with IS: 4968 (Part III).

6.3.   Basic Design factors

           Population forecast: Refer Chapter- 3 Para 3.2
           Per capita demand: Refer Chapter-3 Para 3.3
           Design period: Refer Chapter 3 Para 3.1 .
           Quality of water: Refer Chapter 3 Para 3.8

6.4.   Rehabilitation of Existing Water Supply Schemes

       To economise in project cost it is necessary that wherever feasible existing scheme in full
       or some of its existing assets be utilised. The performance of the existing scheme is to be
       assessed during supply hours and decide if any assets of existing scheme can be used or
       rehabilitated in the proposed scheme.

6.5.   Ground Water Source

       Tube well is the main source for Ground water based supply schemes

       Tube Wells shall be drilled in accordance with Indian Standard IS: 2800 (Part – I),
       developed in accordance with IS: 11189 with latest amendments and tested in accordance
       with IS: 2800 (Part-II) with latest amendments.

6.5.1. Tube well

       Tube wells collect the ground water infiltrated to deeper layers in the soil strata compared
       to dug wells and hence the quality of water will be good and can be supplied after
       disinfections (using bleaching powder).

6.5.2. Methods of Drilling of Tube Well

       There are numerous methods of drilling wells and each method has advantages related to
       ease of construction, cost factors, character of formations to be penetrated; well diameter
       and depth, sanitary protection and intended use of the well itself. The basic principles of
       some of the methods are described here.

6.5.2.1.Percussion Drilling

       The percussion method, often referred to as cable tool method, is one of the oldest, most
       versatile and simplest drilling methods. Construction involves repeatedly lifting and
       dropping of heavy string of tool either manually or power with a suspended with a cable..
       The string of tools, in ascending order, consists of a bit, a drill stem, drilling jars and a
       swivel socket which is attached to the cable. The bit strikes the bottom of the hole,
       crushing, breaking and mixing the cuttings. Above the water table or in otherwise dry
       formations, water is added to dissolve the cuttings which are lifted out by means of a
       bailer. This method is most suitable for drilling in stratum where large boulders are
       encountered in abundance at different depths. Drilling in such unconsolidated formations
       require a pipe or casing that follows the drill bit closely in the well as the well is
       deepened to prevent caving in an to keep bore hole open.

       Advantages and disadvantages of it is given below:

             Advantages                                     Disadvantages
             Rigs are relatively inexpensive, simple in     Penetration rate are relatively slow
             design and requires little sophisticated
             maintenance
             Machines have low energy requirement           Casing cost are usually higher and
                                                            difficult to pullback in some
                                                            geological conditions
             Borehole is stabilized during the hole         Not recommended for solid hard rock
             drilling operation                             formations
             Recovery of reliable samples is possible
             from every depth unless a heaving
             condition occurs
             Wells can be drilled in areas where little
             make-up water exist and can be
             constructed with little chance of
             contamination
             Wells can be bailed at any time to
             determine the approximate yield at certain
             depths

6.5.2.2.Direct Rotary Circulation Drilling:

       The rotary rig drills by mechanical rotation of a drill bit at the bottom of a string of drill
       pipe. The typical string consists of a bit which scrapes, grinds, fractures or otherwise
       breaks the formation drilled; a drill collar of heavy walled pipe to maintain a straight
       hole; and a drill pipe which extends to the surface and imparts rotation to the bit. As the
       bit is turned drilling fluid (usually bentonite mixed with other suitable material) is
       circulated under - pressure which" lubricates and cools the bit, carries the cuttings in
       suspension to the surface, and plasters the wall of the hole to prevent caving in. The
       cuttings in suspension thus received at the surface could be geologically examined
       thereby identifying the depth of water bearing aquifer.

              Advantages                               Disadvantages
              Penetration rates are relatively high    Drilling rigs are costly and requires a high
              in all type of strata                    level of maintenance
                                                       Mobility of the rig may be limited
              Minimum casing is required during        depending on the slope and condition of
              the drilling operation                   the land surface
              Rig        mobilization            and   Collection of accurate samples require
              demobilization are rapid                 special procedure
              Well screens can be set easily as        Drilling fluid management requires
              part of the casing installation          additional knowledge nd experience

6.5.2.3.Reverse Rotary Circulation Drilling

       The reverse circulation rotary rig operates essentially in the same way as a direct rotary
       rig except that water is pumped up through the drill pipe rather than down through it. A
       string of drill pipes with a drill bit at the bottom is rotated by mechanical means. Plain
       water or a drilling fluid, depending on the strata conditions, is allowed to flow into the
       borehole; the drill cuttings along with water are sucked through the drill pipes by a
       centrifugal pump and thrown into a settling pit.

              Advantages                                      Disadvantages
              Porosity and permeability of the formation      Large water supply is generally
              near the bore hole are relatively               needed
              undisturbed
              Large diameter holes can be drilled quickly     Reverse rotary rigs and components
              and economically                                are more expensive
              No casing is required during the drilling       Large mud pits are required
              operation      Rig    mobilization   and
              demobilization are rapid
              Well screens can be set easily as part of Small drill sites are not accessible
              casing installation                       because of rig size

6.5.2.4.Down-the-Hole (DTH) Hammer Drilling

       It is accomplished by a tool called the down-the hole hammer which is essentially a
       pneumatic hammer operated at the lower end of the drill pipe and combining the
       percussion and the rotary actions. The method utilizes compressed air for the rapid
       impacting action given by the hammer to the bit, thus crushing the formation into small
       chips which are flushed out through the annular space between the bore and the drill
       pipes by the upcoming compressed air.

       Advantages                                   Disadvantages
       Cutting removals is extremely rapid          High cost
       Aquifer is not plugged with drilling         Application restricted to semi consolidated
       fluids                                       and well consolidated formation

6.5.2.5.Selection of Drilling Rigs

       On the basis of advantages and disadvantages shown above the site Engineer may adopt
       the suitable type of drilling rig for that particular site.

       Well Casing

       Well casing is a pipe and is used to prevent caving in of surrounding soil into the well or
       bore-hole. In case where casing is the permanent part of the tube well the lower portion
       has screen while the upper portion is used for housing the pumping equipment. The
       length and diameter of the casing pipe is selected on the basis of static water level,
       drawdown, discharge expected from the pump and the size of pump to be installed. The
       housing portion of the casing should be located such that the pump will always remain
       submersed in water and should be a few meters below the lowest drawdown level.

       Steel tubes most suitable for varied type of water well drilling operations - either casing
       or drive are those made to IS: 4270. Unless otherwise agreed to between the supplier and
       the purchaser, the pipes shall be supplied in random lengths of 4 to 7 meters.

       Screen Types

       The following are the various types of well screens and slotted pipes as per IS: 8110:

            Plain Slotted Pipes - These are pipes with slots cut by milling.
            Bridge Slotted Pipes - The slots here are not cut but pressed out.

Chapter-6                                                                                 Page 6-6
                                                  Technical Guidelines-Water Supply Components


           Mesh Wrapped Screens - These are made by wrapping copper mesh over perforated
            steel pipe using spacers about 3 mm thick in between the copper mesh and the
            perforated pipe
           Cage Type Wire-wound Screens - These are special type of screens wherein a con-
            tinuous trapezoidal or circular wire is spirally wound around a fabricated cage. The
            screen consists of wedge profile wire of various dimensions, resistance welded to a
            cylindrical body made of various members and cross sections of longitudinally
            arranged metal rods, which are in turn welded into cylindrical ring couplings at
            either end.

       Material

       The well screens and slotted pipes shall be made of either corrosion resistant material or
       steel pipes having sufficient thickness to guard against the effect of corrosion and to
       ensure reasonable life of tube well. The following are the recommended materials for
       various types of well screens and slotted pipes:

           Low carbon steel or mild steel
           Stainless steel

       Normally Stainless steel strainer is to be used and Low carbon strainer is to be adopted in
       case steel strainer is not commercially available. However for rural areas the required
       diameter of strainer is in the range of 150 mm to 250 mm and for these sizes stainless
       steel strainer is easily available in the market.

       Design Consideration

       Length of Screen

       The length of screen shall be governed by the thickness of aquifer and shall be sufficient
       to obtain the specified yield from tube well. However, the minimum total length shall be
       such that the entrance velocity is less than the permissible entrance velocity of 0.03 m/s
       to ensure longer life of the well. The lengths of individual pipes shall be such as to afford
       easy handling for transport. Screen shall not be placed in at least 0.3 meter on both sides
       of the stratum.

       Size of the Screen

       The screen diameter shall be so selected that the percentage of slot area to screen surface
       area is generally between 20 to 25 percent, for gravel packed tube wells and 8-10% for
       natural packed tube wells.

       Slot Size

       The shape and size of the slots shall be such that the gravel or aquifer material is not
       allowed to block the open spaces. Based on the sieve analysis of the aquifer material, the
       size of the slot openings shall be determined in such a way that finer fractions remain
       outside the slots. The slots shall not be too wide to cause entry of the gravel and resulting
       in plugging. Sharp edges on the periphery of the pipe may offer resistance to flow and
       hence it is preferable to have smooth rounded edges.
Chapter-6                                                                                   Page 6-7
                                                  Technical Guidelines-Water Supply Components


       The slot size for gravel pack shall be so selected as to retain at least 90 percent of the
       pack material. However, in case the well is not provided with gravel pack, slot size shall
       be such that it allows 40 to 60 percent of the aquifer material to pass through. The normal
       slot sizes shall be 1.0, 1.6 and 3.2 mm.

       Cage Type Wire-wound Screens

       The wrapping wire having a wedge profile with flat surface on the outside and producing
       expanding slots on the inside should be-used. This shape facilitates setting and back
       washing operation and also avoids the screens being clogged by fine particles.

       For obtaining a minimum of 15 percent open area, the screen aperture shall not be less
       than 0.375 mm. The number and cross-section of the vertical support rods and the profile
       of the wrapping wire shall be such as to give sufficient axial and collapse -strength.

       Choice of Strainer

       It is recommended that for natural packed/ Gravel Tube wells Stainless steel Strainer
       shall be adopted

       Guidelines for Gravel Packing

       Gravel Packing as per IS: 4097

       Need for Gravel Packing

       The four common reasons for gravel packing are:

       a.   To increase the specific capacity of the well
       b.   To minimize sand flow through the screen in fine formations
       c.   To aid in the construction of well
       d.   To minimize the rate of incrustation by using a larger screen slot opening where the
            formation is relatively thin but very permeable and the chemical characteristics of the
            groundwater indicate potential for significant incrustation.

       Criterion for Gravel Packing

       The desirability of gravel packing decreases as the water bearing formation becomes
       coarser. Generally, formation with an effective grain size, D1O that is that size, than
       which only 10 percent of the formation is finer, or more than 0.30 mm and uniformity co-
       efficient of 5 or more can be safely developed without gravel packing.

       Gravel Sizes

       The gravel sizes shall be as given in Table 6-1 .




Chapter-6                                                                                  Page 6-8

            No.                               mm                       IS: 460 (part 2)

            5     E       Coarse gravel       Over 8.0 to 12.5         8.0. 12.5

       To avoid trouble in placing and inspective of gradation, packs should not contain
       particles greater than 13 mm.

       Thickness of Gravel

       The thickness of gravel pack shall be limited to 13 to 18 cm. The size of the screen slot
       opening is governed, among other factors, by the size of the gravel or aquifer material
       which it has to retain. The slot size for gravel packed wells should be such that it retains
       about 90 percent of the gravel. For further details of gravel packing, IS: 4097 may be
       referred. For construction of Tube well IS: 2800 (Parts -1 & 2) may be referred.

       Tube well Development

       The development of a well is its treatment for the purpose of establishing the maximum
       rate of usable water by cleaning the produced water of turbidity, sand, sediment or other
       impurities introduced during drilling.

       Method of Development

       There are numerous methods of development and an important factor in all these is that
       the development work be started slowly and gently and increased in vigor as the well is
       developed. The development should be started as far as possible from the bottom of the
       screen because with this compaction takes place as the work progresses upward and the
       overlying material can move downwards. The known methods of development are
       described below (For more details refer IS: 11189):

       Over Pumping

       Over pumping means pumping the well at a higher rate than it will be pumped normally
       when it is put in service. It may be simpler to over pump in small wells or poor aquifers
       by employing the pumping equipment intended for regular use in the well.

       Compressed Air

       Another popular way of development is by using compressed air but it requires
       considerable equipment and skill on the part of the operator. The capacity of compressor
       should be at least 9.35 cum per minute at 250 PSI pressure for depth up to 200 meter. In
       case depth of bore well is more than 200 meter, a proportionately higher capacity
       compressor shall be used

Chapter-6                                                                                  Page 6-9

       Calculation of Discharge

       (A)     Discharge of tube well shall be determined by using V-notch. The various
               observations which are required for deciding the yield of tube well at different
               drawdown has to be tabulated as given below:

       Based on observations recorded in the tables given above, the discharge of tube well may
       be finalized as per relevant IS codes.

       To make the design of tube well much more understandable, a typical example has been
       attached as Annexure 05 (Volume-2).

       Factors Affecting the Performance of Tube Wells

       Due to clogging the effective area of opening gets decrease this lead to increase of
       velocity through the opening and resulting into increase of head at the entrance.

       The clogging in the well could be removed by following methods:-

       1. Surging: to dislodge clogging and incrusting material
       2. Chemical treatment: By acids, chlorine in loosening bacterial growths and slime
          deposits, by using polyphosphates @ of 12.5 to25 kg for every kilo litre of water in
          the well.

6.6.   Surface Water Sources

       The following are the base surface water sources:

            Canals
            Rivers
            Ponds / lakes
            Springs

       Flow and Location: Preferably perennial flow and location to be safe and secure.

Chapter-6                                                                                                 Page 6-10
                                                  Technical Guidelines-Water Supply Components


       Inlet works: Inlet chamber with screens, inlet to be below lowest summer water level.

       Intake well: 4-6m dia. depending upon the capacity, sufficient space for pump house,
       pump sets, valves, panels etc.

       Floating Barge: Shall be recommended mainly in case of Rivers with high variation in
       water level throughout the year.

6.6.1. Design of Intake/Raw Water Collection Well

       When surface water is selected to be the technology option, it defines for specific
       structures for the drawal and transmission called intake well or raw water collection well.
       These are the structures placed in a surface water source to permit the withdrawal of
       water from the source. These are essentially used in lakes, reservoirs or rivers etc., where
       wide fluctuations in water level are expected.

       Type of intakes:

           Wet intakes
           Dry intakes
           Submerged intakes
           Movable and floating barge intakes.

       Location and Design Considerations:

           It shall be located such that the raw water can be withdrawn continuously over the
            year of best quality
           It shall be nearer to the raw water sump
           The location shall be free from the water currents and swirls
           The entrance of large objects shall be prevented by screens
           The capacity of the conduit and depth of suction well should be such that the intake
            ports to the suction pipes do not draw air. A velocity of 60-90 cm/sec will give
            satisfactory performance
           The intake conduit shall be laid in a continuous rising or falling grade to avoid
            accumulation of gas or air
           Normally, the size of the well shall be equal to 30 minutes of pumping capacity
           Intake well with pump house is generally constructed with R.C.C. as per site
            condition. The floor level is kept above the high flood level to avoid submergence of
            pumps during floods. The floor area shall be enough to provide space for placement
            of pump motors, control panel, delivery piping and valves
           Proper access shall be provided to the intake well for transport of pumps, etc.

       For finalization of location of intake works; The Naval guidelines of Inland Waterways
       Authority of India shall be considered. For proposed location of water intake in the river,
       necessary permission from IWAI has to be taken to the effect that the intake point does
       not fall within the navigable channel maintained by IWAI there.

       For finalization of location of intake works; The Naval guidelines of Inland Water Way
       Authority shall be considered.

       In tanks and canals where the fluctuation in water level is not appreciable the raw water
       can directly flow into the sump of jack well.

       The diagrams of intake and raw water collection wells are shown in the Figures 6-1.

6.6.2. Impounding Reservoir/Summer Storage Tank

           Storage has to be provided for non-monsoon period plus allowance for silt, seepage,
            dead storage, and evaporation
           It is recommended to explore possibility of using an existing tank to minimize the
            high cost of construction of impounding reservoir
           If supply has to be drawn from existing tank or canal it may be drawn from live
            storage and also have facility for intake works to draw water from dead storage for
            drinking water supply system
           Intake well in SS tank is to be located where dead storage is maximum
           Layer wise compaction of soils is to be ensured for the bund.

       The storage tanks shall be provided for storing the requirement during the canal closer /
       source dry period. The water requirement of this period with a minimum of 50% extra is
       provided in the storage towards percolation and evaporation losses.

6.6.3. Sumps

           Raw water sump: It acts as an equalizing reservoir which enables the units to work
            at a constant rate. It is provided for collection of raw water from intake well, and
            settled water sump is required at places to maintain uniform loading on various units
            such as filter beds etc.
           Clear water sump: It is required for pumping in mains for supply and storage of
            water. Generally a circular sump is to be designed. Sump capacity is calculated on the
            basis of inflow and outflow of water at the sump.

6.6.4. Water Transmission lines

       Conveyance of water may be by gravity flow and / pressure flow. Gravity pipelines have
       to be laid below the hydraulic gradient line of the transmission main. Pressure main is to
       be laid as per profile of the ground surface.

        Hydraulics

            The design of water transmission line is dependent on resistance to flow, available
            pressure or head, allowable velocities of flow, scour sediment transport, quality of
            water and relative cost. There are number of formulae available for use in calculating
Chapter-6                                                                                Page 6-15

             the velocity of flow. Hazen Williams formula for pressure conduit and Manning’s
             formula for free flow conduits have been popularly used. In the transmission main,
             the full flow condition is prevailed so Hazen William Formula is used.

             The Original Hazen William Formula:

                                                                     .           .
                                            = 0.85 ∗      ∗   ∗( )       ∗ (S)

             Where Q= Discharge in Cum/Sec
                   C= Hazen William Coefficient
                   A= Wetted Area of Pipe Conduit
                   R =Hydraulic Radius of Pipe Conduit
                   S= Hydraulic Slope (m/m)

             Now the Modified Hazen Williams formula which was derived from Darcy-Weisbach
             and Colebrook-White equations is used.

             Modified Hazen Williams Formula

             The Modified Hazen Williams formula is used, for estimation of velocity, discharge
             and for loss of head due to friction.

             The Modified Hazen Williams formula derived as

                V       = 143.534 CR r0.6575 S0.5525
                h       = [L (Q/CR)1.81] / 994.62 D4.81

                in which,
                V      = Velocity of flow in m/s;
                CR     = Pipe roughness coefficient, (1 for smooth pipes; <1 for rough pipes);
                r      = hydraulic radius in m;
                s      = friction slope;
                D      = internal diameter of pipe in m;
                h      = friction head loss in m;
                L      = length of pipe in m; and
                Q      = flow in pipe in cum/s.

             The value of Modified Hazen Williams co-efficient ‘CR’ for different pipe materials
             and the value adopted for design purposes are given in Table 6-2.

              Resistance Due to Specials and Appurtenances

              In pipelines there will be several transitions and appurtenances, which will add to the
              loss of head in addition to friction loss. These are normally expressed as velocity
              heads i.e.

                                                  = KV2 / 2g

              Where

              V = Average velocity in a pipe of corresponding diameter in m/s
              g = Acceleration due to gravity in m/s2
              K = A specific resistance co-efficient for the specials of appurtenance

              The values of K to be adopted for different fittings are given in the Manual on water
              supply and treatment published by CPHEEO (Latest Edition). However, in a rural
              water supply system it is recommended to calculate the head loss due to specials and
              appurtenances at 10% of frictional losses in pipeline.

              However for short length segments the following % of losses over friction for account
              of other losses due to the specials and appurtenances are observed in the RWS field
              works.

           Water Hammer

              Any sudden change in the flow velocity or pressure in a liquid line will produce
              hydraulic shock (water hammer). It is like a long, rigid spring; being stretched at a
              uniform speed is suddenly released. A pressure wave would travel back along the
              spring as it is compressed at the point of stoppage.

              The pressure due to water hammer depends on the elastic properties of the pipe
              material.

                                                          =     /

            The actual water hammer head can be calculated and added to the working pressure to
            arrive at the class of the pipe which shall be able to withstand the total head on
            account of water hammer plus the working head (allowable internal pressure of pipe
            lines can be increased for shock loads considerations as per the provisions in codes
            for various type of pipes). Since water hammer head is a function of velocity,
            choosing a higher diameter pipeline reduces the velocity and hence reduces the water
            hammer head. However, cost effect has to be studied for choosing higher diameter
            pipe to minimize water hammer head or changing the pipe material or increasing the
            pressure class of pipe to withstand the water hammer head.

            Special Devices for Control of Water Hammer

               Zero Velocity Valve

                The principle behind the design of this valve is to arrest the forward moving water
                column at zero momentum i.e. when its velocity is zero and before any return
                velocity is established.

                With sudden stoppage of pumps the forward velocity of water column goes on
                decreasing due to friction and gravity. When the forward velocity becomes less
                than 25% of the maximum, the flap starts closing at the same rate as the velocity
                of water. The flap comes to the fully closed position when forward velocity
                approaches zero magnitude; water column on the upstream side of the valve is
                thus prevented from acquiring a reverse velocity and taking part in creating surge
                pressures. The bypass valve maintains balanced pressure on the disc and also
                avoids vacuum on the downstream side of valve if that column experiences certain
                reversal.

                The main advantages of zero velocity valves are:

                (i)    Controlled closing characteristics
                (ii)   Low loss of head due to streamlined design.

Chapter-6                                                                                Page 6-18
                                                   Technical Guidelines-Water Supply Components


               Air Cushion Valve

                The principle of this valve is to allow large quantities of air in the pumping main
                during separation, entrap the air, compress it with the returning air column and
                expel the air under controlled pressure so as to dissipate the energy of the
                returning water column. An effective air cushion is thus provided.

                The valve is mounted on Tee joint on the rising main at locations where water
                column separation is likely. The valve has a spring loaded air inlet port, an outlet
                normally closed by a float, spring loaded outlet poppet valve and an adjustable
                needle valve control orifice.

                When there is sudden stoppage of pump due to power failure, partial vacuum is
                created in the main. With differential pressure, the spring loaded port opens and
                admits outside air into the main. When the pressure in the main becomes near
                atmospheric, the inlet valve closes under spring pressure. The entrapped air is then
                compressed by the returning water column till the proper valve opens. With float
                in dropped position, the air is expelled through poppet valve and controlled orifice
                under predetermined pressure thus dissipating the energy of the returning water
                column.

               Opposed Poppet Valve

                As the name implies, the valve has two poppets of slightly different areas mounted
                on the same stem. The actual load on the stem is thus the difference in loads on
                the two poppets and is thus light. A weak spring is therefore, able to keep the
                valve closed under normal working pressure. If pressure in the water main
                increases beyond a certain limit, the increase in differential pressure overcomes
                the holding pressure of the spring, opens the valve and allows water to discharge
                through both the poppets.

                On account of the light spring the valve is able to open quickly and thus reduce
                the peak surge pressure to the desired limit.

               Air Vessel

                If the profile of a pipeline is not high enough to use a surge tank or discharge tank
                to protect the line, it may be possible to force water into the pipe behind the low
                pressure wave by means of compressed air in a vessel. The pressure in the vessel
                will gradually decrease as water is released until the pressure in the vessel equals
                that in the adjacent line.

6.6.5. Economical Size of Pumping Main

       The economical sizing of pumping main has to be adopted as it not only economise the
       capital cost but also recurring cost. For a given discharge, if smaller diameter of the pipes
       is selected the velocity of flow increases. However the increased velocity results in higher
       frictional loss and hence increases total pumping head, which requires increased HP of
       the pump. This leads to higher pumping cost and may offset the reduction in initial cost
       due to the smaller diameter pipe. Normally, the combined effect is a net increase in cost.

Chapter-6                                                                                  Page 6-19
                                                 Technical Guidelines-Water Supply Components


       On the other hand if too large a diameter of the pipe is used the cost of pumping will be
       less, but the initial investment in cost of pipeline and pumps has an annuity, which
       depends on the rate of interest and period of repayment of loan taken for capital
       investment. The annual operating cost of the pumps will vary depending on HP/KW of
       pumps (depend on size of pipeline). For the most economical condition we must choose
       such a pipe size, whose annuity due to initial cost together with the annual pumping cost
       will make the total annual expenditure minimum. The size of such a pipe is called
       economic size of the pipe.

       The most economical size for conveyance shall be based on proper analysis of the
       following factors:

           The period of design considered or period of loan repayment
           Different pipe sizes against different hydraulic slopes
           Different pipe materials, which can be used for the purpose and their relative costs
            as laid in position
           The duty, capacity and installed cost of pumps sets required against the
            corresponding sizes of pipelines under consideration
           The recurring costs on energy charges for running pump sets, staff for operation of
            the pump sets, cost of repairs and renewals of pump sets, and cost of miscellaneous
            consumable stores
           While selecting the class of the pipe higher of the following shall be considered,
            twice the working pressure at the top of the bore well and Working pressure at the
            top of the bore well water hammer pressure
           Pressure rating of the Pipe should be decided accounting for the water hammer also.
            While putting of the capital cost of the pipe line, suitable pipe rating shall be
            considered considering water hammer pressure as well. The rate of interest on the
            loan shall be considered as per prevailing rate.

       Normally the pipe size required to give a velocity of 0.9 m/sec for a given discharge is
       worked out and the nearest commercially available size of pipe is selected. In addition
       two sizes of pipes above and below the selected size are chosen for design purpose. This
       is done to obtain the size of the pipe, which together with the pumping cost will make the
       total annual expenditure minimum. In addition, the class of the pipe thus selected shall
       also be able to withstand the pressure due to water hammer effects plus the static head.

       All pumping mains will be designed using the concept of economical size and class of
       pipe checked for surge pressures as provided in the Appendix 6.5 of CPHEEO Manual
       on Water Supply & Treatment.

6.6.6. Type of Transmission Pipe Lines

       Cost of Pipes incurred a large proportion of the capital investment in water supply sector.
       Therefore it is utmost important to select the pipe materials in a judicial manner. Two
       types of pipes are:

       1.   Gravity Pipelines
       2.   Pressure Pipelines



Chapter-6                                                                                Page 6-20
                                                   Technical Guidelines-Water Supply Components


       The following provisions should be considered while conducting the structural design of
       the pressure pipes:

           Internal pressure of water including water hammer pressure to be resisted by using
            materials strong in tension
           Pressure due to external loads in the form of backfill and traffic load to be resisted
            by materials strong in compression
           Longitudinal temperature stresses created when pipes are laid above ground to be
            resisted by providing expansion joints
           Longitudinal stresses created due to unbalanced pressure at bends, or at the points
            of change of cross section – to be resisted by holding the pipe firmly by anchoring it
            in massive blocks of concrete or stone masonry.

       Selection of pipe materials must be based on the following considerations:

           The initial carrying capacity of the pipe and its reduction with use, defined, for
            example, by the Hazen-Williams coefficient C. Values of C vary for different
            conduit materials and their relative deterioration in service. They vary with size and
            shape to some extent
           The strength of the pipe as measured by its ability to resist internal pressures and
            external loads
           The life and durability of pipe as determined by the resistance to corrosion; to
            erosion, disintegration and to cracking
           The extent of difficulty in transportation, handling and laying and jointing under
            different conditions of topography, geology and other prevailing local conditions
           The safety, economy and availability of manufactured sizes of pipes and specials
            near the project area
           The availability of skilled personnel in construction and commissioning of pipelines
           The ease is of operations and maintenance.

       Pipe of material including of rising main, transmission main, and distribution network
       shall be selected by the nodal agencies of the respective state based on the specific design
       requirement including local conditions. This should be governed by the State Pipe Policy.

6.6.7. Laying & Testing of Pipes

       Field Hydraulic Test for MS pipelines: After erection at site and after the concrete
       anchor/ thrust blocks have been constructed. The entire pipeline shall be subjected to a
       hydraulic test as follows, to the required test pressure as per Clause 11 of IS: 5822. When
       the field test pressure is less than 2/3 the works test pressures the period of test should be
       at least 24 hours. The test pressure shall be gradually raised at a rate of 0.1 N/mm2 per
       minute. If a drop in pressure occurs, the quantity of water added in order to re-establish
       the test pressure should be carefully measured. This should not exceed 0.1 litre/ mm of
       pipe diameter per km of pipeline per day for each 30 m head of pressure applied. The
       contractor shall provide and maintain all requisite facilities, instruments, for the field
       testing of the material. All pipes, specials, valves and civil works shall be replaced by the
       contractor free of cost if damaged during testing.

       Field Hydraulic Testing of DI pipelines: After the pipes and fittings are laid, jointed
       and the trench partially backfilled except at the joints the stretch of pipe line as directed

       by Engineer shall be subjected to pressure test and leakage test as per relevant IS codes.
       Where any section of the pipeline is provided with concrete thrust blocks or anchorages,
       the pressure test shall not be made until at least five days have elapsed after the concrete
       was cast. If rapid hardening cement has been used in these blocks or anchorages, the tests
       shall not be made until at least two days, have elapsed. Each section of' the pipe line shall
       be slowly filled with water and all air shall be expelled from the pipe by tapping at points
       of highest elevation before the test is made. The duration of test shall be 8 hours. No pipe
       installation shall be accepted until the leakage is less than the number cm3/hr as
       determined by the formula:

                                              =     √ 3.3

       Where, QL = the allowable leakage in cm3/hr
              N = number of joints in the length of the pipeline.
              D = diameter in mm, and
              P = the average test pressure during the leakage test in kg/cm2

     Should any test of pipe laid indicate leakage greater than that specified above, the defective
     joints shall be repaired by contractor at no extra cost to owner/engineer until the leakage is
     within the specified allowance. Necessary equipment and water used for testing shall be
     arranged by contractor at his own cost. Damage during testing shall be contractor's
     responsibility and shall be rectified by him at no extra cost to owner/engineer. Water used
     for testing shall be removed from the pipe and not released in the excavated trenches. After
     the tests mentioned above are completed to the satisfaction of owner/engineer, the
     backfilling of trenches shall be done as per specifications in layers.

     Procedure for Hydraulic testing of Ductile iron (D.I.) / P.V.C.: In case of D.I. pipes the
     permissible quantity of water added into the pipe during testing in twenty hours of test is
     0.1 litre per mm dia./ km. of pipe for a pressure of 30 meters, while that for P.V.C. pipe is
     0.15 litre per km. length of pipe i.e. for 10 mm dia. of D.I. pipe it is 1.0 litre and that for 10
     mm nominal dia. of P.V.C. pipe is 1.5 litres.

     For further details about the P.V.C./H.D.P.E. pipes relevant I.S. specifications are as below:

     IS: 7634 (part 1-5), IS: 8008 (parts 1-7), IS: 7634 (parts1-3), IS: 3076 and IS: 4984

     For D.I. pipes IS: 8329.

     Flushing and Disinfection of Mains: The pipeline shall be disinfected before
     commissioning for use. After testing the main, it shall be flushed with water of sufficient
     velocity to remove all dirt and other foreign materials. When this process has been
     completed, disinfection (using liquid chlorine, sodium or calcium hypochlorite) shall be
     done as per of IS: 5822.

     Laying and jointing of u-PVC and HDPE pipes:

     Due precaution in preparation of the trench for lying of pipes should be taken especially in
     rocky formations to ensure that the trench bottom should be free from any rocky
     projections. The trench bottom shall be carefully examined for the presence of hard objects
     such as flints, rock projections, tree roots etc. in fine grained soft soil free from all such
     objects the trench bottom be brought to even finish so as to provide uniform support to the
Chapter-6                                                                                    Page 6-22

     pipes all through its length. In cases of rocky, uneven trench it is necessary to provide a
     layer of sand or alluvial earth equal one third the diameter of pipe or 100 mm thick
     whichever is less under the pipes. The trench should be narrow and of width 0.30 mm over
     the outside diameter of pipe and its depth should be 0.60-1.0 m below the ground
     depending on the traffic condition at the place. Where heavy traffic will pass across the
     pipe line proper cover above the pipe shall be provided to ensure that traffic load does not
     come on to the pipe. In cases where the pipe has to cross some rivulet the pipe should be
     laid at least 2 m below the bed level (or below scour depth) to protect the pipe from
     scouring.

     Jointing of PVC pipes can be made in following ways:

     a)       Solvent cement
     b)       Rubber ring joint
     c)       Flanged joints
     d)       Threaded joint.

     For solvent cement joints the surface to be glued should be thoroughly be scoured with dry
     cloth and preferably be chamfered to 30 degree. The solvent cement is applied with a brush
     evenly to the outside surface of the spigot on one pipe and to the inside surface of the
     socket on the other. The spigot is then inserted immediately in the socket up to the shoulder
     and thereafter a quarter turn is given to evenly distribute the cement over the treated
     surface. The excess cement if any must be removed at once with clean cloth. The time
     taken in jointing should be minimum not being more than one minute and the joint should
     not be disturbed at least for the five minutes thereafter as about half strength is only
     achieved in 30 minutes and full by 24 hours. Gluing should be avoided in rainy or foggy
     weather as the joint will not gather adequate strength and the colour of cement will turn
     cloudy and milky due to water contamination.

     In case of HDPE pipes, jointing is done by welding of pipe ends .This is done by heat
     welding where the two ends of the pipes to be welded are heated by holding the ends
     pressed to the hot plate and afterwards pressing the two ends to each other such that the two
     pipes become one. HDPE pipes may by jointed using Electro-Fusion Welding with couplers
     and / or Butt fusion welding. These welding can be done by machines so designed. The
     Machines are manufactured and marketed by reputed companies. For bending the cleaned
     pipe is filled with sand and compacted by tapping with wooden stick and the pipe ends are
     plugged. The pipe section is heated with flame and the portion is bent as required .In case
     of PVC pipes standard bends are available which are jointed with pipe ends with solvent
     cement as explained above for pipe jointing. Socket and spigot joints for all PVC pipes are
     preferred up to 150 mm diameter. The socket length should at least be one and a half times
     the outer diameter of the pipe for sizes up to 100 mm and equal to the outer diameter of
     the pipes for sizes more than 100 mm. The pipe lines those are laid earlier, shall be charged
     full of water and plug at both ends. This would avoid the damage to the gasket and thereby
     avoiding subsequently leakages when commissioned.

     For further details on laying and jointing of PVC pipes, reference can be made to IS: 4985,
     IS: 7634 (Part-1to3).

     Testing of Pipes: After laying and jointing, the pipe line must be pressure tested to ensure
     that the pipes and joints can withstand the maximum pressure to which it is subjected under

Chapter-6                                                                               Page 6-23
                                                    Technical Guidelines-Water Supply Components


     working conditions in the field. The maximum pressure field test pressure is the maximum
     out of the following:

     a)     One and a half times the maximum sustained operating pressure
     b)     One and a half times the maximum static pressure in the pipe line
     c)     Sum of the maximum sustained operating pressure and the maximum surge pressure
     d)     Pressure as mentioned in c) above subject to a maximum equal to the work test
            pressure for any pipe fittings incorporated in the pipe line.

     The field test pressure should not be not less than two third the work test pressure for the
     class of pipe used and should be applied and maintained for at least four hours during
     which in the visual inspection no leakage be noticed. The test period be increased to at least
     24 hours. For this the test pressure shall be gradually increased at the rate of 1kg/square
     cm/minute. If a drop in pressure occurs, the measured quantity of water is added in order to
     establish the test pressure. The quantity of water thus added should not exceed 0.1 litre per
     mm of pipe diameter per km of pipe line length subjected to testing for each 30 meter head
     of pressure applied.

     The procedure for the test mentioned above is as follows:

     a)     At a time one section of the pipe line between two slice valves is taken up for testing
            which normally is around 500 meters
     b)     One of the valves is closed and the water is admitted into the pipe from the other. The
            air must be allowed to escape by manipulating air valves suitably .In case there are no
            slice valves in the section, one end of the pipe section can be sealed temporarily by
            fixing an end cap with air relief vent for escape of air during the filling of the line.
            The pipe line thus filled is allowed to stand for 24 hours before it is tested
     c)     After filling the sluice valve on the other end is closed and the section is thus isolated.
     d)     Pressure gauges are fitted at suitable intervals on the crown into the holes provided
     e)     The pipe section is then connected to the delivery side of a pump through a small
            valve
     f)     The pump is then operated till the pressure inside reaches the desired value
            (maximum test pressure as explained above to which the line is to be tested).This can
            be measured from the pressure gauges fixed
     g)     On attaining the required pressure the valve is closed on the pump side
     h)     In case the pressure drops a measured quantity of water is added and the pump is
            restarted so as to attain the test pressure. This observation is thus carried out for the
            specified duration and during all this period the test pressure is maintained and the
            total quantity of water added in the pipe line for maintenance of the pressure is
            recorded which the idea about the leakage and this should not be more than the
            quantity as worked out @ 0.1 litre per mm diameter of per kilo meter length of pipe
            subjected for testing.

            It should be noted carefully that during testing the end cap should remain firmly fixed
            as any disturbance will result into leakage at this end thereby dropping the pressure
            recorded in the gauge. For this the end cap needs to be properly anchored with
            wooden planks and hydraulic jack. It has been observed that when the pressure in the
            pipe line rises the thrust on the planks and hydraulic jack increases such that the same
            is equivalent to the force equivalent to the area of cross section of the pipe multiplied
            by the pressure inside the pipe which is at times quite high .The anchorage thus

Chapter-6                                                                                    Page 6-24
                                                   Technical Guidelines-Water Supply Components


            should be at least twice the force so exerted. At times this is also observed that the
            whole pipe line shift laterally.

6.7.   Valves

       i) Sluice Valves

            Sluice valves as per IS: 14846 on main line is provided to stop and regulate the flow
            of water in the course of ordinary operations and in an emergency. The principle
            considerations in location of the valves are accessibility and proximity to special
            points such as branches, stream crossings, major summit points etc.

            Sluice valves of the same size (For smaller dia. pipes used in RWS), as per diameter
            of the main line pipe are normally used for isolating sections of pipe. Sluice valves
            are sometimes used for continuous throttling which may cause erosion of seats and
            lead to body cavitation. Wherever small flows are required, the bypass valve is more
            suitable for this purpose as compared to throttling the mainline valve.

       ii) Scour Valve

            Scour Valves as per IS:14846 are the Sluice Valves located in valley portions in the
            alignment of pipe lines, so as to facilitate emptying of the pipe line whenever required
            for maintenance of the pipeline. The outlet of the scour valve has to be connected to a
            natural drain. However, precautions must be taken to ensure that the wastewater from
            the drains does not enter the water supply pipelines. During installation of the valve,
            it should be ensured that it is always accessible for operation. A proper valve chamber
            with locking arrangement is required to protect the valve and prevent misuse. The
            size of scour valve shall normally be equal to half the diameter of the main line.
            Protection by way of stone pitching or concrete block beneath the scour valve is
            required, since the scour water erodes the setting place of valve.

       iii) Air Valves

            Air release valves as per IS: 14845 is designed to expel air automatically from the
            pipelines, which tends to accumulate at the high points in the pipeline. Normally in
            gravity flow pipelines, when the pressure in the pipe falls below the atmospheric
            pressure, air has to be drawn in, to prevent collapsing of the pipes to prevent the pipe
            from such collapse (vacuum). Additionally Air valves also release any entrained air
            which might accumulate at high points in the pipe line during normal operations. For
            most cases in water works and pumping practice, two types of air valves are required.
            These are known as a) large orifice air valve and b) small orifice air valve.

            Large Orifice Air Valve

            The Purpose of this type of valve is to discharge air during filling or charging of
            mains and to admit air to mains while they are being emptied. They pass air at high
            rates of flow with small pressure difference either in to or out of the pipes on which
            the valve is fixed. The ball, which forms the valve element although buoyant, is rigid
            being covered with vulcanite. During normal service condition this ball is maintained
            in contact with its seating usually of leather backed rubber by the pressure in the main
            and cannot leave this seating except when the pressure falls practically to that of
Chapter-6                                                                                  Page 6-25
                                                    Technical Guidelines-Water Supply Components


            atmosphere. This occurs at various sections of a main when it is either being charged
            or emptied. When the pipes carrying a large orifice air valve, are empty, the valve is
            open and remains in that position until the ball is carried on to its seating by the
            arrival of water. Once on this seating and under pressure the valve cannot open and
            remains in that position even if the pipe is full of air until the pressure drops. It will
            be seen therefore that this valve will not release air accumulations under conditions of
            normal working pressure. When such a valve is discharging at a high rate, there is a
            risk that the ball although lying in a fully open position in the absence of water may
            nevertheless suddenly be caught in the escaping air stream and closed when it may
            refuse to open again until the pressure has been reduced. The ball of the valve in such
            a case would have to be held down during filling operation. This defect has been
            overcome in a large orifice air valve of the advanced design known as kinetic air
            valve. In this air valve water or air enters from the bottom side of the ball and the air
            rushing around the ball exerts the pressure and loosens the contact with the top
            opening and allows the ball to drop down. When the solid water reaches the ball,
            however it is at once displaced and instantly closed.

            Small Orifice Air Valve

            The Purpose of this valve is to discharge air which may accumulate in sections of a
            main under working conditions that is under the running pressure in the main. The
            orifice is relatively quite small and is sealed by a floating rubber covered ball at all
            pressures above atmospheric pressure except when air accumulates in this valve
            chamber. When air has accumulated to depress the water level sufficiently the ball
            falls away from out let orifice and the air escapes through this orifice until the water
            level rises again causing the ball to reseal the orifice. The diameter of the ball in a
            small orifice air valve is related to maximum working pressure and for a given size of
            orifice increase with this pressure. The orifice is not less than 2.5 mm in diameter.
            The size of air valve shall be ¼ to 1/6 of pipe diameter.

            Double Air Valves

            In many instances both large and small orifice air valves are required at the same
            point on a main and it is usual in such cases to fit a combined air valve in a single
            fitting. Double air valve is used for different dia. of pipe:

            Valve Size (mm)                            Diameter of Pipe (mm)
              40                                       Up to 100
              50                                       125 – 200
              80                                       250 – 350
              100                                      400 - 500

            Air inlet valves are used at peaks. A manually operated sluice valve is introduced
            between the air valve and the main pipe to isolate the air valve for the repairs.
            Normally, air valves are used with size equal to D/4 where D is the diameter of the
            main pipe on which the air valve is placed.

       iv) Reflux Valves

            Reflux valves as per IS: 5312 is also called check valves or non-return valves, which
            automatically prevent reversal of flow in a pipeline. They are useful in pumping
Chapter-6                                                                                   Page 6-26
                                                   Technical Guidelines-Water Supply Components


            mains when positioned near pumping stations to prevent back flow when the pump is
            shutdown. The reflux valve is normally provided on delivery side of each pump to
            prevent back flow into pump impeller and to avoid rotation of impeller in reverse
            direction. The size of the valve is equal to the same size as the pipeline on which it is
            installed. Reflux valves shall have by pass valves, which can be used for priming in
            the suction line before starting of the pumps.

6.8.   Anchor / Thrust Blocks

       Internal pressure including water hammer creates transverse stress or hoop tension. Bends
       and closures at dead ends or gates produce unbalanced pressure and longitudinal stress.
       When pipes are not permitted to change length, variations in temperature likewise create
       longitudinal stress. External loads and foundation reactions including the weight of the
       full conduit, and atmospheric pressure produce flexural stress.

       Bends end closures at dead produce unbalanced pressure and longitudinal stress in the
       pipeline. Further when pipes are not permitted to change length due to variations in
       temperature, pipes also expand and create longitudinal stress. Anchorages are necessary
       to resist the tendency of the pipes to pull apart at bends and restrain or direct the
       expansion and contraction of rigidly joined pipes under the influence of temperature
       changes. (Refer Appendix 6.6 of CPHEEO Manual on Water Supply & Treatment
       for Design of thrust block).

       Technical guidelines on Water Pumping Stations & Water Treatment Plants have been
       elaborated in Chapters 7 & 8 (Volume-1) respectively.

             MECHANICAL APPLIANCES/ EQUIPMENT

7.1.   Pumping Station

       The pumping units required for pumping water are housed in a building known as
       Pumping Station or Pump House. Serious thought must be given to this aspect as a
       properly designed layout will not only give a neat and pleasant appearance but also
       results in ease of operation and maintenance. The material for the construction of
       pumping station should be fire proof. The building of the pump house should offer an
       attractive look which arouses public faith and confidence in the water supply scheme.
       Care should be taken to avoid dampness in case of construction of pump house below
       ground. Necessary provision for semi rotary pump for dewatering floor water should be
       made. The building should be very well lightened and ventilated. The height of roof
       should be sufficient to accommodate the functioning of overhead crane. The door
       openings should be large enough so that the machinery can be taken in and out without
       any difficulty. In case of large pumping station with a provision of ramp in front of door
       opening to enable the truck to load and unload crane. Door openings are generally located
       at one end of the building. The floor of the pump house should be properly sloped to
       drain off water when floors are washed or when there is water through a leaking joint
       inside the pump house. Care shall be taken to avoid water entering the electrical
       equipment’s.

7.2.   General Requirements of Pumping Stations

       The following points deserve careful thought while deciding the general over all
       requirements of a pumping system:

           Adjust the layout of pumping plant in such a way that there is no suction lift, if
            possible or there should be minimum suction lift. There should be least possible
            number of bends particularly on the suction side to keep the losses to minimum
           Provide pumps of different capacities of maximum efficiency in case of variation in
            demand
           Provide largest pumping unit in duplicate or make provision for two pumps in
            reserve
           Make provision for overhead travelling crane in case of large installations and
            various equipment installed in the pumping station should be accessible to the
            overhead crane without disturbing the other units. In case of vertical pumps with
            hollow shaft motors, the clearance should be adequate to lift motor clear off the face
            of the coupling and also carry the motor to service bay
           Pumping station should be well lighted and well ventilated
           Prefer location of the pumping station on the bank of the river instead of bed.
            Likelihood of floods, hill slides near the pumping station area should be critically
            examined.

7.2.1. Space Requirement and Layout Planning of Pumping System

       The layout of various equipment’s requires skill and experience. Adequate space should
       be provided around each unit like pump, motor, valves, piping, control panels etc.
       Additional space should be provided for future expansion. Space requirement of
       equipment should be based on the catalogue of the equipment. It is necessary to have at
       least 1.0 m clearance between various equipment’s. Minimum 1.5 m wide unobstructed
       space should be available throughout the pump house building.

       A clear space of not less than 0.914 m (3 ft.) in width shall be provided in front of switch
       board. If there are any attachment or bare connections at the back of the switch board, the
       space (if any) behind the switch board shall be either less than 0.230 m (9”) or more than
       0.762 m (30”) in width measured from the farthest outstanding part of any attachment or
       conductor. If the space behind the switch board exceeds 0.763 m in width, there shall be a
       passage way from either end of the switch board clear to the height of 1.830 m (6 ft).




7.2.2. Foundation

       The foundation of pump house building requires careful consideration. The function of
       the foundation is to transmit all dead load of the structure including weight transmitted by
       overhead travelling crane and superimposed loads from a structure to the soil on which
       the structure rests. The width of the foundation is far more important than the depth.

7.3.        General Guidelines

                Pump room should be constructed near to the source, to minimize the cable size and
                 Length
                Construction of a new pump room may be avoided, if the community prefers to use
                 the existing panchayat owned building, if situated nearby the source to minimize the
                 estimate cost
                Necessary lighting arrangements inside and outside the pump room should be
                 provided for the convenience of the Pump Operator to operate the Pump set during
                 night hours
                Proper earthing should be ensured as per IE rules
                Pump room door should be fixed in such a way that it can be opened outwards only
                The pump room shall be constructed for centrifugal/jet pump sets following the
                 drawings and detailed estimates as per prevailing practice in the states.

7.4.        The Basic Concepts of Pump Engineering

            A pump is a machine which when driven by power from external source, raises water or
            any other fluid from lower level to higher level or increases the pressure i.e., it receives
            mechanical energy and raises the potential energy of fluid. Hence, the pump is just the
            inversion of hydraulic prime mover. Mainly there are two types of pumps, roto dynamic
            or dynamic pressure pumps and reciprocating or positive displacement type. The

Chapter-7                                                                                           Page 7-3
                                      Pumping Stations –Electro-Mechanical Appliances/ Equipment


       behaviour of positive displacement pumps is much different from that of the dynamic
       pressure pumps.

       When a tank is to be filled in a definite time period, the quantity of water to be delivered
       in a definite time period is the rate of discharge.

       To raise the head of water and to deliver it at a certain rate, power is required to drive the
       pump. This may be manual, mechanical or electrical. The pump takes power from the
       ‘Drive’ and delivers it to water. In this it consumes some of the power for itself. Hence
       the ratio of the power delivered to the water to the power taken from the drive expresses
       the efficiency of the pump.

       Head Considerations

       The pump sucks water and discharges it at a specified point. So the total head of the
       pump consists of two parts: (1) suction side head (2) delivery side head.

       Suction Side: On suction side, the pump draws water either (a) from the suction sump
       wherein water is below the centre line of the eye of the pump, or (b) from a suction well
       where in level of water is above the centre line of the eye of the pump.

       When the suction level is below the centre line of the pump, the pump (1) lifts water
       through the distance between the centre line of the pump and the suction water level
       when the pump is working. This is called static suction lift (hss). (2) the pump also
       overcomes the frictional losses in the suction pipe line and pipe fittings.

       Suction Lift (hs): This is the total of static suction lift (hss), the frictional losses in suction
       piping and the entrance losses at the beginning of the suction piping (hfs) and the pressure
       reduction due to velocity in suction pipe (numerically equal to the velocity head;
       (Vs2/2g).

       Therefore        hs= hss+hfs+Vs2/2g

       Suction lift as measured on the test bed is the reading indicated by vacuum gauge or
       water or mercury manometer at the suction side of the pump plus or minus the vertical
       distance between the point of the gauge or manometer and the centre line of the pump,
       according to the point of attachment of gauge above or below the centre line of the pump.

       Delivery Head (Hd): This is the sum of (i) static elevation difference between pump
       centre line and delivery point + (ii) Head loss in the delivery line.

       Total Head (H): The total head of the pump comprises of (1) the suction head and (2)
       delivery head. It may be noted that the total head would be either the addition of suction
       lift head and delivery head or the difference between the delivery head and suction head
       as the case may be.

       The total head is called the Pump Head, Pump Total Head or Total Dynamic Head. The
       total head H developed by the pump is customarily meters of water column in metric
       measure. Head in meters can be converted into pressure in kg/cm2 by dividing the head in
       meters by 10 (1kg/cm2 = 10 m head of water), Average fluid velocity V, is in
       meters/second (m/sec) where V = Q/A, Q is discharge in m3/sec and A is cross sectional
Chapter-7                                                                                        Page 7-4
                                    Pumping Stations –Electro-Mechanical Appliances/ Equipment


       area of flow passage in square meter (m2). Acceleration due to gravity g, in meters/Sec2 is
       assumed to be 9.81 m/Sec2.

       Friction Loses or Friction Head in Piping System

       This is the equivalent head required to overcome the resistance of pipe, valves (foot
       valve, gate valve, non-return valve etc.) and fittings (couplings, elbows, bends, tapers,
       tees, reducers etc.) Friction head exists both on suction and delivery sides of the pump
       and varies with the flow rate, size of piping, interior condition of pipe and type of pipe.

       Various type of friction losses are given below:

       a)   Loss of head in pipes
       b)   Loss of head due to enlargement of cross section of pipes
       c)   Loss of head due to contraction of cross section of pipes
       d)   Loss of head due to bends in pipes
       e)   Loss of heads due to pipe fittings such as tees, valves, expansion joints and strainers
            with foot valves etc.

7.5.   Classification of Water Pumps

       The pumps are categorised as given below:

7.5.1. Vertical Turbine Pump

       For obtaining ground water, bores are drilled even up to 150 m depth. The pump used
       under this situation is a multistage pump with vertical spindle. The pump is kept well
       under water. All the impellers and at least 3 m of suction pipe, with a strainer at the end,
       are placed below the water level. The motor or the engine is fixed on the ground level.
       The vertical shaft is co-axial with the rising main or delivery pipe and it is supported by
       several bearings which are water lubricated. This pump has an overall efficiency of about
       70% to 80%. Such pumps are capable of discharging 300 to 52000 litres/minute. These
       pumps are used for lifting water from deep tube-wells.

       In turbine pumps water flows in general direction of the axis of the pump through number
       of stages depending upon the head required. This pump is very compact. A powerful
       pump can be built in small dia. bores holes when larger flows are required. This pump
       works at much higher speed, which makes the system compact and lighter but it renders it
       more liable to break down and more difficult to repair.

       When pump is driven by an engine, a belt drive is employed for small and medium type
       pumps and toothed gearing for large sizes. The advantage of directly coupled pumping
       set is that it requires about 25% less power. It is necessary to have impellers and guide
       vanes made of corrosion resistant metals. The deep well turbine pump installation
       practically seals tube well from the exterior, thus protecting water from contamination.

       Criteria for selection of Turbine Pumps requires following details

           Dia. of open well or bore well
           If bore well, dia. and length of tube along with total depth

Chapter-7                                                                                  Page 7-5
                                    Pumping Stations –Electro-Mechanical Appliances/ Equipment


           If bore well, whether it has been tested for verticality and if tested, results of
            verticality test
           Depth of water level from the ground level in the driest season
           Expected depression in water level at the specified discharge
           Quantity of water required in lpm
           Vertical static height from the ground level to the delivery outlet point
           Running length and size of delivery pipe
           Number and sizes of fittings to be used on the delivery side
           Type of driver, electric motor or engine
           In case of electric motor, volts, cycle etc
           In case of oil engine drive, full particulars of engine, engine pulley dia and direction
            of rotation of engine.

7.5.2. Submersible Pumps

       The submersible pumping set should conform to IS: 8034 with latest amendment. The
       pump should be fitted with dynamically balance enclosed type impeller. Each impeller
       shall be balanced dynamically to grade of G 6.3 (6.3 mm/s). The pump shaft shall be
       guided by bearing provided in each stage bowl. The surface finish of shaft or of the
       protecting sleeves should be 0.75 micron Ra Max. The inlet passage of the suction casing
       shall be stream lined to avoid eddies. The suction case shall be fitted with a strainer of
       corrosion resistant material. Suitable sand guard shall be provided just above the suction
       case bearing to prevent the entry of foreign material into suction case. The pump should
       be provided with the non-return valve above the pump discharge case with standard
       flanged connection. The individual casting part or pump as a whole in assembled
       condition should be able to with stand a hydrostatic pressure of 1.5 time maximum
       discharge pressure. The gaskets & seals used shall conform to IS: 5120. The cable clamp
       of adequate size is supplied for fixing submersible cables to the rising main pipes.

       The pump shall be directly coupled to a submersible motor. The submersible motor shall
       be squirrel cage induction motor conforming to IS: 9283 or latest capable of operating on
       415+ 6% volts, 3 phase 50 cycles. A.C. supply both pump and motor shall run at 2900
       R.P.M. The water lubricated thrust bearing should be of adequate size to withstand the
       weight of all rotating parts as well as the imposed hydraulic thrust. The motor shall be
       protected by means of cable glands, rubber seals etc. from ingress of bore well water,
       sand and other foreign material. The motor shall be provided with breathing attachment
       like bellows, diaphragm etc. to compensate the volumetric variation due to change in the
       temperature. The motor shall be made of corrosion resisting material or suitable materials
       to resists corrosion under normal conditions. The rotor shall be provided with shaft
       protecting sleeves having a surface finish of 0.75 micron. The starter shall be star delta.
       Submersible cable of standard make for submersible motor shall conform to IS: 694
       (Part-III). The flanged column pipe shall conform table 2 IS: 1239 (Part-1) or latest
       (Medium Class) Table – 2.

       Normally they are installed at 1.5-2.0 m below the lowest safe yield level (means water
       level after drawdown) during summer under continuous operation. Hence it is necessary
       to install electronic water level indicators to read the water level in the bore well ensuring
       the required minimum submergence (1.5m) also to avoid drawing of the silt/sand from
       the bottom. It is preferable that the lowest part of the pump is 3m above bottom of the
       well. The casing pipe is taken to a height of about 45cm above the ground level and is

Chapter-7                                                                                   Page 7-6
                                      Pumping Stations –Electro-Mechanical Appliances/ Equipment


       covered with a bore cap. The H.P of motor shall be 15% in the excess of maximum H.P
       required under all heads of working. Performance guarantees shall be based on laboratory
       tests corrected for field performance.

       Submersible pumps are often a ‘tight’ fit in tube well as their outside dia. is usually only
       1-2 cm less than the internal hole of the well casing. Consequently great care is needed
       during installation and removal of these pumps. A water proof electric cable connects the
       motor.

7.5.3. Jet Pump

       In this type of pump the kinetic energy of high velocity jet of water is converted into
       water pressure in the portion of suction pipe immediately following a restricted opening
       or throat similar to discharge of venturi-meter. These pumps are also called sometimes
       Ejector Pumps. These pumps are less efficient than any other type of pump discussed so
       far but these have certain advantages which make these pumps suitable for very small
       supplies where conditions favour their installation. Jet pump is essentially a small
       centrifugal pump which forces water down a well at high pressure. This high pressure
       water, issuing from a jet into the throat of a venture tube, causes a larger volume of water
       at lower pressure to be delivered from the rising main. In this type of pump priming is
       necessary. Unless the whole system is filled with water, the operation will not start.

       The jet pump should not be installed where the suction lift is less than 6 m because a
       more efficient centrifugal pump can work under this situation in a better manner. Jet
       pumps work normally with a lift ranging from 6 m-55 m below ground and discharges
       range 570 lph to 22500 lph against a delivery head of about 15m. At all times jet must be
       covered by at least 1.5m of water so that well is not emptied completely.

       The specification covers the design, performance, manufacturing, shop testing, and
       erection, testing and commissioning at site of the horizontal centrifugal pumps.

       The design, manufacture and performance of the horizontal centrifugal pumps shall
       confirm to the latest revisions of the following codes and Indian Standards, in addition to
       other stipulations and standards mentioned elsewhere in the specification.

7.6.   Pump Efficiencies

       Pump efficiencies:-This varies with type of pumps and the manufacturer’s propriety
       designs. At the time of selecting and testing of pumps the specific characteristics of the
       pump should be obtained. Along with these the motor characteristic should also be made
       which gives motor output and motor efficiency relationship. Based on these the suitable
       motor and pump be selected.

       operating at 3000 rpm synchronous, suitable for 415 V +/- 6%, 3 Phase AC supply and
       specifications.

7.7.   Choice for the Type of Pump and Selection of Pump

       Prior to the selection of a pump for pumping station, detailed consideration has to be
       given to the various aspects as follows:

       a) Nature of water, whether raw or treated
       b) Type of duty required i.e. whether continuous, intermittent or cyclic
       c) Present and projected demand and pattern and pattern of change in demand
       d) The details of head and flow rate required
       e) Type and duration of the availability of the power supply
       f) Selecting the operating speed of the pump and suitable drive/driving gear
       g) The efficiency of pump and consequent influence on power consumption and the
          running cost
       h) Various options possible by permuting the parameters of the pumping system,
          including the capacity and number of pumps including stand byes, combining them
          in series or parallel
       i) Options of different modes of installation, their influence on the costs of civil,
          structural constructions, on the case of operation and maintenance and on the overall
          economics.

       The final selection of the pump should be done in considerations of the parameters of
       head, discharge and speed as per Para 11.1.4 of CPHEEO Manual on Water Supply &
       Treatment. For consideration of the suction lift capacity in the pump selection, Para
       11.1.5 and for consideration of the system head curve in pump selection, Para 11.1.6 of
       the same CPHEEO Manual may be referred.

7.8.       Installation of Pumps

           Pump installation: Most pumps to be mounted horizontally are supplied as fully
           assembled unit while those to be mounted vertically are supplied as sub-assemblies. The
           installation has to be under taken in following five stages:

           i.      Preparing the foundation and locating the foundation bolts
           ii.     Locating the pump on the foundation bolts, however resting on levelling wedges
                   to permit easy levelling and also filling the gap with grout
           iii.    Levelling
           iv.     Grouting
           v.      Alignment

7.8.1. Foundation

           The right type of foundation is most important for the success of any pumping
           installation. All pump installations require base plates and foundation blocks. The
           foundation block for the pumping unit is designed for (a) weight of the pumping unit, (b)


11
     CPHEEO Manual on Water Supply & Treatment-Latest Edition –Table 11.3
Chapter-7                                                                                       Page 7-9
                                   Pumping Stations –Electro-Mechanical Appliances/ Equipment


       weight of concrete foundation block, (c) area of foundation block (d) isolation of
       foundation block from the surrounding structure to absorb the vibration.

       In order to meet the above requirements, the foundation block must be adequate in size
       and mass, rest on an adequate bearing surface, provide an accurately finished mounting
       surface and be provided with necessary anchor bolts. The size of the foundation concrete
       block and anchor bolts are generally supplied by the manufacturers of the pumping units.

       The size of foundation block depends upon the dimensions and weight of the pumping
       unit. The following minimum standards are recommended:

       a) Length and width of foundation block should exceed the length and width of the base
          plate of the equipment by minimum 15 cm on either side. The position of holding
          down bolts generally determines the width and length of the base
       b) The depth should be adequate to provide weight equal to 1.3 to 1.5 times the weight
          of the equipment and that there is sufficient depth to accommodate the holding down
          bolts properly. The weight of the foundation block should be sufficient to counter-act
          the sliding against horizontal thrust and to resist the uplift effect. The depth of the
          base must be such that the bottom is on satisfactory bearing stratum
       c) The area of the concrete block for machinery must be sufficient to spread the load on
          the ground without exceeding the safe bearing pressure. The centrifugal pump owing
          to common fabricated base plate and adequate holding down arrangements create
          vibration to nominal extent. When vibration is transmitted to ground, the bearing
          pressure considerably decreases in comparison to as generally assumed for the class
          of ground upon which the base bears
       d) The foundation anchor bolts used to hold the equipment in place should be of the
          material recommended by the manufacturer of the equipment. Anchor bolts are
          usually supplied by the manufacturer along with the equipment. The diameter of bolts
          is according to the mounting holes of the equipment. The length should be equivalent
          to minimum embedded length of 30 times the dia. plus necessary length for J or L
          hook. An additional 14 to 15 cm length should be provided above the top surface of
          foundation for grouting sole plate, shims, equipment base washers and nuts, plus
          small variations in surface level of the foundation block. While laying the foundation
          block concrete, the location of holes is left in concrete, with the help of a sleeve of
          pipe or by some other suitable means to allow for adjustment required for the bolts to
          conform to mounting holes locations. The holes are filled in with concrete after fixing
          in position the pumping installation
       e) It is very important to isolate the foundation block of the equipment from the building
          structure because of vibrations. Cork rubber or lead sheet is used in case of heavier
          pumping installations. Manufacturer’s instructions should be followed in respect of
          isolation materials. Cork or lead sheet is provided between the foundation block and
          the lower soil. Isolation can be obtained by filling in sand between the foundation
          block and the side soil. For continuous vibration due to machinery, an allowance of
          25% or more by increasing the total load should be made. A single base should be
          provided under various supports of pumping machinery and sudden changes in depth
          and width should be avoided
       f) Chain pulley blocks or overhead crane is required for the installation, maintenance
          and repair of the pumps and motors. Depending upon the requirement and the weight
          of different component of the machinery, simple spur gear pulley blocks with high
          tensile steel chains, single or double girder type, hand operated or power operated
          over-head cranes are provided for handling the equipment. Despite the increasing use
Chapter-7                                                                               Page 7-10
                                    Pumping Stations –Electro-Mechanical Appliances/ Equipment


            of power operated overhead cranes, there remain many situations where the use of
            hand operated crane is ideal either for economic or operational reasons. Following
            types of girders are required as follows :

             Double Girder Type

               (Capacity 2 to 25 tons. Span 3 to 15.25m)

               Heavy structural steel sections are bolted to fabricate steel end carriages to form a
               rigid and stable bridge structure. Four double flanged tram wheels carried on
               fixed axles carry the crane. Two of these tram wheels are given to provide the
               long travel motion, the effort being applied to a larger dia. Chain wheel keyed on
               to steel shaft spanning the full length of the cane bridge.

             Single Girder Type

               (Capacity 1/2 to 10 tons, span 3 to 15.25m)

               The single Girder is basically similar in construction to the double girder crane,
               the two bridge girders being replaced by a single girder, with the hoisting unit
               built into a trolley which travels along the lower flange of the girder. The basic
               hoist unit is the worm gear pulley block which can be arranged for either push or
               hand gear travel.

7.9.   Limitations on Use of Pumps

       Do not run the pump:
        Well beyond the recommended range of the particular pump
        Without lubricating the bearings with grease or oil, as the case may be
        With liquid other than specified
        With less NPSH than recommended
        With delivery valve completely closed for longer period
        When misaligned
        Without lubricant to the stuffing box either internal or external
        Unless periodically checked
        When undue weight on suction and delivery side flanges
        Without proper priming
        When strainer is removed from suction.

7.10. Automation Aspects of Pumping Plants

       For efficient and cost effective aspects of the Pumping Plants, automation of pumping
       plant is required. Following aspects should be considered for automation of pumping
       plant:

       1.    As the electric supply is erratic in rural/remote areas, the potable water supply is
             also affected by the same. IC is very important to utilize the electrical motor of
             pumping plant at “off peak hours” to get rid of power scarcity at “peak load hours”.
             So for these requirements, some sort of automation, rather involvement of


Chapter-7                                                                                 Page 7-11
                                    Pumping Stations –Electro-Mechanical Appliances/ Equipment


             “Artificial Intelligence” is required to minimize the manual errors in the operation
             only
       2.    In water tanks provision of over flow is very common phenomenon. Due to slight
             human carelessness, plenty of potable water is being wasted. As potable water is
             precious, it’s proper management is necessary for the survival of human race. Thus
             some device which can regulate and optimize the required amount of water and
             conservation of energy due to need based automatic run of the motor has become
             necessary
       3.    Human being has their own limitation. Manual operator can’t observe the control
             panel continuously and thus they can’t prevent the damage caused by nuisance in
             power system e.g. single phasing, over loading, tripping & restoring of fault/healthy
             condition momentarily. Further to detect & rectify the dry running condition is
             beyond the human control without observing the panel continuously during their
             (pump operator) duty period; continuous observing is simply impractical by all
             means. Hence the motor is exposed to extensive damage
       4.    For optimum and judicious use of power, we need time controlling devices. We
             should prevent the pump/motor to get operated at “peak load hours” & allow the
             operation of motor/pump at “off peak hour”. This will provide us continuous supply
             of water and at the same time maximum judicious utilization of power supply too.
             This system/concept is also necessary for booster pump water supply system (Direct
             injection system) by the help of pre-set timer
       5.    We need to record the total/cumulative hours for which motor has run. By the help
             of it we could calculate the total amount of water pumped by the plant, efficiency of
             motor, condition & level of ground water can be analyse. This will help us to
             minimize/optimize the electrical energy/ ground water use
       6.    Mechanization has made human beings dependent on automation. For uninterrupted
             water supply if a motor/pump burns out, damaged extensively or fails to operate in
             time the masses will suffer beyond the imagination.
       7.    Hence the device, we need should provide us all the above condition on a compact
             display system which will help in its effective monitoring.
       8.    Keeping in the view the socio-economical factor, scarcity of potable water in future
             and maintenance/operation problems the automatic pump operating system have
             been designed, developed and produced in India by some of the firms
       9.    The “Automatic Controller” a dedicated designed controller (on digital signalling
             principle) will regulate the ON/OFF of electric motor for maintaining optimum
             desired level of water in tank/reservoir in all weathers all the time. This will
             minimize the wastage of precious potable water & wastage of electric power & on
             other hand, uninterrupted water supply to the masses.
       10.   “Single Phasing preventer” prohibits the use of motor/pump under faulty conditions
             i.e. single phasing and unbalanced power supply & provides 3 second time delay
             system as well
       11.   “Dry Running Preventer” is there to stop the motor under dry condition to protect it
             to get burnt. “Overload Relay” is there as first line protection device; it protects the
             motor in overloading condition
       12.   “Back up protection” is provided as second line protection by HRC fuse links
       13.   Time controller device/feature restricts/allows the motor to run according to preset
             time slot. Approx. 45 time settings can be fed with minimum time slot of 20
             minutes and there is no limit for the maximum time set. The clock can run even
             for150 hour in one set and is regulated by rechargeable batteries

       14.    Pumping time recorder records the total time for which motor has run & by it, one
              can calculate the total water lifted. The recorder can record 99,999,99 hours
              Cumulatively and will get reset automatically
       15.    “Artificial Intelligence” is provided in this system to synchronize all the
              components with each other. In simple, it the replacement of “human intelligence”
       16.     As no system is fool-proof, but failure must be on safer side. Keeping this view in
              mind Auto/Manual changeover switch is provided for manual operation at will,
              especially when we desire more water than present time
       17.    Display panel should be very compact, precise & clearly visible
       18.    It should be robust and pleasantly powder coated and vermi proof, corrosion free
              and well ventilated
       19.    The manufacturer should provide warranty of one-year time, with prompt and
              effective after sales service.

       (Volume-1) may be referred.

7.11. Pump Priming

       When the pump is at rest for some time, water leaks from the casing of the pump and
       suction pipe and to suction sump. The casing and the suction pipe thus remain filled with
       air. If pump is started under this condition, it will produce only negligible pressure
       difference across the impeller which is inadequate for the creation of proper vacuum to
       enable water to rise along the suction pipe to reach the impeller. It becomes, therefore,
       necessary to first fill up suction pipe and casing of the pump with water. This filling up
       operation is termed as ‘Priming’.

       There are several priming methods which may be used for many types of pumps:

       1. With a flooded suction
       2. A bypass around the discharge check valve
       3. The separate air drawing pump from the casing at the main pump to give priming
          action
       4. An ejector for priming
       5. A priming tank holding the supply of water
       6. Vacuum pumps manually and automatically controlled to prime the main pump.

       In case of small pumps, priming is accomplished by pouring water directly in the casing
       through a funnel. The air vent cocks provided over the casing are kept open for expulsion
       of air during priming process. When the air has completely been displaced from the pump
       casing and suction pipe and the piping system on suction side is throughout filled with
       water, the air cocks are closed and the pump started.

7.12. Pump Accessories

            Foot Valve

             This is a sort of check valve which is fitted at the bottom or foot of the suction line.
             The foot valve remains open while the pump is running. When the pump is stopped,
             the foot valve closes and it prevents water in the suction line to drain back to suction
             sump as long as the seat of the foot valve closes tightly.
Chapter-7                                                                                  Page 7-13

            At several occasions the foot valve falls to seat tightly and suction piping gets
            emptied. In most of the cases the rate of leakage is small and it is usually possible to
            start the pumping after doing required priming of the pump. In case, water being
            pumped contains small particles of foreign matter, the trouble is further increased.
            Another big disadvantage in the application of foot valve is that it has high frictional
            loss.

            The foot valve should be of hinged flap type with a clear passage for water of at least
            the same area as that of the suction pipe. The foot valve should be provided with an
            efficient strainer to prevent foreign matter from being drawn into the pump. The clear
            area of the openings of the strainer should be at least 3 times the area of suction pipe
            for clear water. Much more area is required for water containing foreign matter.

           Suction Sump and Suction Piping

            For best results, the sump or sump bays are located parallel to the direction of flow. In
            case the flow approaches from an angle it creates high local velocities and dead
            spaces which result in non-uniform velocity and increase in entrance losses. The
            pipes should be arranged in such a manner that the flow to any pump should not be
            required to pass another pump before reaching it. The inflow in the suction sump
            should be at the farthest end from the suction pipe to avoid effect of turbulence.

           Delivery Pipes and Fittings

            A check valve (non-return or reflux valve) and a gate (sluice) valve is installed on the
            delivery line. The check valve is fixed between the pump and the sluice valve to
            protect the pump from abnormal pressure and to avoid water getting back though the
            pump upon shut down or power failure. The sluice valve is used for priming
            operation and starting. The sluice valve is closed before stopping the pump. When a
            reducer is required in between pump delivery end and delivery line because of the
            change in diameters of the two, the reducer is fixed between the reflux valve and the
            pump. Pressure relief valves, air valves, reflux valves and scour valves are also
            provided on the delivery line.

            Mani folding the discharge header is a usual practice in the design because with this
            parallel operation can be achieved readily. Interconnecting of discharge headers
            affords additional system flexibility and added protection in the event of pipe failure.

            Devices for reducing water hammer effect will provide a fairly good idea of the
            requirement of fittings required for a particular system. The design of discharge and
            suction line required to be connected with reciprocating type pump is done with about
            50% in excess of the normal working pressure

            The discharge piping should be supported close to the pump flange to prevent
            vibration and strain on the pump casing. The velocity in the delivery pipe is usually
            1.5 to 3.5 m/sec, generally about 2.5 m/sec.

            A pressure gauge is fitted on the delivery side to indicate pressure during the working
            of pump.


Chapter-7                                                                                  Page 7-14

            The sluice valve on delivery side of the centrifugal pump must be closed when the
            pump is being started and till it builds up pressure.

7.13. Motors

7.13.1. Capacity

       The power required to drive the centrifugal pump from shut off to maximum capacity
       varies. Power requirement is minimum at shut-off head and maximum at or near the
       maximum capacity. Operations of pumps at heads below the normal increase the load of
       the drive and sometimes causes overload.

       Therefore in order to avoid continuous overloading of the electric motor, the rated KW of
       the motor should exceed the KW calculated by the following percentages:

           For a pump requiring up to 1.5 KW, add about 50%
           For a pump requiring from 1.5 to 3.7 KW, add about 40%
           For a pump requiring from 3.7 to 7.5 KW, add about 30%
           For a pump requiring up to 7.5 to 15 KW, add about 20%
           For a pump requiring up to 15 to 75 KW, add about 15%
           Above 75 KW about 10%.

       Electric motors below 1/3 hp are not used for driving pumps. For 50 c/s frequency, the
       speed of an induction type motor may be about 1450 to 2900 rpm. Indian Standard 6295
       specifies an allowance for the falloff overall efficiency up to 2% for electric motors for
       every 300 m altitude above mean sea level. Care should be taken in selecting the motors.
       It should be large enough to avoid overload and not too large that power is wasted.

7.13.2. Performance of Motors

       Motors are designed to produce their rated horsepower, torque and speed at specific line
       voltage, line frequency and ambient temperature. The motor will work at a specific
       efficiency and power factor when all these conditions are met.

       The normal operating conditions of a motor are indicated on its name plate with values of
       horse power, speed, ambient temperature and frequency. Any change in conditions from
       the motor name plate will change the performance of the motor.

7.13.3. Energy Efficient Motors

       In line of provision of the Energy Conservation Act 2001. It is the requirement of the day
       to reduce Specific Energy consumptions to keep loads to the minimum. Electric Motors
       consume substantial energy in water supply pumping by providing energy efficient
       motors. We not only limit the initial power load but also energy consumption is reduced
       considerably. Efforts have been made to reduce the power loss due to heat generation in
       motor to the extent of 40% by using best quality of materials. That makes motor efficient
       to draw lesser power from the system. Based on the International Standard IEC 60034-30
       (2008), the Bureau of Indian Standard (IS) have released IS: 12615 which defines new
       Efficiency Classification of single speed, three phase induction motors. The new range of
       motors not only reduces energy consumption but also lead to higher energy savings. For

Chapter-7                                                                              Page 7-15
                                    Pumping Stations –Electro-Mechanical Appliances/ Equipment


       example if a 75 kW Pole premium motor is used instead of standard efficiency motor at
       85% full load for 5840 Hrs. (1 Year of running the total saving from only one motor will
       be about 9000KWh).

       The method of cooling shall be governed as per IS: 6362. The motors are to be
       operational at nominal voltage and frequency with tolerance as per IS: 325. Government
       of India has constituted a statuary body by the name of Bureau of Energy Efficiency
       (BEE) under the Ministry of Power. The bureau rates the different electrical equipment’s
       on the basis of their energy efficiency and awards different number of stars, 5 for highest
       energy efficiency.

       For various star ratings, overall efficiency shall be as follows:

                  Star Rating         Overall efficiency as per IS: 8034: 2002
                  4 Star              >= 1.15 & 1.20
                  5 Star              >= 1.20

       The cost of motor also increases accordingly. Thus over all economics may be worked
       out based on capital cost of motor along with capitalised value of the recurring
       expenditure per year for the working life of the motor.

7.13.4. Voltage

       Motor is designed to operate through 3 phases, 50 c/s, 415 + 6% & 415 – 15% voltage
       AC supply. It shall operate satisfactorily at the name plate rating with + 10% variation
       from name plate voltage. Within + 10% voltage, a motor is expected to operate pump
       safely and continuously. If the motor voltage never increases beyond 70%, the centrifugal
       pump would not reach normal operating speed.

       Different motor voltage from name plate rated voltage will affect the motor speed, power
       factor and efficiency established for rated voltage and load.

7.13.5. Single Phasing on Three Phase Motor

       Occurrence of single phasing on three phase motor will cause overheating and possible
       burnout. Theoretically a three phase machine will not start on single phase but in the
       running position if one lines is broken motor will continue to run but with unbalanced
       current loading as described below:

       In case of both star delta connecting motors, a break in one phase of the supply means
       that the output taken from the machine must be reduced to less than half of the normal
       output. To minimize the risk of such a break in one phase of the supply, check the
       distribution fuses. They should have the capacity of at least three times the full load
       current rating of the motor.

7.13.6. Earthing

       Various types of earth electrodes in use are Rod and Pipe electrodes, Strip electrodes and
       Plate electrodes. Round and flat sections of copper and GI wire are used for earthing
       purpose. No earth wire shall have cross sectional area less than 3 mm2.

Chapter-7                                                                               Page 7-16

7.14. Design of Machine Foundation

       Depending on the type of pumps the structural support of the pump shall be designed. For
       example the vertical turbine pumps which have motor at the top supported on girders and
       the pump submerged in water along with the assembly shall have proper structural
       support to take care of pump and assembly loads along with the load of pump, the water
       inside the piping as well as the extra load on account of vibrations. The centrifugal pumps
       inside the dry sump are supported on the floor through the base plate fixed on the pump
       block. For such installation the foundation should be adequate to absorb vibrations and to
       form a permanent rigid support for the base plate. The capacity of the soil should be
       adequate to withstand the entire load of the foundation and the dynamic load of the
       machinery. Thus the total load in such cases will be as below:

       a) Construction loads
       b) Three times the weight of the pump
       c) Two times the weight of motor.

       In case of vertical turbine pumps additional load of water in the column pipe as well as
       half of the weight of the unsupported pipe connected to the pump flange has also to be
       taken into account. Depending on the safe bearing capacity of the soil at times it becomes
       necessary to spread the load through providing a raft in the floor of the slab. Based on the
       total load and the bearing capacity of the soil at times pile foundation may become
       necessary. The structural designs have therefore to be done as per overall design of the
       pump house structure.

       Foundations for the machines have to be specially designed taking into consideration the
       impact and vibration characteristics of the load and the properties of soil under dynamic
       conditions. While many of special features relating to the design and construction of such
       machine foundation will have to be as advised by the manufacturer of machine, still a
       large part of the details will have to be according to certain general principle of design
       covering machine foundation. There may be different type of machines requiring
       foundations of different types and such different foundations shall have to be designed
       based on the design guide line laid down in respective codes relating to type of machine.
       Such as reciprocating machine requires rigid type foundation and impact type machine
       requires hammer type foundation. As already mentioned properties of soil under dynamic
       conditions plays an important role in achieving successfulness of the particular machine
       foundation in topic. Pumping plant (machine) foundation is one of them and it is designed
       with respect to relevant code. As already explained the manufacturer has to provide
       relevant data for designing apart from those available in relevant IS code of practice. IS:
       code 2974 (part- 4) seems to be best suited for design of pumping plant machine
       foundation.

       Following Table shows IS Codes references (With latest revision) for designing of
       machine foundations:

                                                    8. WATER TREATMENT

8.1.   General

       The aim of Water Treatment is to produce and supply water that is hygienically safe,
       aesthetically attractive and palatable, in an economical manner. Though the treatment of
       water would achieve the desired quality, the evaluation of its quality should not be
       confined to the end of treatment facilities but should be extended to the point of
       consumer use. In this, different operations are carried out for making raw water obtained
       from various sources fit for use.

       In Bihar, Jharkhand and U.P states, the ground water is the main source of water supply
       to the villages. Thus for most of the schemes such as Singe Village Scheme (SHS/SGS)
       source of water supply is normally adopted ground water as it is economical which do not
       require much treatment and can be supplied with disinfection alone. If ground water is
       effected with fluoride/arsenic contamination, treatment plants are not suggested due to
       possible environmental problem of refuse/sludge handling. Thus in such area water will
       be provided with surface source. For other chemical contamination in water, specific
       treatment plants are to be provided which needs skilled personnel for operation and
       constant attention apart from high capital and O&M cost.

       Ground water may be extracted from tube wells or dug wells. Surface water can be
       extracted through intake wells, infiltration gallery and infiltration wells. Generally water
       from infiltration gallery/infiltration well does not require any treatment other than
       disinfection. Surface water directly taken from streams, canals, dams and ponds required
       proper treatment as per impurities of raw water.

8.2.   Methods of Treatment and Flow sheets

       The aim of water treatment is to produce and maintain water that is hygienically safe. The
       method of treatment to be employed depends on the nature of raw water constituents on
       the desired standards of water quality. The unit operations in water treatment include
       aeration, flocculation and clarification, filtration, disinfection, softening, deferrization,
       de-fluoridation and water conditioning and many different combinations of these to suit
       the requirements.

       In the case of surface waters and ground waters, when the water has turbidity below 10
       NTU plain disinfection by chlorination is adopted as shown in flow diagrams (a) & (b).

       When the ground water contains excessive iron, dissolved carbon dioxide, aeration
       followed by flocculation (rapid and slow mixing) and sedimentation, rapid gravity or
       pressure filtration and disinfection may be necessary as in flow diagram (c).

       In surface waters with turbidity not exceeding 50 NTU and where sufficient area is
       available, plain sedimentation followed by slow sand filtration and disinfection are

       Conventional treatment including pre-chlorination, aeration, flocculation (rapid and slow
       mixing) and sedimentation, rapid gravity filtration and post chlorination are adopted for
       highly polluted surface waters laden with algae or other microorganisms as shown in
       Flow diagram (e).

       Sometimes, unconventional flow sheets may be adopted for waters of low turbidity
       (below 1 to 15 NTU) and containing low concentration of suspended matter as in flow
       diagram (f).

       Water with excessive hardness needs softening as in flow diagram (g), for removal of
       dissolved solids, demineralization by ion exchange may form a part of the domestic or
       industrial as in flow diagram (h).

       The above operations are discussed below:

8.2.1. Aeration

       It is the process of bringing water in intimate contact with air, while doing so the water
       absorbs oxygen from the air. The carbon dioxide gas is also removed up to 70% and up to
       certain extent bacteria is also killed. Iron, manganese and H2S gas are also removed up to
       certain extent from the water.

       Aerators are broadly classified in four categories:

       A.   Diffused Type
       B.   Spray Type
       C.   Mechanical Type
       D.   Gravity Type

8.2.1.1.By Air Diffusion

       In this method perforated pipes are fixed in the bottom of the settling tanks. The
       compressed air is blown through the pipes which comes out in the form of bubbles and
       stirs the whole water at greater speed. During the upward moment of the air, it is
       thoroughly mixed with the water and does its aeration. The aeration tanks are usually
       made 2.5 to 3.0 m deep and work on the principle of continuous flow, having minimum
       detention period of 15 minutes (at the average flow). The quantity of air consumed varies
       from 0.3 to 0.6 cu.m. per 1000 litres of water.

8.2.1.2.By Using Spray Nozzles

       In this method the water is blown up in the air into the fine sprays to a height of 2 to 2.5
       m under water pressure of 0.7 to 11.5 kg/cm2. When small particles of water come in
       contact of greater surface area of the air, they absorb it and the water is aerated. The

Chapter-8                                                                                      Page 8-3
                                                                                  Water Treatment


       dissolved gases like H2S, CO2 etc. escape into the atmosphere and the oxidation of
       various substances and organic matter takes place.

8.2.1.3.By Trickling Beds

       In this method the water is allowed to flow on the trickling beds of coke which are
       supported on the perforated bottoms of the trays. The water is allowed to trickle from the
       top to the bottom under gravitational force. During this downward movement, the water
       gets mixed up with the air and the aeration takes place. The size of the coke tray ranges
       between 50 and 75 cm. The efficiency of this method is more than ‘cascades’, but it is
       less effective than the method of spray ‘nozzles’.

8.2.1.4.By Using Cascades

       In this method the water is allowed to fall over a series of concrete steps or over a weir
       etc. in thin film. During the fall, the water gets thoroughly mixed with the atmospheric air
       and gets aerated.

       In the rural water supply schemes the gravity type cascade aerator may be used. The
       design parameters are given below:

              1.   No. of steps               =        3 to 6 normally
              2.   Space requirement          =        0.015 to 0.045 sqm/cum.h
              3.   Head required              =        0.5 to 3 m
              4.   Tread of Step              =        20 to 40 cm
              5.   Rise of step               =        20 to 40 cm
              6.   Velocity of water          =        0.6 m/s to 0.9 m/s
                   CO2 removal efficiency     =        20 to 45%
                   H2S removal efficiency     =        35%

       Figure is given below:

8.2.2. Screening

       Screens are generally provided in front of the pumps or the intake works, so as to exclude
       the large size particles such as debris, trees, animals, bushes etc. Coarse and fine screens
       are to be provided for better result. While designing screens clear opening should be

                                                                                   Water Treatment


       provided. The materials which are deposited on upstream of screen should be removed
       regularly manually or mechanically

8.2.3. Plain Sedimentation and Coagulation

       Plain sedimentation is required from one to several days without subsequent filtration.
       Plain sedimentation has little effect in removing small suspended particles in water. The
       larger and heavier particles, however, settle depending upon their size and the velocity of
       flow in water where chemicals are introduced to hasten the process of settling, the
       addition of chemical is called ‘Coagulation’. The process of addition of chemicals to
       separate the dissolved impurities out of solution is known as ‘Chemical Precipitation’ and
       the sedimentation process after the addition of chemicals is described as ‘Sedimentation’
       or ‘Post Sedimentation’.

       River or stream waters with heavy loads of silt even up to 5000 ppm during rainy season
       are subjected to sedimentation both before and after coagulation or precipitation. Much
       longer settling time is required for basins preceding slow sand filters than for rapid sand
       filters. Rectangular tanks have lengths commonly up to 30 m but larger lengths up to 100
       m have also been adopted.

       The factors influencing the sedimentation process are:

       1.        Size, shape and weight of floc
       2.        Viscosity and temperature of water
       3.        Effective average period available for sedimentation (Detention period)
       4.        Effective depth of tank
       5.        Surface area
       6.        Surface over flow rate.
       7.        Velocity of flow
       8.        Inlet and outlet design.

            1.    It is necessary to study the characteristics and nature of the suspended matter
                  present in the raw water.
            2.    Viscosity and temperature of water: Viscosity of water has definite influence on
                  the efficiency of settling process. The rate of sedimentation of water at 30 C
                  temperatures is 2.3 times more than that at zero degree celsius temperature. It is,
                  therefore, necessary to keep this influence in view while designing the settling
                  tanks intended to handle cold waters.

                                                                                  Water Treatment


8.2.4. Coagulant Dosage

       Although there is some relation between turbidity of the raw water and the proper
       coagulant dosage, the exact quantity can be determined only by trial. Even thus
       determined, the amount will vary with other factors such as time of mixing and water
       temperature. The use of the minimum quantity of coagulant determined to be effective in
       producing good flocculation in any given water, will usually require a fairly long stirring
       periods varying from 15 to 30 minutes in summer and 30 to 60 minutes in the colder
       months, as water temperatures approach the freezing point.

       Addition of coagulants in excess of the determined minimum quantity may increase
       bactericidal efficiency. It is, however, usually more economical to use the minimum
       quantity of coagulant and to depend on disinfectant for bacterial safety.

       Very finely divided suspended matter is more difficult to coagulate than coarse particles,
       necessitating a large quantity of coagulant for a given turbidity. The cation-exchange
       capacity of the particles of turbidity bears a significant relationship to the success of
       flocculation.

8.2.5. Choice of Coagulant

       In selecting the best coagulant for any specific treatment problem, a choice has to be
       made from among various chemicals, each of which may offer specified advantages
       under different conditions. The common coagulants used in water works practice are salts
       of aluminium viz. filter alum, sodium aluminate and liquid alum and iron salts like
       ferrous sulphate (Copperas), ferric sulphate, and ferric chloride.

       Selection of aluminium or iron coagulants is largely decided by the suitability of either
       type or its easy availability. Both filter alum and ferric sulphate have certain specific
       advantages. Alum does not cause the unsightly reddish brown staining of floors, walls as
       against ferric form of iron salts. The dissolving of ferric sulphate also offers difficulties
       not encountered with alum. The trivalent aluminium iron is not reduced to a more soluble
       bivalent iron, as may be the case when ferric salts are used with waters high in organic
       matter. On the other hand, ferric floc is denser than alum floc and is more completely
       precipitated over a wider pH range. Also good flocculation with alum is not possible in
       some waters.

       The choice of the coagulant to be used for any particular water should preferably be
       based upon a series of jar tests, so planned that it will permit accurate comparison of the
       materials, being studied under identical experimental conditions. The coagulant dose in
       the field should be judiciously controlled in the light of the jar test values.

8.2.6. Rapid Mixing

       The purpose of rapid mixing is to disperse coagulant throughout the mass of water
       rapidly and uniformly to create a homogeneous system. These help in the formation of
       micro-flocs and results in proper utilization of coagulant and avoid premature formation
       of hydroxide which leads to less effective utilization of the coagulant.

       The devises used for rapid mixing can be broadly classified as:

Chapter-8                                                                                  Page 8-6
                                                                                   Water Treatment


       a.   Gravitational or Hydraulic Mixers
       b.   Mechanical Mixer
       c.   Diffusers and injection mixers
       d.   Inline mixers.

       (A) Gravitational or Hydraulic Mixing: In rural water supply scheme hydraulic jump
       mixer is recommended.

       (1) Hydraulic Jump Mixer: The arrangement of hydraulic jump mixer consists of
       combination of a chute followed by a channel with or without sill. Coagulant is
       introduced to the water ahead of its entrance into an open, slopping portion. In passing
       down the flume, super critical velocity i.e. 3 to 4 m/s is created by the chute and the
       channel with a gentle slope induces the jump. These flumes constructed for the purpose
       of measurement of flow in the water works system can also be used in which the
       hydraulic jump occurs at the throat of the flume. The loss of head in hydraulic jump
       mixing is to the extent of 30 cm to 60 cm. In case of large plants this arrangement of
       measuring device can be used as a stand-by to mechanical mixers. For small plants this
       can directly serve the purpose. Overflow weirs have also been used for rapid mix. A head
       loss of 0.3 m to 0.6 m across the weir and detention time 2 seconds have been reported.

8.3.   Types of Sedimentation Tanks

       The three types of sedimentation tanks are:

       1. Rectangular tanks
       2. Circular tanks
       3. Hopper bottom tanks

       1)    Rectangular Tanks

             These are rectangular in plan and consist of large number of baffle walls. The
             function of baffle walls is to reduce the velocity of incoming water to increase the
             effective length of travel of the particle and prevent the short circuiting. These tanks
             are generally provided with channel type inlet and outlet extending on the full
             width. The floor between two baffles is made like a hopper sloping towards centre
             where sludge-pipe is provided. The sludge is taken out through sludge outlet under
             hydrostatic force by operating the gate-valve.

       2)    Circular Tanks

             These are generally not used in plain sedimentation, but are mostly used in
             sedimentation with coagulation. There are two types of circular sedimentation tanks
             classified on the basis of flow of water inside it.

             a.    Radial flow circular tank

                   The water enters in this tank through the central inlet pipe placed inside the
                   deflector box. The deflector box deflects the water downwards and then it
                   goes out through the holes provided in the bottom sides of the deflector box.
                   The water flows radically from the deflector box towards the circumference of
                   the tank, where an outlet is provided on the full periphery. All the suspended
Chapter-8                                                                                   Page 8-7
                                                                                 Water Treatment


                  particles settle downward on the sloppy floor and clear water goes through the
                  outlet. The sludge is removed on the story floor and clear water goes through
                  the outlet. The sludge is removed by scrapper (known as raking arm), which
                  continuously moves around the floor at a very small velocity. The maximum
                  velocity of raking arm does not exceed 4.5 metres/hour.

            b.    Circumferential flow circular tank.

                  Water enters in the tank through two or three vertical slits. There is one
                  rotating arm in the tank, which allows the water to move along the
                  circumference of the tank. Water while moving at very low velocity allows its
                  suspended impurities to settle in the tank, which can be removed from sludge
                  outlet. The clear water is drawn over a small weir type outlet.

       3)   Hopper Bottom Tanks:

            These are vertical flow tanks, because water flows upward and downward in these
            tanks. The water enters in these tanks from the top into deflector box. After flowing
            downwards inside the deflector box the water reverses its direction and starts
            flowing upward around the deflector box. The suspended particles having specific
            gravity more than one, cannot follow the water at the time of reversing its direction,
            and settle in the bottom, from where they are removed through sludge outlet pipe
            under hydrostatic pressure. Rows of decanting channels are provided at the top to
            collect the clear water. The water after flowing in the channel is taken out from the
            outlet channel provided on one side of the tank. These tanks are mostly used in
            sedimentation with coagulation process.

8.4.   Tube Settler

       This manual is prepared for village water supply schemes and for it rapid settling unit i.e.
       Tube Settler may also be most suitable technology for sedimentation.

       Settling efficiency of a basin is primarily dependent upon surface area and is dependent
       of depth. Attempts have been made to use this concept to achieve better efficiency and
       economy in space as well as cost. Wide shallow trays inserted within conventional basins
       with a view to increase the surface area have not met with success. However, very small
       diameter tubes having a large wetted perimeter relative to wetted area providing laminar
       flow conditions and low surface loading rate have shown good promise. Such tube setting
       devices provide excellent clarification with detention times of equal to or less than 10
       minutes. Tube configurations can be horizontal or steeply inclined. In Inclined tubes
       (about 60 degree, sludge will not slide down the floors. Under such situations, hosing
       down the sediments may have to be resorted to. With horizontal tubes (normally inclined
       at 5 degree) auxiliary scouring of settled solids is necessary. While tube-settlers have
       been used for improving the performance of existing basins, they have also been
       successfully used in a number of installations as a sole settling unit. It has been found that
       if one-fifth of the outlet end of a basin is covered with tube or plate settlers, the effective
       surface loading on the tank is nearly halved or the flow through the basin cab be nearly
       doubled without impairment of effluent quality.

       The tubes may be square, circular, hexagonal, diamond shaped, triangular, and
       rectangular or chevron shaped. A widely used material for their construction is thin
       plastic sheet (1.5 mm) black in colour, though plastic pipes have also been used. There
       are number of proprietary devices such as Lamella clarifier.


Chapter-8                                                                                    Page 8-9
                                                                                 Water Treatment


       The performance of the tube settlers is normally evaluated by a parameter, Sc, defined as

       Sc = Vsc (Sin Q + LR Cos Q) / Vo

       Where,

       Vsc = Critical settling velocity of the particle, (m/d) = 120 m/d normally assumed
       Vo = Velocity of flow along the tube settler, (m/d)
       Q = angle of inclination of tube to horizontal
       LR = relative length of tube settler = L/D Ratio upto 20
       L = Actual length of tube, (m)
       D = Diameter of tube, (m)
       Sc, should be (4/3) for circular tube, 11/8 for square tube, 1 for parallel plates

       To account for transition zone at tube inlet, it is recommended to increase the relative
       length LR by an amount L’

       Where L’ = 0.058 x Vo x D/µ
       µ = Kinematic viscosity of fluid

       Therefore Sc = Vsc [Sin Q + {(L/D) – 0.058 (Vo x D/µ)} Cos Q]

       Loading rate per tube may be used 1.2 m/h.

       The tube settler module was modified by Mr. Bhole by turning the square tube through
       45 degrees and hexagonal tube through 30 degrees to horizontal so that the original flat
       bottom becomes hopper bottom. The hopper bottom helps to concentrate the settled
       sludge in the hopper which slides down more efficiently. The performance of the tube
       settler was further improved by inserting partition plates of about 15 cm length with
       suitable gap between them. The partition plates reduced to a great extent the interference
       of the water travelling in the upward direction with the down sliding settled sludge. The
       plates also created additional surface for settlement of the sludge and reduced the vertical
       distance of floc travel. Studies showed that performance of this modified tube improved
       by 30 to 40%.

8.5.   Treatment and Disposal of Settled Sludge

       The settled sludge is withdrawn intermittently or by continuous bleeding. The sludge is
       withdrawn by opening of a sluice valve or through a telescopic pipe.

       There are various methods of treatment and disposal of sludge, as shown in following
       diagram. But in rural water supply where ample of land is available, lagooning may be
       quite economical and finally may be sent to landfill sites.

8.6.    Filtration

        Screening and sedimentation removes a large percentage of the suspended solids and
        organic matter present in raw supplies. The percentage of removal of the fine colloidal
        matter increases when coagulants are also used before sedimentation. But however, the
        resultant water will not be pure, and may contain some very fine suspended particles and
        bacteria present in it. To remove or to reduce the remaining impurities still further, and to
        produce potable and palatable water, the water is filtered through the beds of fine
        granular material, such as sands etc. The process of passing the water through the beds of
        such granular materials called as filters, is known as filtration.

        Filtration may help in removing colour, odour, turbidity, and pathogenic bacteria from the
        water. Very fine and colloidal particles of un-settable nature cannot be removed in
        sedimentation process alone. Water coming out of settling tanks and clarifiers is fit for
        filtration. In the process the water from sedimentation tank is allowed to pass through a
        bed of sand and the filtrate is collected at the bottom through the under drains. The action
        of filtration through the filter media retains finer and colloidal particles of silt and clay.
        The filters are periodically washed and put to use again.

        The two types of filters are

            Slow sand gravity filters; and
            Rapid sand gravity filters

8.6.1. Slow Sand Filters

        Slow sand filtration is a simple and low-cost method of purifying water. It uses local
        materials and skills. Basically it is a large tank containing sand bed. Slow sand filters can
        achieve the following:

             Reduce turbidity of the row water by about 90%
             Reduce bacterial count of raw water by 85% or so
Chapter-8                                                                                                  Page 8-11
                                                                                  Water Treatment


            However if the turbidity of raw water is greater than 50 mg/l, a pre- sedimentation
            facility is necessary prior to filtration to prevent short filter nuns.

8.6.1.2.Working Time for Filters

       As for as possible the units should work for 24 hours continuously. Intermittent working
       may be proposed when design is necessary from other considerations.

8.6.1.3.Shape of Filter Bed

       The shape should generally be rectangular. For certain capacities optimal sizes has been
       worked out so that the wall perimeter for a given area is minimal. On the principle of
       minimal perimeter, the optimal dimensions are worked out for the specific requirements.


Chapter-8                                                                                 Page 8-12
                                                                                  Water Treatment


       The design parameters as recommended in CPHEEO Manual.

8.6.2. Rapid Gravity Filters

       Filters design to operate at much higher rate than slow sand filters are called ‘Rapid’
       Gravity Filters or Rapid Sand Filters.

       In this type of filters, the raw water first undergoes a preparatory treatment. Water
       entering the rapid sand filters contains flocks formed during the pre-treatment process.
       The filter media used in this type of filter is of coarser variety and the operation head is
       also higher. A suitable pre-treatment of raw water is of paramount importance for
       efficient performance of rapid gravity filters. Understandably no rapid gravity filter,
       which receives water without pre-treatment of water with un-coagulated colloidal matter,
       can work satisfactorily. This filter remove large amount of impurities in a short time
       resulting in quick clogging necessitating, frequent washing with cleaning interval
       between 24 to 48 hours, depending upon the quality of water being fed to the filters.
       Since these filters require frequent cleaning no chance is left for formation of biological
       slime to form the filtering mat, as is in case of slow sand filters, which proves so much
       effective in improving the quality of the filtrate.

8.6.2.1.Rate of Filtration

       The standard rate of filtration recommended in CPHEEO manual on water supply and
       treatment is 80 to 100 lpm/m2 (4.8 to 6 m3/m2/hr). In recent past, there has been a decided
       trend towards higher rates of filtration by using coarser sand and improving the pre-
       treatment system. In the country a higher filtration rate up to 240 lpm/m2 has been
       achieved. Usual practice is to adopt filtration rate of 80 lpm/m2. Piping arrangements
       consisting of inlet and outlet etc. are designed at 100% over load for emergent situations.

8.6.2.2.Design of Filter Unit

       a) Area: Rapid sand filters should be so designed that the number of units should be
          sufficient for total quantity of water to be handled without any over loading. In the
          design of large size filter, very vital factor which deserves consideration is the rate of
          supply of wash water and the hydraulic problems in achieving equal distribution of
          wash water, area being large. CPHEEO Manual on water supply, Govt. of the India
          recommends the maximum area of 100 m2 for single unit for plants greater than 100
          mld consisting of two halves each of 50 m2 area. In order to obtain flexibility of
          operation, minimum of four units are recommended which should be reduced to two in
          case of small plants.

       b) No. of Units: Morrell and Wallace developed an equation which may be used as a
          guide for number of filter units. It is N = Q /4.69, where

            N = Number of filter units
            Q = Plant capacity in M3/ hour

            Allowing for repairs, renewals etc., and the bed could be designed for 23 hours of
            operation per day or alternatively extra bed may be provided to make up for this loss
            of time.

Chapter-8                                                                                 Page 8-13
                                                                                   Water Treatment


       c) Dimensions : As for the dimension of the filter box, the ratio of length to width
          averages 1.25 to 1.33 and minimum over all depth of 2.6 m including a free board of
          0.5 m is adopted. The settled water is brought into filters in such a manner that it
          causes least turbulence; otherwise it will break up the residual flocs. The filter boxes
          are constructed in R.C.C or masonry (stone or break). The CPHEEEO manual
          recommends that where seasonal extreme temperature is not prevalent, it is not
          necessary to provide roofing over the filters, the operating gallery alone being roofed
          over.

       d) Specification of Sand: Since sand bed is the heart of filtration plant, selection of sand
          needs great care. Although finer sand is more effective in filtration of water, it has
          higher frictional resistance and as such it cannot be economically used except in case
          of slow sand filers.

            The sand should be of following specifications:

            (i)      Effective size of sand shall be 0.45 to 0.70 mm
            (ii)     Uniformity coefficient shall be 1.3 to 1.7
            (iii)    Sand shall be hard, resistant quartz and free from clay, dust, roots and other
                     impurities
            (iv)     It should contain less than 2 % lime and magnesium calculated as carbonates
                     and soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid in 24 hours at a temperature of 70 deg
                     F.
            (v)      Silica contents should not be less than 90%
            (vi)     Specific gravity shall be in the range of 2.55 to 2.65
            (vii)    Wearing loss shall not be more than 3 %
            (viii)   Ignition loss should not exceed 0.7 % by weight
            (ix)     Soluble fraction in hydrochloric acid shall not exceed 5 % by weight.

       e) Depth of sand: The layer of sand is usually 60-75 cm. The depth of water over this
          sand top varies between 1 m to 2 m. The free board shall be at least 50 cm.

            The depth of sand that can be checked against breakthrough of floc through sand bed
            depth required by Hudson formula:

            Qd 3h/l = B x 29323 where

            Q is in M3/M2/h, d in mm sand size and h and l in m, terminal head loss and depth of
            bed respectively. B is break through index whose value ranges between 4 x 10 -4 to 6 x
            10 -3 depending upon response of coagulation and degree of pre-treatment in filter
            influent. Assume B = 4 x 10 -4 for poor response to filtration and average degree of pre-
            treatment, terminal head loss of 2.5 m, rate of filtration = 5.0 x 2 = 10 m3/m2/hr
            (assuming 100% over loading of filters under emergencies) and assuming d = 0.6 mm
            as mean diameter.

            Minimum depth of sand (l) required to avoid break through = 46 cm. Hence assumed
            depth of 60 cm is adequate to avoid breakthrough of flocs.

       f) The Gravel Layer: The function of gravel layer is to support sand layer and to
          distribute wash water. The gravel should preferably be natural rounded and not crush
          stone. The specification of gravel, as recommended by Cox in WHO monograph series
          49, ‘operation and Control of water Treatment Processes’ as shown in following table:

                                Table 8-3: Specification of Gravel

                            Total depth              39 -62

            CPHEEO Manual on water supply and Treatment recommends the size of gravel
            from 50 mm at the bottom to 2 to 5 mm at the top with 45 cm depth.

            The gravel and its size gradation can be estimated as under:

            Assume a size gradation of 2 mm at top to 50 mm at the bottom. The requisite depth l
            in cm of component gravel layer of size d in mm can be computed from empirical
            formula.

            l = 2.54 k (log d)
            K varies from 10 to 14
            for K-12, the depth of various layer of gravel are:

            Size, mm           2       5      10       20     40

            Increment, cm      9.2     12.1   9.2      9.5    9

            Provide a gravel depth of 50 cm

            For strainer or wheeler type under-drain system, minimum size of gravel shall be 2
            mm and maximum 50 mm with 30 to 50 cm depth and for perforated pipe under drain
            system, size of gravel shall be 2 mm minimum and 25 mm maximum with 50 cm
            depth.

       g) Filter Bottom and Under Drainage System: The function of the under drainage
          system is to collect the filter water reaching down through the sand and gravel layer
          and to distribute uniformly upward the back wash underneath the gravel.

            Because the rate of wash water is several times higher than the rate of filtration, the
            rate of wash water is therefore the basis of design for under drainage system. Various
            types of under drainage system are adopted. Most commonly used under-drainage
            systems consist of grid of pipes into which strainers are fitted. A main, called
            ‘Manifold’ is placed longitudinally along the centre of the bottom floor from which
            several 75-100 mm dia. pipes called ‘Laterals’ are placed across spaced 150 to 200
            mm centre to centre. Another system consists of vitrified clay blocks with perforations
            at intervals. Still another type of system is of porous silica plates mounted on the
Chapter-8                                                                                 Page 8-15
                                                                                      Water Treatment


            support. The system has the drawback of getting clogged by minute quantities of
            alumina.

            The pipe grid system consists of cast iron, asbestos cement or concrete pipe etc. the
            design criteria for manifold and laterals, warrants that the loss of head occurs in the
            strainers or openings and not in the manifold or laterals in order to achieve uniform
            flow of wash water and rate of filtration throughout the area of filter. The velocity of
            jets issuing from openings or strainers is lost against the filter bottom or in the layer of
            supporting gravel surrounding the pipes.

            The head lost should, therefore, be equal to the driving head during wash. Usually the
            controlling head is set between 1 to 4.5m. The ratio of total area of opening in the
            under drains to total cross sectional area of laterals should not exceed 0.5 for
            perforations of 12 mm size and should reduce to 0.25 for perforation of 5 mm. The
            ratio of total area (perforations) to the filter area should preferably be 0.003 to 1 except
            with special bottoms. A filter area of 100 sqm. would be provided with under-drain
            perforations having total area of 0.3 sqm. The total cross sectional area of laterals
            should be about twice the total area of strainers or laterals opening and cross sectional
            area of manifold should be equal to 1.5 to 2 times the total that of laterals. The ratio of
            length to dia. of laterals should not exceed 60.

            The spacing of laterals is approximately equal to spacing of orifices and shall be equal
            to 30 cm. In general filtered water and wash water piping should be designed to
            provide a velocity of flow not greater than 0.9-1.8 m/sec and 2.4-3.6 m/sec
            respectively.

       h) Wash Water Troughs: Wash water troughs are constructed in concrete, asbestos
          cement, plastic and steel etc. Wash water troughs are located in such a manner that the
          horizontal travel of dirty water over the surface of sand in the filter box is kept
          between 0.6 to 1.0 m before it reaches the trough, but there are successful units where
          dirty water travel has been as high as 3 m, as recommended by CPHEEO manual. For
          free falling rectangular trough with level invert, the discharge capacity Q in m3/sec
          may be computed from the equation Q = 1.376 bh3/2, where b is the width of trough in
          m and h is water depth in m.

            Wash water troughs should be so located that their lower surface is slightly above the
            expanded sand i.e. 50 mm or more during filter washing with cross sectional area
            sufficient to provide required capacity. The top edge of the trough should be as far
            above the undisturbed sand surface as the wash water rises in one minute. Necessary
            adjustment can be made by selecting a size with more width and less depth. The
            trough should be large enough to carry all the water delivered to it with at least 50 mm
            space between the surface of flowing water in the trough and the upper edge of the
            trough. Any submergence of trough will reduce the efficiency of wash.

       i) Washing of a Filter: Washing of a filter is done with clean water which can be
          managed from either pumping clear water from clear water gallery to wash water tank
          or from distribution mains, if the distribution line is available nearby treatments units
          or from the rising main if the treatment units are located near the pumping main, as the
          case may be.

                                                                                    Water Treatment


            The necessity of washing a filter arises when the filter media gets so dirty that
            maximum gravity head is required to force the water through filter bed. The material
            deposited on sand through the course of filtration process, increases the resistance to
            the flow of water. When the loss of head becomes too great, filter is washed. For this
            purpose loss of head indicators are provided to show the condition of the filter sand.
            Filter should be washed when loss of head reaches 1.8 to 2 m. In clear filter initial loss
            of head is 0.10 to 0.15 m. Length of filter run should not be less than 24 hours with a
            loss of head not more than 2.0 m.

                 Process of Washing: Washing of filter is not merely an operation of a flow
                  control valve; rather it deserves more attention to make the back washing
                  process really effective.

                  For achieving the best result the following steps should be adopted.

                  1. Close the influent valve A and allow the water level on the top of sand to
                     drop till it reaches a point just 15 cm above the sand this way the settled
                     water is conserved.
                  2. Close the delivery sluice valve D.
                  3. Conduct inspection of filter beds to check cracks, mud balls and mounds etc.
                  4. Open the scour valve B.
                  5. Gradually open the wash water sluice valve C taking 50 to 60 seconds time
                     to apply a flow at the rate of above 0.5 m3/m2/min, failing which wash
                     water will be introduced so rapidly that compacted surface of sand is
                     uplifted as a mass until a portion cracks and clean bottom sand and small
                     size gravel is carried towards crack in fast horizontal flow.
                  6. Continue washing at low rate for 2-3 minutes to afford sufficient time for the
                     floc to get dislocated. Wash water rising through laterals, strainers, gravel
                     and sand carrying with it arrested impurities will be collected by the troughs
                     and passed out through the scour valve.
                  7. Open wash water sluice valve ‘C’ further so as to give maximum sand
                     expansion decide such as 40 to 50 % and it should be continued for a period
                     of one minute or till water becomes relatively clearer. Now closed the wash
                     water sluice valve and also close the scour sluice valve. Valve E which
                     allows filtered water to waste to sewer is then opened. Allow the sand to
                     settle for 2 minutes and then close the valve.
                  8. Open gradually influent sluice valve A ensuring some water cushion is
                     available on the top of sand to avoid unnecessary turbulence and open more
                     sluice valve to make the water reach its normal level and then open the
                     outlet sluice valve to put the filter bed back to use.

               High Velocity Wash Water System: High velocity wash water is applied
                normally where no other agitation (air agitation) is provided. The rate at which
                the wash water is applied is 600 lpm/m2 of filter surface or 60-70 cm/min rise in
                the filter box for the period of 10 minutes. The sand should expand 130 to 150
                % of its undisturbed volume. For high rate wash, the pressure in the under
                drainage system should be 6-8 m with wash water requirement being 700
                l/m/sqm for a duration of 6 to 10 minutes. If the pre-treatment is effective, the
                quantum of wash water would amount to 1% to 2.5% of the total amount of
                water filtered each day. Amount in excess of 2.5 % indicates the need to
                investigate for corrective action.

                Cox in ‘operation and control of water treatment processes (WHO monograph
                series 49) recommends the modern practice to design wash water system to
                produce rate up to 56 m3/m2/h or 90 cm raise/minimum (Allowance for high
                water temperature in tropics justified the use of maximum rate up to 72
                m3/m2/h or 120 cm rise/min). Rate of rise of wash water depends upon the
                effective size and uniformity coefficient of sand used.

                Capacity of back wash pumps and wash water tank: Pumps required filling up
                the wash water in less than 8 hours are provided. The tank should be of
                sufficient capacity (normally to hold 1.5 times the volume of water needed to
                wash a single bed) to back wash one filter for at least 10 minutes at the designed
                rate of wash water flow. Where numbers of filter units are four or more, the
                capacity of the storage tank must be sufficient to supply wash water to two filter
                units, at a time. The height of wash water tank should be sufficient to provide
                the desire rate of flow.

                                                                                   Water Treatment


                Surface Wash System: There is a recent development to supplement
                 conventional back washing by means of surface wash. In this system the stirring
                 of expanded filter bed is done mechanically with rakes and hydraulically with
                 jets of water. The grid of the pipe for using the surface wash consists of
                 horizontal header pipes suspended on wash water trough. Secondary pipes
                 vertically down wards are connected with horizontal headers, extending within
                 10 cm of the surface of sand bed. The bottom tips of the vertical pipes of not
                 less than 25 mm dia. have holes of 2.5 mm dia. at an angle of 300 to the
                 horizontal. The spacing of vertical pipes is maintained at 60-75 cm, centre to
                 centre. The pressure used in the system ranges between 0.70 to 2.10 kg/cm2.
                 The system can be installed in the existing filter beds also. The rotatory type
                 shall consist of rotating unit suspended at a height of 50-75 mm at adequate
                 intervals to provide complete coverage .Jet nozzles are on sides and bottom to
                 rotate at a rate of 7 to 10 rpm.
                Air Wash System: In this system, compressed air is used to achieve scrubbing
                 action with less volume of water. Compressed air is forced through the under
                 drain system before wash water. It is preferable to use air through separate
                 piping located in between gravel and sand. It results in better washing. In
                 separate air piping, air is introduced in about the same volume and at the same
                 time water is introduced through the under drains. Air is forced at the rate of 0.6
                 to 0.9 m3 of free air per minute per square meter of filter area @ 0.35 kg/cm2
                 till such time the bed is thoroughly agitated i.e. for about 5 minutes, and water is
                 forced through separate under drain system simultaneously at the rate of 0.4 to
                 0.6 m3/m2/minute.

            In common system of under-drainage piping for air and back wash, the volume of air
            and back wash being the same, free air is forced through the under-drains until the
            sand is thoroughly agitated i.e. for about 5 minutes. Wash water is then introduced
            through the same under-drains at the rate Stated in the former case.

            There is trend to discourage air wash system because poor results are achieved with
            limited volume of wash water. This difficulty can be overcome by increasing the
            capacity of wash water pump to feed sufficient quantity of water to remove dirt from
            the loosened material.

8.6.3. Comparison of Filters

           Rate of Filtration: The major difference in various types of filters lies in the
            filtration head i.e. the head which makes water to flow through the filter and
            consequently the rate of filtration. The rate of filtration in slow sand filters is about 2
            to 2.5 lpm / m2 whereas the rate of filtration through rapid sand filters is usually 80 to
            100 lpm/m2. Thus the rate of filtration through rapid type is 40 to 50 times faster than
            those of the slow type
           Area Requirement: Keeping in view the rate of filtration, the area required for rapid
            sand filters is theoretically only 4 to 5% of the area needed for slow sand filters. In
            practice, the reduction in the area requirement is partly offset by the additional space

Chapter-8                                                                                    Page 8-21
                                                                                  Water Treatment


            needed for pre-treatment works required with rapid type filtration and the figure is
            thus likely to be around 20 %. Slow sand filters require large area, correspondingly
            large structure and volume of sand
           Loss of Head: The head loss in slow sand filters ranges between 1.0m to 1.5 m, while
            it is 2.50 m to 3.0 m in case of rapid sand filters
           Compactness of Design: As already discussed slow sand filters need large areas for
            their installation but are simple to operate whereas rapid filters can be constructed in
            more compact units fitted with automatic devices
           Filter Media: Filter media required in slow sand filters consists of finer sand while
            sand used in rapid type filters is of coarser quality
           Flexibility in Operation: In rapid types filters adjustments can be made according to
            variation in demand where as slow sand filters are less flexible to meet any emergent
            situation of demand
           Method of Cleaning Filters: Slow sand filters require infrequent operation of
            cleaning by unskilled labourers using hand tools not requiring regular flushing to
            waste of wash water. Unless the water being treated is of high turbidity, slow sand
            filter may work for weeks together even months without involving cleaning
            operation. The necessity for cleaning rapid type filter arises at frequent intervals
            usually only after one or two days. Cleaning is generally done by high pressure back
            washing and compressed air or mechanical agitation is used. The system is more
            sophisticated requiring constant and skilled supervision. Wastage of water required
            for back washing is 2 to 3 % of total water treated
           Pre-treatment: Rapid filters cannot run without pre-treatment such as coagulation
            and flocculation etc. which are expensive processes while slow filters do not need
            pre-treatment of water, but slow sand filters work well only when the turbidity does
            not exceed 50 ppm
           Post Filter Treatment: The filtrate from rapid sand filters need disinfection whereas
            water from slow sand filters can be supplied without any further treatment
           Bacterial purification: Slow sand filters give effective bacterial removal. The
            pathogenic bacteria are completely eliminated to 99 % in slow sand process where as
            only fixed bacterial load is removed in rapid sand filtration process thus necessitating
            post chlorination
           Colour and Odour: Slow sand filters are less effective in removing colour and odour
            from water. These give poor results with water of high algae content unless pre-
            treatment is practiced while rapid sand filters can effectively handle colour and odour
            problem
           Corrosiveness: Addition of coagulants increases the acidity and reduces pH value
            rendering the water corrosive. Slow and filters do not need addition of chemicals and
            thus produce an effluent, which is more uniform in quality and is less corrosive.

8.6.4. Other Technologies used for Filtration

8.6.4.1.Pressure Filters

       Pressure filter consists of closed vessel (cylindrical tank) usually of steel containing a
       filter media through which water is forced under pressure. In this process water under
       pressure is subjected to filtration without the pressure being dissipated and thus it avoids
       double pumping. The pressure filter cylinders are designed to stand water pressure of 10
       kg/sqcm. Although as per practice, rate of filtration usually is 4.8 cum/sqm/h, due
       precaution is needed even at this rate of filtration. The pressure filters are compact and

Chapter-8                                                                                 Page 8-22

           can be prefabricated and move to site. Coagulation and flocculation is normally achieved
           in top portion of filter. These filters are most suitable for small water supply scheme.
           However, the effectiveness of the back wash cannot be directly observed; and it is also
           difficult to inspect, clean and replace the sand, gravel and the underlines.

           They may be used for SHS / Single Village Schemes where population is less and surface
           source scheme with regular treatment may be very expensive for small communities.

            Note: Instead of using all valves separately present trend is to have a ‘Multi Port Valve’.

8.6.4.2.Infiltration Well12

           At places, where boulder stratum is found in the upper surface and rocky stratum in the
           deeper surfaces, it is seen that the construction cost of tube well for drinking water is very
           high and discharge of it is low which also decreases with time. For such strata if surface
           water is available throughout the year, construction of infiltration well is cheaper and the
           available discharge is more. Design of such infiltration wells depends on the requirement
           of discharge, ground water level and the distance of the well from the stream.

       The discharge of a well is determined by recuperation test. But it was not possible to
       perform this test at the time of design. Hence, a discharge of 4500 lpm (1000 gpm) was
       assumed, which was double of the actual discharge available from tube wells constructed
       in this area.

       Diameter of Well

       The formula for discharge is

       Q = Av = Ac H

       Assuming c = 1 and H = 4 m, area and diameter are,

                                              4500 × 60
                                       A=               = 67.5 m
                                              4 × 1000

       D = 9.273 m = 10 m (say)

       Depth of Well

       The general ground water table in the area is approximately 2 – 3.5 m below the ground
       level.

       r = Depth of water table + depression head + depth of water to be left for critical
       depression head = 3.5 + 4 + 2.5 m = 10 m

       Design of Staining

       The depth of well curb is 1 m. Depth of well staining is 10 m below ground level. The
       mass density of submerged soil z is 1100 kg/m3and angle of internal friction i 15O. By
       Rankin’s theory,

                                  1 − sin            1−    150°
               Earth Pressure =           ∗      =              ∗ 1100 ∗ 10 = 6490         /
                                  1 + sin            1+    150°

       Water pressure at the bottom of well staining is also to be considered. The maximum
       probable ground water level from the bottom of staining is taken as 6.5m.

       Density of water                        = 1000 kg/m3
       Water pressure at bottom                = 1000 x 6.5 kg/m2

       Well Curb:

       Well curb was designed adopting Public Works Department’s criteria, as follows:

       1. Flat iron, 50 mm x 14 mm to be laid and sleeve nut screwed very tight; after 10 cm of
          1:2:4 cement concrete bond is laid and cured, the remaining 7 cm should be
          concreted, and all the staining rods must be cut to correct length, top of bottom rods
          should be kept in one level.
       2. The vertical angle of curb should be approximately 30 O.
       3. Main reinforcement of curb should be 0.5% of the cross-sectional area of curb.
       4. Cutting edge to be 150 x 150 x 12 mm angle iron with 150 x 12 mm mild steel plate
          welded diagonally with angle and 250 x 12 mm plate welded with vertical edge of
          angle.
       5. RCC curb to be in 1:1½:3 cement with high quality stone aggregates.

       Reinforcement in the well curb is to be provided by the criterion on 3 above.

       Provide twelve 18 mm diameter curb bars, 10 mm diameter link bars as distribution steel
       and also provide 12 mm diameter anchor bars. The super structure and slabs, etc. may be
       designed as per requirements.

       General:

       To get better yield, flow in a combination of radial and spherical patterns, weep holes
       should be provided in the staining. In all, 17 holes have been provided at equal distances
       approximately 1 m above the bottom of staining at another layer of 17 holes 2 m above,
       such that two holes do not come in one vertical line. The size of each weep hole is 15 x
       15 cm, on the inner side of staining wall and 30 x 30 cm on the outer side. Water flows
       inward from outer side; therefore, each hole is fixed with a box of copper plate with
       perforated plates on both the opening sides. The filter media filled in these boxes are
       coarse sand and layers of graded gravels diameter 6, 13 and 20 mm from outside to inside
       direction of Filter Box (Refer Figure 8-4).

       If necessary plugging can also be done at the bottom of the well with the following
       materials in layers laid upwards: (i) coarse sand, and (ii) gravels of sizes 5-10 mm, 10-20
       mm, 20-25 mm, and 25-50 mm in diameters.

       Discharge of Infiltration Well:

       The first well was constructed at a distance of 35 m away from the canal source. The
       discharge was measured by constant level pumping set of 4500 lpm (1000 gpm) capacity.

            Internal diameter of well = 10 m
            Depth of water in the wells = 6m.
            Drawdown = 2.22 m

       A discharge of 4500 lpm can therefore be safety taken from this well. The depression is
       on the safer side from the critical one. Therefore, in case of emergency, 50% more
       discharge, ie, 6750 lpm approximately may also be drawn from it.

       The second well was constructed at 135 m away from the canal. The discharge of this
       well was calculated by recuperation test and constant level pumping set. In this well
       sinking in subsoil was done only up to 5.6 m.

       Recuperation Test

       The discharge is given by

       T = 180 min = 3 hr

       With average depression head (H) of 4 m, the discharge is

                                     2.303           5.1 3.14

                                = 2557 litre/ minute (average yield)

       Therefore, a 2250 litre/minute discharge can safely be drawn from this well.

       Constant Level Pumping Set:

       With inside diameter of well as 10 m and depth of water as 5.6 m, and using a 2250
       litre/minute (500 gpm) capacity pump, the drawdown is 2.40 m. So, the depression is on
       the safe side of it Critical value. Therefore it is safe to draw at an average discharge of
       2250 1/mt from this well.

           The water drawn from these wells is thus potable and may be supplied after chlorination.

           For more efficiency it may also be converted in radial wells.

           They may be used for SVS and MVS where population is less as traditional surface water
           source based scheme may be very expensive for small communities.

           The filter unit uses the river bed itself as the filter medium. These types of units may be
           used for small villages/communities near the perennial river having flow throughout the
           year having permeable bed. The manufacturing cost, the installation cost and the running
           cost are very low. The quality of the filtered water is comparable to that from any other
           filtration process.

       Filtration is a combination of physical and chemical processes for separating suspended
       and colloidal impurities from water by its passage through a porous bed, usually made of
       gravel and sand or other granular material.

       The first two filter plants are normally used for water supplies and are very costly.

       Technique of Filtration

       This technique of filtration was first used in England and an Indian firm in Bombay has
       started manufacturing such filter units named as SWS on this technique in India. This
       unit may be installed in river permeable bed.

       This type of filter unit converts area of River bed into sand filter. This filter plant
       converts an area of river bed into a low maintenance sand filter. It is made of 3 mm thick
       MS plate rectangular box with a false ceiling consisting of a slotted plate below false
       ceiling and filled with coarse sand and gravels in the box with a wire mesh at the bottom
       (Refer Figure 8-5.).

       This unit was immersed with the open end facing down to the river bed such that the top
       of the unit is not less than 30 cm below the river bed and 60 to 90 cm below top surface
       of water. In this unit, the river bed itself works as the filter media and therefore chemicals
       for coagulation, filter media for filtration and back washing are not required. The false
       ceiling chamber has one 80 mm pipe outlet with non-reflux valve. The non-reflux valve
       is attached to flexible suction pipe which goes to pump installed at safe place (above
       HFL).The suction head should not be more than 7 m for efficient functioning. After
       installation it was connected with a pump of 720 lpm (158 gpm) discharge at 30 m head.
       The filtered river water should be pumped into the river for about 20 hours in the
       beginning to develop the filter bed to get clean and pure water. After this period the water
       is driven into the pipeline after its chlorination with solution of bleaching powder through
       a pressure feed type chlorinator.

       In this filter unit the precise nature of the sand, etc. of the river bed is not very important,
       provided there is a range of particle size for the filtration process. The unit must be
       placed in a permeable bed, preferably not less than 60 cm deep. To obtain good quality
       water, effective surface area of river bed to be used as filter should be 1.25 m2 for a
       discharge of 1 m3/hr of filtered water, Thus to get 600 lpm discharge the required
       effective area is 7.50 sqm. With our 60 x 60 x 30 cm box with false ceiling of 40 x 40 x
       10 cm and effective area of 9 sqm can safely draw water to the tune of 600 lpm. By it the
       suspended matter is removed down to 0.1 micron (0.00004 inches). If more quantity of
       treated water is required than another box can be installed after 6 m and one suction pipe
       can be attached to both of reflux valve in series and larger capacity pump can be
       installed.

       The limitation of this technique is this, that it can be installed only in permeable bed and
       having surface water throughout the year. In the case of non-permeable bed, it is
       recommended that a area of 7 x 7 x 1.5 m should be dug out and filled with filter media
       before installing this box.

       They may be used for SHS / SVS where population is less (For details, Figure 8-5 may
       be referred).

8.6.4.4.Reverse Osmosis

       Reverse Osmosis is a membrane permeation process for separating relatively pure water
       from less pure water. The solution is passed over the surface of an appropriate semi
       permeable membrane at a pressure in excess of the effective osmotic pressure of the feed
       water. The permeated water is collected as the product and the concentrated solution is
       generally discharged. The membrane must be highly permeable to water, highly
       impermeable to solutes and capable of withstanding the applied pressure without fail.

       Advantages: Removal of all types of chemical contaminants including total dissolved
       solids and bacteria.

       Technical Specifications and Process Details:

       1. The Plant should be designed based on the following Raw Water properties.

       a) Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)      :      up to 5000 ppm
       b) Total Hardness                    :      up to 1000 ppm as CacO3
       c) Fluorides                         :      up to 1.5 ppm

       2. The components of Reverse Osmosis Plant are as follows:

   Raw water storage tank    Raw water is fed into this tank
   Raw water pump            To pump raw water into the inlet of dual media filter.
   Dual media filter with    Suspended impurities present in raw water are removed.
   filter mesh
   Activated Carbon filter   Water goes through the activated carbon filter in which odour
                             and colour are removed. The hardness of the water is removed
                             to prevent membrane scaling due to calcium carbonate and
                             calcium sulphate salts.
   Cartridge filter          The water passes through cartridge filter to reduce the SDI
                             below acceptable limits for the RO membrane that is 4. The
                             cartridge also takes care of presence of any foreign particles
                             and prevents it from going into the pressure pump to prevent
                             any damage to the pump.
   High pressure pump        It pumps water at high pressure through RO block.
   R O Block                 The major quantity of dissolved salts is rejected with rejected
                             stream and almost pure water comes out as separate stream.
   U V sterilizer            The permeate water shall be collected in a blending tank where
                             activated carbon filter water will be mixed to bring the water
                             quality as per the required specifications.
   Product storage tank      Collects the treated water.

       A typical flow diagram of RO Plant is given in Figure 8-6

       The TDS of water shall be reduced to a major extent in the R.O section. The treated water
       quality expected out of R.O section shall meet IS Standard for drinking water.

Chapter-8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Page 8-32
                                                                                 Water Treatment


8.6.5. Criteria for selection of Non-Conventional Treatment Technologies

       Following Criterion shall be considered while selection of Non –Conventional
       technologies:

       a)   Degree of contamination in Raw water quality
       b)   Land requirement
       c)   Capital cost
       d)   O&M cost
       e)   Ease in O&M

      Based on the above criterion, the brief description and adoptability of the various non-
      conventional treatment technologies (used for SHS/SGS) have been described as
      mentioned below:

      1. Pressure Filter: It may be used, where turbidity and pollution in the raw water is not
         very high. There is also some storage of treated water for its back washing. There
         should not be rise of water level during the floods more than 3-4m. The requirement of
         land is less i.e. 5x5m. Due to use of coagulant, bleaching powder and backwashing
         fresh water, the maintenance cost is on higher side.
      2. Infiltration Well: It is used where the surface water is available throughout the year
         and the adjoining strata are permeable. The cost of construction of Tube well is very
         high due to boulder stratum in the upper surface. On the availability of discharge, it
         may also be used for SMVS. The level requirement near the source for its construction
         is about 20x20 m. The maintenance cost is less as no coagulant is required in filtration
         and there is no requirement of back washing. The capital cost is high.
      3. Low Cost Filtration Plant: It may be used where the surface water is available
         throughout the year and the stratum below the water is permeable. There could not be
         rise of water level during the floods more than 3 to 4 m. The land requirement is 5x5m
         for pump house cum Chloronome. No coagulant is required and only water may be
         supplied after chlorination. This is cheapest in capital and maintenance cost. It will be
         useful for small communities.
      4. Reverse Osmosis: If there is not any option to get potable water, then this method may
         be adopted. Due to costly maintenance and disposal of waste water is not
         environmental friendly. The extra land is also required for placement of RO Plant.

8.6.6. Disinfection of water:

       The process of killing the infective bacteria from the water and making it safe to the user
       is called disinfection. In the filtration unit all type of bacteria are not removed, thus
       disinfection is required for bacteria free water, to prevent various diseases and their
       epidemics causing disasters to the public life.

8.6.6.1.Methods of disinfection:

       The disinfection of water can be done by the following common methods:

       a) Disinfection by Boiling Water

            The water can be disinfected by boiling for 15 to 20 minutes. By boiling water all the
            disease-causing bacteria are killed and the water becomes safe for use. This process
Chapter-8                                                                                Page 8-33
                                                                                   Water Treatment


            can only kill the existing germs but does not provide any protection against future
            possible contamination. It may be done at household level.

       b) Disinfection by Passing Ultra-Violet Rays

            Ultra-violet rays are invisible light rays having wave lengths of 1000 to 4000 m. Sun
            rays also have ultra-violet rays which can also be utilized in the disinfection of water.
            In the laboratory they can be obtained by the ultra-violet ray equipment, which
            essentially consists of mercury vapours enclosed in quartz bulb and passing current in
            it. Ultra-violet rays are good disinfectants and kill the disease bacteria. After
            removing the turbidity and the colour of water, then disinfection by ultra-violet rays
            can be done.

       c) Disinfection with Iodine and Bromine

            It has been seen that addition of Iodine and Bromine in the water kills all the
            pathogenic bacteria. The quantity of Iodine and Bromine should not exceed 8 ppm
            and they can kill bacteria in minimum contact period of 5 minutes.

       d) Disinfection with Ozone

            Ozone is an excellent disinfectant. It is used in gaseous form, which is faintly blue in
            colour of pungent odour. Ozone is an unstable allotropic form of oxygen, with its
            every molecule containing three oxygen atoms. But as the ozone is highly unstable, it
            breaks down into ordinary oxygen and liberates nascent oxygen.

       e) Disinfection by Excess Lime

            Lime is usually used at the water works for reducing the hardness of water. It has
            been noted practically that if some additional quantity of lime is added than what is
            actually required for removal of hardness, it will also disinfect the water while
            removing the hardness.

       f) Disinfection by Potassium Permanganate

            This is the most common disinfectant used in the village for disinfection of dug well
            water, pond water or private source of water. In addition to the killing of bacteria it
            also reduces the organic matters by oxidizing them. Due to its good oxidizing quality,
            it is sometimes added in small dose 0.05 to 0.10 mg/litre in the chlorinated water. In
            the rural areas it is common practice to dissolve a small amount of potassium
            permanganate in a bucket of water and mix it with the well water frequently, to kill
            the bacteria.

       g) Disinfection by silver Ionization Plants

            In silver ionization system the disinfections of water with silver ions start
            simultaneously with pumping of water whereas in conventional chlorination,
            chlorinated bleaching powder solution is to be prepared beforehand. Chlorination of
            water has many drawbacks like chlorine smell, generation of carcinogenic by-
            products, low residual effects, corrosion of metal parts of chlorinators, pipe line and
            specials whereas, silver ionization has advantages like high residual effects, odour
Chapter-8                                                                                  Page 8-34
                                                                                      Water Treatment


                 less and non-corrosive. The regulation of silver ionization is automatic. Chlorination
                 regulation depends on strength of bleaching powder and is totally manual. In view of
                 above the disinfections of drinking water with silver ionization has been introduced in
                 all of the new water supply schemes. Conventional chlorination kills bacteria whereas
                 silver ionization effectively destroys viruses, bacteria, spores and fungi. The other
                 advantages of silver ionization are as under:

            I.       Bacterial disinfection efficiency will be 100% even at high level of E-coli (4000
                     to 5000/ml)
           II.       Silver ions remain in water even after 51 hours after ionization without any
                     significant loss
       III.          No change in physio-chemical characteristics in treated water
       IV.           Silver ionization is safe, consumer friendly and reliable method over conventional
                     disinfections using chlorine/ bleaching powder
           V.        Maintenance involves cleaning of electrodes daily and replacement of electrodes
                     after the design life
       VI.           Silver ionization ensures complete disinfections of drinking water without the
                     problem of smell with chlorine/ bleaching powder.

       Limitations/Disadvantages in this Process:

                Huge cost is involved in capital / operation and maintenance
                More chances of theft
                No tracking of checking the disinfection effect at consumer end.

       h) Electrolytic Chlorination-Sodium Hypo Chlorite Solution Using Common Salt

                 Principle of Operation

                 Chlorine is instantly produced by electrolyte brine solution. Common salt is mixed
                 with water to prepare brine solution. This solution is passed through an Electrolyser
                 of electrodes comprising of anodes and cathodes, which are energised by D.C. current
                 to produce NaOCl. The equipment used is called electro chlorinator. The overall
                 chemical reaction is as follows:

                     2NaOH+Cl2 NaOCl+ NaCl+ H2O

                 Considering the disinfection quality and economical aspects of disinfection,
                 chlorination is the most suitable technology for the rural schemes.

       i) Disinfection with Chlorine

                     Gaseous Chlorination

                      Chlorination with Chlorine gas using a vacuum chlorinator is a very effective
                      disinfection process for water treatment. It is cheap, easily available, reliable,
                      and easy to handle, easy to measure and it is capable of providing residual
                      disinfecting for a long time, thus protecting from future contamination. For
                      MVS, this technique of disinfection is very effective. The schematic diagram of
                      chlorinator with injector is shown in Fig 8-7

Chapter-8                                                                                      Page 8-35

               Free chlorine in the form of liquid chlorine or as chlorine gas
               As combined chlorine in the form of bleaching powder.

                Chlorination with Bleaching Powder

                 Bleaching powder is usually practiced for disinfection of rural water supply.
                 In order to achieve maximum destruction of bacteria a minimum contact
                 period of 30 minutes between the bleaching powder solution and the water
                 is required. If the bleaching powder is added in the OHSR the addition has
                 to be done before stopping of pumps since the turbulence due to pumping
                 will enable mixing of bleaching powder solution and the incoming water.
                 Adding bleaching powder directly into OHSR is not advisable, as lime gets
                 deposited and causes choking. It can also corrode the concrete.

                 However, the distribution system outlet must be opened only after a
                 minimum period of 30 minutes after stoppage of pumping.



Chapter-8                                                                                Page 8‐36
 
                                                                               Water Treatment


                Normally, the bleaching powder contains 30 to 35 % of chlorine when it is
                fresh. Since bleaching powder loses its chlorine content with time, it is
                desirable to assume that bleaching powder contains 25 % of chlorine while
                determining dosage of bleaching powder. Hence, in order to give chlorine
                dosage of 1 mg / lt. Bleaching powder of 4 mg/lt. is to be dosed. After
                addition of the bleaching powder the residual chlorine in the OHSR water
                has to be about 1 mg/lt, to ensure minimum residual chlorine of 0.2 to 0.3
                mg/lt. at the consumption point. Any abnormal changes in the residual
                chlorine level or absence of residual chlorine will indicate the contamination
                of water.

                A chloroscope shall be used to check the residual chlorine content. A sample
                of water is taken in a test tube and a few drops of the reagent is added to the
                water and shaken. If residual chlorine is present, the water in the test tube
                will turn to yellow. The concentration of residual chlorine is indicated by the
                intensity of the yellow colour i.e., the deeper the yellow, higher will be the
                concentration of residual chlorine. The comparator kit provides accurate
                comparison of colours and hence assesses quantity of residual chlorine.

               Differential Pressure Type Chlorinator

                It can be used for dozing of chlorine through online chlorination. In this
                case, the differential pressure chlorinator is fitted into the raising main. Here
                bleaching powder solution is introduced into pumping mains using the
                principle of differential pressure created in the pumping main by introducing
                a venture-flume or an orifice plate. Air release cock is provided at the top of
                the chlorinator to release the air during each loading of the rubber bag with
                bleaching powder solution. The chlorine solution is prepared using
                bleaching powder and allowed to settle for a period of about 20 to 30
                minutes to settle down. The clear decanted solution is filtered and filled into
                the rubber bag. When the pump starts due to high pressure developed prior
                to the orifice plate, water enters into the gap between the rubber bag and the
                tank and starts compressing the rubber bag. Due to this the solution in the
                rubber bag rises and is injected into the pumping main beyond the orifice
                plate where reduced pressure is created, because of venture/orifice. When
                the pump set is put off the non-return valve in the outlet pipe prevents the
                entry of water into the rubber bag. The dosage can be adjusted as in the pipe
                carrying the bleaching powder solution the glass tube portion has a float
                which indicates the dosing of solution in ppm.

                For tube well based scheme the Differential Pressure Feed Type dosing
                Equipment is most suitable.

                  Typical Design of Capacity of Chlorinator

                   Assume the required dose of chlorination at source is 0.5 ppm which will be
                   sufficient to maintain the residual chlorine at end point upto 0.2 ppm. The
                   discharge of tube well is 2200 lpm and it runs for 22 hours.

                   Rate of Chlorination = 0.5 ppm = 0.5 mg/l
                   Quantity of water to be disinfected = (2000 x 22 x 60) / 1000 = 2640 Kl/d
                   Interval change of dose = 24 hours
                   Strength of solution = 2%
                   Available Chlorine in bleaching powder = 25%
                   Total Chlorine requirement = 2640 x 0.5/1000 = 1.32 kg/d
                   Quantity of bleaching power = 1.32 x 100/25 = 5.28 kg/d
                   Capacity of Chlorinator for 2% strength = 5.28 x 100/2 = 264 litre
                   Say = 270 Litre per day

                                                   9. SERVICE RESERVOIR

       Service reservoirs are structures which are built at any convenient point in the water
       distribution arrangement between the original source and the consumer end. The function
       of the reservoir varies considerably depending upon their type and need. The general
       functions of a reservoir are detailed below:

           To equalize the rate of flow, adjusting a variable demand rate to the rate of supply not
            equal to it. This allows the pumps to work at a steady constant rate which not only
            improves their efficiency but also reduces the cost of their operation and maintenance
           To equalize pressure and to make it possible to pump water at an average constant
            head and thereby reducing the size of the pump and also pumping cost, since peak
            pressures are taken over from the pump
           To provide and maintain the desired pressure in remote areas
           To provide necessary time for contact time for chlorine disinfection
           To store water for emergencies such as fires and break-down periods
           To provide economy and safety to the distribution system
           The pumping can be carried out in shifts and during hours convenient to the operating
            personnel and availability of power
           To carry out any repairs to the conveying mains between the source of supply and the
            reservoir without interruption of water service
           Balancing tank at the end of distribution system with a nominal capacity of 1 or 2
            hours where direct pumping into the distribution system is adopted for acting as relief
            valve. For such arrangements ground storage tanks are used for direct pumping which
            involves a suction head.

           Ground Level Service Reservoir (GLSR): They are generally of masonry,
            Brick/Stone, R.C.C. Steel and HDPE
           Over Head Service Reservoir (OHSR): These are also generally made of R.C.C. and
            Pressed Steel
           Anyhow material of construction of tanks is left to the state.

       When the reservoirs need not be over head, it is most economical to adopt ground level
       reservoirs. Where treated water is to be stored, these reservoirs are usually built with
       masonry walls and may be completely underground or partially underground depending
       upon the topography of the locality. Ground level reservoirs are usually covered, unless
       very large in area. The cover protects the water against contamination from wind borne
       material, birds and other sources, and it also prevents growth of algae and other plant life
       which might affect the taste and appearance of water.

                                                                                   Service Reservoir


       Overhead reservoirs are generally costly and are provided only if the ground level
       reservoirs cannot provide the required pressure in the distribution system. Storage of
       water in overhead tanks located at strategic points are usually necessary to provide
       sufficient pressure in the distribution system, unless the terrain is hilly enough to permit
       the use of ground level tank to maintain desired pressure in the distribution system. A
       low level reservoir is of service only in equalizing the operations of filters, deep well
       pumps, low lift pumps and conduits bringing water from a distant source. High level
       reservoirs act as equalizers to the entire supply system, including pumps and some of the
       distributing mains.

       In Multi Village schemes Over Head Balancing Reservoir (OHBR) is provided at
       headworks site to collect treated water from sumps and transfer to different OHSRs in
       villages for distribution. OHBR is only for providing head and not for distribution
       purpose. In Multi Village schemes small reservoirs which acts as raw water and clear
       water sumps of adequate capacities are provided for pumping plants at places where
       pumping is required.

9.2.   Location of Reservoirs

       The three possible locations of Reservoirs are:

       i) Locating the reservoir in central point with respect to distribution area. This will
            reduce the size of distribution mains and will cause better equalization of flow during
            peak demand periods. More uniform pressure will prevail in the system
       ii) Locating near the beginning of the distribution system. This is adopted where the
            distribution area is at a lower level. Then the length of the pumping main becomes
            shorter, but the length of the distribution system mains becomes more
       iii) Locating the reservoir site at a suitable altitude. It depends on the availability of land
            at suitable altitudes. It is necessary that bottom water level shall be at such a height
            that allows for frictional losses in the distribution mains and required residual head in
            any part of the system. This can be ensured either by locating the reservoir on high
            ground or by building on a tower.

9.3.   Capacity of Reservoirs

       While designing the storage of a reservoir, the first consideration is the capacity which
       will be provided. To great extent this depends upon the type of supply and is influenced
       by two main factors: (i) necessity of catering for peak demand periods and (ii) provision
       of reserve to cover normal break down or maintenance interruptions.

       Service storage capacity will be provided for on the basis of mass curve as per CPHEEO
       manual, with minimum of 8 hours capacity.

       Designs of Overhead water tanks (OHSR): The states have opted for inviting bids for
       overhead water tanks (OHSR) along with design and construction. In order to ensure that
       disaster risks are addressed effectively. States will ensure all designs done either by the

                                                                                Service Reservoir


       contractor or department are in conformity with latest IS codes for concrete considering
       seismic and wind loads, and shall be checked by IITs or Government engineering
       colleges.

       Shape of Reservoirs

       The economical shape of the reservoirs should be selected. Few of the recommended
       shapes are given below:

                 Circular
                 Ellipse
                 Square
                 Rectangular
                 Intz type only for OHSR
                 Shaft type for OHSR

       Depth: The depth of the reservoir should always be determined taking site conditions
       into consideration. Where the depth is very shallow, temperature effects are felt which
       are likely to affect the potability of water and permit growth of organism. Shallow depths
       mean larger area and more land cost. At the same time, if the depth is large, this will
       increase the cost of walls, since these walls have to be thick. The most economical depth
       is determined by trial.

9.4.   Reservoir Components

       In addition to the main reservoir /tank body (Foundation), bottom, floor, walls and roofs);
       Followings are the various components of reservoirs:

        (i)   Ventilation: Roofs should have ventilators with wire mesh screen to prevent entry
              of mosquitoes etc. The height of the vents, in case of a ground level reservoir
              should prevent entry of frogs, worms etc.
        (ii) Inlet Pipe: The size of inlet pipe is kept equal to the size of rising main/pumping
              main with the same size of sluice valve; In case of gravity feed reservoir, it is
              equal to size of feeder main with an inlet sluice/gate valve of the same size
        (iii) Outlet Pipe: It should not be more than the diameter of initial distribution pipe
              line with the same size of sluice valve
        (iv) Over flow pipe: It should not be less than the diameter of inlet pipe. The
              discharge of this pipe should be connected to the proper drainage system
        (v) Washout/Scour Pipe: This is to be 100 mm dia. and provided at the bottom of the
              reservoir with a sluice valve before the T- junction with the over flow pipe. The
              down pipe should have a gravity chamber at the bottom
        (vi) Ladders/Stairs: Ladder to stair case will have to be provided one from the ground
              level to the roof of the over-head reservoir and one from the inspection chamber
              of the roof to the floor level of the reservoir to facilitate access for proper
              maintenance. A helical stair may also be provided. Ladder can be made with flat
              iron 63 x 10 mm on sides 25 to 30 cm apart 45 cm wide, 20 mm dia. Iron ladder

Chapter-9                                                                                 Page 9-3
                                                                                 Service Reservoir


               are constructed with an angle of 750 (preferred) to vertical at the floor. Ladder
               shall have minimum 200 mm clearance from any obstruction such as pipes and
               railing with minimum horizontal clearance of 75 mm from any obstruction such as
               columns and walls etc., String should be carried one metre above the landing point
               or roof etc for 750 increased to 1.75m for vertical. If the length of ladder is more
               than 6 m, welded steel mesh cage with minimum clearance of 0.75 m is provided
               from 2.15m above ground or floor level. Railing should be 0.90 m above ground
               or floor level. Railing should be 0.90 m to 1.0 m high at landing and hand rail to
               be from 25 cm for ladder at 600 to 10 cm for 750, above for the sides of the ladder
        (vii) Water Level Indicator: Whether reservoir is supplied water by gravity or through
               pumping, it is essential that water level inside the reservoir, be known at any
               desired time and for this purpose, water level indicators are provided. Float type
               water level indicator will be used for SHS/SGS and Float type /ultrasonic Water
               level indicator/digital will be provided for MVS
        (viii) Lightening Conductor: It is important to provide an efficient system of lightning
               conductor to arrest the damage against lighting for overhead reservoirs. The
               materials used above ground and below ground are shown in Table: 9-1.

        (ix) Manhole cover with medium duty shall be provided at the roof of the reservoir of
             size (60cmx60cm).

9.5.   Structural Design of Water Tanks

       Clear water reservoirs, settling tanks, aeration tanks etc. are supported on the ground
       directly while overhead tanks for water supply may be constructed on masonry
       walls/columns, concrete staging or on towers. Material used may be steel, concrete, pre-
       stressed concrete, polythene or masonry. From design point of view, tanks may be
       classified according to their shapes such as rectangular, circular, pyramid, conical, intze
       type and other modern shapes such as spheroids and folded plates.. Reinforced Cement
       Concrete (RCC) structures are built now days.

       The structural design may be got done by some Consultant or State Department
       Engineer. The software like: (i) STAD-PRO (ii) ANSYS may be used for designing of
       water tanks.

       The components such as top dome, cylinder, conical shell and bottom dome have been
       analyzed individually and designed. Ring beams have been provided at the junction of
       cylinder top dome, cylinder and bottom dome.

       The stipulations outlined in the relevant Indian Standards mentioned in the references
       have been followed in the design. The top dome, top ring beam, cylinder, middle ring
       beam, conical shell and bottom dome have been designed for un-cracked conditions,
       whereas bottom ring beam, columns, braces and foundation are designed for cracked
       condition. The container portion is designed with permissible stress concept, whereas the
       supporting structure is designed on limit State concept.

       Specifications & Design Features:

       Water retaining structures must be built with impermeable walls which will not crack
       under storage or due to shrinkage and temperature stresses. It should be noted that no
       amount of over design in steel or concrete can help to overcome the durability problem.
       For durability, quality of concrete should be aimed at and not quantity. For general
       guidance, according to IS: 456 the material used shall be of the following specifications:

       a) Cement: The cement shall be ordinary portland cement or rapid hardening Portland
          cement conforming to IS: 269 or blast furnace slag cement conforming to IS: 455.
          The use of low heat cement is not covered by the provisions of IS: 456
       b) Aggregates: All aggregates shall conform to either IS: 383 or IS: 515. For heavily
          reinforced concrete members as in case of ribs of main beams, the nominal maximum
          size of aggregate should usually be restricted to 5 mm less than the minimum clear
          distance between the main bars or 5 mm less than the minimum cover to the
          reinforcement, whichever is smaller
       c) Water: Water used for both mixing and curing shall be free from injurious amounts
          of deleterious materials. Potable waters are generally considered satisfactory for
          mixing and curing. Water for concreting and curing should confirm to IS: 456
       d) Reinforcement

            i) Mild steel and medium tensile steel bars and hard drawn steel wire shall conform
                 to IS:432 (Part-I)
            ii) Grade Fe 415 conforming to IS: 1786
            iii) Deformed bars conforming to IS:1139
            iv) Cold twisted steel bars conforming to IS:1786
            v) Hard drawn steel wire fabric conforming to IS:1566
            vi) Structural steel sections conforming to IS:226.
            vii) Lap length = 50 x diameter of bar

       All reinforcement shall be clean and free from loose mill scale, dust, loose rust and coats
       of paints, oil or other coating which may destroy or reduce the bond. Adhering lime wash

                                                                                  Service Reservoir


       or cement grout shall be permitted at the Engineer’s discretion so long as it is not
       excessive or loose.

       a) Concrete: In general, the concrete is of seven grades designed as M15, M20, M25,
          M30, M35 and M40. In designation of concrete mix, the letter ‘M’ refers to the Mix
          and the number to the specific 28-day works cube compressive strength of that mix in
          N/mm2
       b) Flexible Joints: Special attention shall be given to flexible joints, construction joints,
          expansion joints and temporary construction joints
       c) Shrinkage Stresses: Shrinkage stresses shall be investigated in case of rich concrete
          mixes and thick walls or in pre-stressed tanks. Coefficient of shrinkage may be taken
          as 300x10-6 (As per IS:3370 with latest revision)
       d) Length of Bond: The minimum length for bond, or the minimum length of an
          overlap for liquid containers, keeping in view the permissible stresses of steel comes
          to 25 d, where d is the dia. of bar. For practical purposes, the minimum length of an
          overlap 30 d, or minimum length 300 mm should be adopted.
       e) Quality of Water: The quality of water shall confirm as per IS: 456
       f) Quantity of Water: The quantity of water required per 50 Kg of cement for various
          mixes which provides a maximum slump about 150 mm.
       g) Cube Tests: Compression tests are made on 150 mm cubes, which should be made,
          stored, and tested. For cubes made at site, these should be cast from one batch of
          concrete. Identification marks should be made on cubes. Two sets of three cubes each
          are preferable and one set should be tested at seven days and other at 28 days .If one
          set of three cubes is made, they should be tested at twenty eight days. The strengths
          of cubes in any set should not vary more than 15% of average, unless the lowest
          strength exceeds the minimum required. The seven days tests are a guide to the rate
          of hardening; the strength at this age for Portland cement concrete should be not less
          than two-third of the strength required at twenty eight days.
       h) Permissible stress (Ref: IS: 3370)
       i) Roof of the Tanks: Under side of the roof of tanks storing chlorinated water get
          usually corroded due to deteriorating action of free chlorine. Hence such roofs must
          be in concrete minimum M-30 grade and additional surface treatment for chlorine
          protection is required to be applied
       j) Safe bearing Capacities of Soil: The design of foundation should be done as per
          results of the test conducted for safe bearing capacity of the soil at the project site.
       k) Wind Pressure: Since the primary factor in the design of isolated structure is the
          force of wind, careful consideration is necessary to avoid either under-estimating this
          force or making an unduly high assessment. Due account should be taken of the
          susceptibility of narrow shafts to the impact of gust of winds. The total lateral force is
          the product of specified pressure and the maximum vertical projected area and a
          factor of safety of at least 1 ½ is required against overturning. Local meteorological
          records should be consulted to determine maximum wind velocity.

            Strong high speed winds affects only the structures which are high such as OHSRs.
            The OHSRs are designed for Loads due Wind/ storm speed as per IS:
            875, considering the specified wind speed for the respective damage risk zone and

            designed as per IS: 11682 with latest amendments. The foundations of these
            structures are designed as per the IS: 2950(Part-I) with latest amendments for the
            Raft foundation and IS: 2911 for Pile Foundations. IS: 875, Code of Practice for
            structural safety of buildings: Loading Standards. provides the figures of maximum
            basic wind pressure ever likely to occur in respective areas including winds of short
            duration, meaning thereby winds in which the maximum speed is attained suddenly
            and lasts for a few minutes only such as in squalls. The distribution and intensity of
            the resultant pressures due to wind depend upon the shape of the surface upon which
            the wind impinges.

            Bihar: Part of the State falls in high damage risk zone and part of it in Moderate
            damage risk zone-B,

            Jharkhand: Most Part of the State falls in Moderate damage risk zone – B and some
            part in high damage risk zone,

            Uttar Pradesh: Most Part of the State falls in high damage risk zone) and District
            Sonebhadra in Moderate damage risk zone-B

            Seismic effect in design: India has been divided in 5 seismic zones for design
            purpose. The design should be done by taking the values of proper zone of seismic
            effect of the project area.

            Accordingly considering the stresses and forces of that magnitude for the respective
            areas as stated above, all the Service reservoirs are designed and constructed as per
            IS:1893(Part-1) and IS:2014 (Part-2) Fifth Revision, and the staging of the OHSR is
            designed as per IS:11682 with latest amendments. All RCC liquid retaining structures
            are designed as per IS: 3370 (Part-1) and (Part-2) with latest amendments and as per
            IS: 456. The construction of these structures shall also done considering the practices
            of National Building Code 2005 accordingly. The foundations of these structures are
            designed as per the IS: 2950(Part-I) with latest amendments for the Raft foundation
            and IS: 2911 for Pile Foundations. Thus the possible effect/impact of seismicity
            (Earthquake) is mitigated in designs. The cost of “Mitigation measures” is inbuilt and
            hence no separate provision is required.

       Assam: The District which falls in Brahmaputra plains is liable to floods
       Bihar: The Districts which falls in Gangetic plains are liable to floods
       Jharkhand: Not Flood prone

       Uttar Pradesh: Project Districts which falls in Gangetic- plains are liable to floods Thus,
       the Schemes/works of the villages falling in flood prone area in Gangetic- Brahmaputra
       plains are designed and constructed in such a way that they are above High Flood Level
       (HFL). Moreover, the intake works are proposed in such a way that they take care of
       such eventuality and provisions are made accordingly. The mitigation measures are taken
       and provided in the schemes.

9.5.2. Land Slides

       As per the Map of Geological Survey of India, all four project states are in very low
       hazard zone; However, the Technical Committee of National Disaster Management
       Authority is updating the map and according to them Assam is moderately affected and
       Jharkhand is marginally affected.

       After checking the site conditions if required some protection works to mitigate and
       reduce the risks may be considered to be proposed as per the following Codes

       IS: 14496(Part-2), IS: 14458 (Part 1 to 3), IS: 14680 and national Building code 2005.

       However, for specific scheme the exact risk hazard zone may be checked and exact
       stresses and loads have to identified and considered for the designs. All the designs and
       construction of the components of the scheme/project should be done accordingly as per
       the relevant IS codes and Specifications.

       The checklist for disaster management is provided in the sample DPR Annexure 03

                                                      10. Distribution System

10.1. General

       The distribution system is provided to convey water to the household consumer at
       adequate residual pressure in sufficient quantity. The requirements for the distribution
       systems are network of pipes connected to reservoirs with valves at suitable locations for
       efficient operation and maintenance. Adequate residual pressure at maximum demand
       depending upon the hydraulic capacity of the system should be provided.

10.2. General Design Parameters for Distribution System

       Peak Factor: In SHS/SGS rural water supply schemes 6 hours distribution of water is
       being provided and hence a peak factor of 4 is to be considered for design of distribution
       lines. For MVS, water supply of 8-24 hours supplies to be provided with peak factor of 3.

       Pressure Requirements: The minimum residual pressures in all rural water supply
       schemes should be available in the distribution system as per recommendations of the
       CPHEEO Manual i.e. 7 m at household level.

       Minimum Size of Pipe in Distribution System: Minimum size of pipe in distribution
       system of 63 mm (Outer Diameter) is recommended, but it may be reviewed to get
       minimum velocity of 0.6 m/s, which is required to prevent silting.

       Layout Distribution System-Zones: The ground elevations play a very important role
       in planning of laying out a distribution system. The zoning depends upon the density of
       population, type of locality and topography etc. When there is an average difference in
       elevation more than 5 m between zones then each zone should be served by a separate
       main. This philosophy shall facilitate in designing of distribution system for equitable
       distribution. The valves between zones should be kept closed and used only under
       emergent situations.

       The groups of distribution pipes to varying levels should, however, be kept as separate as
       possible. But when the higher levels are adjacent to the reservoir from which the leading
       mains originate, the pipes should have larger dia. at starting and until they have passed
       through, and supplied the higher parts, they should then be reduced in dia. as they
       continue towards the lower levels.

       Survey/ Map: The pre-requisite to sound design of distribution system is a complete
       survey covering all roads and indicating elevations of all important point proposed as
       well as present roads. The plan of the villages can be shaded to show density of
       population and anticipated number of persons per acre should be indicated.

                                                                                Distribution System


       Location of Service Reservoirs in Different Zones: As already discussed where the
       levels vary considerably, it would be desirable to lay a separate set of leading main to
       each range of levels. Location of reservoir in a zone should be finalised by considering
       the following aspects:

            Nearer to treated water source
            At the higher elevation part of the ground
            Centrally located of the distribution area.

10.3. Types of Distribution Systems

       The various types of distribution system are

       a) Grid Area System: This system eliminates the dead ends and thus permits
          circulation of water. In case of heavy draft on leading mains or branch lines, the
          system permits drawing of water from other connected mains. By locating the valves
          properly, in case of repair of one pipe the area from which water is cut off can be
          reduced to one block only, keeping the supply in rest of the area uninterrupted.
          Valves are generally installed three at crosses, two at Tees, and one on single hydrant
          branch.

             The only disadvantages in this method are that the distributing mains are rather more
             complicated and more turn-off valves are necessary and the labour in turning off
             various sections in the sub-districts is slightly greater.

       b) Dead-End System: As the name implies this is a system in which the main line is
          laid on the main road, from these, smaller pipes serve individual streets but do not
          connect at their ends with other mains. In this system if a pipe line near the centre of
          the system develops fault, a large area will be without water.

       c) Compromise System: In most of the cases, only compromise system is possible. In
          this system the pipes provide circulation only where it is provided at reasonable costs,
          but where it is not feasible to connect the pipe ends they are left unconnected and
          adequate arrangement for flushing through hydrants is made. The examples of such
          cases are that it is costly to lay a pipe line across a rocky bed of the stream or under a
          rail road multiple tracks or a multilane highway etc. Under such situation, dead ends
          are unavoidable.

       In rural water supply schemes, grid area system is being recommended.

10.4. Methods of Network Analysis

       The network analysis method in the design of water distribution system consists of sizes
       of pipes, sizing of reservoirs and fixing the location of reservoirs and pumps etc. suitable
       for the proposed layout. The modified Hazen-William’s formula is popularly used for
       finding out the size of the pipe for a given flow.

Chapter-10                                                                                Page 10-2
                                                                              Distribution System


       1) Trial and Error Method: In this method, the heads or flows are assumed in the pipe
          system and the corresponding heads and flows obtained by the use of tables in
          CPHEEO Manual, based on modified Hazen-William’s formula, the nearness of
          assumed head or flows is tested. The process is repeated till the time the head losses
          and flows agree within 0.3 m and 2% respectively when a correct solution is found.

       2) Computation in Dead End System: The design of dead end distribution system is
          done taking into consideration of present & prospective population, topographical
          map of the town and the layout of the piping etc.

       3) Hardy Cross Method (Balancing Heads): The methods discussed above can be
          employed to any distribution system. The problem becomes more complex when
          there are series of interconnected endless line in the layout of the system. For such
          systems, a method developed by Professor Hardy Cross is most widely used. The
          Hardy Cross method is a controlled trial and error process in which the heads are
          balanced. In layout of a system like grid iron, water travels and reaches different
          points by more than one route. It is, therefore, necessary first of all, to find out the
          quantities of flow passing via each route.

10.5. Hydraulic Network Analysis

       A pipe network map corresponding to the road network of the village is prepared for
       hydraulic analysis. The total length of present pipe network is calculated. The estimated
       population/households for the design period are arrived at. From this data the households
       per running meter of network is calculated and hence the demand per running meter of
       the pipe network is calculated. The demand for each pipe section is arrived calculating
       from the end point as per the number of the households per running meter. The
       cumulative demand is calculated for each branch and for the trunk main. This demand is
       average demand; however, the network is to be designed for the peak flow. The pipe
       network is then analyzed for the estimated demand using the suitable peak factor.

       Input Data

       In the hydraulic network design one of the important criteria is the head loss allowed in
       the distribution system. This is also an important constraint required in the optimization
       of pipe sizes required in the linear programming model. The use of smaller diameter
       pipes results in higher head loss which calls for higher staging heights of OHSR to
       ensure desired residual pressure at the farthest delivery point. On the other hand, use of
       higher diameter pipes results in lower head losses but increase the cost of the pipeline.
       Hence the pipe sizes selected shall be optimized using the maximum and minimum head
       loss that can be permitted. Usually a minimum head loss of 0.5 m/ km and maximum
       head loss of 5 m/ km are adopted in a rural water supply system.

       The minimum head loss is calculated as the drop in elevation from the LWL of the
       OHSR to the lowest point in the village divided by the distance from the OHSR to the
       lowest elevation point along the network. The maximum head loss is calculated as the

                                                                              Distribution System


       drop in elevation from the MWL of the OHSR to the highest point in the village divided
       by the distance from the OHSR to the highest elevation point along the network.

       Next important input to the analysis is the Hazen – William’s coefficient ‘C’ for design
       purpose is to be given as input based on the type of pipe material used in the network.

       The network should be designed using software Watergem/Loop/Epanet/or any other
       latest software.

10.6. Location of the valves:

       One sluice valve shall be located at the starting point of the distribution system near the
       OHSR to cut off or restore the flow from OHSR into the distribution system. Each
       branch is also provided with one sluice valve for controlling the flow into that branch.
       Valves on the main line are not recommended. However, main line valves may be
       installed where it is necessary to isolate the supply of water to the various zones. The
       need for Scouring a distribution system arises rarely. However, in an intermittent supply,
       water stagnates in valley portions, which has to be drained out so that stagnant water is
       not supplied to the consumers. Hence scour valves are provided in the valley portions.
       The size of scour valve in a distribution system of rural water supply shall not normally
       exceed 50 mm. Further this valve must be protected against misuse and provided with a
       masonry chamber and a cover with a locking arrangement. The outlet of scour valve shall
       be connected to a drain. It should be ensured that wastewater from the drain will not
       contaminate the drinking water through the scour pipe. All drain crossings of the
       distribution system pipes shall be provided with an outer casing pipe to prevent
       contamination by the drain water. Air valves are provided at the highest points of mains
       to release air so that bursting of pipes can be prevented. The whole arrangement is shown
       in Figure: 10-1 as mentioned below:

       the project with a five year maintenance guarantee. The water meter fixed should
       conform to IS: 779.

10.8. Flow Meters

       Water shall be conveyed to OHSR by installing bulk meters confirming to IS: 2373 at the
       inlet point in a Village. The bulk meter shall be taken with 5 years guarantee from the
       supplier.

       Guidelines for Selection, Installation & Maintenance of Domestic Water Meters

       The following points shall govern the selection of meters as per IS: 779:

       ii)    The maximum flow shall not exceed the nominal capacity of the meter.
       iii)   The continuous flow shall not be greater than the continuous running capacity
              rating.

       Inferential water meter has the same accuracy as the semi-positive type at higher flows. It
       passes unfiltered water better than a semi-positive meter and is lower in cost.

       Special care is necessary in selecting the most suitable meter where large rates of flow
       may exist for short periods. The normal working flow shall be well within the continuous
       running capacity specified in IS: 779. As high rates of flow over short period may cause
       excessive wear if the meter chosen is too small for the duty.

       Owing to the fine clearances in the working parts of meters, they are not suitable for
       measuring water containing sand or similar foreign matter, and in such cases a filter or
       dirt box of adequate effective areas shall be fitted on the upstream side of the meter. It
       should be noted that the normal strainer fitted inside a meter is not a filter and does not
       prevent the entry of small particles, such as sand.

       Installation of Meter: A meter shall not be run with free discharge to atmosphere, if the
       static pressure on the main exceeds 10 m head of water, otherwise the meter is liable to
       be overloaded and damaged. For house connections and similar applications, there shall
       always be some resistance on the downstream side of the meter.

       A Meter shall be located where it is not liable to get severe shock of water hammer,
       which might break the piston or damage the rotor, and the position shall be such that it is
       always full of water. If the meter body or adjacent pipes become partially drained of
       water, the accumulated air, when passed through the meter, is registered as water and
       may cause inaccuracies and perhaps damage. The inaccuracies may be more pronounced
       in the case of inferential meters. Thus we should avoid the use of such type of meters. In
       the case of intermittent water supply system, where there are frequent changes of air
       locks, the piston of the semi-positive meter often breaks. In such a case, it is advisable to
       ensure that the top of the meter is below the level of the communication pipe.

       Semi-positive meters may be fixed in any position, with the dials facing upwards or
       sideways, and they may be installed in horizontal or vertical pipe runs without affecting
       wearing properties of accuracy at normal service flows. Where backWard flows are
       anticipated, reflux valves are recommended to be provided. A stop valve should be
       provided on the upstream side to isolate the meter whenever necessary.
Chapter-10                                                                                Page 10-7
                                                                               Distribution System


       Inferential meters shall be installed in position for which they are designed in the case of
       meters confirming to IS: 779. They shall be placed horizontally with dial facing upwards.
       However, where meters are to be installed in vertical pipelines, details shall be as agreed
       to between the manufacturer and the purchaser.

       Turbulent flow of water affects the accuracy of the meter. There shall, therefore, be
       straight lengths of pipes upstream and downstream of meter for an equivalent length of
       ten times the nominal diameter of the pipe.

       Meters liable to damage by frost shall be suitably protected. It is possible to incorporate
       frost protection devices in certain types of meters, if ordered. Several devices are
       adopted, the, most common among them being a collapsible metal ring which, under frost
       pressure, allows the top plate carrying the mechanism to lift and thus safeguard the body,
       or a metal disc in the body which gives way under pressured. These devices have the
       following disadvantages:

       a) The damaged ring or plate requires immediate replacement in order to stop wastage
          and restore water supply to consumer
       b) Water runs to waste till the meter is attended to which means loss of revenue
       c) Damage is discovered only after thawing has started.

                                   11. SCADA & Automation System

11.1. SCADA

       SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) will be provided in all large MVS,
       while for small MVS simple automation shall be provided.

       Brief description of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) to be provided
       is given below:

       The system is designed for ultimate flows and has to serve the present demand which will
       progressively increase. The hydraulic design done for ultimate demand is to be checked
       for residual heads for present demand and intermediate demand also. The residual heads
       (pressures) are also to be regulated and need to be adjusted for progressive changes in
       demand. The inflow into ESRs has to be controlled to the required rate of flow and also to
       control the cumulative flow. When the ESRs overflow the level is to be sensed and the
       flow into ESR is to be stopped. To achieve this control of inflow into the ESR with
       manual operations is infeasible and not desirable. It is necessary to provide flow and
       level measurement & control device. Apart from the above, the flow measurement also
       helps in analyzing the water losses and water auditing in the system. The availability of
       dependable quality power is always an issue which affects the performance of the control
       devices.

11.2. Control Philosophy of SCADA

       Main Components of Flow and pressure measurement and controls are: (i) ultrasonic level
       (ESR) sensor & transmitter (ii) pressure sensor & transmitter (iii) pressure reducing valve
       (if required) (iv) turbine flow meter with signal generation (v) valve actuator motor (vi)
       valve actuator drive (MOV) (vii) programmable logic controller/remote terminal unit
       (viii) battery power Backup system including for motor actuator and solar back up.

       The flow and pressure are monitored through the flow measured device and it will be
       transmitted to RTU. When the flow varies from the set point of flow then the MOV will
       operate by automatic command from the RTU to regulate and achieve the required design
       flow at inlet of the ESR. The level in the ELSR will be monitored and transmitted to
       RTU. When the maximum water level reaches in the ELSR, MOV at inlet will close by
       automatic command from RTU. When the water level falls below maximum water level
       in the ELSR MOV at inlet will open by automatic command from RTU. The battery back-
       up system is required with charger facility with minimum 24 hour battery back-up and
       solar connectivity enabled.

11.3. Automation

             starting with respect to lower level of higher tank .This controller is capable of to
             monitor the predetermined two point water level in the overhead tank to ensure the
             automatic starting of the pump as soon as the water level reaches the predetermined
             lowest point in order to eliminate the emptying of water tank and also overhead tank
             reaches highest point of predetermined water level in order to avoid the overflowing ,
             thus wastage of water.

            Starter

             It should consist of STAR-DELTA starter to be operated by & with the help of
             “Artificial Intelligence” unit (described later in this chapter) to start & stop the motor
             / pump, with protection of thermal overload relay. Electronic timer is used to change
             the star into delta connection.

            Auto /Manual Switch

             protective & control devices discussed under this specification under digital mode of
             operation. If all the protective and control devices permits then it send the signal to
             the starter unit to get the motor/pump “ON / OFF”. Under normal operating
             conditions, it is the replacement of “human intelligence”.

            Electrical Panels

             A panel is an essential component of the electrical machinery. Various functions
             which the panel board has to serve are:

                    To receive the power supply
                    Distribution
                    Controls
                    Protection
                    Under voltage relays
                    Over current relay.

             The components of panel board are:

                    Starters
                    Level controls
                    Single phasing preventer
                    3 Phase indicators
                    Dry run preventer
                    Capacitors
                    AVO meter.

            Starters

             The principal methods of starting three phase squirrel cage motors are Direct Online
             (DOL), Star Delta and Auto-Transformer.

             When using direct starting, the only control gear is a switch or circuit breaker which
             serves to isolate the motor from the supply. Some starters have two positions for the
             operating handle, Off and On (or Run). The Start position of the latter type cuts out
             the overload coils and this is the only difference between the two types of starters.

             If the motor fails to start when the starter handle is moved to start position, the handle
             should not be moved over to run position but should be immediately returned to Off
             position otherwise both motor and starter will get damaged.

                              12. GROUND WATER RECHARGE

12.1. Need for Ground Water Recharge

       India has had a rich tradition of ground water recharge which is more than two millennia
       old. Evidence of this tradition has been found in ancient texts, inscriptions and
       archaeological remains. Sub-surface storage of harvested rain water through recharge to
       ground water reservoir is a relatively recent technique. In this technique, the harvested
       rainwater is transferred to the aquifer through civil structures like recharge pit, recharge
       trench, tube well / recharge well, recharge shaft, check dam, percolation tank, etc. This
       process of augmentation of ground water reservoir at a rate exceeding that under natural
       conditions of replenishment through suitable civil structures is known as artificial
       recharge. The source water for recharge can be runoff from the catchment area, canal
       water or treated waste water.

       The dependence on ground water as a reliable source for meeting the requirements for
       drinking, irrigation and industrial uses in India has been rising rapidly during the last few
       decades. Ground water development has occupied an important place in Indian economy
       because of its role in stabilizing agriculture and as a means for drought management. In
       many parts of the country, ground water development has already reached a critical stage,
       resulting in acute scarcity of the resource. Over- development of the ground water
       resources results in declining ground water levels, shortage in water supply, intrusion of
       saline water in coastal areas and increased pumping lifts necessitating deepening of
       ground water abstraction structures. These have serious implications on the environment
       and the socio-economic conditions of the populace. Worsening ground water quality has
       also adversely affected the availability of fresh ground water in several areas. The
       prevailing scenario of ground water development and management in India calls for
       urgent steps for augmentation of ground water resources to ensure their long-term
       sustainability. The diverse nature of the terrain and complexities of hydro-geological
       settings prevailing in the country makes this a challenging task.

       In this context Central Ground Water Board ( CGWB), an apex organization at Central
       level under the Ministry of Water Resources has prepared guidelines as well as master
       plan for artificial recharge to ground water for augmenting ground water resources
       through scientifically designed artificial recharge structures to harvest non-committed
       surplus runoff which otherwise runs off into sea. A number of pilot schemes and
       demonstrative artificial recharge schemes have been implemented by the Board in
       association with various State Government Organizations since the 8th plan period. These
       are aimed at popularizing cost-effective ground water augmentation techniques suitable
       for various hydro-geological settings, to be replicated by other agencies elsewhere in
       similar areas. Based on the valuable experience gained from such activities, the Board
       has also brought out a number of publications on various aspects of artificial recharge.
       The ‘Manual on Artificial Recharge of Ground Water’ 2013 is the latest in this series and
       has updated information on various aspects of investigation techniques for selection of
       sites, planning and design of artificial recharge structures, their economic evaluation,
       monitoring and technical auditing of schemes and issues related to operation and
       maintenance of these structures.

12.4. Ground Water Exploitation Status

       The ground water contributes nearly 85 % of the rural water supply, at places, however,
       there has been over exploitation of ground water and deterioration in ground water
       quality reported. Also, in some areas semi critical blocks have been found to slip into
       critical category. In general the ground water development in the blocks / districts
       covering project area states are low in as much as in state of Assam and Bihar all the
       blocks fall in safe category. The district wise status of ground water exploitation in terms
       of categorization of blocks for Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh is given in table below.

       In Assam and Bihar, there are no critical or semi critical zones hence not furnished in the above
       table Criteria for selection of sites for recharge structures

       Depending upon geomorphologic and physiographic conditions as well as conditions
       suitable for recharge, availability of source water the approach for artificial recharge has
       been recommended suiting to the environment.

       The suitability of an aquifer for recharging has been estimated from the following
       parameters; Surface material which has to be highly permeable so as to allow water to
       percolate easily.

       The unsaturated zone should present a high vertical permeability, and vertical flow of
       water should not be restrained by less permeable clayey layers.

       Depth to water level should not be less than 7 to 10 m.

       Aquifer transmissivity should be high enough to allow water to move rapidly from the
       mound created under the recharge basin.

       An adequate transmissivity for recharge is also a good indicator of the aquifer capacity to
       produce high well discharge and therefore easily to return the water stored.

12.5. Ground Water Prospect Maps

       NRSA have prepared Ground Water Prospects and Recharge Zone Maps for Project
       States of Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. These maps are deciphered & used
       in identifying sites suitable for developing ground water based supplies in no-source
       habitation areas. Such maps also help in identifying suitable sites for recharging ground
       water. These maps are given in detailed at Annexure-10 (Volume-2)

12.6. Technological Options for Recharge

       Artificial Recharge Issues

       Artificial recharge techniques will address following issues at various at various types of
       water supply scheme levels.

       Increase sustainable water yield in areas where over-exploited, critical and semi-critical
       development have variously depleted aquifers. Conserve and dispose of run-off in
       storage for future needs improve the quality of deteriorated ground water through
       dilution.

       Remove bacteriological and other impurities from sewer and waste-water so that water is
       reused. The problems of water table decline and water quality deterioration are present
       variously in parts of some blocks/villages in the identified study districts. The use of
       artificial recharge techniques shall benefit communities ground water based water supply
       and reverse/improve falling water table and dwindling water quality due to high arsenic
       in, fluoride, nitrate, and iron levels in ground water of water supply scheme areas.

       Design Criterion

       The basic requirements for recharging the ground water reservoir are:

            Availability of non-committed surplus monsoon rainfall runoff in space and time.
            Identification of suitable hydro geological environment and sites for creating
             subsurface reservoir through cost effective artificial recharge techniques.

       Design Considerations

       The important aspects to be looked into for designing a aquifer recharge system to
       augment ground water resources are:

            Hydrogeology of the area including nature and extent of aquifer, soil cover,
             topography, depth to water level and chemical quality of ground water
            The availability and quality of source water, one of the prime requisite for ground
             water recharge, basically assessed in terms of non-committed surplus monsoon runoff


Chapter-12                                                                               Page 12-7
                                                                          Ground Water Recharge

            Area contributing runoff like area available, land use pattern etc.
            Hydro meteorological characteristics like rainfall duration, general pattern and
             intensity of rainfall.

       Potential Areas

            Where ground water levels are more than 8 m deep and declining on regular basis
            Where substantial amount of aquifer has been de-saturated
            Where availability of ground water is inadequate in lean months
            Urban areas where infiltration of rain water into subsoil has decreased drastically
             resulting into diminished recharge to ground water reservoir.

       Scientific Inputs for Effective Recharge

       The efficacy of artificial recharge schemes depends largely on the scientific input of
       source water availability and capability of ground water reservoir to accommodate it,
       which requires detailed knowledge of geological and hydrological features of the area for
       site selection and design of artificial recharge structures. While assessing the availability
       of source water, which is one of the prime requisites for ground water recharge, careful
       consideration has to be given to committed monsoon storages, so that the recharging of
       non-committed surplus monsoon runoff in the given area does not have adverse
       environmental impact like drying up of existing lakes/ponds/reservoirs due to reduction
       in inflows from their catchments. In particular, the features, parameters and data to be
       considered are geological boundaries, hydraulic boundaries, storage capacity, porosity,
       hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, natural discharge of springs, water balance,
       lithology, depth of the aquifer and tectonic boundaries. Detailed knowledge of
       dimensional data of the aquifer i.e. their thickness and lateral extent is necessary for
       evaluation of the storage potential. The availability of sub-surface storage space and its
       replenishment capacity govern the extent of recharge.

       Constraints of Effective Recharging

       Some of the constraints include:

            Source water availability for recharge and aspect of recharging in up Stream of
             watershed depriving downstream habitants
            Lack of understanding of the aspect of rainfall intensity and distribution that
             determines the design of water capturing and its infiltration into aquifers
            Presence of low permeable strata on high permeable deposits
            Occurrence of bad quality water at shallow depth.

       Provisioning and Augmenting Water Supplies for Small and Large Communities

       Ground water is dependable, instant and preferred source for rural communities. CGWB
       3D Aquifer maps, ground water quality maps, NRSA designed ground water prospects
       zone maps, particularly know as hydro-geomorphological maps, depth to water level and
       piezometer levels , geophysical resistivity data shall be analysed in designing and
       improving rural water supply scheme of various type.

       Over area covered with hard rocks, a watershed approach shall be considered in
       identifying the type of recharge structure which would be a check dam, sub surface dyke
       system or small nala bunds and for flat alluvial terrain unlined percolation ponds along
       with bore wells shafts depending upon hydrogeology of the area shall be recommended
       to improve recharge and water supply by small / regional rural water schemes.

       The watershed structures weather check dam, subsurface dam, ponds, open wells, nala
       bunds etc. would need to be protected and maintained and managed to get maximum
       benefits. It is here the convergence of MNREGA, IWMP, NWDPRA, RKVY, ARDWS
       etc. would facilitate water supply management and recharging.

       State level watershed mission, Self Help Group (SHG) working under IWMP project,
       watershed committees, NGOs and various level stakeholders should converge towards
       decision taking leading to improvement in water supply scheme at local and regional
       level. Manual is thus intended to besides other things; help improve sustainable
       development of water sources / sewage in rural communities.

       Choice for Recharge Methods

       The depth to water table, soil permeability, Hydraulic conductivity & Transmissivity of
       unconfined aquifer shall play a large role in choosing appropriate methods of recharging
       ground water sources. The following ground water recharge techniques commensurate
       with depth of aquifer are identified study districts (CGWB Guidelines) shall be caused
       for adaptation. These are as described as below :

       (i)      Percolation Pond
       (ii)     Dug Well Recharge
       (iii)    Recharge Through Shaft
       (iv)     Recharge Through Shaft with Recharge Well
       (v)      Recharge Trench
       (vi)     Recharge Pit with Bore Well
       (vii)    Check Dam
       (viii)   Subsurface Dyke

       The selection of above mentioned methods shall be locations specific and depend upon
       the several local factors like: (i) hydro geological parameters (ii) geo-morphological
       parameters (iii) water (iv) soil permeability/conductivity/transmissivity of the acquifer.
       The brief sample design of recharge structures (for guidance purpose only) has been
       attached at Annexure-11 (Volume-2). However for selection of recharge methods
       including planning & design; The recommendation of Central Ground Water Board/State
       Ground Water Board may be referred.

       Convergence Strategy

       Water has been at the core of various development schemes initiated by different
       Ministries of the Government of India. There has been increasing recognition over the
       years of the need for water conservation and efficient water management. Ground water
       is a common pool resource and mostly being developed through private entrepreneurship.
       Due to ubiquitous nature of ground water, it is the most preferred source; Hence very
       often it is being developed in an unscientific way leading to over-exploitation, decline in
       water level and other environmental problems. Judicious development of ground water

                                                                       Ground Water Recharge

       with suitable conservation measures is the need of the time. Several efforts are being
       made in this direction by different Govt. departments as well as stakeholders who have as
       their critical components, water conservation and water management issues.

       Various Central Ministries have number of centrally sponsored programme/ schemes. As
       many as nine centrally sponsored schemes have been launched by GoI which have
       affinity with Water Resources, Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment. Such
       schemes/ programme include Dug-well Recharge Scheme, Natural Rural Employment
       Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP),
       Farmers Participatory Action Research Programme, (FPARP), Rashtriya Krishi Vigyan
       Yojna (RKVY), National Watershed Development Programme (NWDP), National
       Afforestation Programme (NAP), National Horticulture Mission (NHM), National Food
       Security Mission (NFSM) and Bharat Nirman Yojna (BNY) and sustainability of Rural
       Drinking Water Supply etc.

       Central and State Departments are spending large amounts on such schemes for
       development of living conditions of rural areas. All such schemes haves one thing in
       common and that is the element of recharge that accrues directly and indirectly through
       implementation of these schemes leading to improvements in the availability of water and
       its quality, locally and regionally. Ministry of Rural Development has already worked out
       the convergence modalities on water recharge measures such as construction of check
       dams, recharge shafts under NREGA and running maintenance under watershed
       programme / RRR of Water Bodies; creation of ponds under NREGS and linking under
       RKVY programme of Ministry of Agriculture ( MOA), etc. The artificial recharge
       activities in most cases cannot be taken up by individuals. It would require group action
       at community level or even by farmer’s level with financial assistance by the
       Government and financial institutions. There is also a need to work out the viable model
       under Public – private partnership mode. Further, the success of the programme would
       also depend upon inter-agency cooperation for joint programming, planning and
       implementation. Following are the excerpts of various sustainability schemes of the
       Government which have water recharge as one of the critical components:

       1. National Afforestation Programme: The overall objective of the scheme is to
          develop the forest resources with people’s participation. Financial support under the
          scheme is also provided for soil and water conservation
       2. National Project for Repair, Restoration and Renovation of Water Bodies
          (RRR): Under the scheme, the states are to take up restoration of water bodies having
          original irrigation cultivable command area of 40 ha to 2000 ha to revive, augment
          and utilize their storage and irrigation potential
       3. National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS): One of the most
          successful programmers of Govt. of India, among the works undertaken under
          NREGS, water conservation, ground water recharge and water harvesting has high
          priority which culminates with creating durable assets in rural areas through legal
          guarantee of 100 days of employment
       4. HARYALI : The objective of the project is to harvest every drop of water other than
          employment generation, poverty alleviation community empowerment etc. This
          scheme is already in vogue, various water conservation measures suggested needs to
          be integrated with this scheme.

       Relevant components of the recommended measures for water conservation and artificial
       recharge to ground water may be dovetailed with the above schemes which would enable
       effective implementation.

       A multi-faceted strategy is needed to be adopted towards achieving convergence among
       various programme/schemes having common goals. Convergence in essence is a mean to
       achieving integrated planning and implementation at grass-root level. First step is in this
       direction would be identifying potential areas/schemes for convergence which have
       similar and common goals. The exercise of convergence should commence at grass roots
       with process of grass-roots planning. MNREGA is model national programme for
       convergence in Agricultural level programmes. Common goals of improving &
       augmenting existing rural drinking and allied water supplies should be set up in terms of
       physical & financial targets.

       Institutional arrangements to facilitate convergence exist at various levels like at (i)
       villages (ii) block and (iii) district level. Institutional at village level are gram panchyats
       and village level water and sanitation committees, at block level it is block panchayat and
       at district level it is zila parishad for planning at districts level. Convergence in
       programmes towards maximization of return from investments can be achieved through
       Technical Advisory Groups (TAGS) at gram panchayat level, where knowledgeable
       extension officers can facilitate convergence.

       In view of common objective under various centrally sponsored schemes, a common
       ‘Recharge Fund”, should be built to promote augmentation of rural drinking water
       supplies.

       Convergence, therefore, at gross-root institutional levels would enable participatory
       approach in the implementation of common programme & schemes with common goal of
       affecting recharge & sustainability to drinking water sources in rural areas. However, the
       knowledge & know-how at gross –roots being limited, the dissemination of knowledge
       would form part of convergence. The States & Department level coordination committees
       can generate know-how for dissemination at gross root level. Standing committees for
       planning can serve platform for convergence. The introduction and up- gradation of
       appropriate technologies should form integral part of convergence strategy & plans. In
       fact, convergence is an opportunity for institutions to resort the R&D in augmentation of
       recharge techniques and methods through special and Common Recharge Fund (CRF).

   13. SOLID AND LIQUID WASTE MANAGEMENT


13.1. Assessment of Existing situation

             During the site visit conducted at 04 states, the general observations are:

             1.   Non availability of sufficient space of placement of leach pit
             2.   Pit emptying is a cultural problem
             3.   On subsequent uses the pit porosity is reduced
             4.   Improper disposal of waste water create unhygienic conditions
             5.   Non availability of proper drainage system causes unhygienic conditions
             6.   Non availability of proper solid waste management system that includes: waste
                  collection, transportation, processing, recycling or disposal.

             In absence of any other solution, the same leach pit system is being practiced in rural
             areas even now. Besides, with the increasing use of water supply, disposal of grey
             water from kitchen and bath and black water from existing conventional septic tanks
             have added to sanitation problem to formidable heights.

13.2. Solid and Liquid Waste Management Plan (SLWM)


13.2.1. Introduction

       Solid and liquid waste management is the collection, transportation, processing,
       recycling, or disposal of waste materials, usually produced by human activity, in an effort
       to reduce their effect on human health, local aesthetics or amenity. The objectives of
       waste management is primarily to protect human health, reduce environment pollution
       and make rural areas clean, besides promoting recycling and reuse of both solid and
       liquid waste after providing necessary treatment. Considering village layout, its
       topography, the possible place of final disposal say natural drain, pond, or for
       afforestation etc., the most cost effective alternative acceptable to the community be
       adopted.

       Depending on the arrangement of the houses along the village street, the type of
       pavement and the village topography the street drains could be on one side or both sides
       ,or could be as centrally laid pipe drains with proper covering at crossings.

       The drain should cover all the village area so that at no place, water remains stagnated
       and it is not necessary that there is only one outfall point. However the drain should have
       sufficient carrying capacity to carry storm water and should have sufficient slopes to
       generate self-cleansing velocities, which may not be possible in all the cases. The street
       pavement could be allowed to carry storm water also where pavement slopes permit the
       same.

       Deep and too narrow drains be avoided and the top width of the drain should be kept
       considering the street width and the type of traffic plying over it. All these considerations

       need adequate data about the village layout as well as slopes, type of pavement, street
       width etc.

       A master plan for village environmental sanitation shall be prepared for:

       I. Human waste
       II. Liquid waste both grey and black water
       III. Solid waste both organic and inorganic waste.

       In preparing the plan, following considerations be kept:

            Technology suggested should as far as possible be simple, cost effective and easy to
             maintain
            Plan should be socially acceptable considering community practices, social customs
             and traditions
            Plan should be compatible considering, climate, topography and geo-hydrological
             conditions of the village
            Community level skills, their experiences and suggestions in view of their living
             habits are kept in view.

13.2.2. Village Transact

       The solid and liquid waste management plan [SLWM] should be prepared only after
       detailed field survey including household survey and a walkthrough in the village along
       with the community.          This will generate the required information about the
       environmental problems being faced in the village and the community’s approach
       towards these. During the transact walk participatory rapid appraisal (PRA) in the
       village, it will be fruitful to identify problem and to suggest possible alternatives for
       mitigating them. Against the problems faced by the community, it will help in arriving at
       the acceptable solutions agreed by the community. As each village has their own
       problems, there cannot be one single SLWM for adoption by all the villages. It is
       suggested that during discussions at the time of village transact, community decision will
       be required to sort out issues such as locating proposed works such as treatment plant/
       disposal facility. In such issues the decision of the village panchayat will be necessary
       especially if it is a panchayat land. During the site visit, the identification of desire/need
       and capabilities of the community shall be assessed. This would facilitate in proper
       planning, designing, constructing and O&M of the solid and liquid waste collection,
       transportation, treatment and disposal.

13.2.3. Data Verification

       A checklist of the various information to be gathered during the household survey and
       field visit to be prepared to assist in the formulation of the village SLWM. This
       information be checked and physically verified to avoid any disputes during
       implementation of the plan. The common observation is that in some household there
       may not be sufficient space to construct the two pits required for twin pit pour flush
       sanitary latrine. The alternative such as combining the two pits into one or providing
       small bore sewers for carrying the wastewater to disposal points etc. be examined.
       Likewise there may be other issues such as alignment of drains, providing open or

       covered/pipe drains etc. which have to be looked into as per specific condition and
       requirements of the village.

13.2.4. Strategy

       The strategy for preparing the SLWM plan for the village is to manage the waste as far as
       possible at the household community level. For this, the various options available are
       detailed out in this chapter. The solid waste which consists of house sweepings, kitchen
       waste, garden waste, cattle dung and waste from cattle shed, agro waste [all bio-
       degradable] along with broken glass, metal, waste paper, plastics, and cloths etc. [all non-
       bio-degradable] should as far as possible be segregated at the household level itself. The
       non- biodegradable waste could be stored safely at a corner of the house and could be
       recycled or sold to the vendor [kabadi walla]. The bio-degradable waste should be
       collected and composted.

13.2.5. Checklist

       Checklist for preparation of SLWM Plan for village:

       1. Total population and no. of households in the village
       2. No. of households having sanitary latrines or septic tanks for safe disposal of human
           excreta
       3. No. of households without latrines or dry pit type latrines requiring sanitary
           latrines, and the no. of people who defecates in open
       4. No. of households where twin pit pour flush latrines could be constructed as sufficient
           space is available for the construction of the two pits. In case of non-availability of
           space, other alternatives such as combining the two pits into one or any other
           alternative is feasible
       5. In case no other alternative is possible whether community latrines with septic tanks
           will have to be provided
       6. Considering the depth of subsoil water level, the substrata characteristics, flood
           proneness and location of water sources do any special treatment is required, if so the
           details of the treatment be decided
       7. No. of houses having cattle, the no. of cattle in each such house and their present
           method of disposal of cattle dung including the cattle yard waste. Is their sufficient
           space in cattle yard to carry out composting as per various alternatives, if not is there
           any possibility of providing for the village compost plant on cost as well as benefit
           sharing basis amongst the participants?
       8. Does the village have street sweeping arrangement or the house sweepings are thrown
           on the street? Can the households be motivated to segregate the waste into two parts
           i.e. bio degradable and non-bio degradable?
       9. Does the household have adequate space to carry out composting, vermi composting
           thereby taking care of their waste in the household itself?
       10. For non-bio degradable solid waste left after use through recycling is there any
           opportunity for sale to the vendor [Kabbadi wala]? if not can it be organized at the
           panchayat end?
       11. How many houses have enough space to practice kitchen gardening for disposal of
           bathroom waste? In any case street drains will have to be provided for taking care of
           rain water discharge.

13.3. Solid Waste Storage, Collection, Transportation, Disposal and Recyclable System-

13.3.1. General

       The solid waste generated from various users like domestic, institutional and commercial
       (if any) have been broadly classified into two categories : (i) biodegradable (organic) and
       (ii) non-biodegradable (inorganic ) waste. Organic wastes apart from human excreta are:
       (i) household kitchen left over (ii) fruits and vegetables peelings agriculture waste and
       (iii) cow as well as other animal dung. These waste are highly degradable and if not
       disposed of within few days, may exerts foul smell and generates fly, mosquito and other
       nuisance inform of insects and rodents. Such wastes could be converted into compost
       which is used in farming as good manure. This manure provides adequate quantity of
       Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium which are required in plant growth besides
       providing humus for increasing porosity of soil.

       Inorganic wastes are metal, glass, plastic, stone, sweeping and debris etc. Part of these
       waste could be exchanged with money, while balance could be disposed of on sanitary
       landfill. Front end loaders, trucks, Tractor/Trolley etc. shall be used for collection and
       transportation of solid wastes.

       The solid waste management system for inorganic & organic waste has been described as
       below:

13.3.2. Non-Biodegradable (Inorganic) Waste

       Instead of throwing house sweeping and other waste outside the house, it is suggested
       that the waste be segregated into two categories separately i.e. bio degradable (organic)
       and non-biodegradable (inorganic) waste and be placed into two separate pits of
       dimensions 1.5’ x 1.5’ x 1’ deep dug in a corner of the courtyard of the house. After
       segregation, the non-bio degradable (inorganic) waste like glass, plastic, metal, paper etc.
       could be disposed of to the vendors in exchange of some commodities or even money. In
       some villages, those near the town such vendor facility is available while in other villages
       these could be developed once the system for segregation of waste at the house itself is
       practiced and the waste are available for recycling. Till then the collection of inorganic
       waste can be taken out of the pit when full and disposed of at the village dumping ground
       outside the habitation. There is need to improve the village dumping ground into a
       sanitary landfill. The details of sanitary landfill are given below. Segregating the two type
       of wastes will improve the aesthetic look of the village and its surrounding and will
       reduce the growth of rodents and flies etc. which presently inhabits at the village
       dumping ground, where at present mixed (organic and inorganic waste) are dumped.

13.3.2.1. Sanitary Landfill

         In almost all villages of the four low income states (Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar
         Pradesh) at present there is no system for sweeping streets, collection and transportation
         of waste to disposal site. As such it is suggested that no waste should be thrown out of
         the household and it should be segregated into organic and inorganic wastes at the
         household itself. The inorganic waste consists of glass metal, wood, paper stone and
         masonary debris, part of which could be recovered and recycled.

13.3.2.2. Planning & Design of a Landfill

         Steps for planning design, implementation and operation of a Sanitary Landfill are:

         1.   Site selection
         2.   Design of sanitary landfill
         3.   Implementation of sanitary landfill
         4.   Operation of sanitary landfill
         5.   Closure and post closure measures.

13.3.2.3. Location Criteria:

         Criteria for identifying suitable land for sanitary landfill has been furnished in the
         Table 13-1 as mentioned below:

13.3.2.4. Assessment of Area Required (an Example)

         An assessment about the quantity of the waste have therefore to be made prior to
         selection of sanitary landfill site. Assuming a per capita generation of waste of 100 gms
         per day for an active fill period of 20 years in a village having a population of 1000, the
         quantity of waste which will be put into the sanitary landfill during this period works
                                 ∗     ∗   ∗
         out to 730 tons                       . Assuming that one ton waste occupies one meter
                                     ∗
         cube volume, the area required to accomodate this much of waste will have an average
         fill depth of 4 meter works out to 182.50 sq meter. Taking 30% (thirty percent) as area
         required for supporting infrastructure, the total area required is around 250 sq meter.
         Depending upon the design population of the village and the expected collection
         percentage of the waste generated the area of landfill site be worked out and a few
         probable sanitary landfill site be identified. Further the site has to be finally selected
         based on draft rules prepared for Municipal Sanitary landfill site.

13.3.2.5. Development of a List of Potential Sites

         In areas where land is scarce, degraded sites such as abandoned quarry sites or old
         waste dump sites can be considered. The required area for a sanitary landfill including

Chapter-13                                                                                     Page 13-5
                                                                  Solid and Liquid Waste Management


         the related infrastructure has been worked out in earlier paragraph. For population of
         1000 and active fill period of 20 years, the area requirement shall be 250 square meter
         with average fill depth of 4 meter.

13.3.2.6. Data Collection

              Following data must be collected for the landfill sites:

                Table 13-2 below presents the data to be collected:

                       Table 13-2: Data Requirement for Sanitary Landfill

              Maps                  regional ground water flow.
        2     Rainfall Data         Precipitation data is used for designing the amount of possible
                                    leachate
        3        Wind Map           Wind rose indicates the predominant wind direction, based on
                                    which landfill infrastructure has to be located
        4        Seismic Data       The seismic activity of a region has to be considered in the
                                    design of Sanitary Landfill
        5        Road Maps          Accessibility of the site.

                The possible sites should be evaluated concerning the topographical conditions
                and the availability for landfill site such as:

                a)   Sufficient size of land
                b)   Flat area with low inclination
                c)   Connection to highways and conditions of the access roads
                d)   Flooding during monsoon
                e)   Land use and soil type
                f)   Depth to ground water table (as observed in open wells or bore wells)
                g)   Information concerning the sub-ground
                h)   Crossing of electrical lines
                i)   Actual settlement patterns (eventual new or informal settlements).

13.3.2.7. Final Site Selection

         The final selection of the site amongst the best alternatives should be done by
         comparing:
         a) The environmental impact
         b) Social acceptance
         c) Land availability
         d) Transportation costs
         e) Sanitary landfilling costs (site specific costs are to be considered).

         Transportation costs may be compared on the basis of average hauling distance from
         the centre of the waste generation.

                                                                Solid and Liquid Waste Management


13.3.2.8. Design Life

         The life of a sanitary landfill will comprise of an active period and a closure and post-
         closure period. The ‘active’ period may typically be 20 years depending on the
         availability of land area. The ‘closure and post-closure’ period for which a sanitary
         landfill will be monitored and maintained will be 25 years and more after the active
         period is completed.

13.3.2.9. Additional area requirement for other services

         The space requirement for filling of waste to be placed in a sanitary landfill should be
         roughly calculated as per considerations mentioned in para 13.3.2.4 above.

         However the total sanitary landfill area would be larger than the area required for the
         filling area to accommodate all infrastructure and support facilities as well as to allow
         the formation of a green belt around the sanitary landfill.

         From a technical point of view it is important to guarantee the runoff of rainwater.
         Therefore minimum inclinations have to be maintained at the slopes. Every footprint of
         the disposal area of landfill will have to maintain a certain minimum height to meet
         these inclination requirements. The height of the sanitary landfill is also constrained by
         the overburden pressure on the soil.

             A sanitary landfill with considerable heights can interfere with the landscape and
             cause visual disturbance.

             A sanitary landfill site will comprise of the area in which the waste will be filled as
             well as additional area for support facilities.

             In sanitary landfill site, following facilities must be located in the layout:
              Access roads
              Small room as office space
              Demarcation of the sanitary landfill areas and areas for stockpiling cover material
                 and liner material
              Drainage facilities
              Location of leachate treatment facilities
              Location of monitoring wells.

             For each sanitary landfill site, a layout has to be designed incorporating all the above
             mentioned facilities. The layout will be governed by the shape of the Sanitary Land
             fill area. However for a small sanitary land fill site; usually space for access road and
             for leachate treatment being very small could be accommodated in additional ten
             percent of area as worked out above for filling of waste and is sufficient to
             accommodate the support facilities also.


13.3.2.10. Technical Design Requirements

             The design of the sanitary landfill focuses on optimized leachate management, as
             leachate generation is a main source of potential environmental pollution. It is

Chapter-13                                                                                  Page 13-7
                                                                 Solid and Liquid Waste Management


             important to minimize leachate generation and to avoid leachate being retained for a
             long time in the landfill body.

             A landfill can be both above ground or partially below ground, based on the local
             hydro- geological situation and the availability of land.

             Above ground landfills have advantage that leachate can flow by gravity according to
             the natural surface slope; leachate is collected in the main leachate pipe (header pipe)
             which is laid to extend beyond the footprint of the landfill.

             At locations where water table is not close to the ground surface, landfill can be at a
             level below the ground level, by excavation, to accommodate more waste per unit area
             of land.

13.3.2.11. Sanitary Landfill in Marshy Regions

             Sanitary Landfill should not be constructed in marshy areas. Under such circumstances
             the local authority should access a regional landfill facility outside the marshy area.

13.3.2.12. Base Sealing System

             The shape of the site should be adapted to the existing conditions with a minimum of
             fills and cuts. However the mass which will be replaced by the sealing system has to
             be excavated.

             The base area has to have a sufficient slope to guarantee draining of leachate and
             storm water. Minimum inclinations are indicated in Table 13-3.

                  Table 13-3: Minimum Inclination Inside the Sanitary Landfill

             Area                       Minimum Inclination
             Base sealing               3% for leachate pipes, roof profile
             Main leachate pipe         1.0 %
             Secondary leachate         3.0 %
             Final slopes               Not less than 1:4 and not greater than 1:20

13.3.2.13. Leachate Management

             One of the most important objectives of a successful landfill management system is to
             avoid leachate generation as far possible and to efficiently drain the leachate contained
             in the waste body and from other contaminated areas. As per the rules, organic and
             hazardous wastes should be diverted away from the landfill.

13.3.2.14. Leachate Generation

             The principal sources of leachate generation include:

                Moisture content of waste entering the landfill
                Infiltration from direct precipitation on the waste surface
                Sealed areas of landfill which are only partially covered with waste
                Surface water flow onto the active face of the landfill.
Chapter-13                                                                                  Page 13-8

13.3.2.15. Leachate Collection

             The leachate from the waste body will be collected in the drainage layer system and in
             the secondary drain pipes made of HDPE and will be directed to the main leachate
             pipes outside the waste body.

             The entire process of construction and arrangement of leachate collection system is
             illustrated thorough Figure 13-1 as below:




                                  Figure 13-1: Leachate Collection

             Leachate Collection pipes is to be connected to a sump, through the liner (in case
             of below ground landfills)

             The primary criterion for design of the leachate collection system is that all leachate
             be collected and removed from the landfill at a rate sufficient to prevent a hydraulic
             head greater than 12 m from occurring at any point over the lining system. The
             system is designed to remove the accumulation of storm water resulting from a 25-
             year, 24-hour storm, within 72 hours. Other design criteria include the following:
              Bottom of the leak detection layer and the leachate collection layer is sloped at a
                 minimum 2%
              Granular drainage layer is 30 cm. thick with hydraulic conductivity >1 x 102 cm/s.
              The system must be designed to minimize clogging
              The system is located above seasonally high water table
              System must be designed to handle the runoff from a 25 year, 24 hour storm.

13.3.2.16. Leachate Pond and Treatment

             The leachate pond is a basin to retain and pre-treat leachate within a period of several
             days. The pond allows sedimentation and biological stabilization. The leachate pond
             should have two basins to achieve an optimal leachate management. As per Rule, bio
             degradable should not be disposed of in landfills. Based on the characteristics of the
             leachate, treatment processes may include: physical, chemical and biological
             processes.

             One of the simple techniques used to manage leachate is to spray it in lined leachate
             ponds and allow the leachate to evaporate.
             Since the quantity of leachate in village sanitary landfill will be very small, hence the
             leachate can also be disposed of by forestry all along the sanitary landfill site.

                                                               Solid and Liquid Waste Management


13.3.2.17. Access Road

             The access road to a sanitary landfill should be constructed in accordance with the
             following design parameters:
               Widths of roadways 4 meter in small country side sanitary landfill
               20 cm stabilized sub-foundation layer

13.3.2.18. Equipment / resources

             The Sanitary landfill should be supplied with:
              Water Supply
              Power
              Communication (Telephone)
              External Lighting
              Fire Fighting (external)

             Site security is among the most important considerations in landfills. The site has to
             be peripherally fenced and access to the landfill limited to one entrance gate, which
             will be locked when the site is unattended. The fence will also keep children,
             unwanted / unorganized scavengers, cattle and animals out of the site. It will also
             protect litter to be blown out of the landfill site.

13.3.2.19. General Safety Measures

             General Safety Measures have to be applied during the operation of the landfill,
             regardless of the nature of ongoing activity or location in the landfill. Given below is
             a list of priority measures, which should be elaborated based on site specific
             conditions:
              Maximum traffic speed should be 20 km/h
              Every person working on the landfill should have a yearly medical examination
              No one should be allowed to operate at the landfill without a mobile
                 communication system (mobile telephone)
              Smoking should be prohibited except in designated smoking areas
              Ingestion of food is restricted outside designated areas
              General hygienic requirements while working on the landfill have to be applied.

              Person Related Safety Measures

                 Workmen have to be equipped with the following personal protection equipment:
                  Safety boots (always to be used while working outside the buildings)
                  Reflective vests (always to be used by all staff working outside the buildings)
                  Safety helmets (to be used in case of risk of injuries to the head e.g. during
                   construction, loading or unloading activities, while operating machinery etc.)
                  Gloves (to be used in case of risk of injuries to the hands e.g. during
                   loading/unloading or maintenance activities)
                  Ear protectors (to be used while working in noisy areas)
                  Disposable dust mask (to be used e.g. in case of exposure to dust).



Chapter-13                                                                                Page 13-10
                                                              Solid and Liquid Waste Management


                The landfill management has to strictly enforce the use of personal protection
                equipment.

              First Aid

                Considering the specific conditions at a sanitary landfill, it is strongly
                recommended that First Aid training needs to be given to staff working in the
                landfill on a regular basis.

              Fire Protection and Prevention

                To prevent fire incidents the following rules have to be applied:
                 Banning smoking in all areas of the sanitary landfill
                 Handling material on fire as well as setting to fire materials on the landfill are
                   strictly forbidden
                 Waste that has been unloaded in the filling area has to be examined visually
                   for potential fire sources (glowing ash or glowing burning remains). If fire
                   sources are located, these have to be neutralized with cover material
                   immediately
                 All mobile equipment/vehicles should be furnished with a fire extinguisher.

              Fire Control

                In case of fire, the following basic rules of conduct have to be complied with:
                 Every fire has to be reported immediately
                 The preservation and the protection of lives and health have priority before the
                    fire fighting. Endangered persons have to be alerted and saved from the range
                    of dangers
                 Rescue of people has priority over fire fighting
                 Alarm signals have to be paid attention to.

13.3.3. Bio Degradable (Organic) Waste

       Storage and improper disposal of organic waste breeds odour and fly nuisance. Organic
       waste could be conveniently converted into useful manure for village farms thereby
       saving in cost of chemical fertilizers besides improving the quality of soil in farm land.
       Use of artificial chemical fertilizers reduces the fertility of soil as they do not contain
       humus necessary for growth of organism in the soil and inhibits the water absorption
       capacity since humus which improves the soil porosity is not present. Presently in most
       of the villages the animal dung along with agriculture waste is dumped in pits outside the
       village or in animal yards near the house. This method of dumping reduces the quality of
       compost available from these pits since most of the nutrients are lost as these pits are
       exposed to the sun and other weather vagaries. Leaches from these pits cause pollution of
       water sources and are also responsible for odour nuisance. It is necessary to organize safe
       disposal of these organic wastes scientifically to reap full benefits along with
       improvement in environmental sanitation status of the village. Two of these methods
       discussed below are economical, technically feasible and are being practiced in quite a
       large numbers of villages and households.


Chapter-13                                                                               Page 13-11
                                                             Solid and Liquid Waste Management


13.3.3.1. Composting Through N.A.D.E.P. System

         Unlike the present system of dumping animal dung, agriculture and other organic waste
         a simple method based on aerobic and anaerobic digestion requiring air, suitable
         temperature and water for the process has been developed.

         This consist of construction of a rectangular enclosure on plain levelled ground of
         length 10 feet, width 5 feet made with honeycombed brick/ stone work in mud mortar.
         Opening on the opposite walls should be of width 7 inches each and should each be in
         front of opening in opposite wall on the other side as far as possible. The height of this
         enclosure wall is about 3’ and the top two layers of the wall should be of 1:6 cement
         mortars to ensure structural strength. The width of the enclosure should not exceed 6’
         while the length could be extended so as to store more waste. As far as possible such
         enclosure is constructed near the farm under the shadow of tree on wet ground. The
         enclosure wall from inside and outside should be hand plastered with a mixture of cow
         dung and mud in a ratio of 2:1 all around. The enclosed bottom ground is wetted with
         water preferably with cow urine. A 6 inches thick layer of leaves and other agriculture
         waste cut in small pieces be laid all over the ground inside the enclosure. This first
         layer of the organic waste is fully wetted with a mixture of about 4 kg of cow dung
         mixed with 5 buckets of water. Over this layer another layer of screened earth with
         about 40-50% of water is laid. This process is repeated for about 10-12 times so that the
         enclosure gets fully filled up. Filling of subsequent layers as mentioned before could be
         raised in a conical shape up to a height of 15 feet with slope all around. The whole
         stack is then painted with a thick plaster of screened earth and water. The stack be
         allowed to get digested which will take around 90-120 days. The stack needs to be kept
         wet such that in case cracks develop in the mound it should be covered with mixture of
         dung and water. A visual inspection through the opening of the enclosure wall will
         show that the waste is converted into compost and a sample could be taken through the
         opening which will show earthly manure with sweet smell. The properly digested
         manure thus prepared will look like a granular tea leaves and be taken out slowly
         through the 5 feet wide face and be screened. The screened manure is then stored into
         gunny bags which should be stored in a shady area with adequate humidity for 30- 45
         days. This manure can be applied into the field during ploughing and can even be
         spread after the initial growth of plant during evening time of the day.

         The construction of above mentioned enclosure is not a major engineering activity and
         does not cost much. It involves use of fifteen hundred bricks, one bag of cement, four
         bags of sand and six bags of aggregate. It can convert 1500 kg of agriculture waste,
         about 100 kg of cow dung and 4 buckets of screened earth. However, the process of
         filling in layers with cow dung and agriculture waste as well as hand plastering with
         mixture of water and dung is quite cumbersome. However like any other agricultural
         activity it can be undertaken by the farmers. It resolves the problem of solid waste
         disposal with considerable physical and economic benefits. The only constraint is the
         collection of 90-150 kg of dung which could be collected from number of animals. This
         constraint arises since most of the household converts the cow dung into sundried dung
         cakes which are used as fuel in preparation of meals. However as a joint venture
         amongst few household having animals and the quantity of compost thus generated
         could accordingly be shared as per contribution of dung and labour. Otherwise, this
         whole activity could be organized at the community level by the village panchayat or
         its subcommittee responsible for water and sanitation project. In any case it will result
         into large saving in foreign exchange by reducing the quantity of imported chemical

                                                              Solid and Liquid Waste Management


         fertilizers and will also generate considerable benefit through increasing the fertility of
         the soil which has been reported to be reducing due to large scale use of chemical
         fertilizer. It will also reduce pollution of water sources as with use of lot of chemicals
         particularly excess of nitrogen, pollution in ground as well as surface water has been
         reported.

13.3.3.2. Vermi Composting

         It is another method of safe disposal of the organic solid waste. It could be organized at
         the community level on a large scale as well as at household level on small scale. This
         will help a lot if all households with courtyard having space for construction of pit takes
         care of disposing their kitchen as well as other organic household waste by carrying out
         vermi composting at their own end. This will also augment the production of vegetable
         and fruits in their kitchen garden. This activity can be carried out by the ladies of the
         household themselves with some support by way of physical labour and small capital
         investment.

         It consists of digging small pit of length 2 feet, depth 2 feet and width 4 feet. If more
         space is available the length could be increased. The pit should be dug in a corner of
         household where drainage water does not stagnate and is protected from flooding by
         rains by providing small thatched cover. After digging the pit a sand layer of about 2-3
         cm. (one inch) thickness is laid at the bottom of the pit. A layer of partly digested cow
         dung in thickness of 5-6 cm. (2 inches) is then laid over it. The third layer to be laid is
         of vegetable matter such as leaves, small sized agricultural waste and kitchen waste.
         This layer has to be covered with the mixture of earth and partially digested cow dung.
         Another layer over it would be of organic matter 8-10 cms (4 inches) thick which
         should be covered with a earth layer of 1 cm (1/2 inch) thickness. After 7 days, 1000
         number worms are placed over it. Within 5 days yellow coloured material appears
         which in fact worm are eggs. In 20 days black coloured matter which crumbles easily
         appears on the surface indicating thereby that the organic matter is converted into
         compost. Within 60-70 days about 15-20 kg compost thus gets produced which should
         be screened and any undigested waste be left into the pit. The compost thus prepared
         should be stacked in bags which should be well protected against sun and strong winds.
         At times some worms come along with the un- screened compost which should also be
         returned into the pit. Thus a cycle of worms is created and initially 1000 worms put into
         the pit do not need to be replenished again for initiation of another cycle in the start.
         This activity can also be organized at community level. The vermi compost is very
         good for vegetable and fruit gardens. In some urban centres this is organized as an
         industry and there is high demand of vermi compost by the city dwellers for growing
         flowers in earthen pots of terrace gardens.

         Two practical methods have been discussed which are being adopted at individual as
         well as small commercial levels. Any centralized system such as sanitary landfill
         (which also includes disposal of inorganic matter, could be practiced at urban
         community level and village community level also. Sanitary landfills need activities
         such as separation of recyclable material, control of fly and odour nuisance by covering
         the daily fillings with sand. The sanitary landfill also needs to have necessary
         infrastructure so as to prevent pollution of water sources through leachate of the
         sanitary landfills.

13.3.3.3. Bio Gas Plant

         All bio degradable organic solid waste could be converted under anaerobic
         decomposition into a gaseous mixture of methane and carbon dioxide known as Biogas.
         The decomposition occurs under the fermentation process which is carried out by
         different groups of microorganism like bacteria, fungus, actinomycetes etc. The
         anaerobic digestion of the organic waste matter occurs in three different stages:
          Hydrolysis
          Acidogenesis
          Methanogenesis




             The biogas technology can be used for management of bio degradable solid waste
             (portion) generated from:
              Household – Kitchen waste, cattle dung, garden waste, leaves etc.
              Community – Cattle dung from gaushalas, garden waste, and agriculture waste.

             The Gas production varies from 0.29 cu.m per kg of volatile solids added per day to
             0.19 cu.m 0.16 cu.m per kg added per day in different seasons. The volatile solids
             destruction ranges from 40 to 55%. The sludge has good manorial value of nitrogen,
             phosphorous, potassium (NPK ratio is 1.6: 0.85: 0.93). The process gives a good
             performance at a retention time of 30 to 55 days varies as per season.

             Design and Construction of Biogas Plant

             There are many designs and models of biogas plants in operation with each one
             having some special characteristics and each popular model having some basic
             components. The biogas plants have following components for proper functioning of
             these designs:
              Digester or fermentation chamber
              Gas holder or gas dome
              Inlet (pipe or tank)
              Outlet (pipe or tank)
              Mixing tank
              Gas outlet pipe

Chapter-13                                                                            Page 13-14

                Inlet and Outlet displacement chambers (for fixed dome biogas plant)
                Inlet and Outlet gates

             Following are the two groups of biogas plant designs:
              Floating gas holder plant e.g. KVIC, water jacket, Pragati etc.
              Fixed dome plant e.g. Janata, Deen Bandhu etc.

             Floating Gas Holder Plant

             This type was developed in India and is usually made of masonry. It runs on a
             continuous basis and uses mainly cattle dung as input material. The gas holder is
             usually made of steel although new materials such as Ferro cement and bamboo
             cement have already been introduced. The original version of this floating gas plant
             was a vertical cylinder provided with partition wall except for small sizes of 2 and 3
             cum of gas per day. The main characteristic of this type is the need for steel sheets
             and welding skill. The mode of functioning of these plants is depicted in the
             following Figure:

                 This plant runs on a continuous or batch basis. Accordingly, it can digest plant
                 waste as well as human and animal waste. It is usually built below ground level
                 hence it is easier to insulate in a cold climate. The plant can be built from several
                 materials, e.g. bricks, concrete, lime concrete and lime clay. This facilitates the
                 introduction and use of local materials and manpower. The available pressure
                 inside the plant doesn’t cause any problems in the use of the gas.

                 In the floating dome type plants the gas holder moves while in the fixed dome
                 plants the slurry moves. The mode of functioning of the fixed dome plant is
                 depicted in the following Figure:

                 In the semi-continuous feed type system, a predetermined quantity of feed
                 material mixed with water is charged into the digester from one side (inlet) at
                 specified interval of time; say once a day and the digested material (effluent)
                 equivalent to the volume of the feed, flows out of the digester from the other side
                 (outlet). The digestion volume remains always constant.

                 This type is best suited for household or family size biogas plants. In practice, it
                 is only this type which has been adopted for all categories of biogas plants, viz.
                 family size, large size (institutional) and community size (village level).

             B. Design Criterion for a Biogas Plant

                    Volume of digester – which is interalia dependent on quality or quantity of
                     feed and its hydraulic retention time
                    Storage capacity of the gas holder - which is dependent on the requirement
                     of gas and the intervals at which substantial quantity of gas is required
                    Delivery pressure of the gas
                    Volume of mixing tank which is dependent on the quantity of daily feeding
                     and proportion of water to be mixed
                    Arrangement of heating and insulation
                    The unit should be strong to have a long life, using local raw materials and
                     labour for construction/ installation and it should be leak proof for liquid and
                     gas
                    Another very important aspect is that the cost should be as minimum as
                     possible.

             C. Advantages

                 Biogas plants help not only in decomposing the solid waste but also produce
                 good amount of clean fuel and environment friendly organic manure. Biogas is a

                 clean fuel which does not make cooking vessels dirty and does not produce
                 smoke to irritate eyes and lungs.

             D. Limitations

                     High cost for lower middle and low income group in rural areas
                     Lack of availability of required technical infrastructure in rural areas.

13.4. Liquid Waste Management

       There are two type of liquid wastes:

        Grey Water

             Water which carried bathroom and kitchen wastes along with washings are classified
             is as grey water. This can be carried out to the disposal points through open or close
             drains. Its treatment could be carried out through forestry, disposal in filter beds or
             into village ponds. The drains will carry part of the storm water also. The remaining
             water will flow over the pavements discharging into the ponds.

        Black Water

             Water used for flushing of human excreta which has high B.O.D is termed as black
             water.

13.4.1. Sanitary Latrines and Safe Disposal of Human Excreta/Waste Water Disposal

       A.     VIP Latrines

              This consist of a squatting platform over a pit with a hole plug to be placed after
              defecation. In the improved design a ventilating pipe with cowl at the top covered
              with net is provided for preventing fly and odour nuisance. For proper functioning,
              liquid waste as urine and ablution water must not be discharged into the pit and
              sand covering after each defecation be done by pouring handful of sand or ash into
              the pit. Considering the inconvenience for separate entry of liquid waste it is not in
              much use.

             B.   Twin Pit Pour Flush Latrines

                  This is the most versatile design developed by the UNDP Global Technology
                  Mission and is widely adopted by the Government of India under its Total
                  Sanitation Campaign (now Swachha Bharat Mission).

                  It consists of a squatting pan, a trap with water seal. The trap is then connected
                  through a pipe or a cover drain to a small shallow junction chamber. This
                  chamber has properly shaped cunnette dividing the flow into two outlet
                  openings each leading to one leach pit dug into nearby ground. To start with one
                  opening of the shallow chamber is closed while the other opening which has
                  connection to one of the two pits is kept open so that the flushed contents from
                  the squatting pan through shallow junction chamber flows into this pit. This pit
                  is used for almost one and half to two years and gets filled. On filling of this pit
                  its opening in the shallow junction chamber is closed and the other opening
                  leading to second pit is opened such that now the flow of water along with
                  excreta is diverted into the second pit.

             Each pit has the capacity to take waste discharged for about one and a half year so
             that the first pit will be required to be connected again after its closure only after this
             period. By this time i.e. about one and a half to two years most of the pathogens
             present in the human excreta will die off and the mass is converted into sludge. This
             could be conveniently emptied since by this period the excreta get digested and the
             waste water leaches out into the surrounding underground. The digested sludge is
             very good manure and can be used in the fields. Thus the two pits can be used for 3
             years continuously alternatively at one and half to two year’s interval each with one
             getting the flow and the other is emptied and allowed to rest. The principle is that
             small quantity of water used for flushing the toilet leaches easily into the surrounding
             soil thereby leaving the solid alone for digestion. The squatting pan is of special
             design with steep bottom slope of 25 to 28 degree with a trap having 20 mm water
             seal set on a cement concrete floor. The slope of the toilet pan is such that by pouring
             small quantity of water (about 1.5 to 2.0 litre per use) can flush human excreta into
             the pit. Twin pit pour flush water seal latrine is a very satisfactory and hygienic
             system of disposal of human waste and could be located even inside the house yards
             since the water seal prevent odour and insect nuisance.

                 the likely flood water or sub soil water level. Raising the pipe will
                 necessitate raising the latrine floor also.

                 In pits located in water logged or flood prone areas, earth should be filled
                 and well compacted all around the pits in 1000 mm width up to the top. It
                 is not necessary to raise the pit by more than 300 mm above the plinth of
                 the house because if water rises above the plinth, the residents will in any
                 way vacate the houses.

                 In high sub soil water areas, about 300 mm filling all around the pits may
                 be done depending upon the site conditions.

                 In all such conditions the pit bottom should be sealed to stop leaching
                 through it. The pit dimensions be designed taking the long term infiltration
                 capacity of the soil as 20 litre/day/sq. meter of the pit surface area
                 subjected to leaching.

                Pits in Rocky Strata

                 In rocky strata having soil layers in between, leach pits are designed on the
                 same principle as those for low sub soil water level taking the long term
                 infiltration capacity of the soil as 20 litre/sq.meter/day. However in rocks
                 with fissures & Chalk formation, pollution can flow over a long distance,
                 hence these conditions demands careful investigation and adoption of
                 pollution safeguards.

                 Since there will be no infiltration of liquid in totally impervious rocky
                 strata the pits will function as holding tanks. In such a situation pour flush
                 latrine with leaching pit is not a suitable system.

                Pit in Soils with Low Infiltration Capacity (Clayey Soils)

                 Leaching capacity tends to be the limiting factor when the infiltration
                 capacity of soil is low. In these circumstances there are two options;
                 construct a larger pit, or increase the leaching area. Construction of a
                 larger pit is a costly option while the critical leaching area could be
                 increased by back filling and compacting with brick blast, gravel, sand etc.
                 in the required width all around the pit. This will increase the leaching
                 area, since the leaching area is the vertical surface of the excavation of the
                 pit rather than of the external wall of the pit.

                 Pits in black cotton soil are designed on the basis of whether the pit is wet
                 or dry, taking the infiltration rate as 10 litre per sq. meter per day.
                 However a minimum 300 mm vertical fill (envelope all around the pit) of
                 sand, gravel or ballast of small sizes should be provided all around the pit
                 outside the pit lining to separate the soil and the pit lining thereby
                 increasing the infiltration surface area.

                           Latrine Size and Super Structure

                            The overall plan area dimension of the latrine as proposed by UNDP in
                            their design is 750x900 mm, though for convenient sitting the plan area
                            dimension of 800x1000 mm has been found to be more acceptable. The
                            latrine super structure should be such that it could ensure all weather uses
                            as well as privacy. This means provision of proper roofing and doors as
                            per availability of local material and economics in cost of construction.
                            Proper ventilation by providing C.C. Jali work near the roof is necessary
                            to avoid suffocation during defecation. The Rural Latrine Pan (used
                            without cistern) with steep gradient are available in the market. The
                            squatting pan and the trap can be of ceramic, glass fibre, reinforced
                            plastic/HDPE/PVC with inner surface glazed and smoothly finished.
                            Cheap latrine pan with locally made cement concrete, mosaic are also
                            available which are not very smooth and needs intensive cleaning.

                           Site Selection and Pollution Safeguards

                            As the leach pits stores the excreta and flush water, it is necessary to select
                            the site for location of twin pits in such a way that there is no chance to
                            cause sub soil water pollution. Extensive studies carried out during
                            Technology Mission14 in India and other countries have established:

                            (i) That there is no risk of bacterial pollution when the pit is in alluvial
                                 soils with predominance of silt mixed with clay and fine sand, if the pit
                                 bottom is at least 2 m above the maximum sub soil water level
                            (ii) Even under unfavourable conditions such as coarse sand, high water
                                 table and where the soil depth beneath the water table is less than 2m,
                                 the twin leach pit pour flush latrine system can be used with one or
                                 more following modifications as necessary:
                                  Providing all around minimum 500 mm thick envelope of fine sand
                                     of average size of 0.6 mm sieve
                                  Sealing the bottom of the pit by any impermeable material such as
                                     puddle clay or any polythene sheet
                                  Keeping the inlet of the pit at least 1 m above the maximum
                                     ground water level in high water table conditions.

                            Detailed investigation for geological /hydro geological conditions of the
                            site where pits are to be located and the locations of drinking water
                            sources their size etc. are the prerequisite in planning designing and
                            construction of twin pit pour flush latrine as a onsite low cost sanitation
                            system. This is necessary to ensure that the pollution risk to ground water
                            and water distribution mains is minimal. Faulty construction and wrong
                            data/information gathering regarding hydro geological condition may lead
                            to pollution of drinking water sources.

                            To ensure that the risk of polluting ground water and drinking water
                            sources is minimal, following safeguard should be taken, while locating
                            the pits:

                  Drinking water should be obtained from another source or from the
                   same aquifer but at a point beyond the reach of any faecal pollution
                   from the leach pits
                  If the soil is fine (effective size 0.2 mm or less) the pits can be located
                   at a minimum distance of 3.0 m from the drinking water sources,
                   provided the maximum ground water level throughout the year is 2.0
                   m or more below the pit bottom. If the water table is higher i.e. less
                   than 2.0 m below the pit bottom, the safe distance should be increased
                   to 10.0 m
                  If the soil is coarse (effective size is more than 0.2 mm) the same safe
                   distance as specified above can be maintained by providing a 500 mm
                   thick sand envelope of fine sand of 0.2 mm effective size all around
                   the pit and sealing the bottom of the pit with an impervious material
                   such as puddle clay, a plastic sheet, lean cement concrete or cement
                   stabilized soil
                  If the pits are located under a footpath or a road and if a water supply
                   main is within a distance of 3.0 m from the pit, the invert of the pipes
                   or drains connecting the leach pits should be kept below the level of
                   water main or 1.0 m below the ground level. If this is not possible due
                   to site consideration, the joints of the water main should be encased in
                   concrete.

                Limitations of Pour Flush Latrine

                 Out of two systems of onsite disposal of human excreta, twin pit pour
                 flush latrine have been found to be most acceptable because of low cost,
                 simple technology and suitability for adoption in all types of geological
                 and hydro geological conditions. However, some limitations and adverse
                 observations have been reported, which are as below:
                 i) Non availability of space in quite a few households especially of low
                      economic and socially depressed sections of the community
                 ii) Pit emptying is a cultural problem requiring some agency to carry it
                      out on demand and at nominal cost
                 iii) Pit porosity of leached pit on subsequent uses have been reported to
                      get reduced resulting into pits getting filled earlier in further usages
                      well before the design period of one and a half to two year
                 iv) Chances of ground water getting polluted in case of lack of
                      supervision in ensuring the suggested measures under different
                      conditions such as high sub soil water level, floods etc.

                 To ensure open defecation free condition in the village The Total
                 Sanitation Campaign of the Govt. of India has included construction of
                 community latrines for household not having space to build and at market
                 places. Community latrines, if not properly managed could become
                 serious nuisance instead of the solution of the problem. These have to be
                 managed on the pattern of Sulabh Sauchalaya as available in some cities
                 on the basis of “Pay and Use” facility with disposal of waste through
                 septic tank and soak pits or into the city sewer.

13.4.2. E – Toilet

       E –Toilets are widely used in Kerala and are developed by Eram Scientific. The first
       prototype E –toilet was constructed in the year 2010 and by now the number of such
       toilets is more than 400. Some of the important features of the E-toilet are:

            Automated Main Door
            Coin Validator
            Toilet status indicator lights
            Automated floor wash
            Floor wash on request
            Auto and Manual flush
            Platform cleaning
            Inbuilt water tank
            Water Low Indication
            Internal / External Speakers
            Exhaust Fan
            Health Faucet
            LED lights
            Auto shutdown on AC power failure or no water
            Power Backup
            USB Voice Guide Instructions
            WEB Connectivity / Updation
            Self-Checking Capabilities.

       The waste generated in these toilets is taken care of by bio digester developed on
       Defence Research and Development Organisation Technology, Anaerobic STP, by
       connection to existing sewer lines and septic tanks. CPU control valve flushes 4 to 6 litres
       depending on usage time and 5 litres for floor washing after every 5 uses. 1 service
       vehicle for 25 machines and trained personnel for maintenance as per plan are used. E-
       Toilets are available in different models and broadly the dimensions of the cubicle are:
          Length – 2.3 m
          Width – 1.25 m
          Height – 2.8 m
          Overall Area requirement – 32 Sq. Meters.

       These units are widely used as individual house toilets, school toilets and at various
       public places as pay and use facility. The Model IHHL (Sanitation) facilities shall be
       provided as per guidelines suggested in Swachch Bharat Mission (Web site under
       MoDWS).

13.4.3. Bio – Toilets

       Bio toilets are based on bio-digester technology developed by Defence Research
       Development Organization for high altitude military establishments like Siachen. This
       technology has been commercialized by Banka Bio Loo Pvt. Ltd located at Orissa state.
       This consists of four chambers such that the waste water enters into the first chamber
       which has charged bacteria colonies. The process continues in chamber 2 and 3 and clear
       water rich in nutrients is delivered in Chamber number 4 along with sludge formation.
       There is a provision for gases to be let out through vent pipes and the water collected in
Chapter-13                                                                              Page 13-25
                                                              Solid and Liquid Waste Management


       chamber 4 could be disposed off through soak pit or land irrigation. A sketch diagram is
       given below:




                                    Figure 13-8: Bio-Toilet

       This technology is now being used by Indian railways for intercepting the human waste
       from the toilets in train coaches which at present is discharged directly on the railway
       tracks. Based on this technology bio digester tanks are fitted in toilets of the railway
       coaches. Night soil degradation occurs through microbial reaction which converts it into
       bio gas. On the basis of dry waste weight, 90% of the waste is reduced and the gaseous
       effluent is continuously let out to the atmosphere. Liquid effluent from the tank is
       discharged into soak pits without causing any environmental hazard or can also be used
       for irrigation. This technology is being applied on bio-toilets constructed in rural Odisha.

13.4.4. Septic Tanks

       In some villages a few affluent household have constructed septic tanks which are in fact
       a system of primary treatment of raw sewage i.e. human excreta flushed with water prior
       to its final disposal. The liquid wastes from bathrooms and kitchens can also be sent into
       the septic tank without endangering its normal operation, though excessive use of
       detergents flowing into the tanks should be avoided. The effluent from the tank should
       not be discharged into open street drains as it contains pathogenic bacteria, cysts and
       worm eggs since the anaerobic decomposition occurring in the septic tank does not
       provide complete treatment. Septic tanks are the most satisfactory units for disposal of
       excreta from houses, institution, colonies, camps, school and hospitals, where proper
       sewerage system does not exist.

       The Indian Standard IS:2470, Code of Practice for Design and Construction of Septic
       Tank Part-II recommends following parameters-

       (i)    Plan dimension shall be based on surface loading at peak discharge. Length shall
              be 2 to 3 times the width. Surface area is designed on the basis of 0.83 sq. m. for
              flow of 9 lpm

Chapter-13                                                                              Page 13-26
                                                             Solid and Liquid Waste Management


       (ii)     Per capita contribution of dry solid be assumed as 70 grams per day
       (iii)    Detention period should be within 24 to 48 hours on an average daily flow of
                sewage
       (iv)     Load may be taken in terms of fixture units, sanitary appliances taking flow from
                each fixture as 9 lpm
       (v)      Each household having 5 members be considered to have 2 fixtures units each
       (vi)     Peak discharge is worked out on the basis of 60% of fixture units discharging
                simultaneously
       (vii)    Average temperature of the septic tank is assumed as 25 ˚C
       (viii)   Capacity required for sludge digestion on the basis of assumption taken in ii) &
                vii) of the above, is 3.3 cum/100 persons
       (ix)     Capacity required for storage digested sludge on the basis of assumption at ii) is
                7.67 cum for 100 persons per year
       (x)      Minimum depth of septic tank is considered to be 1.0 m
       (xi)     The baffle wall should project 30 cm. above liquid level while the overall free
                board should be 45 cm. above liquid level.

       Prior to putting new septic tank into operation it is necessary to seed the tank with some
       quantity of ripe sludge or cow dung which is fairly in an advance stage of decomposition
       so as to provide bacteria and fungi for rapid fermentation. Turbulence in the tank should
       be avoided as it may cause complete failure of the functioning of septic tank.

                                                                Solid and Liquid Waste Management


13.4.4.1. Soak Pits

         Effluent from the septic tank should be disposed into the soakage pit. A soakage pit is
         of diameter 1-2.5 m and depth of 2–5 m below ground. The walls of the pit are lined
         with brick or stone masonry without mortar. The pit is filled with stone or over burnt
         brick bats as filter media. The pit soil has to be fairly porous so that it can last for about
         5 years. The location of pit should be on downhill side and at least 10 m away from the
         water source. This is necessary since on choking of pours of the soil with passage of
         times or due to over loading of pits, overflowing has been observed. As such the
         construction of soakage pits needs to be discouraged in the thickly populated area
         especially where the ground water is the source of water supply.

13.4.4.2. Septage and Its Disposal

         Septage is the sludge consisting of solids or settled contents of pit latrines and septic
         tanks. It is different from the sludge obtained in the conventional sewage treatment
         plants. Its characteristics varies widely from household to household and are influenced
         by the duration of storage, temperature, intrusion of ground or surface water in tanks /
         pit , performance of tank and tank emptying technology and pattern.

         Septic Tank should be emptied every year or when the tank is ⅓ (one third) full.
         Normally at almost all the places except for bigger towns, these are emptied manually
         and hardly any safety of the environment or of the worker is considered. The septic
         tank are of capacity 1 to 4 m3 in most of the household and taking ⅓ (one third) of
         sludge being retained in the tank the quantity of sludge to be emptied works out as
         @230 litre per m3 per year of tank capacity. The sludge quantity which has to be taken
         out at the time of emptying after one year in a 4 m3 capacity tank works out as 920 litre
         say one meter cube.

         Tank emptying should be done mechanically with vacuum pumps mounted on the
         waste water carrying tankers. Small machines of capacity 200 litre with vacuum pumps
         are available which can go inside the narrow lanes. Large machines of capacity up to
         2000 litres truck mounted are also available; On an average one machine can empty
         three to ten septic tanks per day. As such depending upon the number of tanks and
         taking one year as the emptying interval, the no of machines and their schedule could
         be planned out which should include details such as location of all tanks, procedure for
         emptying, post emptying site control, safety of workers, repair of equipment’s and
         disposal arrangements. The procedure for emptying the septic tank is to lower the tank
         water level below outlet point, breaking of scum and sucking contents through vacuum
         pumps into the tanker. Some sludge around 10 cm thick at the bottom of tank should be
         left.

         The Septage could be disposed of:

            Into the existing sewage treatment plant, where available
            At the plant set up to treat the septage, a separate plant for septage disposal
            By mixing with organic refuse including agricultural waste for composting.

         In villages, composting is the feasible option considering cost of new plant and
         operation & maintenance problems at existing sewage treatment plant nearby.
         Composting is carried out by putting septage along with organic refuse into stacks as
Chapter-13                                                                                  Page 13-29
                                                             Solid and Liquid Waste Management


         windrows which are trapezoidal or triangular stacks of height 1 to 2 meters and width
         at bottom of about 2 to 4.5 meters. Anaerobic and aerobic decomposition takes place
         with moisture content 40 to 60 %, oxygen 5 to 15 % and temperature 55 to 60 0c, in the
         stacks, pH-6 and carbon nitrogen (C.N) ratio 30 to 1. These stacks are overturned after
         one week every time such that the inside material is brought out on stack and the
         outside material gets inside of the stacks. After three to four turnings the wastes turns
         into compost which could be screened and stacked properly. This compost can be used
         as manure in the field for farming.

13.4.5. Small Bore Sewer Systems

       (For black water)




                       Figure 13-9: Schematic diagram of a small bore sewer system

13.4.5.1. Small Bore Sewers System

         Small bore sewer systems are designed to receive only the liquid portion of household
         wastewater for off-site treatment and disposal. Grit, grease and other troublesome solids
         which might cause obstruction in the sewers are separated from the waste flow in
         interceptor tanks installed upstream of every connection to the sewers. The solids which
         accumulate in the tanks are removed periodically for safe disposal at offsite treatment
         plant.
         Advantage: - Collecting only settled wastewater in this manner has four principal
         advantages:

                Reduced water requirements – Since large quantities of water are not needed to
                 carry solids
Chapter-13                                                                             Page 13-30
                                                              Solid and Liquid Waste Management


                Reduced excavation costs - With solids removed, the sewers do not need to be
                 designed for self-cleansing velocity
                Reduced materials costs – Peak flows are lower as interceptor tanks provide
                 some storage which attenuates peak flow
                Reduced treatment requirements – Since primary treatment is performed in the
                 interceptor tanks.

         Disadvantage: - The principal disadvantage of the small bore sewer system are
         following:

                Need for periodic evacuation and disposal of solids from each interceptor tank in
                 the system
                Need for a strong organization for maintenance and for effective control over
                 illegal connections to the system as they may not provide interceptor tank.

13.4.5.2. Components

         Small bore sewer systems consist of: (a) house connections; (b) interceptor tanks; (c)
         sewers and their appurtenances; and (d) sewage treatment plant.

                House connection. Storm water must be excluded in house connection
                Interceptor tank. The interceptor tank is a buried watertight tank with baffled
                 inlet and outlet. The tank should have capacity to store Liquid flow for 12 to 24
                 hours and ample volume for storage of the solids, which are periodically removed
                 through an access port.




                          Figure 13-10: Typical solids interceptor tank

                Sewers. The sewers are small bore plastic pipe (minimum diameter of 100 mm)
                 which is trenched into the ground at a depth sufficient to collect the settled
                 wastewater from most connections by gravity. Sewer alignment may curve to
                 avoid natural or manmade obstacles
Chapter-13                                                                             Page 13-31
                                                                 Solid and Liquid Waste Management


                  Cleanouts and manholes. These are required for inspection and maintenance.
                   Cleanouts are preferable to manholes because they cost less and can be more
                   tightly sealed to eliminate most infiltration and grit




                          Figure 13-11: A typical small bore sewer cleanout

                  Vents. The sewers must be ventilated to maintain free-flowing conditions. For this
                   vents within the household plumbing are sufficient
                  Lift stations. Lift stations are necessary where elevation differences do not permit
                   gravity flow from interceptor tank to sewer. Preferably these should be avoided.

13.4.5.3. Need for Small Bore Sewer System

          i.       The purpose of the sewers is to remove liquid effluents from interceptor tanks that
                   cannot otherwise be disposed of onsite - and so forms a natural link to the most
                   likely application of small bore sewers in developing countries: to upgrade on-site
                   disposal systems such as pour-flush latrines when changes in water use, housing
                   densities or other conditions lead to difficulties in on-site effluent disposal.
         ii.       There are situations when, due to adverse ground conditions such as low soil
                   permeability, shallow rock, on-site systems are technically infeasible. In such
                   circumstances, Small bore sewer systems are suitable in developing countries in
                   the following situations.

                      Pour-flush toilet systems with Sewer: When the effluent from pour-flush
                       toilets and household sullage cannot be disposed of on-site, as soil becomes
                       unable to absorb because of rise in subsoil water level and increased water
                       usages
                      Septic tank systems with Sewer: Improvements in the water supply
                       distribution system resulting into increased waste water flows or from
                       increased housing densities, the septic tank effluent could not be absorbed in
                       soaking pit/ trenches.

                                                               Solid and Liquid Waste Management


13.4.5.4. Design Considerations

             1. Flows
               I.  Considerable care has therefore to be exercised by the design engineer in
                   estimating the design flow, as often the factors are difficult to evaluate
                   precisely since with improvement in water supply and subsequent increase in
                   consumption of water higher waste water flows are observed. Over estimation
                   of the flow usually results in the interceptor tank and small bore sewers being
                   overdesigned and under-estimation results in a system prone to failure
              II.  Small bore sewer system are suitable for installation in low- to middle-income
                   areas on the peripheries of towns in developing countries, where very high
                   rates of urban population growth will probably result in considerable changes
                   in settlement patterns and in provision of water supply service resulting into
                   need for more waste water carrying capacity in small bore sewer system. This
                   could be done at less cost by duplication of this system which with
                   conventional sewer system may not be physically possible.

             2. Design Considerations for Interceptor Tanks
                 The preferred shape of interceptor tank is rectangular with a length to breadth
                   ratio of 2 to 1 or higher, in order to reduce short-circuiting of the raw
                   wastewater across the tank
                 For equal volumes, shallow tanks are preferred to deep tanks, to ensure good
                   removal of settable solids; the liquid depth of the tank should be at least 0.9 m
                   but not more than 2 m
                 To prevent blockages in the small bore sewers, the tank outlet should be
                   smaller than or equal to the diameter of the sewer
                 The baffle should extend 150 mm above the liquid level to rise above the scum
                   layer, and down to approximately 30 to 40% of the liquid depth. A curtain, or
                   hanging, baffle is not recommended on the inlet because scum is able to build
                   up behind it and so plug the inlet
                 The outlet invert should be at a sufficient level below that of the inlet to
                   provide some surge storage and prevent stranding of solids. A drop of 75 mm
                   is recommended
                 A minimum freeboard or space above the liquid level of 300 mm should be
                   provided for scum storage and ventilation
                 The inlet and outlet baffles should be open above the scum layer to provide
                   adequate ventilation
                 An access hole 300 to 600 mm dia. in the roof of tank is common.

             3. Sewer System Layout. Selection of sewer routes must consider the following:
                 Interceptor tank location and elevation
                 Rights-of-ways and easements
                 Vertical and horizontal alignment
                 lift stations if required
                 Future development
                 Site restoration
                 Resident and traffic disruption.

             The location and outlet elevation of the interceptor tanks together with the local
             topography will establish the routes and necessary depths of the sewers in most cases.
Chapter-13                                                                               Page 13-33
                                                               Solid and Liquid Waste Management


             Use of existing rights-of-way and easements should be assessed but if excavation
             costs can be reduced significantly by some other route special easements may be
             necessary.

             4. Peak flow & Hydraulic Formula
                    Until more field data are available it seems prudent to adopt a design flow
                     peak factor of 2
                    Wastewater flows for sewer dia. design should include estimates of
                     groundwater infiltration and surface water inflow ideally, the addition of any
                     such "clear" water should be zero but conservative estimates of clear water
                     inflow would be 20 m3/ha/day for vitrified clay pipes and 10 m3/ha/day for
                     PVC pipes
                    Manning formula given below be used for hydraulic design of sewers:

                                               1       /   /
                                           =       ∗

                V = velocity of flow, m/s
                n = pipe roughness coefficient
                R = hydraulic radius, m
                S = slope of the hydraulic grade line, m/m

                Values of ‘n’ range from 0.011 to 0.015 but for most pipe materials a value of
                0.013 is suitable

                     In order to facilitate cleaning of the sewer, a minimum diameter of 100 mm
                      is recommended in developing countries where the specialized equipment
                      for cleaning smaller pipes is not generally available
                     The design must ensure that an overall fall does exist across the system and
                      that the hydraulic grade line during estimated peak flows does not rise above
                      the outlet invert of any interceptor tank
                     High points where the flow changes from pressure flow to open channel
                      flow and points at the end of long flat sections are critical locations where
                      the maximum elevation must be established above which the sewer pipe
                      cannot rise.

13.4.5.5. Appurtenances

         Cleanouts and manholes provide points of access for cleaning and maintaining the
         sewers. Since hydraulic flushing is sufficient to cleanse the lines of accumulated
         organic solids, cleanouts are recommended in lieu of manholes, except at major
         junctions, because the latter are more costly and are a source of infiltration, inflow and
         grit. Cleanouts should be located at all upstream termini, intersections of sewer lines,
         major changes in direction, high points, and at intervals of 150 to 200 m in long flat
         sections.

         Lift stations are used to overcome adverse elevation conditions either at individual
         service connections or to raise collected wastewater from one drainage basin to another
         basin.

13.4.6. Waste Water Treatment - DEWATS

       DEWATS is the process through which waste water could be treated at comparatively
       less capital and operation maintenance cost by employing treatment system based on
       simple technology, not requiring electrical and mechanical equipment, such that it could
       be operated and maintained by the community having minor basic primary skills.

       DEWATS is based on four treatment systems:

           sedimentation and primary treatment in sedimentation ponds, septic tanks, fully
            mixed digesters or Imhoff tanks
         Secondary anaerobic treatment in baffled reactors (baffled septic tanks) or fixed-bed
            filters
         Secondary and tertiary aerobic/anaerobic treatment in constructed wetlands
            (subsurface flow filters.)
         Secondary and tertiary aerobic/anaerobic treatment in ponds.
       Treatment system components are combined in accordance with the wastewater influent
       and the required effluent quality.

13.4.6.1. Components

         Septic tanks (see para 13.4.4 of this Chapter)

         Fully mixed digesters provide anaerobic treatment of wastewater with higher organic
         load, while serving as a settler in a combined system. In the process, biogas is produced
         as a useful by-product.

         Anaerobic baffled reactors or baffled septic tanks function as multi-chamber septic
         tanks. They increase biological degradation by forcing the wastewater through active
         sludge beneath chamber-separating baffles. All baffled reactors are suitable for all
         kinds of wastewater, they are most appropriate for wastewater with a high percentage
         of non-settle-able suspended solids and narrow COD/BOD ratio.

         Horizontal gravel filters are sub-surface, flow constructed wetlands, which provide
         effective, facultative treatment and filtration, while allowing for appealing landscaping.
         Constructed wetlands are used for wastewater with a low percentage of suspended
         solids and COD concentrations below 500 mg/l.

                                                          and low loaded

13.4.6.3. Space Requirements

          Depending on the total volume and the nature of the wastewater and its temperature,
          the following values may indicate permanent area requirements for setting up a
          treatment plant:
          Septic tank, Imhoff tank:                      0.5m²/m³ daily flow
          Anaerobic baffled reactor, anaerobic filter:   1m²/m³ daily flow
          Horizontal gravel filter:                      30m²/m³ daily flow
          Anaerobic ponds:                               4m²/m³ daily flow
          Facultative aerobic ponds:                     25m²/m³ daily flow

          Land use can be minimized if closed anaerobic systems are applied, as they are usually
          constructed underground. The area for sludge-drying beds may require an additional 0.1
          to 10 m²/m³ daily flow, depending on the wastewater quality and de-sludging intervals.

13.4.6.4. Performance

                Treatment quality depends on the nature of the influent and boundary conditions
                 like temperature
                BOD removal rates are generally within 70 to 90% for anaerobic baffled reactors
                 and anaerobic filters. 70 to 95% for horizontal gravel filter and pond systems
                Assuming a discharge limit of 50mg/l BOD, for discharge in land the anaerobic
                 filter in combination with a septic tank may treat wastewater of 300mg/l BOD
                 without further treatment
                Phosphorus removal in DEWATS is limited – as in most treatment plants.

13.4.6.5. Pathogen Control

                Transmission of worm infections is the greatest risk associated with wastewater
                Worm eggs or helminthes are removed from effluent by sedimentation and
                 accumulate in the bottom sludge
                The long retention times in septic tanks and anaerobic filters of 1 to 3 years
                 provide sufficient protection against helminthes infection
                Frequent sludge removal is discouraged due to increased health risks.

13.4.6.6. Septic Tank

         The septic tank is the most common, small scale and decentralised treatment plant,
         worldwide. It is compact, robust and extremely efficient when compared with the cost
         of constructing it. It is basically a sedimentation tank in which settled sludge is
         stabilised by anaerobic digestion. Dissolved and suspended matter leaves the tank more
         or less untreated requiring further treatment of effect. For details (Refer Figure no. 13-
         9 of this Chapter)

13.4.6.7. Fully Mixed Digester

         The fully mixed anaerobic digester (also called bio-digester) is suitable for rather
         “thick” and homogenous substrate like sludge from aerobic-treatment tanks or liquid
         animal excreta.

         “Thick” viscous substrates of more than 6% total solid content do not need stirring. To
         avoid Scum formation still at the inlet and outlet pipes should be placed at middle
         height. In fixed-dome digesters, the outlet should be made of a vertical shaft with the
         opening starting immediately below the zero line; this will allow some of the scum to
         discharge.




                        Figure 13-12: Fully Mixed Digester (Bio-Digester)

             The main parameter is the hydraulic retention time, which should not be less than 15
             days in a hot climate and not less than 25 days in a moderately warm climate; a HRT
             of more than 60 days is required for highly pathogenic substrate. The gas-storage
             volume depends on daily gas use in relation to daily gas production. The storage

Chapter-13                                                                              Page 13-38
                                                              Solid and Liquid Waste Management


             capacity of gas for household use should exceed 65% of the daily gas production. Gas
             production is directly related to the organic fraction of the substrate which based on
             field experience could be taken as 40 litre biogas per mm kg of fresh cattle dung
             diluted with are litre of water.

13.4.6.8. Anaerobic Baffled Reactor

         The anaerobic baffled reactor is ideal for DEWATS because it is simple to build and
         simple to operate. Hydraulic and organic shock loads have little effect on treatment
         efficiency.




                            Figure 13-13: Anaerobic Baffled Reactor

         The anaerobic baffled reactor consists of at least four chambers in series. And treatment
         efficiency does not increase with more than six chambers.

         Equal distribution of inflow, and extensive contact between new and old substrate are
         important process features. The fresh influent is immediately mixed – and, thereby,
         inoculated – with the active sludge in the reactor, to begin digestion. The wastewater
         flows from bottom to top with the effect that sludge particles settle against the up-
         stream of the liquid, providing intensive contact between resident sludge and newly
         incoming liquid.

         A settling chamber is used to separate the larger solids before the wastewater continues
         to a series of up-flow chambers. Between chambers the water flow is directed to the
         bottom of the next chamber by baffle walls that form a down-shaft,

         The wastewater that enters a tank should be distributed over the floor area as evenly as
         possible. This is facilitated by relatively short compartments (length < 50% to 60% of
         the height)

         The outlet of each chamber (particularly the last one) should be placed slightly below
         the water surface to retain possible scum.

         The anaerobic baffled reactor is suitable for treating all kinds of wastewater its
         efficiency increases with higher organic loading; it is also well-suited for domestic
         wastewater. Treatment performance is in the range of 65% to 90% COD (70% to 95%
         BOD) removal. However, three months are required for maturation.



Chapter-13                                                                              Page 13-39
                                                               Solid and Liquid Waste Management


13.4.6.9. Starting Phase and Maintenance

         Treatment performance depends on the availability of active microbial mass.
         Inoculation with old sludge from septic tanks shortens the start-up phase. In principle, it
         is advantageous to start with only a quarter of the daily flow and with a slightly
         stronger wastewater. The loading rate should increase slowly over three months. This
         provides micro-organisms with enough time to multiply before suspended solids are
         washed out. Starting with the full hydraulic load from the beginning severely delays
         maturation.

13.4.6.10. Calculating Dimensions

             The up-flow should not exceed 1.0m/h. This is the most crucial parameter for
             dimensioning, especially with high hydraulic loading. The organic load should be
             below 3.0kg COD/m³×d. Higher loading rates are only possible at higher
             temperatures and for easily degradable substrate. The HRT of the liquid fraction (i.e.
             above the sludge volume) should not be less than eight hours. Sludge-storage volume
             should be provided for 4l/m³ BOD (4 litre/cube meter) inflow to the settler and
             1.4l/m³ BOD removed in the upstream tanks.

13.4.6.11. Planted Soil Filters

             Horizontal filters comply with DEWATS criteria, as they are simple in principle and
             require almost no maintenance – if well-designed and constructed. Planted horizontal
             gravel filters – also referred to as subsurface flow wetlands (SSF) or root zone
             treatment plants – provide natural treatment for pre-settled waste water of a maximum
             COD content of 500mg/l. They are ideal, therefore, as tertiary treatment for
             wastewater, which has already undergone secondary treatment in units, such as baffled
             reactors, anaerobic filters or biogas digesters. They are also appropriate for treating
             pre-settled grey water directly.

             The rules of safe design are:
               large and shallow filter-bed
               wide inlet zone
               reliable distribution of inflow over the full width of the inlet zone
               round, coarse gravel that is nearly the same size as the filter medium.




                              Figure 13-15: Horizontal Gravel Filter

             In order to utilize the full filter, the front part of the bed must have voids that are
             small enough to retain some of the SS, while being large enough to allow further SS
             removal in later parts of the bed. Round, uniform gravel of 6-12 mm or 8-16 mm is
             best.

             Removing fine soil from gravel by washing is more important than ensuring the exact
             grain size. If the length of the filter-bed is more than 10 m, an intermediate channel
             for redistributing cross-flow should be provided.

             The relation between organism load and oxygen supply reduces with length. It is most
             likely, therefore, that anaerobic conditions prevail in the front part, while aerobic
             conditions reach to a greater depth in the rear part. However, only the upper 5 to 15
             cm can really be considered an aerobic zone.

             Filter clogging normally results in surface flow of wastewater. This is usually not
             desired, although it hardly reduces the treatment efficiency if flow on the surface
             maintains the assumed retention time inside the filter

             Knowledge of the amount of void space within the filter material is essential for
             calculating the retention time and planning the treatment process. The details are
             given below:


Chapter-13                                                                            Page 13-42

                      Sand             0.1 - 4           15%           42%

             For high conductivity, large pore size is more important than total pore volume.

             The filter-bed should not be deeper than the depth to which plant roots can grow (30–
             60 cm), as water will tend to flow faster below the dense cushion of roots. However,
             treatment performance is generally best in the upper 15 cm because of oxygen
             diffusion from the surface. Shallow filters are more effective, therefore, than deeper
             beds of the same volume.

             Uniform distribution of wastewater throughout the filter requires an equally
             distributed supply of water at the inlet and equally distributed reception at the outlet
             side. Trenches filled with rocks 50 to 100 mm in diameter are provided at both ends
             to serve this purpose. A perforated pipe, which is connected to the outlet pipe, lies
             below the strip of rocks that form the collection trench. While the top of the filter is
             kept strictly horizontal to prevent erosion, the bottom slopes down from inlet to outlet
             ideally at 1%.

             The percolation of wastewater into the ground is not desirable so the bottom of the
             filter must be sealed. While solid-clay packing might be sufficient, heavy plastic foils
             are more common.

             Whenever possible, trees should not be planted directly beside the filter; this will
             avoid the structural problems caused by the roots and the unwanted sealing of the
             filter surface by fallen leaves.

             The filter is changed every eight to 15 years. Weaker wastewater, lower loading rates
             and larger gravel size generally increase the lifetime of the system.

             The plants are not normally harvested. Phragmites australis (reeds), found almost
             anywhere, are considered to be ideal because their roots form horizontal rhizomes
             that guarantee a perfect root-zone filter bed. At least two clumps of plants or four
             sprouted rhizomes should be placed per square meter when planting is started.

13.4.6.13. Starting Phase and Maintenance

             Young plant seedlings may not grow on wastewater. So it is advisable to start feeding
             the plant with plenty of fresh water and to let the pollution load grow parallel to plant
             growth. Replacement of the filter media might be necessary when treatment
             efficiency declines. Since there is no treatment during the time that the filter media is
             being replaced, it is advantageous to install several, parallel filter-beds.

             To prevent clogging of the filter with fine soil, storm water should neither be mixed
             with the wastewater before the treatment step, nor should outside storm water be
             allowed to overflow the filter bed.

13.4.6.14. Calculating Dimensions

             As a rule of thumb, 2.5 square meter of filter should be provided per capita for
             domestic wastewater. This would mean a hydraulic loading rate of 30 litre per square
             meter and an organic loading rate of 8 gm BOD per square meter per day.

13.4.7. Sullage Stabilization Ponds

       In this system, the collected grey water is stabilized by natural processes involving algae,
       bacteria and natural oxidation processes. Hot climate is very suitable, solar radiation and
       light is intense for efficient functioning of this system.
       Advantage

       1. The process is a natural process. The GP only provides suitable piece of land where
          ponds are established
       2. Capital cost is very low
       3. O&M cost is also very low & affordable.

       Description
       The system has three or more components:

       a) Anaerobic pond
       b) Facultative pond
       c) Maturation pond one or more.

       These components are usually placed in series. Maturation ponds can be more than one.
       The following description and measurements are applicable only for grey water (not
       black water) i.e. waste water without human excreta.

13.4.7.1. Anaerobic ponds

         The grey water reaching the pond via drain usually has high solid content. In the
         anaerobic pond, these solids settle at the bottom, where these are digested
         anaerobically. Thus, the partially clariﬁed liquid is discharged onwards in to a
         facultative pond for further treatment.

         The solids are expected to settle in this pond, and would be anaerobically digested at
         the bottom of the pond. Hence, this pond should have a depth of 8 – 10 ft. The length
         and width or the diameter of this pond should be such that the volume of pond would
         provide hydraulic retention time of 1- 2 days for the incoming grey water i.e. the water
         remains in the pond for 1-2 days. The pond may have brick lining. If the soil permits,
         the sides and bottom may be compacted to make it less pervious and stable. If the soil is
         very permeable, plastic sheeting topped with soil may be laid at bottom.

13.4.7.2. Facultative pond

         The partially clariﬁed water is led to facultative pond. In this pond oxidation of grey
         water takes place. It is called ‘facultative’ because in this pond in the upper layer
         aerobic conditions are maintained while in the lower layer, anaerobic conditions exist.
         In this pond solids are generally taken care of by three mechanisms.

            Aeration from air through the surface (however this is limited)
            Oxidation due to oxygen liberated through photosynthetic activity of algae growing
             in the pond because of the availability of plant nutrients, from bacterial metabolism
             in water and the incident light energy from sun.
            The pond bacteria utilize the algal oxygen to metabolize the organic solid content of
             grey water.

13.4.7.3. Maturation pond

         The stabilized water from facultative pond is led to a maturation pond. The main
         function of the maturation period is destruction of pathogens. This pond is wholly
         aerobic.

13.4.8. Waste Water Treatment through Duckweed Pond:

       Waste water specially the sewage is treated in special treatment plants involving high
       capital cost and requires high annual expenditure for their operation and maintenance. In
       the treatment plants for sewage the bacteria, fungi and protozoa are used to decompose
       the organic matter present in waste water into simpler, less toxic compounds. This
       decomposition takes place in both aerobic and anaerobic environments. The objective of
       all waste water treatment plants is to decompose the organic matter contained in waste
       water and to destroy any pathogens present, thereby preventing the spread of disease.

       This objective could be achieved specially in small communities where waste water
       generation is in small quantity and does not contain more complex industrial wastes by
       treatment in lagoons( ponds ) covered by Duckweed. The floating mat of Duckweed
       effectively reduces the growth of phytoplankton (algae) and submerged aquatic plants by
       competing for nutrients dissolved in the waste water and creating shade, which also
       prevents the growth of these plants. The floating Duckweed mainly consists of Lemna
       obscure. Since Duckweed is forty percent protein by weight and grows so quickly, it can
       serve as an excellent feed supplement for poultry, livestock, and fish. Thus an integrated
       system can be developed where waste water is treated and also provide income through
       employment to local residents who sell the produce raised on Duckweed.

       Such projects are ongoing in Bangladesh and some countries of Middle East (Palestine,
       Israel) etc. In Bangladesh most communities have their own village ponds where all
       waste water generated in the community is gathered and these ponds are converted into
       Duckweed ponds by properly seeding them with Duckweed .Duckweed harvesting and
       it’s drying for use as chicken or other animal feed is done by the local people. In India at
       Bhubaneswar in Orissa Duckweed ponds are followed by ponds developed for fisheries
       as the effluent from these ponds have adequate food material for healthy growth of fishes
       .Some of the findings about Duckweed are as below:

       1. Duckweed thrives around 30 degree Celsius; in temperatures much higher or lower
          than this the plant will not grow to cover the ponds
       2. Duckweed is to be harvested twice in a week
       3. Average weight of chickens fed by Duckweed is 17 % higher than other chickens and
          has whiter meat
       4. In addition to reducing the biological oxygen demand and Total suspended solids
          levels Duckweed efficiently reduces nitrogen and phosphorus levels in waste water.

       It is said that the operation of Duckweed systems is an art rather than a science, and while
       plants flourish in some locations, it is difficult to grow them in others.

13.4.9. Waste Water Treatment through Forestry

       The Central Soil Salinity Research Institute Karnal carried out detailed study on
       treatment and disposal of waste water through its application on land. At present in most
       of our local bodies it is observed that the waste water carried out of town is being utilized
       for irrigation and growing vegetables and other crops. Irrigation with sewage makes the
       plant more succulent and thus more vulnerable to attacks by insects and pathogens to
       control the farmers use more insecticides and fungicides. These contaminate the
       vegetables thereby exposing people to severe health hazards.

Chapter-13                                                                               Page 13-46
                                                             Solid and Liquid Waste Management


       For safe utilization of sewage following points needs to be given due attention:

       1. No stagnation of sewage to avoid foul smell and mosquito breeding
       2. Sewage should not percolate into ground to avoid ground water pollution and as such
          should evaporate or be consumed by the plants
       3. It should not make the land unproductive by increasing the salinity of land and/ or due
          to accumulation of toxic elements
       4. No vegetation grown on lands with sewage irrigation should be consumed raw by any
          being.

       Considering all these constraints a technology based on growing trees on ridges one
       meter wide and fifty centimetre high and disposing sewage in furrows { shallow
       trenches ) two meters wide, as shown in figure enclosed . The discharge into the trenches
       is so regulated that it is consumed in 12 to 18 hours and there is no standing water left in
       the trenches. It is possible to dispose of five to fifteen centimetre depth of sewage which
       is equal to 0.5 to 1.0 million litters of sewage per day per hectare of land. Forest plants
       use water and nutrients of sewage for their growth. Each tree acts as small Bio-Pump
       absorbing water from the soil and releasing it in the environment through transpiration.
       There is no adverse effect of sewage disposal on land either on account of toxicity or
       deficiency of nutrients or due to salinity. It builds up the soil fertility with respect to
       availability of N (Nitrogen), P (Phosphorus), K (Potassium) and O (Oxygen) and
       micronutrients. lt decreases the soil pH from the highly alkaline to neutral levels .
       Further there is no chance of pathogens entering into human food chain system as forest
       plants produce fuel wood or timber.

       The tree species chosen for this arrangement should be fast growing, can transpire high
       amount of water and are able to withstand high moisture content in the root environment.
       Such species are Eucalyptus, Leucaena and Poplar .Out of these three species Poplar is
       most responsive in utilizing sewage, however in winter it remains dormant and cannot
       Bio-drain the effluent. Depending on the area available and the volume of effluent a
       combination of Poplar and Eucalyptus have been suggested.

13.4.10. Drainage and Grey Water Treatment

13.4.10.1. Design Guidelines and Improvement of Drainage System

             The waste water from the household coming out of kitchen, bath and washing is called
             sullage. It consists of some organic matter ashes and other material used for cleaning
             of kitchen utensils as well as soap and other ingredients used during bathing and
             washing etc. This liquid waste needs to be properly discharged and dispose of
             otherwise it spreads all around the village lanes creating slush over unpaved streets
             and water pools thereby making movement on foot in village lanes difficult and
             becomes breeding places for mosquitoes at stagnating pools. With the supply of more
             quantity of water, more liquid waste is generated and it is common to hear complaints
             usually faced on introduction of pipe water supply in the villages. In villages where
             adequate natural ground slopes are not available the water spreads all around the
             village and as such drains are required to carry this water for collection and proper
             disposal.

             The water coming out of the houses during rains includes water falling in courtyards
             and roofs and is known as storm water. The quantity of storm water coming out of the
             house and flowing in lanes depends upon the intensity of rain fall in the area. Compare
             to sullage water the quantity of storm water is quite large thereby requiring big drains
             to carry it. Considering the village lane width mostly being narrow it may not be
             possible to construct large sized drains. As such in the villages the drains/small bore
             sewers are designed for dry weather flow while the storm water flow is allowed into
             free board capacity of drain and otherwise flows on street pavements.

             The drain should full fill the following conditions:
               It should develop self-cleansing velocity (Minimum 0.60 m/s) with the minimum
                 dry weather flow
               It should have free board of at least 15 cm even during Peak flow/ maximum
                 discharge of the drain. Free board is the depth between the top of drain i.e. ground
                 level at the place and the maximum flow level of waste water into the drain
               It should be such that it can be cleaned easily. Narrow deep drains are difficult to
                 clean as compared to wide drains
               It should be structurally safe and stable
               In case of single drain provided on one edge of the street the cross connecting
                 drain from the other side should have inlet into the main drain at higher level
                 during maximum dry weather flow discharge.

13.4.10.2. Catch Pits

             Catch pits prior to outflow of sullage water from the houses must be provided so as to
             entrap any solids and other gritty material getting into the drains. It consists of a small
             chamber with screen at a top so that the floating material is entrapped at the screen.
             Further the sediments flow along the water gets settled in the kitchen pit chamber
             bottom as the outlet from the chamber bottom is kept around 6-9” above the bottom
             of the chamber there by providing some settling space for the gritty material. Thus the
             catch pit entrap most of the sediment and floating material which if allowed to flow
             onto street drain will deposit in the drain restricting the smooth flow. These catch pits
             should be kept clean by occasionally taking out the sediments deposited in the
             chamber and removing the screens blocking the flow into the chamber. No flow from
Chapter-13                                                                                   Page 13-48
                                                               Solid and Liquid Waste Management


             the house should be allowed without the provision of catch pits before it flows into
             the drains. It has also been observed that if the catch pits are provided inside the
             house, these are kept clean as against those where these are provided outside the
             household premises.

13.4.10.3. Layout of Drains

             Depending upon the topography of the village settlements the layout of the drain has to
             be so planned that the deep drains are avoided. This is possible only if the drains are
             laid mostly at ground slopes. As such detail surveys of village its layout with lane
             width, ground levels and natural gradients (ground slopes) should be carried out. At
             places it may not be possible to provide drains on both sides of the street pavement
             along the houses. As such shallow covered cross drain to collect the waste from house
             or group of houses have to be constructed to collect the waste discharge by the houses
             on the other end of the pavement. The layout of drain has to be so planned that all
             waste water is collected preferably at one lowest level point usually the village pond.
             In some villages it may not be possible and the final out fall of the drains have to be
             connected to more than one point so as to avoid deep drains.

13.4.10.4. Drain Sections

             Depending upon the dry weather flow main width and availability of ground slope
             drains in various sections have been designed and described as below:

                U- Shaped Section: The bottom is of semicircular shape with side walls
                 vertically straight along the length. These drains are provided for small
                 discharges, are quite stable and easy to clean as these are mostly shallow drains
                V- Shaped Section: The drain section has the advantage that it can develop self-
                 cleansing velocity with small discharges and at the same time it can carry large
                 amount of flow during rains. The drain requires more wide area at top which may
                 not be available in village lanes
                Rectangular Section: These types of drains are suitable for large quantities of
                 flow. Cleaning of these drains is difficult. To ensure better flow hydraulic the
                 bottom of the drain is kept as U –shaped
                 For standardized section of drain as shown in Figure 13-18, the permissible
                 slopes and corresponding quantity of flow are given in the table below.
                 Depending upon the requirement the drain section could be altered for which
                 necessary calculation be done.

             These are provided at both the edges of the edges of the pavement all along its length.
             Since small elevation (raising central portion slightly higher) all along its length of
             pavement. Most of the water falling on the pavement drains towards the edges into the
             K&C drains. Along the side edges of the pavement most of the village houses are
             located and the waste water from the houses also discharges into these. In cases where
             ground slopes are steep these drains carry most of the water discharged from the
             houses but at times adequate capacity drains have to be constructed. However to keep
             the pavement dry and to carry the storm water falling on the pavement K&C drains are
             provided all along the street length. In villages where streets are paved provision of
             K&C drains are necessary. These drains are triangular sections. Now a days precast
             kerb sections are available in the market and have replaced the brick masonry
             constructed especially along highways and city pavements where these are provided at
             both the sides along the footpaths. These have small converging capacities but their
             provision is necessary for long life of pavements.

13.4.10.6. Covered/Open Drains

             For proper maintenance and cleaning drains are mostly kept open. At crossings or
             where the lane width is small drains are covered. Covering of drains has the
             advantage that the household cannot be able to throw solids and house sweepings into
             the drain but have the disadvantage that encroachment over the drains occurs and the
             maintenance including cleaning of drains becomes difficult. At some places
             underground PVC pipe laid in the centre of village lane to avoid traffic load are also
             used as drains. In such cases waste should flow through single outlet from the house
             with proper catch pit provided in the house which should be kept clean. Pre cast
             concrete drain with two circular halves of pipe diameter to be joined by placing top
             half over the bottom half have also been used as piped drain laid at the centre of the
             lane.

13.4.10.7. Hydraulic Design of Drain

             Drains in different section are laid at such gradients that self-cleansing velocity at
             minimum dry weather flow is generated in them. The self-cleansing velocity occurs
             during non-peak hours and the flow is minimum, while the flow during peak hours is
             almost 6 to 8 times the non-peak flow. Considering that the waste water from the
             household also carries some suspended solids the self-cleansing velocity during non-
             peak hours could be 0.60 m/sec. which with peak flow could be around 0.90m/sec so
             that any sediments deposited during non-peak hours may get flushed during peak
             hours. The drains laid at very steep gradients may result into velocities up to 1.5- 2
             m/sec. which may erode the invert of the drain. Most of the village panchayat with the
             funds available under the State or Central grant have constructed street pavements
             with rectangular drains without any proper design and layout of the drainage system.
             Most of these drains do not generate sufficient cleansing velocity and are being found

Chapter-13                                                                                                                        Page 13-51
                                                                Solid and Liquid Waste Management


             mostly clogged with only in the top few inch portions of drain water flows down. It is
             suggested that when natural ground slope are not available as per requirement for self-
             cleansing flow then at least the minimum slope of 1:240 for 200 mm dia. / bottom
             width and 1: 315 for drains of diameter / invert width of 250 mm be provided.

13.4.10.8. Treatment of Waste Grey Water

             Layout of drain be so planned that all waste water of the village flows to the lowest
             level where mostly village ponds are available. Preferably one single out fall at a pond
             be provided where some pre-treatment in the shape of grit chamber with screen could
             be constructed. Pumping of waste water into the pond should be avoided and if
             necessary more than one out fall discharging into more number of ponds could be
             provided. The treatment at the out fall for the waste water could be as below:

                Root Zone Treatment System-Community waste can be treated efficiently
                Stabilization Pond – most of our existing village ponds function like stabilization
                 pond and with slight modification their performance could be improved
                Duckweed Ponds – Weeds grown in such ponds are useful food material for
                 ducks and this method is widely practiced in Bangladesh.
                Tree Plantation/ Forestry – Some varieties of trees have the capacity to treat waste
                 water and grow rapidly such trees are eucalyptus, poplar etc.. Forestry based on
                 plantation of such trees with rotational cutting and generation of new trees can be
                 done around the outfall area close to the pond.

             At household level the waste could be disposed of through soak pits. Such soak pits
             have been found to be constructed in quite a few household of some villages. It is
             observed that the design of these pits is not based on the infiltration capacity of soil
             and for proper design percolation test for assessing the infiltration capacity is
             necessary. In areas where the infiltration capacity is low soak trenches have to be
             provided. Details of soak pit and soakage trenches are already given in. In villages
             having dense habitation such household treatment and disposal of waste water is not
             advisable.

13.4.10.9. Root Zone Treatment System

             Pond Systems

             Pond systems are the ideal form of treatment – if the required space is available.
             Anaerobic ponds are deep and highly loaded with organics. Depending on the
             retention time, digestion of sludge only or the complete wastewater is possible.
             Facultative and anaerobic ponds may be charged with strong waste water, however,
             bad odour cannot be avoided reliably with high loading rates. Aerobic ponds are large
             and shallow – they provide oxygen via the pond surface for aerobic treatment.
             Wastewater for treatment in aerobic ponds should have a BOD5 content below
             300mg/l. Pond systems can be combined with certain types of vegetation, creating
             aquatic plant systems with additional benefits. Existing village ponds with some
             modifications could be used for treatment of grey water which has very low BOD
             content as it mainly consists of water from the bath rooms and kitchens besides rain
             water. The modification could be by providing screen and grit removal chambers
             prior to their inlet into the tank. Some of the methods described earlier viz Forestry,

Chapter-13                                                                                Page 13-52
                                                               Solid and Liquid Waste Management


             Duckweed pond and Gravel filters could also be used depending upon the availability
             of land and the drainage system proposed in the village.




             Root Zone System

             The community waste water can be treated and reused by adopting Root Zone
             Treatment System. The mechanisms followed in this system are:

                The functional mechanisms in the soil matrix that are responsible for the
                 mineralization of biodegradable matter are characterized by complex physical,
                 chemical and biological processes, which result from the combined effects of the
                 ﬁlter bed material, wetland plants, micro-organisms and waste water
                The treatment processes are based essentially on the activity of microorganisms
                 present in the soil. Smaller the grain size of the ﬁlter material and consequently
                 larger the internal surface of the ﬁlter bed higher would be the content of
                 microorganisms. Therefore the efﬁciency should be higher with ﬁner bed
                 material. This process however is limited by the hydraulic properties of the ﬁlter
                 bed; ﬁner the bed material, lower the bed hydraulic load and higher the clogging
                 tendency. The optimization of the ﬁlter material in terms o hydraulic load and
                 biodegradation intensity is therefore the most important factor in designing RZTS
                The oxygen for microbial mineralization of organic substances is supplied
                 through the roots of the plants, atmospheric diffusion and in case of intermittent
                 wastewater feeding through suction into the soil by the out ﬂowing wastewater.
                 The roots of the plants intensify the process of biodegradation also by creating an
                 environment in the rhizosphere, which enhances the efﬁciency of microorganisms
                 and reduces the tendency of clogging of the pores of the bed material caused by
                 increases of biomass
                RZTS contain aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic zones. This, together with the effects
                 of the rhizosphere causes the presence of a large number of different strains of
                 micro-organism and consequently a large variety of biochemical pathways are
                 formed. This explains the high efficacy of biodegradation of substances that are
                 difﬁcult to treat

                The ﬁltration by percolation through the bed material is the reason for the very
                 efﬁcient reduction of pathogens, depending on the size of grain of the bed
                 material and thickness of ﬁlter, thus making the treated efﬂuent suitable for reuse.

             The main components of the root zone system are:

                Sedimentation tank for settlement of solids
                Inlet pipe (PVC non pressure pipe to be used)
                Inﬂow collection system
                Space effective root zone treatment module(gravel ﬁltration: horizontal ﬂow or
                 vertical ﬂow as per soil condition and topography)
                Outlet collection system
                Outlet pipe (Non-pressure PVC)
                Polishing pond.

                                            14. Construction Management

14.1. Background

       Construction of Water Supply and Sanitation works is an important and integral part of
       the implementation phase of project. The responsibilities at different level of technical
       personnel for various activities are mentioned in the engineering responsibility matrix
       which is appended as Annexure-2 (Volume-2 ) in this manual, for details refer PIP
       Annexure-27 . Desired supervision and quality control are the main features to achieve
       the objective of water supply and sanitation schemes. These actions are primarily taken by
       site engineer and his superiors.

14.2. General Strategy of Supervision

       The basic job of a site engineer is to ensure:

       1) Compliance with the plans and specifications as per applicable national codes and
          standards
       2) Safety regulations in construction
       3) Environmental and social safeguards.

       The site engineer can be Junior / Assistant Engineer of the State Technical Department /
       Agency or Support Organisation on behalf of Gram Panchayat (GP).

       The site engineer normally acts with limited authority as agent of the owner who may be
       either GP or State Technical Department, thus he reports to the owner or his Project
       Manager (Engineer). Site Engineer uses measuring devices and test equipment, takes
       photographs, keeps a daily log and keeps the record of all maps and drawings. He writes
       reports on the progress of the construction and also keeps records of the work performed
       with the materials used, so that proper payment can be made.

14.3. Requirements of Site Engineer

       The site engineer works under the orders of his superior and is guided by the
       requirements of contract, plans and technical specifications. As he observes the activities
       of the contractor’s daily works, he should have the following technical knowledge and
       skills to achieve results:

       1. Knowledge

             It is essential for the site engineer to have knowledge of the work he is supervising.
             The site engineer’s background and knowledge should include, among others, the
             following:

              Knowledge of all the Technical Specifications, National Building Codes and IS
               standards


Chapter-14                                                                               Page 14-1
                                                                      Construction Management


              Knowledge of applicable engineering terminology and familiarity with the
               construction materials and equipment
              Knowledge regarding the use of all types of Tools and Plants and equipment.

       2. Skills

             Site Engineer should have the following skills:

              Read and interpret engineering drawings and specifications for construction
              Plan and schedule inspections and related activities to accommodate emergencies
               or changing situations and the needs of the owner and the Contractor
              Use computer databases for reporting and record keeping
              Monitor and observe objects to determine compliance with prescribed
               specifications or safety standards
              Communicate well verbally and using written communication and contractor staff
               including labour
              Perform physical tasks that require climbing, stooping, kneeling, crouching and
               has good eye sight
              Ability to work in team.

14.4. The Site Engineer’s Report:

       The site engineer’s report is a proximate record of present events that serves as a future
       reference when these events need to be reviewed. It is often an important document and
       sometimes the only source of clues on how these present events might have contributed to
       malfunctions and failures that have to be investigated. The site engineer’s reports should
       contain all information pertaining to the work being inspected. Any information/item
       should be recorded in sufficient detail to make it fully understandable.

14.5. Construction Management of Work

14.5.1. Civil Works

       The levels at site shall be checked from the source point to service reservoir and
       ascertained that the levels taken are same as mentioned in the drawings proposed during
       planning and preparation of DPR. If any variation is noticed the necessary action shall be
       taken to redesign the pumping main and pump machinery in accordance with the working
       levels now obtained.

       Civil works construction will start once contract procurement process is over and work
       orders are issued. Once the adequacy of source in terms of quantity and quality is assured
       transmission line and reservoir works with procurement of pipe material can be taken
       simultaneously and immediately. As per experience, distribution pipe line works are
       likely to deviate from the original plans due to change in alignment on community
       demand accordingly procurement of distribution pipes can be phased out suitably.

       Ground water recharging works should be taken up after rainy season and be completed
       before the next rainy season or completed to a safe level so that it once withstands the
       impact of the floods. Sanitation work can commence simultaneously such that water
       supply should be available by the time sanitation works are completed and put to use.

       Splicing of reinforcement bars and its bending & cranking shall be as per bar bending
       schedule/ drawing or as detailed or indicated. Laps and welding of reinforcement shall be
       in accordance with IS Specifications. Welding shall be done during day time only.

       The specifications are intended to generally describe the quality of materials and
       workmanship to be used for the finished work. They are not intended to cover minute
       details; it is assumed that only the best quality of materials and workmanship shall be
       used on the proposed work and that the work shall be executed in accordance with the
       best engineering practices and as per the instructions and directions of the engineer who is
       supervising the work.

       The works envisaged in the proposed project shall, unless otherwise stipulated, be carried
       out as per the various Indian Standard Specifications/Code of Practice as may be
       applicable. To ensure the quality of construction works, construction checklists have been
       appended (refer Annexure-04, Volume-2 ).

14.5.2. Construction of Over Head Service Reservoirs (OHSR)

       A. Site Requirement

             The following precautions should be taken before selecting the site for construction of
             OHSRs at the identified / selected site.

             • The selected site should not be in made up soil or loose earth
             • Trial pits have to be dug up to the depth of 1 m below the foundation level to
               assess the nature of soil met
             • If soil met with is loose or black cotton or soft clay the SBC of soil should be got
               tested again from soil mechanics laboratory. If SBC is found to be less, the design
               should be modified suitably.

       B. Procedures to be followed during Construction of OHSR

                Centering and Shuttering/or strutting
                 •   Formwork for concrete shall be rigidly constructed of approved materials
                     and shall be true to shape and dimensions described on working drawings
                 •   Proper check should be made for the verticality of the formwork of columns
                     and side walls with plum-bob during execution
                 •   Apply non staining oil or grease to column moulds, shuttering of beams,
                     side walls and slabs etc., to prevent absorption of water from concrete
                 •   Provide tight joints between shuttering sheets and moulds to prevent
                     leakage of cement slurry
                 •   Steel moulds and shuttering should be used for columns, braces, side walls,
                     floor slabs and roof slabs
                 •   Mango planks should not be used
                 •   Shuttering made out of bamboo with mud plaster on top should not be
                     entertained
                 •   Centering may be removed after two days for sides of slab, beam and
                     columns to aid curing
                 •   The strutting floor slab should be independent without touching the other
                     components of the structure. It should not be supported over the braces

                 •      The struts should be firmly fixed on firm ground
                 •      The level of formwork for braces, floor slab and roof slab provided should
                        be checked for any deviations prior to and during concreting.

            Checking of Reinforcement and Cover
             •   The diameter, type and spacing of reinforcement may be verified with reference
                 to drawings and agreement specifications thoroughly
             •   Proper cover of 5cm, 4 cm, 2.5 cm may be provided for footings, columns,
                 beams and slabs respectively with cement concrete cover blocks (for details see
                 IS: 456)
             •   Stone chips or similar pieces of bricks etc., should not be used for maintaining
                 cover
             •   Concrete spacer blocks or concrete rings of required cover preferably tied with
                 rods, by binding wire should be used to prevent their displacement
             •   Rusted steel reinforcement or reinforcement coated with mud, oil, and grease
                 should not be used
             •   Cut length rods should not be used for main reinforcement to minimize the laps
             •   The reinforcement should be tied properly with binding wire
             •   Stirrup hooks should be cranked inside for proper binding.

            Mixing of Concrete
             •   Only after testing and satisfying to the required quality standards, the
                 aggregate, sand, cement, steel and water may be permitted for use in the work.
             •   Mixer machine should be used for mixing concrete
             •   Bulkage of sand should be checked and the same quantity should be allowed.
             •   Slump cone test should be done for assessing the water cement ratio as
                 mentioned IS: 456
             •   Only machine mixed concrete allowed. For small petty works where necessary
                 hand mixing if done should be on platform and not on ground
             •   Minimum 3 Nos. of concrete cubes (02 nos. are to be tested) of 15 cm x 15 cm
                 x 15 cm must be casted at during concreting for each component of OHSR and
                 tested on 7th day and another on 28th day in the nearby laboratory at site
             •   Vibrator should be used for better compaction.
            Curing of concrete
             •   Exposed surfaces of concrete shall be kept continuously in a damp or wet
                 condition by ponding or by covering with a layer of sacking canvas or similar
                 materials and kept constantly wet for 21 days from the date of placing the
                 concrete. If admixture is used then if can be reduced depending on the
                 admixture
            Admixtures
             •   Sometimes the admixtures are added in concrete to improve the concrete with
                 respect to its strength, hardness, workability, water resisting power

             Depending upon their respective activities in the concrete mix, the admixtures can be
             classified in the following five categories:

             •       Accelerators
             •       Air entraining admixtures
             •       High range of water reducers or super plasticizers
             •       Normal range of water reducers or plasticizers

Chapter-14                                                                               Page 14-4
                                                                       Construction Management


             •    Retarders.

             Some admixtures may have the combined effect of the above individual activities.
             The popularity of various types of admixtures in concrete is increasing rapidly
             because of the following advantages available from their use:

             •    Adjusting the final setting times of concrete
             •    Higher early and ultimate strengths
             •    Higher slump and self-levelling concrete
             •    Increasing durability of concrete
             •    Lesser water-cement ratios
             •    Reducing quantity of cement
             •    Reduction in the permeability of concrete
             •    Time savings in terms of repair and maintenance, etc.
            Precautions to be Taken
             •    After laying of foundation concrete, the disturbed soiled watered and
                  consolidated for at least 10 days
             •    Centering sheets should be smooth enough to get smooth finishing. Finishing
                  should be such that further finishing is not warranted
             •    Before laying concrete for floor slab and roof slab the props should be checked
                  properly to avoid any disturbance in formwork
             •    Polyethylene cover sheets may be spread over the centering sheets of floor slab
                  and roof slab to prevent leakage of cement slurry and for attaining smooth
                  finish
             •    The top level of PCC, ground level, brace, middle brace, floor slab, and roof
                  slab should be checked with tube level during concreting for any disturbance in
                  formwork
             •    Floor slab, stride wall, roof slab diameter should be checked perpendicularly
                  and diagonally, in four direction to obtain uniform size.

14.5.2.1. General Guidelines for all type of Civil works

              Excavation: The excavation shall be of the width and length necessary for the
               construction of foundations or other works below ground. The depth of all
               excavation shall be decided by the engineer-in-charge depending upon the bearing
               capacity and other requirements. Excavation for building work shall generally be
               left open taking all safety measures such as display sign, barricading. The bottom
               shall be cleaned and any loose or disturbed ground shall be well rammed
              Preparation of Ground below Permanent Construction: Plain concrete in
               foundation shall not be placed in direct contact with earth soil of excavation. The
               top of excavation is covered with a ‘blinding’ layer or screed of (1:3:6) or M-10
               concrete not less than 50 mm thick with smooth surface. The required cover of
               concrete under the reinforcement shall be entirely above the blinding layer. A
               sliding layer of bitumen paper or other suitable material to destroy the bond
               between screed and floor concrete shall be provided (IS: 3370).
              Bending of Reinforcement: Bars shall be bent cold. No reinforcement shall be
               bent when in position in the works. Bends shall comply with dimensions given in
               Bending Schedule. Refer to IS:2502 for details
              Fixing Reinforcement: Reinforcement shall be accurately fixed and maintained
               in a position as described in the drawing. Bars crossing each other shall be
               securely wired together at all such points with No. 16 gauge soft iron annealed
               tying wire. Reinforcement projecting from work being concreted or already
               concreted shall not bend out of its correct position for any reason. Refer to
               IS:2502 for details
              Proportions of Concrete: The proportion of cement and aggregate shall be as
               taken in design. Only sufficient water shall be added to cement and aggregate
               during mixing to produce a concrete having sufficient workability to enable it to
               be well consolidated, to be worked into the corners of formwork and around the
               reinforcement, to give the specified surface finish and to have specified strength
               throughout the work. Slump test shall be conducted from time to time to ensure
               the maintenance of desired consistency. Refer to IS:456 for details
              Placing of Concrete: Before proceeding to place the concrete, the formwork shall
               be realigned if necessary and water and rubbish therein shall be removed.
               Immediately prior to the placing of concrete, the formwork shall be well wetted
               except in frosty weather. Each layer of concrete while being placed shall be
               consolidated by mechanical vibration and tamping to form a dense material, free
               from honey combing, free from water and air holes. Concrete shall be placed in a
               single operation to a full thickness of slab, beams etc and shall be placed in
               horizontal layers not exceeding 1 m deep in walls and columns etc., If stopping of
               concrete operation is unavoidable elsewhere, a construction joint shall be made
               where the concrete work is stopped

              Sealing Mortar: The sealing mortar for packing of recesses, seal grooves and
               form holes shall consist of one part of cement and 1 ½ parts of the sand by weight.
               For tie holes and pipe seals, the mortar shall be packed tightly into place.
              Seal around Pipes: Pipes shall not be run through the wall except where
               absolutely necessary. Grooves shall be provided around each pipe where it
               intersects exposed surface, and shall be filled with sealing mortar
              Placing of Concrete Joints: Construction joints shall be vertical and horizontal,
               as required and shall be at right angle to the axis of member. Construction joints
               shall be in a position described on the drawings and where not so described shall
               be in accordance with the following:
                A joint shall be formed horizontally at the top of a foundation 75 mm below
                   the lowest soffit of the beams meeting at the head of a column.
                A joint shall be formed in the rib of a large T- beam and L- beam 25 mm
                   below the soffit of the slab.
                Concrete in the beam shall be placed without a joint.
                Before placing new concrete against the concrete that has already hardened,
                   the face of the old concrete shall be cleaned and roughened and scum and
                   loose aggregate removed. The face shall be thoroughly wetted and coating of
                   neat cement grout applied thereto immediately before placing the new
                   concrete
              Spring of Formwork: Formwork shall be removed by gradual easing. Removal
               of formwork shall proceed only in the presence of competent person. A complete
               record of the dates upon which the concrete is placed in each part of the work and
               the date upon which the formwork is removed there from, shall be maintained.
               Before the bottom forms and posts are removed, the concrete surface should be
               exposed in order to ascertain that the concrete has sufficiently hardened.

             In normal circumstances (generally where temperatures are above 200C.) where
             ordinary cement is used, forms may be removed after expiry of the following periods.

             a) Walls, columns and verticals 24 to 48 hr.
             b) Slabs (props left under) 3 days
             c) Beams soffits (props left under) 7 days
             d) Removal of props to slabs:
                1. Spanning up to 4.5m 7 days
                2. Spanning over 4.5 m 14 days
             e) Arches
                1. Spanning up to 6m 14 days
                2. Spanning over 6 m 21 days

                  Procedure of Removal of Formwork

                  All formwork shall be removed without such shock or vibration as would damage
                  the reinforcement and concrete. Before the soffit and struts are removed the
                  concrete surface shall be exposed where necessary, in order to ascertain that the
                  concrete has sufficiently hardened. Proper precautions shall be taken to allow for
                  the decrease in the rate of hardening that occurs with all cements in the cold
                  weather:

                                                                           Construction Management


              Finishes: Honey combed surfaces shall be made good immediately upon removal
               of formwork and superficial water and air holes shall be filled in. No other finish
               to the concrete shall be given unless it is inspected by the engineer-in-charge
              Water Tightness Test for Hydraulic Structures

                After completion of the hydraulic structure, it is tested for water tightness. If there
                is more than one compartment, initially all of them are filled in simultaneously.
                This ensures uniform settlement all over the area. The filling operations are also
                carried out gradually and full supply level is reached in a period of not less than
                72 hours IS: 3370 (Part-I General requirements) ‘Code of Practice for the
                Concrete Structures for Storage of Liquids’ specifies water tightness test at full
                supply level

              Brick Work

                Bricks which absorb water more than 1/5th of their own weight when dry shall be
                used. Bricks shall be clean well wetted or soaked in fresh water for at least
                twenty-four hours before use on the work and no brickbats or broken bricks shall
                be used except where absolutely necessary to complete the bond. Entire cut bricks
                wherever specified shall be used and shall be of the first quality. (For details refer
                to IS: 2212)

              Preparing Surfaces for Plastering

                Immediately prior to the application of the plaster, the joints of the brickwork
                shall be raked out to a depth of at least 12 mm and the surface cleared and
                thoroughly saturated with water before the plastering is commenced

              Cement Plaster

                Cement plaster shall be of the specified composition cement and sand. Plaster
                shall be laid in a single coat of somewhat more than the required thickness and
                shall be levelled with a flat wooden straight edge and smothered with proper
                trowels to the precise thickness required. The plastering shall be kept thoroughly
                wet for seven days from the date it is done. The entire finished plaster work shall
                be to perfect plumb. For more details, IS:1661 may be referred

                Curing of Plaster

                The plaster shall be thoroughly cured for 15 days. Any cracks, which appear in the
                surface and all portions which sound hollow when tapped or are found to be soft
                or otherwise defective, shall be cut out in rectangular shape and redone.

14.5.2.2. Pipelines

             Pipe Handling

             The proper handling, moving, and storing of pipe materials should assure the integrity
             of the materials regardless of size, type or classification.


Chapter-14                                                                                   Page 14-8
                                                                          Construction Management


             Inspection of Delivered Pipe Materials

             Normally pipes undergo inspection at the factory before being delivered to the job
             site. The engineer must check for the following before accepting the delivery:

             1) Damage on any of the pipe before or during unloading
             2) Randomly pipes be checked physically with magnify callipers
             3) Conformity of all piping materials (e.g., pipes, rings, gaskets and fittings) against
                a tally sheet for quantity and correct sizes and class.

             Loading/Unloading

             The site engineer must see to it that the pipes are not damaged while being loaded or
             unloaded. The following practices are prescribed:

             1. If possible, pipe should be loaded/unloaded using some form of mechanical lifting
                equipment. Whatever the method used, it should prevent abuse and damage to the
                pipe materials
             2. In handling the pipes, no hooks, chains, or similar metal devices should contact
                the pipe at any failure points
             3. Single slings should not be used. Pipes should be lifted with 2 slings (minimum)
                at their third points to avoid bending them and cracking their lining or coating
             4. At the jobsite, pipes should be unloaded as near as possible to where they are to be
                used, so as to avoid excessive handling
             5. Pipes should never be dragged along the ground or road.

       Stacking/Storage

       Generally, pipes, fittings and gasket materials should be stacked and stored in accordance
       with the manufacturer’s recommendations. The Site Engineer must also ensure
       compliance with the following:

       1. All pipes, fittings and gasket material should be kept as clean as possible and be
           protected from any contamination
       2. Pipe stockpiles should be built on a flat base, above the ground to minimize
           contamination. (See Figure 14-1)
       3. The bottom layer should be supported uniformly along the barrel of the pipes to
           prevent bending
       4. Pipes of the same size and classes should be stacked together
       5. When stacking pipes, the bell ends should project beyond the end of the barrel in
           alternate layers
       6. Stacks should be kept within the limits of safety and practicality. Generally, a stack
           should not be more than 1.5 m high
       7. The stacked pipes should be secured against rolling down
       8. PVC pipes should be protected from sunlight. The stockpiles should be covered with
           opaque material in a way that permits adequate air circulation above and around the
           pipe and prevents the excessive accumulation of heat
       9. The interior of the pipes, as well as all end surfaces, should be kept free from dirt and
           foreign matter from the time they are delivered to their actual installation
       10. Coils may be stored stacked one on top of the other, but they should be kept away
           from hot surfaces
Chapter-14                                                                                 Page 14-9
                                                                        Construction Management


       11. Short pipes, fittings, adapters and gaskets should be placed in separate piles
       12. When issuing pipes, fittings, adapters and gaskets, the principle of “first in first out”
           should be followed.

       Stringing

       Pipe stringing means the unloading of pipes along the line of the trench. If pipes are to be
       strung, the Site Engineer must ensure that the proper practices are applied:

       1. Pipes should be laid as near to the trench as safely possible to avoid excess handling
       2. The pipe should be laid on the side opposite the excavated material or equipment, or,
          if trench is not yet opened, opposite where these will be positioned
       3. Pipes should be secured against rolling into the trench and kept safe from traffic and
          heavy equipment
       4. The bell end of the pipe should be placed towards the direction of the work, as during
          the installation the spigot end will enter the bell end of the previously laid section
       5. Lifting equipment should be used to lower larger pipes; for which a webbing sling
          should be attached to the pipe
       6. The pipe ends should be covered to prevent contamination and entry of any object.

       Laying of Pipe Lines

       Depth and width of trench required for laying the pipe lines, hydraulics testing have been
       discussed in Chapter 6 on “Technical Guidelines-Water Supply Components
       (Volume-1)” in this Manual. However for further details refer CPHEO Manual on Water
       Supply and Treatment

14.5.2.3. Tube Well

             Tube well construction should be done as described in IS: 2800 (Part –I) and it should
             be tested as per IS: 2800- Part–II.

             A tube well is to be developed according to the IS: 11189 either by over pumping or
             with compressor as mentioned in Chapter – 6- “Technical Guidelines – Water
             supply Components”.

             For rehabilitation of tube well guiding principle is adopted as per IS: 11632 .

14.5.2.4. Construction of Slow Sand Filters:

             Some of the important considerations that need attention during construction are:

             I. the type of soil and its bearing capacity,
             II. the ground water table and its fluctuation,
             III. the availability and cost of construction material and labour.
             IV. Water tight construction of filter bed should be guaranteed, especially when
                  ground water table is high. This will prevent loss of water through leakage and
                  contamination of filtered water. The top of the filter box should be at least 0.5 m
                  above the ground level in order to keep away flood water, dust, animals and
                  children. The pipe drainage system for collection of filtered water should be
                  carefully laid as it cannot be inspected, cleaned or repaired without complete
                  removal of the filter sand and gravel.

14.5.2.5. Surface Water Treatment Plant:

             It will be constructed as per design and specifications elaborated in the contract
             document and approved by the competent authority. The site Engineer will supervise
             accordingly.

              Refer Chapter – 8 on Water Treatment (Volume-1)-and IS specification for more
             details.

14.5.2.6. Pump Sets Installation:

             1) Installation of Submersible Pumps: It should be procured and installed as per
                Chapter 7 (Volume-I) on “Pumping Stations-Electro-Mechanical Appliances/
                Equipment’s” of this manual.

             Normally the submersible pumps are installed at 1.5 m-2.0 m below the lowest safe
             yield level (water level after drawdown) for continuous operation during summer;
             Hence, it is necessary to install electronic water level indicators to read the water level
Chapter-14                                                                                   Page 14-11
                                                                           Construction Management


             in the bore well ensuring the required minimum sub-mergence (1.5 m) also to avoid
             drawing of the silt/sand from the bottom. It is preferable that the lowest part of the
             pump is at least 3m above bottom of the well. Performance guarantees shall be based
             on laboratory tests corrected for field performance.

             Following precautions to be taken for proper installation of submersible pumps:

             1) Do not pull the pump with the electric cable.
             2) Do not tamper with the important assembly settings carried out at workshop like
                axle play of motor and          pump since these have been done under expert
                supervision with proper tools. In case pump set is required to be disassembled at
                site, it should be carried out by factory-trained mechanic of the manufacturer.

             Commissioning and Start-up

             During the initial start-up pump should be run for 10 minutes with discharge valve
             slightly open because powerful suction might cause the large amount of sand to be
             entangled with the water and damage the pump. Do not keep the pump idle for more
             than 2 weeks. It is ideal to run pump at least five minutes in a week. Always ensure
             that the pump is not running dry.

             Installation of Centrifugal Pumps

             Centrifugal pumps shall be installed for intake well/Clear water pumping stations
             such that the motor assembly is fitted in pump room and the suction point is fitted in
             water at collection level and delivery point to feeder or conveyance main.

             The bottom of suction pipe is fitted with foot valve and strainer.

             Horizontal centrifugal pump is most commonly available pump as it is extensively
             used in water supply schemes. Centrifugal pumps are supplied with electric motor
             fitted on the common base frame. Pump shall be installed as per the instructions of
             manufacturer. Proper installation of pump is of utmost importance for satisfactory and
             trouble free working of the pump.

             Normally pumps are supplied with a matching electrical motor. Pump and motor are
             mounted on a common base frame and coupled by a coupling. This assembly is
             required to be properly secured on a cement concrete foundation and then connected
             with suction and delivery pipeline. (refer IS: 6595: part-2).

             Foundation: Refer Para 7.8 and 7.8.1 of Chapter-7 (Volume-1) of this Manual.

14.5.2.7. Suction and Delivery Lines

             After foundation is completed place the equipment in the order. Suction and delivery
             pipe size should be of bigger size than suction and delivery ports of the pump. Both
             piping must have independent support to avoid the undue strain on the pump nozzle.
             Suction and delivery pipe strain may result in wearing of the ball bearing and bending
             of the pump shaft. Suction line should be correctly laid out. Foot valve is provided in
             proper working condition and dust free. The suction piping should be leak proof to
             facilitate the trouble free priming. On delivery line a non-return valve and gate valve
Chapter-14                                                                               Page 14-12
                                                                        Construction Management


             should be installed to protect the pump from excessive back-pressure. Pressure gauge
             with the valve to be provided before the delivery valve.

14.5.3. Electric Motor

       Electric motor if supplied with pump should be decoupled from the pump and no load test
       and trial be carried out before connecting to pump. Generally pumps and motors are
       tested at the manufacturer place as the facility for such test and trial are available there.
       Direction of motor shall match the direction of rotation of pumps, (as marked on the
       pump casing). Recoupling of motor at no load trial shall be done with proper alignment.
       Motor shall be provided suitable earthing.

14.6. Inspection and Testing

       Inspection and testing of various components of pump sets as well as testing of complete
       pump set after assembly will be done by the engineers deputed. The result achieved
       during testing should tally with the data/specification furnished by the supplier in the
       tender/Agreement.

       The guidelines for the inspection procedure will be as follows:
       i) Manufacturer should submit test certificate on the casting for physical and chemical
            properties for each and every pump set. The inspecting authority on their discretion
            may take samples of raw materials of casting for due verification of the composition
            and ascertain whether the materials supplied conform to the relevant standard
       ii) Dynamic balancing certificate for the impellers and the result should be submitted for
            verification
       iii) Manufacturer should test each and every pump set for hydraulic performance and
            submit the result for verification
       iv) Manufacturer should carry out no load test for each and every motor and full load test
            for every 5 motors and temperature rise for every 20 motors and submit the result for
            verification
       v) The inspection authority will see the performance of motor, type of tests of motors,
            including temperature rise test, torque test, hydraulic performance test and dynamic
            balancing on random samples. Necessary facilities also be provided to inspecting
            authority for checking every individual component of the pump set
       vi) All the pump sets which are approved for delivery by the inspecting authority shall
            bear the inspection marking as stipulated in general forms and conditions of contract.
       vii) The pump test should be done taking into consideration of pipe friction losses using
            orifice plate.

14.7. Testing and Inspection at Manufacturer’s Work site:

       The manufacturer shall conduct all tests required to ensure that the equipment furnished
       shall conform to the requirements of the specifications and in compliance with
       requirements of the applicable codes. The buyer’s (GP) representatives shall be given full
       access to all tests. Prior to pump performance tests, the manufacturer shall inform the
       Buyer allowing adequate time so that if the buyer desires his representatives can witness
       the test. All materials and casting used for the equipment shall be to tested quality. The
       test certificates shall be made available to buyer. The pump casing shall be hydraulically
       tested at 200% of pump rated head or at 150% of shut-off head, whichever is higher. The
       test pressure shall be maintained for at least half an hour. The pump rotating parts shall

        be subjected to static and dynamic balancing tests. All pumps shall be tested at the shop
        for capacity, head efficiency and brake horsepower and cavitations. The tests are to be
        done according to the requirements of the “Hydraulic Institute” of U.S.A., ASME Power
        Test Code PTC-8.2 (latest edition) and Indian Standards as applicable. The pumps
        accessories e.g. the thrust bearing, the motor pump shaft coupling etc. will be subjected to
        tests as per manufacturer’s standard. The combined vibration of pump and motor should
        be restricted to the limits specified by Hydraulic Institute Standard, USA, when the pump
        in operation at any loads singly or in parallel. Tests on motors shall be conducted as per
        electrical specification. The reports and certificates of all the above-mentioned tests to
        ensure satisfactory operation of the system shall be submitted to the buyer before
        dispatch. Cast heat marks to be provided on castings for casing and impeller.

        Accessories

        (a) Switches: A main switch of adequate capacity to disconnect power supply shall be
            provided after the meter. This will enable to disconnect the service immediately in
            case of any emergency or for maintenance purpose.
        (b) Starter: Starter with over load relay is provided to start and stop the motor and to
            protect it against any over load. Over load may be either electrical or mechanical
        (c) Capacitor: Installation of capacitor of suitable rating in the motor circuit will improve
            the power factor and reduce energy consumption. The running cost of the motor will
            also be reduced. The recommended capacitor ratings are shown in Table 14-1 .

        (d) Single phase preventer: In three phase circuit, three fuses are provided (one for each
            phase). If in any one phase were to blow or any one phase is disconnected from
            service during running of the motor, the motor keeps running drawing excess current
            from the two lines and hence causing damage to the motor. If a single phase preventer
            is provided in the circuit, it will sense the operating coil and trips the starter and
            protects the motor from burning.
        (e) Voltmeter and Three Phase Ammeters: These meters will indicate whether system
            voltage is within permissible range for the motor or to know whether motor is

           drawing current equally on all three phases. The functioning of Voltmeter is very
           important, voltage being low in villages damaging the motors.
       (f) Selector Switch: Selector switches of adequate capacity shall be used wherever more
           than one pump is installed. The selector switches will enable to operate any one of the
           pump or both the pumps from a single switchboard.

       Refer Para 7.15 Chapter-7 (Volume-1) of this Manual.


14.8. Solid and Liquid Waste Management

       Sanitation Materials:

       The squatting pan can be of ceramic, glass fiber reinforced plastic (GRP), high density
       polyethylene (HDPE) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), cement mosaic.
       However, the ceramic pans are favored in this project due to their better non-sticking and
       non-staining properties.

       The superstructure of latrine cubical could be brick or stone in mud or in cement mortar.
       The superstructure could be of very low cost if constructed with bamboo matting with
       mud plaster outside and inside with thatched or tiled roof.

       Care to be taken during construction of Latrine and Leaching pit

       During construction, one should check whether the following conditions have been met:

       •     The depth of the pit below the invert level of connecting pipes or drain shall be as
             given in relevant drawings
       •     The minimum distance between the two pits shall be equal to the effective depth
             (depth of the pit below the invert of incoming pipe or drain) of the pits
       •     The pits shall not be located in a depression where water may stagnate over the pits or
             in a drainage line which allows the flow of rain water over the pits
       •     The bottom of the leach pit is left in a natural condition except where it is necessary to
             seal it to prevent pollution
       •     The RCC cover is as per designs
       •     The top of the pit cover is about 50 mm above the natural ground level and the earth
             fill is well compacted all around the cover sloping to avoid a step being formed
       •     The drains is “U” shaped, cross-sectionals and is inner surface is smooth. Drains with
             benching are properly provided in the junction chamber to divert the flow to one of

       m.

14.9. Public Safety

       General

       During preconstruction meetings and in monthly meetings during construction, the job-
       site safety issues should be discussed with all parties involved in the project.

       The discussions should put specific focus on hazards peculiar to the upcoming phase of
       construction, as well as keep the discussants alert to the more general, continuing ones
       that are features of any such constructions. They should address any problems that need
       to be corrected and set reminders on potential health and environmental hazards. In
       addition, the Inspector should routinely check first-aid supplies weekly, and continuously
       check the job site for debris and hazards.

       Construction Safety and Social Safeguard

       The need for safety precautions in any specific project area must be recognized and
       observed before and during construction activities. Following care should be taken:
Chapter-14                                                                                   Page 14-16
                                                                           Construction Management


       1. Any construction will draw on-lookers, especially children. Onlookers should be kept
           away from the operating equipment and from the edges of excavations
       2. Traffic must be diverted and or controlled at all times unless permission has been
           received from the proper authority to completely close a road
       3. When a pipeline trench crosses any road intersection, steel plates should be put in
           place to allow traffic to cross the trench. The Engineer, Contractor, and all workers
           should be alert to situations when these are dislodged from their proper placement
       4. Emergency vehicles must not be delayed
       5. Vehicular access to homes and places of business should be maintained. If this is not
           possible, the occupant should be apprised of the situation by the Contractor or the
           Engineer. It is an absolute necessity that good relations be maintained with the general
           public
       6. When leaving the project at night, no unnecessary obstructions to traffic should be left
           behind, such as earth lumps from the trench excavation or sections of pipe that
           encroach on the roadway
       7. All necessary barricades for the construction close to traffic need to be made
       8. Provision of warning signs 150 meters in advance of any place on the project where
           the operations interfere with the use of the road by crosses or coincides with an
           existing road
       9. Provide a sufficient number of watchmen
       10. The construction area of the project should be properly lightened
       11. Deploy traffic flagmen as needed. In case only alternating one-way traffic control
           needs to be imposed, the contractor shall furnish flagmen to direct traffic through the
           section of road under one-way control.

       Signs, Signals and Barricades

       It should be ensured that signs, signals and barricades are properly used.

       1. Barricade

             This is an intentionally placed obstruction to deter the passage of persons or vehicles.

             a) Types
                 Permanent – A large surface area barrier at the limits of the work area
                 Temporary – Smaller barricade used for work area protection or as portable
                   bases for temporary warning or directional signs.
             b) Placement
                 Should be placed so that there is no gap large enough for a vehicle to pass.
                 Should be facing traffic and must be illuminated or reflectorized at night.
                 Should never be placed in a moving lane of traffic without an advance
                   warning sign.

       2. Delineators

             These are markers which aid the driver in determining the locations and alignment of
             the traffic lane.

       3. High-Level Warning Devices (Flag Standards)


Chapter-14                                                                                 Page 14-17

14.15. Environmental & Social Impact


             a)     Environmental impact may be defined as the sum of the short term and long
                    term effects of any proposed action (of absence of action) on man himself and
                    on physical, biological and socio-economic environment, including the effects
                    of policies. Legislature proposal, programmes, projects and operational
                    practices, attention needs to be paid significant adverse effects on the quality
                    of man’s life including both those that affect him directly and those that affect
                    him indirectly through adverse effects on the environment.
             b)     Several studies both at national and international levels have concluded that
                    most of the diseases are either water borne or water related. Consumption of
                    safe and clean drinking water will help to control all these infectious diseases
                    which are caused by pathogens. Some of the important infectious diseases
                    related to consumption of infected water are fluorosis, typhoid, cholera,
                    dysentery, diarrhoea, and gastro-enteritis. Viral hepatitis and amoebiasis etc.
             c)     It is imperative to mention that there are a numerous invisible savings that are
                    caused as a result of clean and safe environment to be provided by the
                    proposed service of piped water supply. Such savings or benefits cannot be
                    fully quantified in terms of monetary gains, but their impact can be well
                    perceived in form of good health, longevity of life, reduction in cost of
                    hospitalization for fighting diseases and consequently extra working days /
                    years and improved socio-economic conditions. These benefits are not
                    apparently visible but cost heavily on exchequer and national economy.
             d)     As stated earlier, the project needs deliberate and sincere endeavours for
                    prompting health and sanitary environment. Introduction of piped water
                    supply scheme in project area’s Gram Panchayats shall have a significant
                    impact on the aforesaid direct and indirect benefits. It may also be pointed out
                    that this project does not include any such proposal / activity, which at any
                    stage might have adverse effect either on environment or on natural resources
                    in the project area. The project is thus eco-friendly.

             In absence of pipe water supply, the Women used to bring the water from the remote
             places. The implementation of pipe water supply shall facilitate them to save the time.
             This time may be utilized by them in: (i) Look after their children (ii) To explore the
             other income source like farming, animal husbandry, carpet weaving. Hence social
             impact of the project is positive.

                                             15. Operation& Maintenance

15.1. General

       The objective of an efficient operation and maintenance of a Water Supply System is to
       provide safe and clean drinking water in adequate quantity and of desired quality, at
       adequate pressure at convenient location and time and as economically as possible on a
       sustainable basis.

       Operation refers to timely and daily operation of the components of a Water Supply
       System effectively which is a routine function. The term maintenance is defined as the art
       of keeping the structures, plants, machinery and equipment and other facilities in an
       optimum working order. Maintenance includes:

            Preventive maintenance: regular effective follow up of schedules for operations
            Corrective maintenance: Based on problems faced ascertain reasons and take
             corrective measures.

       Efficient and effective operation depends upon sound village water supply strategies
       made up of:
       (a) Water safety plans to ensure good quality water
       (b) Standard operating procedures
       (c) Service improvement plans.

       These simple templates allow villagers to assess the condition of their assets, the true
       costs of operations, their current performance, to identify operational and infrastructure
       remedies and how they propose to finance these.

       The templates can also be used to guide development of training modules for local
       operators, field facilitators, Gram Panchayats, and Block Resource Centre and District
       Water and Sanitation Mission staff.

       Any water supply system, how well engineered it may be, can give satisfactory service to
       the community only when it is properly and effectively maintained. The operation refers
       to the art of handling the system in such a manner that designed quantity and quality of
       water can be produced. The scope of maintenance of water system will vary depending
       upon the particular situation.

       Following consideration need to be undertaken for the effective and efficient O&M
       activities:

            Availability of Detailed Plans, Drawings and O & M Manuals:

             All these sets must be corrected and updated whenever any additions / alterations /
             deletions are done to any of the structures and equipment.

            Schedule of Daily Operations:

Chapter-15                                                                              Page 15-1
|                                                                        Operation & Maintenance

             For each of the activity where operators are employed, a detailed scheme and
             schedule of unit operations should be worked out and a copy of the same should be
             available with each operator. This schedule of unit operators may have to be altered
             to suit changes in raw water quality, hours of availability of power, breakdowns and
             upset conditions etc.

15.2. Operation & Maintenance of Various Components for Water Supply Schemes

15.2.1. Intake Works

       a) Sanitary Survey
          Sanitary surveys at regular intervals at field management levels and inspections at
          supervisory management level should be conducted. The catchment area of the source
          should be located on the maps. Potential sources of pollution observed in the
          catchment should be marked. The type of pollution e.g. industrial / domestic waste
          discharges, wastes of animal origin and agricultural run-offs should be determined.

             The quality of such discharges has to be ascertained and its likely effect on water
             being drawn at source should be mentioned. Reports of such surveys should be
             promptly sent to the Pollution Control Authorities as well as water works authorities
             to promote corrective action. Procedure for monitoring of preventive action taken
             should be laid down and observed. An instant action plan for providing chlorination
             of raw water should be available and brought into effect under such circumstances.

       b) Measurement of Flow
          In case of surface sources such as springs, rivers, canals, etc., there should be a
          permanent arrangement for recording daily flows near the intake works. Appropriate
          records in the form of graphs showing variation of flows in the source for each month
          in a year and for each year shall be maintained. Rain gauge stations should be
          established to record daily rainfall in their service catchments and appropriate rainfall
          records should be built up and compared with discharges / storages available. In cases
          of reservoirs, the regime tables for refilling and emptying of storages should be
          maintained for each year.

       c) Maintenance of Intakes

                It should be ensured that sufficient water level is maintained at headworks in
                 order to ensure withdrawal of required quantity of water into intake works without
                 vortex formations
                All intake strainers should be cleaned at frequent intervals particularly during
                 monsoon to prevent entry of fish or floating matter into intake works
                All damages to structural components of intake works particularly during floods
                 should be promptly repaired
                Sufficient stocks of rubble should be maintained at intake works site for use to
                 temporarily overcome the problems of scours at spillways and other places
                A schedule of painting of steel and other structural parts of the intake works
                 should be prepared and followed scrupulously to avoid damages to the structures
                All raw water holding structures such as intake wells should be desilted during
                 and immediately after monsoon to remove settled silt.

 15.2.3. Clear Water Sump &Reservoir

          Roofing should be periodically checked to ensure that no leakages are there. Ventilator
          outlets should be regularly checked and cleaned to guard against mosquito breeding and
          bird droppings. Cleaning of the sump and reservoir should be done regularly. Level
          recorder should be kept in working order at all times.

 Chapter-15                                                                               Page 15-3
|                                                                       Operation & Maintenance



       The total capacity of clear water reservoirs should be adequate for storage of treated
       water, especially during low supply periods at night when reservoirs become full.
       Instances are reported, where water from the filters have backed up into the inspecting
       galleries, thus reducing the rate of filtration. The remedy lies in having additional clear
       water reservoir in the plant, or arrangement for the final water to be automatically
       pumped to the balancing reservoirs.

15.2.4. Balancing Reservoirs and Elevated Reservoirs

        Important aspects to be considered during maintenance are:
       I. Measurement of inflows and outflows: Whenever measuring devices are provided, it
           should be seen that discharge at inlets and outlets fairly tally. It should be seen that
           water level indicators and recorders are in proper working order
      II. Structural Leakages: All structural damages and leakages should be promptly repaired
     III. Preventing External Pollution: The manhole opening, ventilating shafts and overflow
           pipes should be properly closed and protected from external pollution
     IV. General cleanliness in and around the reservoirs should be maintained and observed.
           A garden around the reservoir structure may be provided
      V. A programme for periodical cleaning of the reservoirs at least once in a year should
           be undertaken. During such cleaning process there should be facility to bye pass the
           supply to distribution system
     VI. Appropriate safety measures to prevent climbing of unauthorized persons should be
           provided. All the railings provided shall be maintained in a safe and firm condition.

15.2.5. Treated Water Quality

       The quality of the water before distribution may be controlled by adjusting the calcium
       carbonate balance in the water to safeguard against corrosion or excessive scale
       formation in pipes. The periodical analysis of the water can also indicate if there is any
       biological growth in the main and if any further chlorination is needed to check it. The
       samples of water collected from several points should be routinely examined for residual
       chlorine and other chemical and bacteriological parameters.

15.2.6. Water Treatment Plants

       The engineer-in-charge responsible for maintenance of water treatment plants should
       have complete knowledge of the working of various components of the treatment system.
       Major problems in the treatment unit arise because of the fluctuation in quality and
       quantity of water, improper functioning of several units and mechanical and electrical
       equipment.

       For proper and sufficient maintenance of treatment plants it is imperative to take timely
       action to avoid unexpected break downs. For effective maintenance the following points
       are to be observed:
       1) Complete set of drawings of the components of treatment plant unit should be readily
           available. These drawings should indicate the location and sizes of all pipes and
           appurtenances
       2) The drawings of important parts of plant should be displayed inside the building of
           plant for ready reference

Chapter-15                                                                               Page 15-4
|                                                                                    Operation & Maintenance

        3) A systematic routine schedule for inspection of various components of the plant and
           equipment installed in it, should be drawn and proper record should be maintained in
           respect of machinery and lubricants used
        4) A log book should be maintained keeping complete record of various units and
           equipment regarding their cleaning, repairs, break-downs of particular component and
           the time taken for its repair
        5) Analysis of water, Jar test records and the quantity of chemicals used should be
           maintained regularly and methodically.

15.2.6.1. Water Treatment Components

             a) Chemical Feeders: Alum tanks should be painted annually. Stock for spares,
                mixing devices should always be available
             b) Flocculation System: The flocculation equipment should be checked up prior to
                monsoon once a year for overhauling and maintenance. The parts moving under
                water shall be dried, loose rust or scale removed and equipment should be
                thoroughly checked up to avoid break down during service, sludge lines should be
                kept free from choke. The traction wheel should be checked for alignment
             c) Sedimentation Tanks: The tanks should be checked up once a year and any minor
                repairs if required should be carried out. The walls and floors of the tanks should
                be thoroughly cleaned to remove algae growth or other loose material and dirt and
                then tank should be disinfected. Algae grown on walls of sedimentation tanks can
                be controlled by coating the wall portion from FSL to a point 0.6 m below with a
                mixture of copper sulphate and lime. The sludge can be removed by opening the
                scour valve provided in the bottom of the tank. Sludge will flush with discharge
                of water with sufficient force. The sludge at the distant corners should be flushed
                towards the drain with the help of 65 mm dia hose streams with a pressure of 3.4
                to 4 kg/cm2
             d) Slow Sand Filter: At start up, filters are filled with water by introducing it from
                the bottom. First, close the outlet valve and charge the filter with clear water from
                the bottom to remove the air bubbles from the filter bed. This method of filling
                should be continued till the water comes above the media at least up to 500 mm.
                This will prevent disturbance of bed that may be caused by turbulence on
                admission of raw water. Now open the inlet valve and start filling up the filter
                from the top up to the supernatant level. Open the outlet valve and waste the
                effluent. Continue wasting at a rate of approximately one quarter of the normal
                filtration rate till the filter gets mature.

             The new filter takes some time to “mature” (to build up the “schmutzdecke”15) a thin
             layer formed on the surface of the filter bed which contains algae, plankton, bacteria
             and other forms of life and the sticky layers round the sand grains). Till maturing, the
             effluent quality is not expected to be satisfactory hence it is to be wasted. For several
             weeks during “schmutzdecke” development the filter should be operated with the
             regulating valve only slightly open or fully closed. Subsequent to maturing the valve
             is gradually opened a little each day; to compensate for the choking of the filter and to
             maintain the required rate of flow. In the early part of the filter run the daily build-up
             will be almost negligible; Calling for little valve adjustment but towards the end of the

             resistance will increase more rapidly, necessitating a more positive opening of the
             valve.

       Cleaning of Filter

       To clean the filter bed, (whenever required, normally once in two or three year) the raw
       water inlet is first closed, allowing the filter to continue to discharge to the clear water
       well as long as possible. Then by opening the waste valve on the effluent outlet pipe, the
       water level in the filter bed is lowered until it is 100 mm or more below the surface. Then
       a 10-20 mm thick sand layer containing the “schmutzdecke” is removed using flat nosed
       shovels.

       After the removal of the scrapping the bed should be smoothed to a level surface and
       restarted with sand topping up. The quicker the filter bed is cleaned the less will be
       disturbance of the bacteria and the shorter the period of re-ripening.

       Filter units should be cleaned one by one. When one unit is cleaned others can be
       operated at higher rate to avoid shortfall of filtered water.

        e) Rapid Gravity Filters: Washing of filters is done using different methods such as
           High Velocity Wash Water System, Surface Wash System, Air Wash System,
           Application and Operation of filters, filter appurtenances such as rate of flow
           controller, such expansion gauges, care of sand in filter beds, chemical treatment etc.
           The rate of flow gauges and loss of head gauges usually get out of order. Necessary
           spares for these gauges should be kept in stock for carrying out minor repairs
           quickly.
       f) Chlorinators: Whenever chlorinator goes out of order it should be repaired
          immediately and commissioned. It is necessary to dismantle gas piping and feeders
          once a year to clean the accumulate impurities to avoid unscheduled breakdown.

Chapter-15                                                                                  Page 15-6

15.2.6.2. Records

             The format of records for the purpose of treatment would depend upon the size and
             type of treatment plant. The record should be kept systematically and regularly.
             Where the plants are large, each operator of the plant should maintain record of his
             own shift of 8 hours, recording hourly the chemical doses and volume of water
             treated etc. This information should be transferred to daily forms.

             The laboratory assistant shall maintain records of laboratory tests indicating the
             volume of each sample, volume of reagent used supported by details of computations
             so that it can be rechecked by the engineer in charge in case of any variation. The
             record of chlorine equipment should indicate the volume of water treated, dosage of
             chlorine, loss of weight of chlorine cylinder (i.e., the actual amount of chlorine
             consumed) residual chlorine determined at specific intervals with column for remarks
             for indicating any particular observation or events.

15.2.7. Distribution System

       Important aspects of operation and maintenance of distribution system are detection and
       prevention of wastage due to leakage. The object is to control the waste within reasonable
       limits.

       The O&M of a water distribution system is directed at the following general objectives:

            To ensure adequate pressure in the system
            To minimize Non Revenue Water (NRW)
            To ensure that the water delivered is potable.

       The distribution system consists of four components, whose O&M requirements are based
       on their unique characteristics as well as their function and contribution to the total
       system. They are:

       1.    Distribution pipelines
       2.    Storage tanks or reservoirs
       3.    Service connections
       4.    Valves and other appurtenances.

       Distribution pipelines must be able to convey quality water reliably and efficiently to the
       consumers and keep it from being contaminated along the way. Properly constructed,
       pipelines can provide years of trouble-free operations. However, sound operation
       practices need to be observed, both to ensure water quality and to prevent the
       deterioration of pipeline efficiency.

15.2.7.1. Sound Operation Practice

             Sound operation practice can be summarized as follows:

             1. Always maintain positive line pressure. Negative pressure could result in
                backflow from private storage and the intrusion of foreign water/matter that may
                pollute or contaminate the system
Chapter-15                                                                              Page 15-7
|                                                                        Operation & Maintenance

             2. Always open and shut off valves gradually. Abruptly opening or shutting off a
                valve can cause sudden surges, changes in water velocity, and reversals of flow
                that might produce water hammer effects that could stir up sediments, making the
                water dirty, and damage valves and weaken the pipe joints
             3. Implement an appropriate flushing program to clear sediments from the system.
                Such a program should institute the regular, periodic flushing of the pipes, as well
                as prescribe the maintenance measures for those sections of the system that are
                more prone to sediment build-up, such as dead-end pipes and low sections. These
                sediment-prone sections should be pre identified and, if needed, provided with
                additional scour and hydrants to facilitate flushing and disinfection.

15.2.7.2. Preparation for Repairs

             Regardless of their construction and the best operational and maintenance practices,
             pipes are subject to the aging process, to accidents, and to other adverse factors
             including force majeure. Since water main breaks need to be repaired with as little
             delay as possible, it is important to have contingency plans in place, and the
             maintenance personnel are trained to work with minimal delay based on the plans.

             The following tasks should be done in advance in order to eliminate delays in getting
             the needed repair work started:

             1. Post the phone numbers of key maintenance personnel conspicuously in the
                pumping station or office
             2. Keep the following items available and ready for use at all times: valve keys, hand
                tools, digging tools, pavement breakers, trench-shoring material, a portable
                centrifugal pump, floodlights, an emergency chlorinator, and calcium hypochlorite
             3. Keep a stock of split-sleeve and mechanical-joint repair fittings in sizes that fit
                critical mains.

15.2.7.3. Locating Water Mains

             The exact location of pipes can be determined by referring to records or as-built plans
             of the water supply system. In cases where records are inadequate or lost,
             underground pipes might be pinpointed by

                 Asking old residents who witnessed their installation;
                 Trial excavation:
                 1. In the vicinity of the reported problem, select a primary reference point that
                     you can use to establish the position of the problem pipeline. An exposed pipe
                     section would be a good primary reference point
                 2. Where there is no exposed pipe section, select any point one side of the road;
                     Identify household having house connection, the owner of the house will
                     inform which side of the road and at which approximate distance the pipe line
                     exists. Then excavate and locate the pipe line
                 3. If a water main is not found at the first point excavated, try again at another
                     point based on gathered information and continue the trial and error process
                     until a water main is located
                 4. Using the water main just located as reference point, select a second point in
                     line with the first 50 to 100 meters from it and make another excavation

Chapter-15                                                                                Page 15-8
|                                                                           Operation & Maintenance

                5. Once a second excavation point reveals the water main, draw an imaginary
                   line connecting the successful excavation points 1 and 2. The connection of
                   the two points is the exact position of the buried pipe
                6. Repeat the above process using the identified points as reference until all
                   pipelines are pinpointed.

15.2.7.4. Cleaning Pipelines

             Water going through the pipelines may sometimes carry sand, sediments, and organic
             and other objectionable matter. When water velocity is low, these tend to get
             deposited and build up inside the pipes. The built-up deposits decrease the carrying
             capacity of the pipes and increase internal friction, making the pipelines less efficient.
             Less water can be delivered per given time, pumping costs increase, and the added
             and uneven pressure within the pipelines increases the likelihood of breaks and leaks.
             These effects are complicated when magnesium and calcium salts are present in the
             water (hard water), as their precipitation results in scaling inside the pipes. Likewise,
             when organic matter is present in the deposits, bacteria proliferate, causing
             undesirable odours, and an of-taste and colour in the delivered water.

             The method for removing solids which are not cemented to the inside surface of pipes
             is to flush with water at high velocity. Annual flushing is generally sufficient to
             maintain the pipelines clean. (But note that different water and pipe materials may
             need a different schedule.) Dead- end pipes should be flushed and disinfected at least
             once a year. Furthermore, whenever mains are opened for repair, they should also be
             flushed and disinfected. The flushing procedure is as follows:

             1. Isolate the water mains to be cleaned by closing the appropriate control valves
             2. Empty the water mains by opening the scour valve or other temporary outlet at the
                lower end of the pipeline. In some cases, to expedite the emptying of water mains
                without pumping, compressed air may be introduced at the highest point of the
                isolated system
             3. Inject water at high-induced velocity (1.0 meter per second or higher) until the
                objectionable materials are expelled
             4. As needed, disinfect the pipelines. After disinfection, flush the pipeline with clean
                water until the chlorine-odour is hardly detectable
             5. Put pipelines back to operation.

15.2.7.5. Repairing Pipe Leaks

             Leaks in water mains should be fixed as soon as they are detected. Once the leak is
             pinpointed, the water in the isolated main must be removed the repair job then
             consists of sealing the leaks and/or replacing the defective pipe section. The different
             methods of fixing leaks are as follows:

             1. Using Epoxy (for Small Leaks)
                a) Dry the surface of the area to be repaired
                b) File the surface to make it rough, and slightly enlarge the crack or hole
                c) Apply the epoxy, forcing some of it into the crack or hole to produce a seal



Chapter-15                                                                                   Page 15-9
|                                                                          Operation & Maintenance

                d) Normally, the epoxy will set in 2 to 4 hours before the pipe can be disinfected
                   and put back into service, However, be sure to check the directions for use of
                   the epoxy as some types may require more or less time.

             2. Using Sleeve Type Coupling /Repair Clamps
                Put a split sleeve/repair clamp around the leak opening.

             3. Using Strips from the Inner Tube (“Interior”) of a Rubber Tire
                In emergency work when no other repair materials are available, cut a discarded
                inner tube of a rubber tire into strips and wind the strong, flexible rubber strips
                tightly around the pipe to cover the leak and its surrounding surfaces.

             4. After the Leak Is Repaired
                a) Open the control valve to allow water to flow into the repaired section
                b) Observe carefully to verify if the leak is completely sealed
                c) After sealing, backfill the excavation and restore the surface to its former
                   condition
                d) Apply the disinfection procedures.

             5. Replacing Damaged Sections of Pipelines
                When the damage in a certain section of a water main is extensive, repair may
                involve cutting off and replacing the damaged section. The procedures for repairs
                are as follows.

                For Galvanized Iron (G.I.) Pipes

                a)   Isolate the defective section by closing appropriate control valves
                b)   Excavate the water main
                c)   Determine the exact location of the leak
                d)   Cut the defective portion of the water main
                e)   If a nipple of appropriate length is not available, prepare a substitute nipple
                     using a short pipe of the same kind, diameter and length as the cut off
                     defective pipe
                f)   Thread the ends of pipe to be joined
                g)   Install G.I. coupling and union parts
                h)   Assemble them
                i)   Open the control valve to allow water to flow into the repaired section
                j)   Observe carefully if the repaired section is not leaking
                k)   If there is no more leak, backfill the excavation and restore the surface to its
                     former condition
                l)   Disinfect the repaired section.

                For Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Pipes

                a) Isolate the defective section by closing the appropriate control valves
                b) Excavate the water main
                c) Pinpoint the leak
                d) Measure and cut the defective portion of the pipeline. The length of the pipe
                   cut should have an equivalent commercially available threaded nipple
                e) Install the PVC socket and adaptor union

Chapter-15                                                                                Page 15-10

                 f) Join the two cut portions of the water main with the nipple in between

                 (In case PVC threaded nipple is not available, use the equivalent G.I. threaded
                 nipple)

                 g) Open the control valve to allow water to flow into the repaired section and
                    observe if it is not leaking
                 h) If there is no more leak, backfill the excavation and restore the surface to its
                    former condition
                 i) Disinfect the repaired section.

|                                                                         Operation & Maintenance


15.2.9. Meters

       Accurate metering is the key to maximize the operational efficiency of water supply
       systems. It ensures accurate billing, helps identify leaks and provides consumption data
       which is vital for future planning. Water authorities all over the world are increasingly
       recognizing the importance of accurate metering for control, management and
       development of water supply. An effective maintenance of meters plays a vital role in the
       maintenance of distribution system. Meters indeed deserve a careful attention. These are
       perhaps the most delicate pieces of equipment and thus are most difficult to maintain.
       Skilled staff fully conversant with the maintenance of meters and necessary workshop is
       required to overhaul, repair and test water meter. A wilful damage to water meters is a
       common phenomenon either due to dishonesty of consumers or due to corrupt practices
       of meter readers. It is necessary to manage effective maintenance of meters otherwise
       revenue will suffer very badly. For first five years the maintenance will be done by the
       supplier/contractor. After that, a maintenance contract may be given.

15.2.10. Reservoir

       1. Operation

             Water for distribution is pumped from the water source to the system’s water tank or
             reservoir, from which it is delivered to the consumers through the pipelines. The
             reservoir is designed, based on the requirements of the system, to distribute the water
             by gravity or by pumping.

       2. Cleaning

             The quality of water coming from the reservoir must be maintained within the
             standards for potable water. To ensure the quality of the water supply, the reservoir
             must be cleaned and disinfected periodically. Failure to apply this routine will result
             in the accumulation of solids and proliferation of bacteria in the tank, making the
             water unsafe for drinking.

             Cleaning is usually done once a year, but it always must be done whenever the water
             in the reservoir contains an appreciable amount of dirt.

       3. Important Safety Precautions

             When cleaning reservoirs workers must work in pairs – one to go down and the other
             to keep watch over the one inside the reservoir. Proper ventilation must be ensured at
             all times during the cleaning or repair operations.

                Checking Sediment Levels
                 a) Reduce the water level down to 15-20 cm above the bottom of the tank;
                 b) Stir up the water
                 c) If the bottom appears to be clean and sediments are either minimal or not
                    present, cleaning is not needed
                 d) When the check confirms that an appreciable amount of sediments has
                    accumulated in the reservoir, cleaning should proceed


Chapter-15                                                                               Page 15-12
|                                                                           Operation & Maintenance

             e) Brush the walls, column, ladders, and other parts of the reservoir to remove
                 adhering dirt particles and algae, if any
             f) Open the drain valve to drain the remaining water to waste. While draining,
                 agitate the water to keep the dirt particles from settling, and sweep the
                 sediments in the water towards the outlet
             g) Disinfect the tank by any of the following methods:
                  Fill the tank with 50-mg/l chlorine solutions and allow the solution to
                     stand for 24 hours before draining it to waste
                  Alternatively, mix bleaching powder and water in a pail or bucket to form
                     a thin paste. Using a brush, apply the thin paste forcefully on the interior
                     surfaces of the reservoir. Allow one hour to pass before rinsing the tank
                     with clean water
             h) Put the tank back into operation after rinsing it with clean water.
       4. General Precautions

             a) Storage facilities tend to attract children who like to play around the facilities,
                climb the ladders, and play on top of concrete roof, oblivious of the serious
                hazards involved. All gates, access hatches and manholes of reservoirs should be
                locked. Never leave a storage facility for even a few minutes without locking all
                access openings
             b) Vandals are known to intentionally damage storage facilities. Utilities should
                keep watch against vandalism to protect the stored water and the public from
                health hazards. If a covered storage facility is found to have been forced open, it
                must be assumed that the water has been contaminated. Therefore the reservoir
                should be drained to waste and disinfected before being refilled with new water.
                All fences should be maintained in good condition. Do not allow any materials to
                be staked out on fences, as these could aid trespassers to climb over
             c) Keep reservoir roof ladders and walk ways free of dirt, debris and grease to
                prevent slipping and contamination
             d) Never enter a closed reservoir alone without someone standing by to help if you
                get in trouble
             e) Keep alert for cracks/leaks in the reservoir and repair these at once
             f) Never store un-chlorinated water in a reservoir for more than 72 hours
             g) The foundations of concrete reservoirs are subject to differential settlement when
                the soil beneath one part of the foundation compresses more than the soil at
                another part. A differential of only 1- 2 cm can cause large stresses in the
                reservoir wall or legs. When differential settlement is discovered, corrective
                measures are urgent. These require the services of a soil engineer.

       5. Detecting and Repairing Leaks in Concrete Reservoirs

             Leaks in concrete reservoirs can be repaired with cement mortar. Concrete reservoirs
             may be elevated or installed at ground level. If the concrete reservoir is elevated, leaks
             can be detected visually. If it is at ground level, leaks can be detected by either of
             these methods:

                Marking the Water Level in the Reservoir – Close the discharge pipe control
                 valve. Fill the tank with water up to a certain level and mark the water level. After
                 one or two days, check the water level. If there is an appreciable decrease in water

|                                                                          Operation & Maintenance

                 level, the tank has leaks. During the entire process, the outlet control valve should
                 be closed
                Checking the Discharge in the under drains – If the tank has under drains observe
                 the discharge in them. An appreciable discharge indicates leaks in the tank.

       6. Maintenance of Reservoir Appurtenances
          a) Monthly Maintenance Tasks
             1. Lubricate float control pulleys.
             2. Inspect float for leaks.
             3. Check level indicator for free operation.
             4. Sweep roof, catwalks and ladder landings.
          b) Manholes
             Manholes should always be covered and locked to keep out foreign materials.

15.2.11. Machinery and Equipment

        A regular schedule of inspection of machinery and equipment their lubrication and
        servicing program must be prepared and circulated and an effective supervisory control
        should be exercised. This schedule should follow the manufacturer’s recommendation
        for operation and maintenance procedure and should be drawn in simple language.
        Proper maintenance of pumping machinery needs a trained and skilled staff and should
        be well conversant with the equipment.

        The spare parts required for routine maintenance shall be procured well in advance to
        avoid unnecessary delay in carrying out repairs and to be supported by the services of a
        nearby good workshop. Beside it the engineer-in-charge of maintenance shall keep
        readily with him the names and addresses of firms dealing in spare parts and other
        essential requirements.

       The most important machine used in water supply scheme is pumps and motors.

15.2.11.1. Pumps

             To keep the record of pumping hours, quality of water pumped and electric
             consumption are to be kept on format (logbook).

             The first page of the log book should contain detailed particulars, make and size of
             various components of the machinery installed along with date of installation with
             test results. These particulars are to be carried over to the subsequent log books so as
             to make the information always readily available.

2)Safety Practices in O&M of Pump

            While carrying out inspection/repair on pumps, main electric supply should be
             switched off and fuse removed. This will prevent unintended/accidental start of
             pump during inspection
            Equipment should be covered with proper shed
            Ensure that coupling guard is in place before starting the pump
            Electric motor and cooling fan should also have safety guard
            All valves, main switch, emergency stop switch should be located at suitable height
             to easy and safe access
            Electric cable should be properly clamped at loose end
Chapter-15                                                                             Page 15-16
|                                                                           Operation & Maintenance


            Lifting of pump and electric motor should be done by using chain pulley block.

          3) Inspection Schedule of the Pump
       a) Day to Day Checking Schedule

                Clean the pump from the outside thoroughly
                Rotate the Pump & Motor by hand 2-3 turns. it should move freely
                Check the oil level of the pump bearing housing. (if the pump is oil lubricated)
                Pump bearing to be greased by turning the grease cup by half turn. Grease cup is
                 mounted on the pump bearing housing. (For grease lubricated pump).

       b) Weekly Schedule

                Clean the pump from outside. Check for any leakage
                Check the foundation bolts, if loose, tighten it
                Check the coupling pin and bush condition, if damaged replace it
                Check pump’s suction and delivery line, flanges, nut & bolts, if loose tighten it
                Check the gland leakages, if leakage is more, tighten the gland follower nut
                 slightly
                Check the pump suction delivery valve gland leakage, if it is more, tighten the
                 gland follower nut
                Check the value operating condition by opening and closing
                Lubricate the pump bearings by turning the grease cup 4 times
                If it is oil lubricated, top-up the oil level

       c) Yearly Schedule

                Decouple the pump
                Check the coupling fitment on the pump shaft if loose, try changing keys and grub
                 bolt still if it is loose replace the coupling halves having correct size bore and key
                 way
                Drain the lubricating oil from the bearing housing with fresh oil and fill fresh oil
                 of proper grade as recommended by pump manufacturer ( For oil lubricated
                 pumps)
                Remove the bearing covers, clean the bearing grease, apply the fresh grease, fit

       d) General Checking

                Check the pump shaft by hand, by turning, lifting up and down; if there is a play,
                 the pump needs to be overhauled
                Check the pump axial play by moving horizontally, if the play is more, pump
                 need to be overhauled
                Pump foundation bolts to be checked, if loose, tighten
                Check the grouting of the frame, if loosened, re grout it with cement concrete
                Pump Gland Packing to be removed and checked, if it is found damaged, pump
                 needs to be overhauled
                Replace joint packing between pump suction & delivery nozzles and lines

15.2.11.2. Maintenance of Electric Motor

             There are following factors detrimental to the life of an electric motor:

             a) Moisture in Electric Motors

                 Presence of moisture is not good for motor insulation. Motors should always be
                 located in dry place. For moist locations drop proof, splash proof or totally
                 enclosed motors should be used else the winding will be damaged. When motors
                 are stored in unsuitable conditions where they can absorb moisture, it is essential
                 to dry them thoroughly before commissioning. If the insulation resistance falls 1.0
                 mega ohm, the motor winding should be dried by any of the methods such as hot
                 air blast, by means of hot stove or oven. Winding temperature should be
                 maintained at about 900C.

             b) Low Voltage Supply

                 Voltage lower than that specified on the name plate of the motor is detrimental to
                 the motor in respect of performance and life expectancy. Low voltage will cause
                 the winding to heat up even at low loads and the current drawn by the motor will
                 be higher.

             c) Dust

                 Dust has been cause for many motor failures. Its action is slow but sure. It is
                 essential that preventive measures are taken to offset the dust accumulation and to
                 blow it out occasionally from winding by a portable electric blower or with such
                 other equipment.

             d) Oil

                 Oil is very harmful to the winding insulation because once the winding is soaked
                 with oil; It is in danger of immediate burn out or breaks down. It is, therefore,
                 essential to ensure that oil doesn’t come in contact with the winding. To remove
                 it, use non-inflammable solvent like carbon tetrachloride, but with caution
                 because the latter has softening effect on the winding insulation.


Chapter-15                                                                                Page 15-18
|                                                                          Operation & Maintenance


             e) Bearings

                 Bearings run well if properly lubricated. Insufficient or excessive supply of
                 lubricants should not be resorted to, both being harmful to bearing life. Again
                 correct grade and type of lubricant should be used.

             f) Misalignment

                 Motor damages such as shaft being springing or broken, bearing getting worn-out
                 or over load failure are often caused by misalignment. This defect can be in the
                 motor or in pump and it should be carefully located and removed.

             g) Vibrations

                 Misalignment is one of the important causes of vibrations. In order to locate the
                 source of vibration disconnect the vibrating motor. If the motor operates far more
                 smoothly when disconnected and if its alignment is found to be proper, the pump
                 should be examined for the source of vibrations.

             h) Overload

                 To protect the motor from danger due to over load, various devices are
                 incorporated in the starting mechanism of electric motors:
                 (i) Electric motors are required to be protected against the hazards of current
                      fluctuation and overloading etc. during the operation by the use of certain
                      devices which break the electric circuit when fluctuation is more than the
                      predetermined value. The simplest device is the fuse to prevent excessive
                      current to the motor, but the surges of power are not destroyed by the fuses or
                      sometimes only one fuse blows off
                 (ii) Relays and circuit Breakers: The relays are used as automatic devices for
                      breaking the circuit under fixed conditions. These devices are widely
                      applicable and accurate. These are reliable in action and can be adjusted with
                      precision to control the time of opening or closing of a switch. The circuit
                      breakers are higher in initial cost but are preferable on circuits subject to
                      frequent over loads. Standard relay can be adjusted for any current range and
                      provides an instantaneous trip. Immediate repeat operation is possible. This
                      works as single phase preventer also. Whenever an overload device operates,
                      it has to be at rest before motor can restart. There setting may be automatic or
                      manual. Whenever an over load device operates, the cause should be taken as
                      warning. It may be due to low voltage, overload, Jammed or hard bearing,
                      Single phasing etc.


15.2.11.3. Burn-out of New Motors

             At times, brand new motors fail on the first switching or shortly after commissioning.
             Main reasons of this failure are:

             (i) Occurrence of single phasing in the supply system
             (ii) Accumulation of water inside the motor.

Chapter-15                                                                                 Page 15-19
|                                                                           Operation & Maintenance

             It has been found in experiences that under certain circumstances, totally enclosed
             motors are highly susceptible to damage by the atmospheric moisture. Whenever
             totally enclosed motors have been standing idle for more than two or three weeks in an
             unheated building it will be a good practice to examine before putting them in
             operation. If the slightest trace of water is found inside the enclosure or if there be an
             indication like rust on the steel shaft or iron parts inside the machine, the safest rule
             would be to presume that the winding has absorbed moisture and to dry them before
             setting it to works.

15.2.11.6. Records

             For each piece of equipment and machinery a record register should be maintained in
             which all records of the equipment such as servicing, lubricating, replacement of parts,
             operating hours (including cumulative) and other important data is entered.

15.2.12.     Measures of Water Quality Control in field

             (A)       Using Field Water Testing Kit (FTK)

                       The field water testing kit is a simple device, which can be used for testing
                       some critical water quality parameters in the field as it gives first-hand
                       information on the quality of water. Whenever100% accuracy is needed then
                       laboratory test shall be carried out. This water testing kit can be used for
                       regular Water Quality Monitoring Programs to be conducted at Village level.
                       Panchayat level functionaries, NGOs and students of even 7th and 8th
                       standards can easily do the experiments using this kit. The details of water

|                                                                       Operation & Maintenance

                   sources and the quality of water in many villages can be collected and the data
                   computerized at Panchayat level. The data will be much useful in planning
                   and formulating various water supply schemes and will be useful for proper
                   maintenance of rural water supply schemes. The kits can be used in schools to
                   promote the knowledge on water quality and help to develop a good practice
                   and scientific culture among the students.

             (B)   Water Testing Methodology

                   For testing water in the field, the following aspects have to be clearly
                   understood:

                      Sampling procedures
                      Testing procedures
                      Reporting Procedure ( Refer para 3.9.1 & 3.9.2 of Chapter-3 )
                      Before sampling, the container should be flushed adequately
                      For lakes, rivers and dams, the water should be collected near the off take
                       point
                      The water should be collected after clearing the suspended and floating
                       matter
                      Water for chemical examination should be collected in a clean white 250
                       ml capacity leak proof polythene container
                      Before collection of sample the container should be washed, rinsed with
                       the water to be sampled for at least two to three times
                      The water should be then filled completely in the container without
                       leaving any air space
                      Place a polythene sheet (10x10cm) over the cap and tie it with a rubber
                       band or twine thread to avoid any leak
                      Write the field code number (sample ID) on the container. The field code
                       number and related source details should be separately recorded in a note
                       book
                      The testing of sample should be completed within 12 hours from the time
                       of collection.

             (C)   Water Testing Procedure
                    Physical Parameters
                     Pour 10-20 ml. of water into the 100 ml polypropylene/ titration cup.
                     By observing the water in the cup, record qualitatively the appearance,
                     odour and turbidity.

                Chemical Parameters
                 (i) Using the pH paper, record the pH value also.
                      - pH booklets have been provided to measure pH value of water.
                          Tear a portion of the PH paper and hold it by your fingers. Using
                          the ink filler add one drop of water sample on the paper. Wait for
                          10 seconds. The colour change taking place on the wet portion of
                          the pH paper is observed and compared with the pH chart provided
                          in the cover page of pH booklet. Record the pH value
                 (ii) Alkalinity: Using the measuring cylinder, measure 20 ml of water
                        sample and pour it into the clean titration cup. Add 5 drops of
                        'A1liquid. The water turns bluish green. Using the '1 mL syringe'
                        provided in the kit, add 'A2' liquid. At the end point, the colour of
                        water changes into yellow or Orange. Record the number of
                        divisions for which the 'A2' liquid has been consumed to reach the
                        end point. Calculation: Alkalinity mg/L = No. of Divisions of 'A2'
                        added x 10
                 (iii) Hardness: Using the measuring cylinder, measure 20 ml of water
                        sample and pour it into the clean titration cup. Add 5 drops of 'H l'
                        and then 5 drops of 'H2' liquids. The water in the titration cup turns
                        Pink in colour. Using the '1 mL syringe' add 'H3' liquid in drops. At
                        the end point, the colour of water changes into Bluish colour. Record
                        the number of divisions for which 'H3' liquid has been consumed to
                        reach the end point
                 (iv) Chloride: Using the measuring cylinder, measure 20 ml of water
                        sample and pour it into the clean titration cup. Add 5 drops of 'C1'

                        changes to slight reddish in colour. Record the number of divisions
                        for which 'C2' liquid has been consumed to reach the end point.
                        Calculation: Chloride mg/L = No. of Divisions of 'C2' liquid x 10
                 (v) Total Dissolved Solids (TDS):The approximate value of TDS can be
                        arrived at by the following Calculation: TDS mg/L = (Alkalinity +
                        Hardness + Chloride) x 1.2
                 (vi) Fluoride: In the 1.5 ml polypropylene tube, add 1.0 mL sample
                        water. Add 5 drops of 'Fl' liquid. Mix. Gently. Compare the colour
                        with "fluoride chart" provided and record the fluoride value

             (1)   First Aid Boxes: These are simple boxes for use by the staff in case of an
                   emergency. This contains wound and burn dressing. Disinfectants like iodine is
                   provide for small cuts with cotton for application of disinfectant. It is useful to
                   have two scissors available in the first aid box for getting out splinters. In case
                   of a wound, it should be thoroughly washed under clean running tap water and
                   after that the disinfectant should be applied. In case of all major injuries and
                   something affecting the eye, immediate medical help should be obtained. The
                   patient should be immediately taken to hospital in case of fracture of bones and
                   unconsciousness etc
             (2)   Miscellaneous Items: Certain miscellaneous items like lamps with a stock of
                   kerosene oil, cleaning rags, brooms, soap, detergent powder, three cell torch,
                   emergency light, paint, paint-brushes, gardening tools and grass cutters are also
                   required for carrying out maintenance job properly and effectively. Where bulk
                   meters are used, daily and weekly charts and ink should be kept in stock for
                   ready replacement. Other items usually required are red hurricane lamps for
                   warning traffic of an open trench, torches, valve keys, portable stand pipe and a
                   lockable hand cart for carrying these articles from one site to another
             (3)   General Cleanliness: Above all general cleanliness of plant is of vital
                   importance. The equipment and the buildings where equipment is installed
                   should be kept in neat and tidy conditions. This indeed speaks of the

                    responsibility and the interest of maintenance personnel in the discharge of their
                    duties. It can be safely said that if external cleanliness is neglected the internal
                    maintenance and up-keep of the equipment which is not seen is neglected still
                    more
             (4)    Health and welfare of water works maintenance personnel: It is very necessary
                    that the persons engaged in the operation and maintenance of water works, who
                    come into contact with water supply works, who perfectly free from
                    communicable diseases. Most of maintenance personnel come in direct contact
                    with water such as labourer cleaning the filter boxes, cleaning tanks and wells,
                    pipe fitters making repairs to the pipe line. So no labourer suffering from any
                    disease should ever be employed on such maintenance jobs. It is important to
                    get the water works maintenance personnel medically examined periodically
             (5)    The water works area should be properly fenced and entry should be restricted.
                    Water works site should not be allowed to be a thoroughfare otherwise people
                    will use tanks for bathing, washing of clothes etc. and start dumping refuse in
                    the water works area.

             Nearby the pump house facility of water tap and water closet should also be made
             available; otherwise the operating staff will get water for drinking and cleaning food
             containers by dipping their utensils in the water tank itself. In the absence of water
             closet, the staff will spoil the surroundings by indiscriminate urination. All these
             things take place if proper attention is not paid to provide necessary facilities to the
             operating staff.

15.2.14.     Chlorine Safety

             As generally chlorine is used for disinfection of water, health hazard may occur by
             careless handling.

15.2.14.1. Hazard of Chlorine

             In both its liquid and gaseous form, chlorine is classified as a poisonous or toxic
             substance. When it gets into contact with moist body surfaces such as the eyes, nose,
             throat, lungs, and wet skin it reacts with the moisture, forming harmful acids that can
             cause severe damage to these organs and even be fatal.

             1. Human Health; Repeated exposure to chlorine does not produce an immunity or
                tolerance. Long-term exposure even to low concentrations of chlorine may cause a
                gradual decrease in lung efficiency. A single exposure to a high concentration can
                cause permanent lung damage.

                   Following Table 15.716 presents the Toxic effects of the chlorine at different
                   levels of concentration

    1-3 mg/l      May cause mild irrigation of the eye, nose and throat
    3-5 mg/l      Burning in eyes, nose and throat; may cause headache, watering eyes,
                  sneezing, coughing, breathing difficulty, bloody nose and blood-tinged

             2. Fire and Chemical Reactions:
                 Chlorine will not burn by itself, but will support combustion when it comes
                    into contact with many combustible materials, including acetylene, kerosene,
                    most hydrocarbons like solvents, greases and oils, finely divided metals and
                    organic matter, and materials containing potassium and phosphorous. It can
                    explode when it reacts with high concentrations of ammonia or hydrogen
                    peroxide
                    Never store acetylene, solvents, and the other materials enumerated above in
                    the same building or area as chlorine.
                 In both gas and liquid forms, chlorine reacts with almost all chemicals, usually
                    releasing heat. At high temperatures, chlorine reacts vigorously with most
                    metals. For instance, a chlorine reaction can cause stainless steel to catch fire
                    or melt
                 Reaction to Water
                    Chlorine reacts with water or moisture in the air to form highly corrosive
                    acids. Every precaution must be taken to keep chlorine and chlorine equipment
                    moisture-free.

                     Never use water on a chlorine leak. Most chlorine is more corrosive than dry
                     chlorine and leak will worsen rapidly if water is applied to it.

|                                                                          Operation & Maintenance


             1. General

                Any water utility that uses chlorine should have written procedures for its chlorine
                system operation. Even the use of powdered chlorine should have written
                procedures. Before starting any chlorination process, take the following
                precautions:

                (i) If a faucet with good flowing water is not available close by, make ready a 20
                     lit container of fresh water, but make sure it is away from the chlorine cylinder
                     or storage area. This is to ensure that if the chlorine accidentally comes in
                     contact with your eyes or skin, you can flush the affected areas with copious
                     amounts of fresh water for at least 10-15 minutes
                (ii) Flush the chlorine out. Do not just soak the affected surface. If you get some
                     of the chlorine solution in your eyes, flush it out and immediately see your
                     doctor
                (iii)Wear the prescribed safety clothing and equipment, specifically:
                     - Goggles to protect your eyes from contact with the chlorine in any form.
                     - Rubber gloves and rubber boots certified for use around the chemical to
                          protect your hands and feet.
                     - Waterproof suit, coveralls or a full-length apron.

             2. Housekeeping/Chlorine Storage

                a) Use signs to clearly identify all areas where chlorine is used or stored. Only
                   qualified personnel should be permitted to enter these areas.

                b) Do not store materials that may react violently with chlorine in the same room
                   as chlorine. Put up visible warning signs prohibiting persons from taking these
                   materials where the chlorine is stored.

                c) Do not store chlorine near busy roadways or where vehicles operate. Chlorine
                   reacts with carbon monoxide to produce phosgene, an extremely poisonous
                   gas.

                d) Store chlorine cylinders and containers in a cool, dry, and relatively isolated
                   area, protected from weather and extreme temperatures.

                   •      When storing cylinders and containers outside, shield them from direct
                          sunlight.

                   •      When storing chlorine containers inside, store the containers in a well-
                          ventilated building, away from any heat sources.

                e) Use cylinders and containers on a “FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT” basis.

                f) Clearly tag or mark empty cylinders and separate them from full cylinders.

                g) Determine the most appropriate location for emergency equipment.
                   Emergency equipment and a faucet should be available in a readily accessible
                   location, but not inside the chlorine room because a worker (and emergency

Chapter-15                                                                                 Page 15-29
|                                                                        Operation & Maintenance

                    response staff) trying to use the emergency equipment or faucet during a
                    chlorine leak risks further exposure.

                h) Store cylinders upright and secure them against tipping over and rough
                   handling. Cylinders will discharge vapor when upright and discharge liquid
                   when upside-down. Since chlorine gas tends to sink, provision should be made
                   for low-placed ventilation near the floor that allows it to dissipate outward, as
                   well as high-placed ventilation that allows the chlorine mist (the gas mixed
                   with air) which tends to go upward, also to dissipate.

             3. Handling Chlorine Cylinders

                a) Handle containers with care while moving or storing them. Do not drop or
                   allow containers to strike objects

                b) Use new gaskets as recommended by the chlorine supplier each time a
                   cylinder or container is connected

                c) Follow the chlorine supplier’s recommended disposal procedures for leaking
                   containers. Do not modify, alter, or repair containers and valves. Only the
                   supplier should carry out these tasks

                d) Ensure that cylinders have valve protection hoods in place when not connected
                   to a system

                e) Do not lift a cylinder by its valve protection hood. The hood is not designed to
                   carry the weight of a cylinder

                f) If possible, open valves by applying a steady force to a 200 mm (8 inches)
                   wrench, without applying an impact force and without using an extension on
                   the wrench. If this does not work, apply a light impact force by smacking the
                   wrench with the heel of your hand

                g) Do not use a wrench longer than 200 mm (8 inches) to open or close valves.
                   To prevent valve damage that could cause leaks do not use tools such as pipe
                   wrenches or hammers. Valves on cylinders are designed to deliver full volume
                   after one complete counter clockwise turn. Valves may be damaged if turned
                   beyond this point. Immediately return containers with damaged or inoperable
                   (but not leaking) valves to the supplier

                h) If the valve is very difficult to open, loosen the packing nut slightly. Tighten
                   the packing nut after the valve is opened or closed.

15.2.14.3. Leak Detection (Chlorine) and Control

             It is important to follow the right procedures in replacing an empty cylinder with a
             new one. Nonetheless, after the new cylinder has been installed, it is essential to
             ensure that there is no leak in the new hook up.



Chapter-15                                                                               Page 15-30
|                                                                         Operation & Maintenance


             1. Detecting Leaks

                Chlorine leaks can be determined by soaking a rag on the end of a stick in aqua
                ammonia (ammonium hydroxide, not pure ammonia) and holding it next to the
                pipes, cylinder or dosing equipment. (A plastic squeeze bottle containing the aqua
                ammonia can also be used.) A white cloud will show the location of the leak. This
                test is safe because ammonium hydroxide (ammonia dissolved in water or moist
                air) is used rather than pure ammonia. Chlorine reacts readily with ammonium
                hydroxide to form ammonium chloride, a relatively harmless compound. This
                reaction forms a visible white cloud, indicating a chlorine leak. The ammonia test
                is useful for pinpointing the exact location of a leak.

             2. What to Do If a Leak Is Indicated After Installing a New Cylinder

                a) Wear a respirator and immediately close the main cylinder valve

                b) As long as the monitor reads less than 10 mg/l, the cylinder hook-up procedure
                   may be repeated

                c) Open (and close) the main cylinder valve and repeat the ammonia test

                d) If a leak is still indicated, make a third and final attempt to get a good seal
                   using a new lead washer

                e) If the leak cannot be corrected after three attempts, remove the cylinder from
                   service and contact the supplier. Ensure that there is no leak from this cylinder
                   with the main valve closed. A different cylinder must be connected to the
                   chlorination system

                f) Leave the chlorine room and remain nearby to restrict access to the room or
                   provide other assistance, as directed.

15.2.14.4. Repair and Maintenance of Chlorine System

             Employers, in this case the water utility, are responsible for training and providing
             written operational, preventive maintenance and emergency procedures to any person
             who works on a chlorine system. Employers, in consultation with equipment
             manufacturers or suppliers, must ensure that all equipment are inspected regularly and
             replaced when necessary.

             The utility’s management must make these written procedures readily available to all
             workers required to work on the chlorine system. Workers should not only understand
             but be thoroughly familiar with these procedures before carrying out repairs or
             maintenance on the chlorine system.

             Only qualified workers must supervise the cleaning and repair of chlorine systems.
             All assigned workers must be familiar with all the hazards and adhere to the
             safeguards necessary to perform the work safely. Ideally, a chlorine container repair
             kit should be available on-site. If a container repair kits not available, the utility’s
             response team must be aware of the nearest readily available kit. There are three types

Chapter-15                                                                                Page 15-31
|                                                                          Operation & Maintenance

             of repair kits (A, B, and C), each with materials specific to the type and size of the
             chlorine container.

15.2.14.5. Hazard Recognition

             Written procedures for the repair or maintenance of chlorine systems must consider
             the following hazards and include procedures that will help workers avoid these
             hazards:

             1. Moisture – Chlorine reacts with moisture to form corrosive acids. Every precaution
             must be taken to keep chlorine and chlorine equipment free of moisture, including the
             following steps:

             • Close pipes, lines, valves, and containers tightly when not in use to keep moisture
             out of the system;

             • Before starting repair, take the measures needed to prevent chlorine coming into
             contact with any residual material that may drip from the equipment when pipes or
             lines are being dismantled.

             2. Foreign Material – Pipes, lines, and fittings must have all cutting oils, grease, and
             other foreign material removed from them before use. Trichloroethylene or other
             recommended chlorinated solvents may be used; however take special precautions
             because these solvents can produce serious health effects. Never use hydrocarbon or
             alcohol solvents for cleaning because they can react violently with chlorine

             3. Heat – Because iron and steel will ignite in chlorine at about 230°C (450–500°F),
             all welding or burning must only be done after the chlorine equipment are completely
             emptied and purged with dry air.

15.2.14.6. Personnel Protective Equipment

             Controlling exposure requires strict attention to the chlorine exposure effects (see
             Table 15-8). Appropriate eye, skin, and respiratory protection are essential. Workers
             must be familiar with their use and understand the equipment limitations or capacities.

             a. Basic Protection

                When chlorine gas is in the air, safety glasses and face shields will not protect the
                eyes and respiratory passages. Workers in an area where the concentration of
                chlorine may cause mild to moderate irritation must wear eye protection with a
                tight seal around the eyes as well as a respirator that prevents inhaling the gas. If a
                full face respirator is not available, a half-face respirator and vapour-tight
                chemical goggles should be worn.

             b. Skin Protection

                Emergency response workers who are engaged in controlling serious chlorine leak
                must have access to full-body protective suits.


Chapter-15                                                                                  Page 15-32
|                                                                        Operation & Maintenance


             c. Full-face Respirators

                Full-face respirators, either with cartridges or canisters, may be used only if the
                chlorine concentration is determined to be below 10mg/l.

                • With Cartridges – A worker must wear a full-face respirator fitted with acid gas
                cartridges during any hazardous work where there is a chance of a chlorine leak.
                Full-face respirators are also appropriate for leak control where tests show the
                chlorine concentration to be less than 10 mg/l. Workers required to use a
                respirator must be clean-shaven where the respirator seals with the face to ensure
                a proper fit.

                • With Canisters – Although cartridges are preferable, a worker may use a full-
                face respirator fitted with an air-purifying canister for leak control and repair or
                maintenance procedures in chlorine concentrations less than 10 mg/l. Canisters
                with an indicator window must be replaced when the material in the window has
                changed colour. Canisters without an indicator window must be replaced after
                each use. In either case, canisters must never be used beyond the expiration date
                stamped on the label.

             d. Self-contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA)

                A worker must use an SCBA when a chlorine
                leak is suspected and the airborne chlorine
                concentration is unknown or is measured at
                more than 10 mg/l. This means that an IDLH
                situation prevails in the area. A worker wearing
                an SCBA must not enter a contaminated
                atmosphere until a second, qualified person is
                present, also equipped with an SCBA, and ready
                to perform a rescue.

                SCBA air cylinders should be refilled every six
                months or after each use, whichever comes first.
                Cylinders must have a hydrostatic test at least
                every five years. Since workers rely on this
                equipment in IDLH conditions, it is essential
                that maintenance and inspections be carried out
                according to the manufacturer’s instructions.           Figure 15-1: Self-
                                                                       Contained Breathing
             e. Person-check Radio or Telephone                        Apparatus (SCABA)

                Employers must establish a check system to ensure the continued well-being of
                workers who are working alone or at an isolated worksite. Where visual checks
                are not possible, the check system may require a radio or telephone. Workers who
                will need to use such a system must be trained in emergency procedures.

             f. Emergency equipment

                   Emergency equipment includes eyewash and shower facilities, first aid kits, and
                   container repair kits.

                   Workers must have immediate access to each of these items and must know how
                   to use them in case of emergency.

15.2.14.7. Safe Work Practice

             (A)     First Aid

                     When someone is injured in a chlorine-related incident, first aid can help
                     reduce the impact of their injuries and prevent further injuries from occurring.
                     The following steps apply to any situation in which someone is injured:

                     1. Do not panic.
                     2. Ensure that there is no more danger to yourself or the victim.
                     3. Using appropriate safety gear, remove the victim from the contaminated
                        area.
                     4. Send for medical help.

             (B)     Chlorine Inhalation

                     A person who has inhaled chlorine may be unconscious, and may have
                     difficulty in breathing or may have stopped breathing completely. Follow these
                     steps when treating a victim of chlorine inhalation:

                     1.   Assess the victim’s breathing. If breathing has stopped, begin artificial
                          respiration and continue until the victim resumes breathing. Pocket masks
                          are recommended for artificial respiration, although the mouth-to-mouth
                          method may also be used

                     2.   If the victim is having difficulty breathing (for example, gasping or
                          coughing), place the victim in the most comfortable position, usually semi-
                          sitting

                     3.    If an oxygen therapy unit and trained personnel are available, administer
                          oxygen at a 10-litre flow

                     4.   Ensure that the victim is transported to hospital in case the victim suffers a
                          delayed reaction in the form of pulmonary oedema. Any physical exertion,
                          excitement, or apprehension increases the chance and severity of a delayed
                          reaction. Keep the victim warm and completely at rest. Reassure the victim
                          while waiting for assistance and transportation to hospital.

             (C)     Skin Contact
                     Skin contact with chlorine can result in severe burns. Before attempting to flush
                     a victim’s contaminated skin, make sure the victim is breathing properly.
                     Follow these steps:

Chapter-15                                                                                   Page 15-34
|                                                                        Operation & Maintenance

                   1.   Assess the victim’s breathing. If breathing has stopped, begin artificial
                        respiration and continue until the victim resumes breathing. Pocket mask is
                        recommended for artificial respiration, although the mouth-to-mouth
                        method may also be used. If the victim is having difficulty breathing (for
                        example, gasping or coughing), place the victim in the most comfortable
                        position, usually semi-sitting

                   2.   As soon as the victim resumes breathing, flush the victim’s contaminated
                        skin and clothing with large amounts of water for 30 minutes. Remove all
                        contaminated clothing while flushing. Continue flushing until all traces of
                        chlorine have been removed

                   3.   Dress obvious burns with sterile gauze and bandage them loosely. Apply
                        insulated cold packs to help reduce pain

                   4.   Get the victim to hospital.

                   Take Note:

                   1.   Do not attempt to neutralize the chlorine with other chemicals
                   2.   Do not apply salves, ointments, or medications unless prescribed by a
                        doctor
                   3.   Skin contact with liquid chlorine coming straight out of a cylinder can
                        result in frostbite.

             (D)   Eye Contact

                   Eye contact with chlorine (liquid or gas) for even a short period can cause
                   permanent disability. Flushing must begin within 10 seconds. Follow these
                   steps:

                   1.   Flush the eyes immediately with large amounts of running water
                        (preferably lukewarm) for 30 minutes. Hold the eyelids forcibly apart to
                        ensure full flushing of the chlorine from the eyes and eyelids
                   2.   After flushing has removed all traces of chlorine, cover both eyes with
                        moistened sterile gauze pads and bandage, enough to keep light out
                   3.   Apply insulated cold packs to help reduce pain
                   4.   Get the victim to hospital.

             (E)   Unconscious Patients

                   1.   As soon as an unconscious victim of chlorine inhalation resumes
                        breathing, place the person in the drainage position (lying on one side, so
                        fluids can drain from the mouth and airways). Never give an unconscious
                        patient anything by mouth
                   2.   Keeping the victim in the same position, flush the victim’s contaminated
                        skin and clothing with large amounts of water for 30 minutes
                   3.   Remove all contaminated clothing while flushing. Continue flushing until
                        all traces of chlorine have been removed


Chapter-15                                                                              Page 15-35

                   4.   Dress obvious burns with sterile gauze and bandage them loosely. Apply
                        insulated cold packs to help reduce pain
                   5.   Get the victim to hospital.

15.2.15.     Records of key activities of O&M

             For planning future augmentations and improvements of a water works in operations,
             it is advisable to maintain certain key records such as daily and cumulative supply
             over the years, number of connections of various sizes given and cumulative number
             of connections each month, water treated and the supply billed.

15.2.16.     Staff Position

             Appropriate charts indicating the standard staff for each of the unit of operations and
             maintenance and the staff actually in position (by names if possible) shall be
             maintained at each office for review.

15.2.19.     Suggestions for GPWSC

             1. Verify the certification of daily water supply and residual head by the ward
                member / sarpanch.
             2. The persons identified by GPWSC, for running and maintenance of pumps /
                OHSR / Distribution Mains / Transmission Mains should be engaged on works
                with the executing agency at the time of construction for training purpose, so that
                later on they can take over the maintenance works without any difficulty.
             3. For MVS schemes of surface water source, the maintenance of source, intake
                works and Pumps, Transmission lines, Raw Water Storage, Treatment Plant,
                CWR and upto OHSR should be maintaned by Concerning State Department, and
                from there the water should be supplied to intra villages through a bulk water
                meter. From onwards to this point the maintenance of distribution system, house
                water supply meters etc should be maintained by GPWSC and revenue should be
                collected by them. The agreed supplied water charges should be given to the
                department by GPWSC on monthly basis. This arrangement should be made
                under an agreement so that In the case of default in payment by GPWSC the
                amount could be recovered out of grants given to GP by the Government.
             4. Based on income and expenditure statement as prepared in DPR, the GPWSC
                should fix the tariff for domestic and non domestic consumption so that proper
                maintainance can be performed. It is recommended that in addition to the annual
                O&M cost a provision to the extent of atleast 5% of the annual maintainance cost
                be provided while working out the tariff charges to meet out the major repairs.

|                                                                           Operation & Maintenance


15.2.20.     Water Revenue (Billing & Collection)

             Revenue management system is an important aspect of any Water supply System as it
             governs the financial sustainability to it. Besides fixing a tariff structure, billing and
             collection of revenue play an important part.

             1. Tariff Fixation

                The water charges to be fixed by the GPWSC with the assistance of concerned
                state department taking into account the ability of the system to meet the
                expenditure on the following heads:
                • O&M Cost (Recurring and non- recurring)/ Establishment Cost
                • Depreciation
                • Asset replacement fund.

                Tariff structure should be revised annually.

             2. Categories of Consumers

                Among the different categories, the domestic consumers are the privileged class
                of people in terms of supply of water and collection of taxes mainly because they
                use water for their healthy existence. The other categories viz. commercial
                complexes, hotel/restaurant/ industries/ bulk consumers/ offices/ institutions etc.
                are usually charged with a higher tariff. Therefore, the distribution of cost
                incurred on the maintenance of such system to each class of consumers including
                un-privileged people should be logically and appropriately determined with
                reference to the level of service rendered.

             3. Methods of Water Charges

                The methods of levying water charges can be any one or more of the following:
                a) Metered consumption of water
                b) Non-Metered System
                   • Fixed charge per house per month (depending upon the size of the house)
                      or per connection per month or fixed charge per family per month or per
                      tap per month/per house or
                   • Percentage of rateable value of the property.

                    Note: Charges for APL and BPL family may be determined separately by GP/
                    GPWSC

             4. Distribution of Bills to Consumer

                In the case of the Multi Village Water Supply Scheme, the water agency /
                MVWSC / out sourced agency charged for O&M will raise the bill every month
                to each of the panchayat based on the GP bulk water meter reading. The
                panchayat will pay the water charges to the agency / GPWSC and in turn will
                collect the water charges from the consumers. In the case of Single Village water
                supply scheme, the panchayat / GPWSC will collect water charges from the
                consumers and utilized the revenue generated for the maintenance of the scheme.

Chapter-15                                                                                  Page 15-39
|                                                                          Operation & Maintenance



                The distribution of bills in rural area can be done by operators specially
                authorized for this purpose or meter readers and bills can be distributed at the time
                of meter reading along with the receipt for previous payment if collected in cash
                by him for the next round.

                (This option saves effort/manpower but there is delay in one complete cycle in
                reading and distribution of bills).

             5. Payment of Bills by Consumer

                The payments can be accepted at any one or more ways of the following:
                • Counters at GPs. / VWSC office
                • At bank / banks authorized for accepting payments
                • Door to door/on the spot recovery by authorized person
                • By cheque through drop boxes.

             6. Related Accounting

                The billing section also carries out the accounting related to these receipts such as
                posting of receipts, generation of demand registers or ledgers on periodic basis.
                The complete accounting related to the billing may also be more efficiently
                carried out by the computerized system.

             7. Delayed Payments

                Since water is being treated as a commodity consumed the advance billing is
                generally not carried out. It is therefore ‘a must’ to levy penalty/interest on the
                delayed payments of the bills. To avoid delays in payments some discount/
                incentive may be thought for the consumers who pay within the stipulated time.

15.3. Operation        and     Maintenance       of    Solid     Liquid     Waste       Management

15.3.1. Operation and Maintenance of Sanitary Landfill

       Refer Chapter 13 para 13.3.2.21 & 22 and for further details, refer CPHEEO Manual on
       Solid Waste Management.

15.3.2. Operation and Maintenance of Twin Pit Pour Flush Latrine

       Generally the Twin Pit pour Flush Latrines are to be constructed in rural area, thus its
       main points for maintenance are given below:

       Diversion of flow from one pit to another is necessary as only one of the two pits is to be
       used at a time. It is very important to completely seal the entry to the pit that is not in use.
       This is done by blocking one of the openings in the junction chamber. When water does
       not flow out of the pan either there is blockage (chocked) or the pit in use is full. If by
       roding of the connecting pipe, the flow is not restored, it indicates that the pit in use is
       full and the flow needs to be diverted to the second pit. For this the opening of the second
       pit, which so far is not in use be opened and that of the pit which is filled up be blocked.

Chapter-15                                                                                  Page 15-40
|                                                                         Operation & Maintenance

       Keep cover on the drain from the junction chamber to the pit (in case of open drain
       connection) as well as on the junction chamber properly, so that foul smell is not emitted.

       When the filled pit is allowed to rest for a minimum period of a one and a half year the
       pit contents are completely digested and are free of foul smell. The pit can then be safely
       emptied manually without being hazardous to health; by the householder himself or
       through the local authority or a private agency. However in cases of combined pits and
       pits located in water logged, high sub soil water areas desludging of pits should be done
       carefully; because the sludge might not be completely safe and dry to handle due to travel
       of pathogens from the pit in use to the pit to be desludged. After the pit is emptied the
       cover should be placed in position and the joint be made air tight. The sludge humus
       collected has rich manure value and is a good soil conditioner. The manure from dry pits
       can be used directly either in the kitchen garden or in the fields but from wet pits it can be
       used only after sun drying.

            Do’s and Don’ts

             For continuous sustainable uses of Twin Pit Pour Flush Latrines by all the members
             of the households certain actions for convenience of users as well as for long term
             use, following measures needs to be taken.

             Do’s

              Keep a bucket full of the water outside the latrine
              Keep a 2.0 litre can in the latrine with water for pouring
              Before use, pour a little quantity of water to wet the pan so that excreta slid
               smoothly into the pit
              Flush the excreta after the use
              Pour a little quantity of water say ½ a litre in the squatting pan after urination
              The squatting pan should be kept clean
              Use minimum quantity of water in washing the pan and latrine floor
              Wash hand using soap or ash after defecation at the assigned place
              If any construction defect is observed during the guarantee period, report the
               matter to the local authority or the construction agency
              When the pit is in use is full, divert the flow to second pit
              If the trap gets choked, roding should be done from the pan side as well as from
               the rear side by means of a split bamboo stick after removing the cover of the
               drain or junction chamber
              Care should be taken when desludging the pit located in water logged or high sub
               soil water areas and in case of combined pits, as the humus may not be safe for
               handling

             Don’ts
              Do not use both the pits at the same time
              Do not use more than 2.0 litre of water for each flushing (if the waste is not flush
               with 2.0 litre pour more water at the specific spot for flushing waste)
              Do not use caustic soda or acid for cleaning the pan
              Do not throw sweepings, vegetable or fruit peelings, rugs, cotton waste and
               cleaning material like corn cobs, mud balls, stone pieces, leaves etc. in the pan or
               the pits
Chapter-15                                                                                Page 15-41
|                                                                            Operation & Maintenance

                  Do not allow rain water, kitchen or bath waste to enter the leach pits
                  Do not provide water tap in the latrine
                  Do not throw lighted cigarette butts in the pan
                  Do not desludge the pits before one and a half years of it being out of use.

15.3.3.      Septic Tanks

             (i)   Withdrawal of septage from the tank should normally be done every year or in
                   any case when it gets filled with sludge to one third of it’s depth. In case it is not
                   done the effluent from the tank will carry lot of undigested organic matter
                   having high BOD
             (ii) Septage collection from the tank be carried out carefully with due consideration
                   of the safety of workers and of the area environment
             (iii) It is necessary that the water level in the tank is first lowered well below the
                   tank outlet level and the scum is punctured for putting the suction of the pump
             (iv) A layer of digested sludge of thickness around five to ten centimetres all through
                   the bottom of tank be left over so that in subsequent loading of the tank with
                   waste the process of sludge formation and waste digestion starts immediately.

15.3.4.      Small Bore Sewers

             (i)   Small bore sewers require very little maintenance. The only routine maintenance
                   which must be performed is the removal of sludge from each of the interceptor
                   tanks. Routine flushing of the sewer mains has not been necessary in any of the
                   systems currently in use. However, periodic flushing is recommended to insure
                   against blockages.
             (ii) Small bore sewer systems should be operated and maintained by the local
                   agency (e.g., municipality, local water and Sewerage Company) responsible for
                   waterborne sanitation. Its responsibilities should include all sewer appurtenances
                   located on private property as well as those in the public right-of-way.
                   Easements to any appurtenances should be obtained from each property owner
                   to allow free access.
             (iii) Interceptor tanks. Scheduled maintenance for the tanks is generally limited to
                   yearly inspection and solids removal when necessary. If the sludge layer is
                   within 300 mm of the bottom of either the inlet or outlet baffles, or if the bottom
                   of the scum layer is within 75 mm of the bottom of the outlet baffle, the tank
                   should be desludged. The sludge layer can be determined by wrapping a cloth
                   (preferably toweling) on a stick long enough to reach the bottom of the tank.
                   The stick is pushed to the bottom of the tank, twirled between the hands and
                   held in the tank for about a minute. When the stick is withdrawn, a distinct black
                   mark is left on the cloth recording the sludge depth. The scum layer can be
                   checked by nailing a 75 mm square piece of wood on the bottom of the stick.
                   This is pushed through the scum layer and slowly moved up and down to locate
                   the bottom of the scum by feeling the change in resistance. The stick is marked
                   using a convenient point for reference. With the same stick, the bottom of the
                   outlet baffle is located and the stick marked again. The distance between the two
                   marks is the distance between the bottom of the scum layer and outlet baffle.
             (iv) Interceptor tanks are cleaned by pumping the contents to a truck-mounted tank
                   for hauling to a suitable disposal site. All solids should be removed, although a
                   small quantity may be left in the tank to act as a seed for the new sludge. At no

|                                                                          Operation & Maintenance

                   time should the tank be entered because of the danger of toxic gases. Land
                   spreading or discharge to a treatment plant is the most common methods for
                   sludge disposal.
             (v) Sewer mains. Occasional hydraulic flushing of the sewer mains is required. This
                   is usually sufficient to remove most solids accumulations. Flushing should begin
                   at the upstream terminal ends of the sewers, and each section between cleanouts
                   or manholes should be flushed successively downstream. Each cleanout or
                   manhole is flooded with water from a tank truck to a depth sufficient to create a
                   flow velocity of at least 0.5 m/s in the section. During flushing care must be
                   taken not to surcharge the system excessively, so creating sewage backups at
                   individual connections. The connections with the lowest elevation in each
                   station should be noted to determine whether the flushing will create backup.
                   Flushing rates and volumes should be adjusted accordingly.
             (vi) If blockages occur, the connection at the lowest elevation upstream of the
                   blockage should be located, the interceptor tank opened and a pump truck
                   stationed there to remove all incoming sewage. The blockage can then be
                   removed using hydraulic cutting tools snaked down the main through the
                   cleanouts or by breaking into the pipe. If the pipe is broken into, a cleanout
                   should be installed at that point for future emergencies
             (vii) Flow monitoring at the wastewater treatment plant headworks is recommended
                   to identify problems with inflow or infiltration. Both are detrimental to the
                   system because of the grit which usually enters with the flow. If flows increase
                   substantially during the wet season, the building sewers, interceptor tanks, sewer
                   mains and appurtenances should be inspected for leaks.

15.3.5.      Horizontal Flow Gravel Filter of DEWATS

             (i)   For proper growth of plants it is necessary to load the filter with fresh water
                   only so that the seedlings planted attains rapid growth .The filter bed should
                   thereafter be loaded gradually with waste water by increasing the contents of
                   waste water till full load of waste water is attained and the plants attains full
                   growth .Thereafter the waste water alone could be loaded on it
             (ii) It is necessary that the inlet provides uniform distribution of waste water all
                   through the cross section of the filter bed and the outlet also ensures equitable
                   collection of the waste water all through from the cross section of bed. This is
                   ensured by providing entry and outlet through the gravel mass at both ends of
                   adequate porosity. It is necessary to ensure that at the two ends the gravel mass
                   is not disturbed and if so it should be restored to as initially
             (iii) The gravel sizes and shape provided are such that porosity of the gravel mass is
                   as desired. For this it is necessary that all sand and dust is removed from the
                   gravels before putting them at the inlet and outlet ends.

15.3.6.      Anaerobic Baffled Reactor

             (i)    Before commissioning it is necessary that some quantity of fully digested sludge
                    is put into the reactor such that the waste water flowing into the reactor gets in
                    contact with the digested sludge thereby initiating the digestion reaction
             (ii)   The flow velocity in the chamber should not exceed one meter per hour and as
                    such it necessary to control the flow of waste into the chamber

             (iii) The entry at the first baffle is provided at its mid-depth and in subsequent
                   baffles at the top end of the baffle wall
             (iv) These openings of equal size are spaced at equal distances to each other all
                   along the width of the baffle wall so that the waste flows smoothly all through
                   the chamber uniformly under quiescent conditions.

15.3.7.      Drainage System

             (i)    Catch pits provided in the house premises should be properly and regularly
                    cleaned
             (ii)   Regular cleaning/de-silting is required for drains so that sufficient capacity is
                    achieved. So that rain water shall not flow over pavement in case of occurrence
                    of rain.

15.3.8.      Exit Strategy

              After trial-run and commissioning, joint inspection by both GPWSC/ Community
              and PHED/RWSD will be done to ensure: (i) water supply for all households (ii)
              bulk Flow meter and disinfection facilities installed (iii) distribution system covers
              the entire habitation, (iv) interconnection between new and existing system is
              provided, (v) saddle pieces are provided to all households, to take house connections
              (vi) water quality analysis reports are available (vii) construction quality records are
              available at the sites, (viii) GPWSC / Community is aware of O&M cost and tariff
              to be paid (ix).operator selected by community is trained (x) soft and hard copies of
              all financial details of the scheme are available; Completion plans and required
              contact numbers for effective complaint redressal are available and insurance of
              works provided in post implementation technical support to GPWSC. (xi)
              Arrangements are made for Periodic verification of service levels, social and
              sustainability audits of all completed schemes.

              Provision for five year operation and maintenance of the schemes (DBO) shall be
              included in the scope of construction agency; while the provision of 01 year of O&M
              shall be kept for other schemes apart from DBO. After expiry of O&M period, the
              internal distribution system shall be handed over to gram panchayat, while common
              water source and reservoir will be maintained by the concerning state departments.
              Annexures are placed separately at Volume-2 of the Technical Manual.
