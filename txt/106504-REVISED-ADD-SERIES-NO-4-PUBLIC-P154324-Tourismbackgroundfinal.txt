Tourism
Pacific Possible Background Paper No.4.
Pacific Island countries face unique development challenges.
They are far away from major markets, often with small
populations spread across many islands and vast distances,
and are at the forefront of climate change and its impacts.
Because of this, much research has focused on the challenges
and constraints faced by Pacific Island countries, and finding
ways to respond to these.

This paper is one part of the Pacific Possible series, which
takes a positive focus, looking at genuinely transformative
opportunities that exist for Pacific Island countries over the
next 25 years and identifies the region’s biggest challenges
that require urgent action.

Realizing these opportunities will often require collaboration
not only between Pacific Island Governments, but also with
neighbouring countries on the Pacific Rim. The findings
presented in Pacific Possible will provide governments
and policy-makers with specific insights into what each
area could mean for the economy, for employment, for
government income and spending.

Tourism in 2040:
Bringing an additional one million visitors
per year to paradise

     Executive Summary
1.       Tourism offers Papua New Guinea (PNG), Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa,
Kiribati, Palau, Marshall Islands (RMI), Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and Tuvalu, hereafter
referred to as the PIC11, significant opportunities for economic growth and shared prosperity. These
opportunities derive from the comparative advantage of their resource endowments suited to
tourism: pristine natural environments and cultural diversity. While pristine natural environments are
not the exclusive domains of PIC11, competing island destinations in the Indian Ocean and the
Caribbean also have them, the PIC11’s unique and diverse cultural heritages are what differentiates
them in the global market. Further, tourism presents the chance to preserve the environment and
cultural heritage through sustainable development practices. Tourism represents a unique
opportunity because it is less subject to—and can actually benefit from—factors that are barriers to
other forms of economic growth: small and dispersed populations, small land areas, remoteness from
markets, and limited natural resources (UNWTO 2012).
2.        The PIC11 received 1.37 million overnight visitor arrivals in 2014, a record number. The five
most popular destinations in order of visitor arrivals were Fiji, PNG, Palau, Samoa and Vanuatu. Fiji
received 100,000 more than the other 10 countries combined. Two thirds of the market for the PIC11
is visitors from Australia and New Zealand. The United States, China, Japan and Europe are relatively
small but still very important markets as they have the potential to generate much more growth in
arrivals given the size of their populations.
3.       Tourism already plays an important role in the economies of Palau, Fiji, Samoa and Vanuatu.
Tourism is an important source of export earnings for many PICs. In Samoa and Vanuatu, tourism
generates the majority of export earnings. In Tonga it is the largest single source, about five times as
that of agriculture and fisheries combined. For Fiji it has replaced sugar as the primary export earner.
Tourism is also a tax base, which generates revenue from targeted taxes, like Fiji’s service turnover
tax on hotels and restaurants. Targeted taxes also give governments another means to influence
visitor arrivals numbers by affecting prices, like Palau’s efforts to limit arrivals via increased departure
and hotel taxes. Tourism is a significant employer in those PIC11 where tourism is a major industry.
South Pacific Tourism Organization (SPTO) estimates indicate the highest levels of employment in
Tonga, 15 percent, Samoa, 18 percent, and Palau, 50 percent.
4.       Compared to global average annual growth of 3.9 percent from 2005 to 2014, PIC11 visitor
arrivals have grown by 4.5 percent. While long-term growth is positive for PIC11s, performance varies
between countries and short-term decreases have resulted from political instabilities, natural
disasters and global market conditions. The average annual growth rate for the five top destinations
from 1995 to 2014 was 5.5 percent, while the other six only averaged 2.5 percent.

5.        The PIC11 countries are significantly underrepresented in international brand name hotels.
This is largely due to the very small average size of hotels in the region. Research by the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) shows that there are fewer than 60 hotels in the PIC11 with more than 100
rooms and less than 60 percent of these carry an international brand. In terms of large international
hotel groups, Accor (France), Starwood (US) and InterContinental Hotel Group (UK) dominate the
region with 60 percent of the branded properties. The absence of a critical mass of international brand
names limits recognition in international markets.
6.      Analysis of individual source markets and market trends suggest that in order to ensure
long-term, balanced and manageable visitor growth, the Pacific will need to work on several fronts
to maintain its strong position in the short haul markets of Australia and New Zealand, capture a share
of the emerging Asian markets while at the same time significantly improving penetration into the
traditional, but slower growth long haul markets of Europe and North America.
Learning from the Seychelles and the Maldives
7.       Tourism has transformed many emerging economies in the last 50 years including
Seychelles and the Maldives. In 1995, the Maldives received 315,000 international arrivals and
US$211 million in tourism receipts. By 2014 arrivals exceeded 1.2 million and tourism receipts were
US$2,645 million. In 2013, tourism accounted for 27.9 percent of GDP (Ministry of Tourism 2014).
Maldives has successfully attracted the Chinese market through a combination of marketing and
easing direct flight access. China grew from nearly zero to over 30 percent of the market in an eight-
year period making it the top source market since 2010. Tourist arrivals in the Seychelles increased
from 120,716 in 1995 to 231,857 in 2014, an increase of 92 percent. The Seychelles was quick to
change strategy when the 2008 financial crisis hit the main European source market and diversified
its source markets.
8.       Under the assumption of long-term visitor growth of three percent, tourism will continue
to be important to PIC11 economies. However, long-term growth at this level will not generate
significant changes in economic performance of the PIC11s. For this, it will be necessary to
significantly expand demand in selected segments. Significant growth in visitor arrivals above trend is
possible.




                                                                                                          ii
Transformational Opportunities
9.       Based on long-term performance, emerging market trends, specific product opportunities
and the natural attractions and selling points, the Pacific has opportunities that hold the potential
to generate transformational change. These opportunities include aggressively targeting the Chinese
visitor market, engaging more directly in the rapidly growing Pacific cruising product, expansion of the
high-end resort market and capitalizing on the aging population in key origin markets by developing a
long-stay visitor opportunity for retirees. These opportunities have the potential to deliver
substantially higher revenues but will also bring impacts that will need to be managed.
Capturing the Chinese Market
10.      The market share of Chinese tourists can be increased substantially beyond its current seven
percent. Between 2009 and 2014, Chinese visitors to PIC11 grew by an average of 27 percent per
annum, and now represent seven percent of the inbound market. Based on the experience of other
destinations that implemented well-targeted policy interventions that facilitated improved access,
such as aviation and visa policies, together with targeted marketing, the annual growth rate of Chinese
arrivals could continue to grow at 20 percent for the next 10 to 20 years in most PIC11. Limitations on
carrying capacity and absorption rates would act to reduce the growth of Chinese visitors to PIC11s
over time.
11.      The PIC11 can attract nearly one million Chinese tourists in 2040. Chinese visitors could
represent a 26 percent share of total PIC11 tourism, resulting in a figure of approximately 965,000
visitors by 2040. At that time the PIC11 would welcome nearly 3.7 million international tourists.
Compared to a long term growth rate of around five percent for most PIC11, the additionality of the
transformational scenario estimates the economic potential of the Chinese market opportunity in
2040 at over 660,000 additional tourists, which bring nearly US$950 million in tourism receipts, and
generate nearly 65,200 additional jobs.

                                                   iii
Home-basing cruise ships
12.       Home-basing cruise ships in the Pacific can generate multiplier effects in the hosting country,
and open up new destinations. The growth of the Australian market has transformed cruising in the
Pacific. Since 2004, cruising to all destinations by Australians has grown at an annual rate of 20 percent,
reaching 1 million passengers in 2014. One way to increase both the number of visitors to the PIC11
and the socioeconomic impact of cruising is by basing large cruise ships in the islands. Not only would
this bring benefits to the homeport country, but it would also bring more cruise arrivals to PICs that
are too far from Australia to reach on the most popular 7-10 day-length cruises. In 2040, the economic
potential of the home-basing cruise ships market opportunity is estimated at nearly 266,000 tourists,
which bring nearly US$67 million in tourism receipts, and generate nearly 4,700 jobs. The country
hosting the cruise ship can earn over two thirds of these benefits.

Increasing the presence of Luxury Resorts
13.     Developing high-end luxury properties can bring an extra 139,000 high-yield tourists. For
PIC11s, with limited ability to serve mass markets of the scale emerging globally, it will also be
important to pursue strategies that increase yield. Achieving yield, however, requires properties that
meet the demands of discerning international travelers, with either international standard resorts or
specialty resort products. There is an opportunity to develop 98 rooms in first-tier exclusive resorts,
200 rooms in second-tier luxury hotels and 700 rooms in third-tier luxury hotels by 2030. In 2040, the
economic potential of the luxury market opportunity is estimated at nearly 139,000 additional tourists,

Capturing the Retiree Market
14.      The largely increasing retiree market has the potential of bringing over 300 million dollars
to the PIC11 in 2040. The number of Australians over the age of 65 is projected to increase by 75
percent over the next 20 years, from 3.3 million in 2012 to 5.8 million in 2032, and post-retirement
assets will grow from around US$300 billion to US$1.3 trillion by 2032. Moreover, the number of New
Zealanders over 65 is expected to double by 2036. The current senior tourism market is disaggregated
into three segments by length of stay: leisure travelers, long-stay travelers and home owners or
permanent stay. For the home owners and permanent-stay segment, long term certainty of residency,
access to high quality medical care, ease of communication, and ease of visa and immigration process
are critical factors. In addition, affordability, safety, ease of international and local connectivity, tax
status and property ownership rights, including disposal on death or departure with repatriation of
assets, are also important to this segment. Based on the experience of other destinations and with
appropriate conditions, it is plausible for the PIC11 to target a total of 5,000 retirees by 2025. The
growth is likely to slow after 2025 and it is reasonable to assume that retirees would only stay for a
period of up to ten years. Growth is likely to continue beyond 2025 and PIC11s could potentially have
10,000 resident foreign retirees by 2040. These 10,000 retirees could bring US$200 million in receipts
and generate nearly 14,000 jobs.

Capturing the Opportunities for Transformational Growth

15.     The Pacific faces challenges which constrain growth. These include difficulties in access;
declining competitiveness with dated facilities; limited demand, particularly from long haul markets
and constrained marketing. This is coupled with a lack of effective data for decision making. It will be
necessary for the Pacific to address these underlying fundamentals in order to build a stronger
platform for growth.
16.     Realizing the potential growth of tourism in the Pacific requires a strategy of improving yields
and developing markets. It means being less dependent on Australia and New Zealand markets. To
achieve this requires a four part strategy:
•       Improving connectivity with growing and established markets. The first step is improving
access to long-haul markets, which has declined over the last decade as demand from northern
hemisphere markets was constrained by the Global Financial Crisis. It requires direct connections
between those markets and PIC11s, avoiding the hubs of Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and Guam.

                                                    v
•      Attracting more and higher yielding tourists. Overcoming dependence on Australia and New
Zealand as the principal markets for PIC11s will require concerted, long-term market development
that emphasizes yield, rather than volume.
•        Improving the investment climate and the effectiveness of public sector participation in the
sector. There are a number of issues to be managed in ensuring that PIC11 Governments and regional
agencies are equipped to manage the future demands of a fast growing tourist industry, including the
business enabling environment, the quality of the labor force, the effectiveness of public institutions
to attract visitors, and the capacity of regional destination marketing.
•       Improving the efficiency of the tourism sector. This would include improving linkages between
tourism and the local economy such as food supplies and services to hotels, improved destination
management and strategy, pooling of private sector resources such as cold storage and access to
warehousing financing for this purpose, and regional training facilities. The Caribbean tourism strategy
now incorporates a number these initiatives designed to improve efficiency. Fiscal revenues from the
sector can also be better managed.
17.      In addition to building a stronger platform for growth, PIC11s need to adopt a series of specific
actions in order to capture the four transformational opportunities.
        Opportunity                                         Actions Required
                                    •   Negotiate new air routes between PIC’s and Chinese cities with
                                        frequencies to fit with limited holiday opportunities, price
                                        points to match competitive destinations and minimal stops.
                                        Scheduled routes may initially be developed by charters or
                                        supplemented by charters at times of high demand.
                                    •   Upgrade airports and provide support to attract new carriers,
                                        to cater for larger aircraft and volume traffic, to minimize
                                        processing delays on arrival and departure and facilitate
    Increasing the                      transfers to their destination.
                                    •   Tailor offerings to Chinese tourists, such as providing
   Chinese Market
                                        translators, improving service standards, installing Chinese
                                        signage and coverage of Wi-Fi. Prioritize market segments and
                                        understanding the preferences of these segments. Develop
                                        information for independent travelers which minimizes
                                        uncertainty, and provides clarity from the point of product
                                        selection to destination arrival.
                                    •   Build relationships with major Chinese outbound operators,
                                        wholesalers and China-based agents selling the Pacific to
                                        develop concrete sales and distribution channels for marketing
                                        efforts.
                                    •   Implement a fully-resourced, long-term targeted promotion
                                        campaign, covering all cities, including travel trade, public
                                        relations and a major on-line presence through leading
                                        booking and trading websites.

                          •  Identify specific segments of the Chinese market which match
                             PIC11 offerings, including soft adventure, diving, weddings,
                             incentives, overnight cruising etc.
                          • Increase the efficiency of visa application processes across all
                             PIC’s targeting the Chinese market where visas are a barrier.
                             o Improve the communication of visa requirements to
                                 intending Chinese tourists.
                             o Streamline and simplify the visa application process as
                                 much as possible.
                             o Introduce multiple entry electronic visas (e-visa) and
                                 extend the allowed duration.
                             o Promote regional visa scheme or visa waiver programs to
                                 facilitate travel among PIC11s, eliminating individual visa
                                 requirements for each destination.
                             o Introduce no-cost Visa on Arrival where possible.
                          • Improve the shopping product in key destinations and at
                             resorts through a retail development program.
                      •   Implement a major campaign through Chinese media to raise
                          awareness of the Pacific.
    Opportunity                                  Actions Required
                          • Work with the cruise lines and the Fiji Government to ensure
                             the formal procedures, authorities and rights for Fiji-based
                             cruise operations are in place and that essential services are
                             provided.
                          • Work with Fiji Ports to bring Lautoka Wharf up to the necessary
                             standard for alongside berthing and passenger embarking-
Increasing the PIC-          disembarking, including pre-departure assembly, baggage
 based cruise ship           handling and coach loading areas.
      market              • Work with Fiji Roads to ensure the Nadi-Lautoka Road is at a
                             standard for large volume coach traffic.
                          • Work with Airports Fiji Limited to ensure terminal capacity can
                             meet the needs of multiple arrivals and departures of cruise
                             passengers to coincide with scheduled cruise vessel
                             movements.
                          • Build relationships directly with cruise companies and airlines
                             to ensure that charter flights to and from main source markets
                             can operate in coordination with cruise ship schedules.
                          • Assist the development of existing and new destination ports
                             in PIC’s including safe navigation, adequate services and the
                             development of ground operations where not already in place.
                          • Negotiate with cruise companies for sector fares to enable
                             multi-stop, alternative fly-in fly-out, or extended shore breaks
                             for example Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Vanuatu to increase yield.

                   •   Encourage the use of smaller cruise vessels (less than 500
                       passengers) for remote island cruising, enabling low impact
                       visits to sensitive communities. These already exist in some
                       locations including Fiji, PNG and the Solomon Islands. Tonga
                       has potential in the Ha’apai and Vava’u groups.
                   •   Upgrade ports to improve the visitor experience with weather
                       protected markets close to the wharf and control over local
                       tour operations.
                   •   Assist agencies operating potential new cruise ports to attract
                       cruise vessels through financial or in-kind subsidies where
                       economic impact from cruise traffic is sufficient to meet the
                       goals of the destination.
                   •   Promote the Pacific as a fly-cruise destination in both Pacific
                       Rim and global markets.
   Opportunity                             Actions Required
                   •   PIC Governments to develop an exclusive accommodation
                       policy and implementation strategy at a national level to
                       minimise concerns of elitism.
                   •   Support by governments to assist the purchase or lease of land
                       under conditions acceptable to investors but ensuring full
                       protection and benefits to traditional land owners.
                   •   Identify prospective locations, their characteristics and

 investments in    •   Identify a Pacific champion to lead, guide and assist in the
                       development of a regional strategy, an individual respected by
high-end resorts
                       his or her peers and who can, with assistance, bring investors
                       and opportunities together.
                   •   Develop a Pacific luxury marketing strategy similar to Tourism
                       New Zealand’s Premium Strategy and, if possible, establish
                       links to enhance the South Pacific offering.
                   •   Increase availability of private jet aircraft facilities at gateway
                       airports.
   Opportunity                             Actions Required
                   •   Establish visa and taxation regimes to attract long stay retirees
                   •   Invest in high quality and affordable health care offerings that
                       are crucial to the retiree market including private hospitals and
                       aged-care homes.
                   •   Invest in infrastructure and provide incentives to attract the
                       private sector to develop accommodation options for foreign
Attracting the         retirees. Provide policy incentives for foreign retirees to own
Retiree Market         and dispose of properties in PIC11s.
                   •   Determine rights of individuals to import personal effects duty
                       free, and vehicles for their own use either duty free (with a
                       claw-back on sale) or at a minimal charge.

                                  viii
•   Determine rights of retirees to import capital and receive
    income from their home country, and to remit capital on sale
    or to beneficiaries in the event of death.
•   Establish a system of licensed immigration agents to assist and
    guide intending immigrants, with an agreed scale of fees and
    specific skill requirements.
•   Enhance targeted marketing efforts to potential foreign
    retirees. Develop annual targets for participant numbers.
    Given Australia and New Zealand are both top destinations for
    retirement, PIC11s need to develop a strategic plan to attract
    retirees from these two potential markets with a roll-out to
    wider markets in the future.
•   Develop a communication plan and provide clear guidance to
    retirees through a dedicated government website.
•   Introduce training through authorized providers for aged-care
    support services.
•   Determine the interest of Australian and New Zealand aged-
    care providers to establish facilities in PICs and encourage the
    development of retirement complexes close to major centers.

1 Importance of Tourism in Pacific Island Countries
1.      Tourism is one of the few economically viable sectors for the 11 World Bank member-Pacific
Island Countries (PIC11) of Papua New Guinea (PNG), Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa,
Tuvalu, Kiribati, Palau, Marshall Islands (RMI), and Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Being very
small, and very remote, severely constrains the countries’ areas of international competitiveness and
growth potential. The key economically viable growth areas are those that draw on PICs’ natural and
human resource endowments.
2.       The pristine environment is the PIC11’s main tourist attraction, bringing 1.37 million tourists
in 2014. The other top demands for tourism are the range of recreation opportunities and cultural
diversity. Two thirds of the market for the PIC11 is visitors from Australia and New Zealand. The United
States, China, Japan and Europe are relatively small but still very important markets as they have the
potential to generate much more growth in arrivals given the size of their populations. However, other
destinations strongly compete with the PIC11, including the Maldives and Bali.
3.      Tourism offers the PIC11 significant opportunities for economic growth and shared prosperity.
These opportunities derive from the comparative advantage of their resource endowments suited to
tourism: pristine natural environments and cultural diversity. While pristine natural environments are
not the exclusive domains of PIC11s, competing island destinations in the Indian Ocean and the
Caribbean also have them, the PIC11’s unique and diverse cultural heritages are what differentiates
them in the global market. Further, tourism presents the chance to preserve the environment and
cultural heritage through sustainable development practices. Tourism represents a unique
opportunity because it is less subject to—and can actually benefit from—factors that are barriers to
other forms of economic growth: small and dispersed populations, small land areas, remoteness from
markets, and limited natural resources (UNWTO 2012).
4.       Tourism already plays an important role in the economies of Palau, Fiji, Samoa and Vanuatu
as a contributor to GDP. Solomon Islands, PNG, Tonga, and FSM have all seen significant growth in
arrivals since 2000. With over two thirds of tourist arrivals to the PIC11 originating from Australia and
New Zealand, both relatively small markets, large markets in China and other rapidly growing Asian
countries present substantial growth opportunities. Smaller, more established long-haul markets in
Europe and North America could be boosted through product diversification targeting retiree and
high-end markets. Cruising can also provide an opportunity for port cities and small islands to benefit
from the Pacific’s fastest growing tourism sector. PIC11s all have potential for tourism to make a
greater economic contribution through growth in visitor numbers and an emphasis on higher yielding
segments. Achieving transformational change, however, will require improving access from emerging
and existing source markets, improving the investment climate and increasing the effectiveness of
public-sector participation in the tourism sector.

1.1 The Scale of Tourism
5.      The PIC11 received 1.37 million visitor arrivals in 2014, a record number. The five most
popular destination countries in 2013 were also the top five in 2014 (Table 1). The only change was
Palau jumped from fifth to third due to a rapid increase in Chinese visitors. Fiji was overwhelmingly
the most popular destination, having received more visitors in 2013 than all of the other countries
combined. The same was true for 2014, although arrivals data were not available for Kiribati and


                                                   1
 Marshall Islands. These two countries combined received 11,258 arrivals in 2013. Nevertheless, for
 2014 international arrivals to Fiji totaled 100,000 more than all of the other countries combined. None
 of the other destinations grew as quickly as Fiji. In fact, declines were recorded for Vanuatu, Solomon
 Islands and FSM. Initial reports of arrivals for 2015 show very strong growth since 2014 for Fiji and
 Palau, at 9 percent and 19.3 percent, respectively. Tonga continued to grow steadily with a 6.6 percent
 increase. As anticipated, Vanuatu saw a decrease of 17.2 percent in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Pam.
                Table 1. In 2013, tourism brought 1.3 million visitor arrivals and US$1.4 billion

 6.      Total tourism receipts for PICs in 2013 were US$1.4 billion with an average expenditure of just
 over US$1,000 per arrival. There are wide variations in reported per arrival expenditure across the
 countries and collection methods are not always comparable. Tourism receipts can give a clearer
 picture of how the tourism sector is performing within an economy. In ecologically sensitive
 destinations such as PICs, low volume-high yield tourism is preferred because it can be less damaging
 to the environment. More arrivals do not necessarily coincide with higher receipt totals. Assuming the
 data are accurate and collected based on similar indicators, the relationships between arrivals and
 receipts can highlight market distinctions among PICs.
 7.     While PNG ranked second in terms of arrivals, their tourism receipts lagged considerably
 compared to the other countries. This mainly resulted from differing data collection methods that
 undercount tourism receipts. Another factor was a large proportion—30 percent—of arrivals for
 employment purposes.
 8.       When comparing Samoa and Vanuatu, Samoa received 10 percent more visitors but earned
 just over half of Vanuatu’s tourism income. For Samoa this reflects regional visitors from American
 Samoa and Visiting Friends and Relatives (VFR) traffic from Australia, New Zealand and the US—less
 than 40 percent of 2013 arrivals reported holiday as purpose of visit. Vanuatu’s main source markets
 were Australia and New Zealand, and holiday visitors were over 80 percent. Generally, regional visitors
 stay shorter, while VFR visitors are more likely to stay with friends or relatives and spend less during
 their stay.



                                                        2
9.      Tourism receipts in the Solomon Islands were more than twice those for FSM, but arrivals
were about 60 percent of FSM. While the US was the main source for FSM, the second source market
was the Philippines. As in PNG, Philippines arrivals are most likely for business or employment
purposes. The main source market for Solomon Islands is Australia and surveys have shown that the
majority of Australian visitors come for leisure purposes.

1.2 Impacts of Tourism
10.      Tourism’s share of GDP reflects the sector’s relative importance in an economy. Estimates by
WTTC are only available for some PICs, and their methods have been criticized for overestimating
tourism’s role. Their data are therefore most valuable for making comparisons over time and between
countries (Figure 1). Between 1990 and 2014, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu and Kiribati all
saw increases in tourism’s share of GDP, with the share essentially doubling in Solomon Islands and
Kiribati. However, PNG saw a 60 percent decrease, due to faster growth in other sectors of the
economy. Arrivals to PNG grew by over 400 percent during the same period and were the second
highest among PICs at 184,563 in 2014.
                           Figure 1. The direct contribution of travel and tourism to GDP has increased in most PICs

11.     Separate estimates from SPTO indicate that, in 2011, tourism’s share of GDP was 20 percent
in Samoa, 50 percent in Palau and 3 percent in Tuvalu. According to the IMF, tourism activities in Palau
made up about 75 percent of economic growth in 2012. Tourism-related industries like hotels, food
services and transportation accounted for 4.5 percentage points of the 5.5 percent growth in real GDP
(IMF 2014).
12.     By comparison, tourism makes a significant economic contribution in Indian Ocean Island
States that have successfully engaged the industry. Tourism represents 28 percent of GDP for the
Maldives and 21 percent for the Seychelles (Ministry of Tourism 2014).
13.       The services sector, which includes direct tourism activity, has been the largest sector in PIC
economies—except in PNG where the industrial sector dominates thanks to natural resources
extraction. The agricultural sector, which includes fisheries and farming, was smaller than tourism in
Fiji, Palau and Samoa. By comparison the Maldives had a services sector contributing 78.4 percent of
GDP and in the Cook Islands 83.5 percent (ADB 2015).

                                                                      3
14.     Tourism is an important source of export earnings for many PICs. In Samoa and Vanuatu,
tourism generates the majority of export earnings. In Tonga it is the largest single source, about five
times as that of agriculture and fisheries combined. For Fiji it has replaced sugar as the primary export
earner. When looking only at services exports, tourism’s role is even more significant. In 10 of the 11
PICs, tourism is the primary services export sector, with PNG the only exception.
15.      The values of tourism earnings in nominal terms vary greatly among PICs, but illustrate the
strength of each country’s industry over time (Table 1). Fiji, Palau, PNG, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga
and Vanuatu have seen significant growth in receipts from 2010 to 2014, while others have stagnated
or declined. However, comparisons may be hindered by different methods of data collection and
definitions of tourism spending within the economy. The very low levels of receipts in PNG relative to
arrivals indicate a need for improved data collection processes to capture actual revenues from
tourism.
16.     Tourism receipts per arrival offer a more useful figure for comparing performance between
countries (Table 1). More spending per arrival indicates that a destination has achieved a higher yield
per arrival. This is especially important in PICs where limited resources and sensitive environments
make mass tourism unsustainable. Receipts per arrival can also highlight the price competitiveness of
a destination, allowing higher-cost destinations like Solomon Islands to tailor marketing campaigns or
investigate measures to lower costs.
17.      Another useful measure is tourism receipts per capita, which allows for easier comparisons
across countries with vastly different population sizes (Table 1). These data emphasize the relatively
large impact of tourism in Palau, Maldives and Seychelles, and would indicate that opportunities
exist to increase receipts in other PIC11s.

Tourism and Government Revenue
18.     Tourism is also a tax base. Fiji changed their tax regime in November 2015, reducing VAT from
15 percent to 9 percent but extending the base to previously zero-rated products including food. The
service turnover tax, which applies directly to hotels and food service, among other areas, was
increased from 5 percent to 10 percent and a new environmental levy of 6 percent was introduced.
The net effect is that the tax on tourism-related turnover has increased from 20 percent to 25 percent.
This coincided with the increase in funding for Tourism Fiji.
19.      For other PICs, tourist related taxes—hotel, departure and service taxes—have enabled
governments to directly benefit from tourism. There are two main direct taxes related to tourism in
Palau, the traveler’s departure tax and the hotel occupancy tax. Both were increased recently in an
effort to contain the number of tourist arrivals and preserve the environment. The share of these two
taxes to total tax revenue has increased from nearly 9 percent in FY2003 to around 15 percent in
FY2013 (IMF 2014).

Employment and Tourism
20.      Tourism is a significant employer in those PIC11s where tourism is a major industry. South
Pacific Tourism Organization (SPTO) estimates indicate the highest levels of employment in Tonga, 15
percent, Samoa, 18 percent, and Palau, 50 percent. According to the IMF (2014), “More than 40
percent of total employment in Palau is occupied in tourism-related activities, including a large
number of foreign workers, who, by comparison, make up around 50 percent of total employment.”
Tourism in Tuvalu employs less than 1 percent of total employment. The Government of Samoa’s 2010

                                                   4
employment survey estimated that tourism’s direct contribution to employment was at 7 percent,
significantly less than the SPTO estimate. Interesting to note was that while males and females were
equally represented as employees in the tourism sector, females dominated the management level
with 54 percent of total management staff while males dominated the supporting staff level with
51 percent of total supporting staff (STA 2015).
                          Table 2. Tourism is an important source of employment

                                    Source: WTTC and SPTO. 2014 figures.

21.    Two of the three Indian Ocean destinations—Maldives, with 32.2 percent, and Seychelles with
22.9 percent—generate a significantly greater proportion of employment through tourism. The
dependence of small-population tourism economies on foreign workers continues to challenge policy-
makers in Maldives and Cook Islands, but also can offer lessons to PIC11s.

Tourism and Poverty Reduction
22.     According to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) (2014), tourism development has
been central to the graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status of the Small Island
Developing Stares (SIDS) of Samoa, Cape Verde and the Maldives in recent years. In Cape Verde, the
poverty rate dropped from 37 percent to 27 percent between 2000 and 2010—a period that saw
tourism increase from 7 percent to 18 percent of GDP and annual arrivals increase from 115,000 to
336,000. Individual islands within the Cape Verde group with the highest tourism Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) also had the lowest poverty rates, at 10 percent and 11 percent, and saw poverty
reductions larger than the national average. Further, households linked to the tourism sector nation-
wide had lower poverty incidence rates, averaging 12 percent (Garcia 2013). The Maldives achieved
even greater poverty reduction during spectacular tourism growth, decreasing poverty rates from 43
percent in 1998 to 15 percent in 2010 (ADB 2015).
23.      However, tourism sector growth does not automatically lead to poverty reduction. In order
to more effectively reduce poverty, tourism growth should provide equal opportunities and be
inclusive. UNWTO and Netherlands Development Organization (SNV) (2010) advocate seven
approaches for poverty reduction through tourism:
a.   Employment of the poor in tourism enterprises;
b.   Supply of goods and services to tourism enterprises by the poor;
c.   Informal selling of goods and services to tourists by the poor;
d.   Developing micro, small or community-based tourism enterprises or joint ventures;
e.   Tax or charge on tourists or enterprises with proceeds benefiting the poor;
f.   Voluntary giving by tourists or enterprises that benefits the poor;
g.   Collateral benefits to the poor from tourism investment and activity.

                                                     5
24.    While some of these approaches can occur outside purposeful interventions, the poverty
reducing effects of tourism can be increased through targeted policies by tourism enterprises,
governments and local destination management groups.

1.3 Tourism Policy
25.     The role of tourism as a driver of economic growth is recognized by all PICs and all have
National Tourism Organizations (NTOs) and a direct interest in the South Pacific Tourist Organisation
(SPTO). It is a major foreign exchange earner and a revenue source through tourism-related taxes.
26.     As one of the region’s main economic drivers, it is a principal area of public policy. All PICs
have a Tourism Minister, although not all see it as a high-ranking portfolio. Samoa is an exception; it
includes tourism as one of five key economic development outcomes in the Strategy for the
Development of Samoa 2012-2016. It recognizes the leading role of tourism in achieving foreign
exchange earnings and sets a target of 5-7 percent annual growth in arrivals. Average annual growth
from 2010 to 2014 was only 0.2 percent. Until recently, the Prime Minister was also Minister for
Tourism. Over the past decade they have created a favorable investment environment, including
concessions for development and the use of Government-controlled land for new hotels.
27.     In 2010 IFC undertook tourism diagnostic reviews of several PICs, using the methodology
developed by IFC Sydney. In Vanuatu, the study found that tourism was housed within a broad
industry portfolio and not specifically recognized within the Government’s medium-term
development strategy. Tourism suffered from a lack of Government resources and inadequate
coordination and prioritization. There was no implementation process for the Vanuatu Tourism
Masterplan 2004-2010 or for the Vanuatu Tourism Action Plan 2008. There was also a lack of
coordination and dialogue with the private sector (IFC 2010).
28.      In Tonga the review found that while tourism was one of only three sectors targeted within
the National Strategic Planning Framework (NSPF) for “promoting sustained private sector led growth,”
in practice tourism was afforded only a moderate level of priority by the Government (IFC 2010).
29.      Similar findings for the Solomon Islands identified an apparent lack of coordination and
prioritization of tourism development across key government agencies, an inadequately resourced
national tourism agency and weak policy and legislative frameworks for tourism (IFC 2009).
30.      Since its establishment in 1993, the PNG Tourism Promotion Authority (PNGTPA) has been the
primary developer and implementer of tourism policy. Current policy was set in 2006 in the Tourism
Master Plan 2007-2017. The principle goal of the plan is to double arrivals every five years. In pursuit
of this, PNGTPA has launched an effective marketing campaign and raised its profile on social media.
PNGTPA has also improved data collection and analysis systems and established a national
accommodation classification and accreditation system. The government also established tax
incentives to promote investment, training and market development. The National Development Bank
has set up a tourism credit facility to provide loans to local start-ups and existing small- and medium-
sized tourism enterprises ranging from a few hundred to nearly half a million USD. By removing the
visa requirement for cruise passengers, reducing pilotage fees and improving infrastructure, PNG
attracted P&O Cruises to begin visiting in 2013 (PNGTPA 2014).
31.     Fiji has provided major assistance to the tourism sector through significant tax concessions,
including the Short Life Investment Plan, which have been a significant driver of new hotels. The Plan
was extended several times and has been a major contributor to the development of international

                                                   6
hotels, which are at the core of Fiji’s tourism growth. Infrastructure support, including the provision
of access roads, has also opened areas for development. Tourism Fiji received USD14 million in
government funding in the 2016 budget, a 27.7 percent increase over 2015.

1.4 Tourism Performance and Attractions
32.      At the global level, international tourism achieved a new record in 2014 with 1.133 billion
arrivals, an increase of 4.3 percent compared to 2013. This was the fifth year of consecutive growth
since the global financial crisis in 2008. International tourism receipts reached US$1,245 billion
worldwide in 2014, up from US$1,197 billion in 2013. Europe remained in 2014 the world’s most
visited region. France, the US, Spain and China are the top most visited countries in the world. Travel
for holidays, recreation and other forms of leisure accounted for just over half of all international
tourist arrivals in 2014. About 14 percent of international tourists reported traveling for business and
professional purposes, and another 27 percent travelled for other reasons such as visiting friends and
relatives (VFR) or religious reasons.
33.    Europe is still the largest source region followed by the Asia Pacific. China has been the top
tourism source market since 2012 and increased their tourism expenditure abroad by 27 percent in
2014 reaching a total of US$165 billion. The other top five largest tourism spenders are the US,
Germany, the UK and Russia. In 2014, about four out of five worldwide arrivals originated from within
the same region (UNWTO 2015).
34.     Tourism plays a large and growing role in the world economy. The World Tourism Organization
(UNWTO) estimates that direct, indirect and induced impacts of tourism generated 10 percent of
global GDP, one in eleven jobs and 30 percent of global services exports. International tourism has
experienced long term growth. From 1995 to 2010 international tourist arrivals saw average annual
growth of 4.1 percent, while for emerging economies the growth rate was 5.7 percent. Emerging
economies also saw their share of international tourist arrivals increase from 32 percent to over 50
percent between 1990 and 2015.

Arrivals Trends in the Pacific
35.     Annual overnight visitor arrivals to Oceania, which also includes primary destinations Australia
and New Zealand, grew on average 0.2 percent for the period 1995-2010, the lowest growth of any of


                                                    7
the 17 regions identified. In contrast, the Caribbean grew at 0.4 percent and North-east Asia, the
fastest growing region, at 4.7 percent. Compared to global average annual growth of 3.9 percent from
2005 to 2014, PIC11 visitor arrivals have grown by 4.5 percent, or close to the UNWTO forecast for
emerging economies 2010-2030.

36.     While long-term growth is positive for PIC11s, performance varies between countries and
short-term decreases have resulted from political instabilities, natural disasters and global market
conditions. The average annual growth rate for the five top destinations from 1995 to 2014 was 5.5
percent, while the other six only averaged 2.5 percent. PNG saw the strongest growth over the period
at 8.5 percent, largely due to growth in the natural resources sector. Fiji’s dramatic drop in arrivals in
2000 was a result of instability following a coup, which led to travel advisories imposed in origin
markets. However, Fiji was able to rebound strongly by 2005 through government and private sector
support for a series of marketing campaigns, as well as deep airfare and accommodation discounts
once order was restored. Another coup in 2006 led to further restrictions by source markets and the
temporary diversion of travelers to other destinations.
37.      Natural disasters have also affected short-term patterns. The Samoa tsunami of 2009 affected
arrivals for three years during the rebuilding process. Cyclone Pam, which hit Vanuatu in 2015, has
damaged many accommodation properties and will affect 2015-2016 visitor arrivals. Data available
for 2015 shows a contraction of approximately 17 percent. Climate change may be increasing the
frequency and intensity of tropical storms in the region, and rising sea levels will threaten coastal
communities and tourism products.
38.     Global market conditions have both positive and negative effects on arrivals. Fiji has been
negatively affected by the high Australian dollar, which diverted some of this major market to
alternative destinations. Palau, the primary driver of regional growth in 2014, has experienced a rapid
increase in arrivals from China. For PNG, the increase in arrivals is largely due to high business and
worker arrivals—65 percent in 2014—linked to major natural resource projects. There has been a
decline since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis in the numbers of Europeans—and in some markets
North Americans—visiting the PICs.

Performance of Regional and Global Competitors
39.      Visitor numbers to most PIC11s have been growing, whereas other competing Pacific regional
small island states Guam, French Polynesia and New Caledonia have been flat or in long-term decline.

                                                                                                          8
In 2014 arrivals to the PIC11 totaled 1.37 million, driven by the five top countries, with Fiji generating
50 percent of total PIC11 arrivals (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Visitor numbers to most PICs have been growing, while competing pacific island states have been flat
                                           or in long-term decline

40.      PIC11s compete with a number of destinations in their main markets. Australian outbound
travelers to Bali in 2014 exceeded one million, compared to 350,000 to Fiji. The strong Australian
dollar, resulting from the now-fading mining boom, made travel to North America and Europe more
viable alternatives. The three top Indian Ocean destinations, Maldives, Mauritius and Seychelles, are
major destinations for China, Southeast Asia and Europe. Of the regional competitors—French
Polynesia, New Caledonia, Cook Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Niue and Northern Marianas—the
Cook Islands compete effectively with their Polynesian neighbors, but arrivals have been static for the
last three years, while the French territories have been declining in importance.

Arrivals Trends for PICs
41.     While the majority of PIC11s are dependent on Australia and New Zealand as their main
generating markets there are changes occurring in other markets. A detailed analysis of arrivals for
each PIC is shown at Appendix 1. The key characteristics of demand are summarized below.

Fiji
42.      International visitors traveling for a holiday represent over 75 percent of all international
arrivals to Fiji. Australians have consistently provided 50 percent of visitor arrivals in Fiji over the past
five years. The New Zealand share of the Fiji market has increased from 15 percent in 2010 to 18
percent in 2014. The US market to Fiji is particularly strong, and is attracted by the range of high-end
resorts and secluded smaller luxury properties, particularly in the northwestern islands of Fiji. There
have been significant falls in the volume of UK and European visitors since the Global Financial Crisis.
Japanese visitor numbers began falling dramatically in the late 1990s. Chinese visitors have been
increasing and direct charter flights are now operating at selected periods of the year. There are strong
seasonal patterns of visitor arrivals to Fiji, with Australian and New Zealand arrivals peaking in the
southern winter months through to September, while northern hemisphere markets primarily arrive
in the northern winter. This new year-round pattern has significantly improved the financial viability



                                                      9
of the Fiji tourist industry, and operators are using Chinese New Year as a prime opportunity to access
that market.

Vanuatu
43.      Vanuatu shares the pattern of dependence on the Australian market—50 percent of all
arrivals—but the pattern of Australian arrivals is static. Over 80 percent of overnight visitors in 2013
were on holiday. It is a major cruise destination with cruise visitors outnumbering overnight visitors
by more than 2 to 1 and increasing by 15 percent annually. The introduction of low cost carriers in
2005 has opened the market to Australia and New Zealand packaged visitors, and there is a range of
resorts primarily on the principal island of Efate. Arrivals from New Zealand have increased steadily,
averaging 8.1 percent annual growth 2010-2014. Arrivals from Europe have also seen steady growth,
averaging 3.4 percent a year over the same period. Vanuatu, as a nearby Francophone country, has
significant numbers of visitors from New Caledonia. While arrivals from China are still small in
comparison, they have increased over 500 percent from 2011 to 2014.

Palau
44.     The quality of the dive experience in Palau generates visitors from across the globe and Palau
has one of most diverse source markets of all PIC11s. 95 percent of visitors are on a holiday. China,
China Taiwan, Japan and Korea are the largest generating markets, with the first three generating
30,000 to 40,000 arrivals each and Korea nearly 15,000 arrivals. The introduction of charter flights
from China has driven rapid growth over the past two years. There have been fluctuations in total
annual arrivals, but the Chinese market grew exponentially in 2014 and the first months of 2015, with
year on year growth rates of over 300 percent in the second quarter of 2015, creating significant
pressures on facilities and natural attractions and impacting on visitors from other established origin
markets.

Samoa
45.      Samoa has a high proportion of VFR arrivals—up to half of visitors from New Zealand, Australia
and the US (American Samoa and continental). New Zealand is the dominant market to Samoa,
generating 41.8 percent of arrivals in 2014, but there is consistent visitor traffic from American Samoa
(14.0 percent) as Apia provides a transfer point to Australia and New Zealand. Australia has become
the second most important market, generated by lower cost carrier direct flights and competitive
pricing as well as direct Government support. However, the withdrawal of direct flights to the US has
impacted the development of long haul markets. Connectivity between Polynesian PICs is limited, with
Fiji and New Zealand as the airline hubs for PIC visitors. The strong influence of VFR is a major driver
of arrivals. Visitors from the US include both holiday and VFR.

Papua New Guinea
46.    In 2014, only 26.5 percent of arrivals were on holiday, compared with 34.8 percent on
business and 30.4 percent for employment. The high proportion of business and short-term
employment arrivals to Papua New Guinea includes a wide spectrum of nationalities. Australians
dominate, both on holiday and business, while Philippines arrivals are primarily contract workers.
47.        When looking only at holiday visitors, a different pattern emerges. While Australia still ranks
first, it is then followed by the US, the UK, Germany and Indonesia. The Australian holiday market has
increased since 2005 when the PNG Tourism Promotion Authority (PNGTPA) office opened in Sydney.
The close relationship between the two countries, the short distance and the frequency of flights


                                                   10
make PNG a convenient destination for Australians. In 2011, PNG received 3,452 US holiday travelers
and by 2014 this had increased to 6,233. Marketing efforts in the US have helped create awareness
and the unique natural and cultural attractions receive strong interest from the US niche markets.
Australian holiday arrivals are probably affected by a restrictive visa regime, although this is now being
modified.
48.      Holiday arrivals from Europe have increased sharply over the last years as well. Arrivals from
the UK increased from 1,679 in 2001 to 3,087 in 2014. Arrivals from Germany increased from 1,626
(2011) to 2,572 (2014). PNGTPA opened an office in London in 2013 and arrivals from the UK increased
by 35 percent since. In 2010, Japan was the third largest market (2,350 holiday arrivals) for PNG but
arrivals have dropped since then. This has been partly caused by a decline in the number of flights to
Tokyo and a change in Japanese travel patterns. Holiday arrivals from China are low, 916 arrivals in
2014, despite PNG having “Approved Destination Status” since 2006.

Tonga
49.      Tonga depends on New Zealand as its principal source of visitors, which includes a significant
proportion of VFR, which is also an important factor in arrivals from the US and Australia. In 2013, 42
percent of arrivals stated they were visiting friends and relatives, but the actual proportion is probably
higher. Northern Europe visitors have continued to decline, a pattern shared by other PICs. New
Zealand, which is frequently a shared destination with PICs, also experienced a significant decline in
Northern Europe in the period following the Global Financial Crisis. There are also low numbers of
visitors from other PICs, constrained by lack of transport links. Cruise arrivals have become
increasingly important since 2008, bringing 13,733 visitors during 2014.

Solomon Islands
50.      Australia dominates arrivals into the Solomon Islands in every segment. Business and
Conference arrivals are the largest share of all visitors with 37 percent, and holiday arrivals make up
27 percent, followed by 13 percent for VFR. However, the diversity of diving and natural experiences
draws a much wider market and, although numbers are small, European visitors are increasing. Inter-
PIC traffic among the Melanesian PICs is much greater than in Polynesia, with better linkages and
shorter distances. Australia has been operating a peacekeeping operation in the Solomon Islands for
more than ten years, which generates visitor and service personnel arrivals.

Federated States of Micronesia
51.      The US is FSM’s largest source market, for total arrivals and for all segments. Unfortunately,
FSM does not distinguish between holiday and VFR segments within their ‘Tourism & Visitors’ purpose
of arrival, which accounts for 39 percent of the total. Japan is the second largest contributor to this
category of arrivals, followed by Europe. Business and Employment arrivals make up 15 percent.

Republic of the Marshall Islands
52.     Like Micronesia, RMI’s largest source markets are the US and Japan. However, just 20 percent
of the 4,000-5,000 annual arrivals are on a holiday.

Kiribati
53.      With two distinct destinations, the capital Tarawa and Kiritimati (Christmas Island), Kiribati
has two distinct source markets. Australia is the largest source for Tarawa, which reflects the high
shares of business and VFR arrivals, 35 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Holiday visitors make up


                                                   11
75 percent of arrivals to Kiritimati and the US is the largest source market, accounting for over 40
percent of arrivals.

Tourism Assets and Attractions in PICs
54.     Fiji is the aviation hub for the South Pacific and the entry point for long-haul passengers
traveling to many other Pacific destinations. This role has increased as a result of changes in
connectivity amongst other PICs. It is the region’s administrative center, with international
organizations and regional institutions, and a strong meetings and business base. Fiji has been the
leading destination in the Pacific, with a market attracted by beaches, coastal resort products, and
small island resorts that provide the signature destination experience. The visitor activity base
includes diving, surfing, cruising, fishing, touring, cultural tourism and eco-tourism, but visitor surveys
show an emphasis on beach and water activities. There are also strong wedding and honeymoon
markets. Fiji is a major cruise destination with 87,641 cruise visitors in 2014, and there are current
studies to base a large cruise vessel in Fiji. The sun, sand and sea experience attracts young travelers
and there is a strong backpacker market.
55.     Vanuatu has strong soft adventure products, an active volcano and a rich culture attracting
mostly younger people. The destination has a high number of repeat visitors at 29 percent although
recent research by IFC suggests this could be as high as 40 percent. Much of Vanuatu remains
undeveloped for tourism and offers considerable potential, both for cultural and environmental
experiences, as well as beach and dive opportunities.
56.     Palau, the closest PIC to Asia, has developed a significant tourist industry based on beaches,
and the exploration of its superb marine environment through swimming/snorkeling and diving.
Shopping is also favorite activity particularly among Asian visitors. Many other types of natural,
cultural and adventure activities are undeveloped for tourism. As one of the world’s leading dive
destinations it already faces sustainability challenges with overcrowding on sensitive sites. The visitor
experience in Palau is of exceptional quality but finite.
57.      In Samoa, holiday visitor demand is primarily for beach and marine activities, with a beach
fale (traditional hut) product providing a unique experience. The cultural assets of Samoa complement
the beach product, but Samoa is still under-developed as a tourist destination.
58.      PNG has the most diverse visitor experience of any PIC, with world-class diving, surfing, rich
cultural experiences, major walking tracks, nature and adventure products, as well as World War II
historical sites. But leisure tourism is a minor contributor to visitor arrivals. PNG is diversifying its
product, opening additional airports to tourism and developing a cruise product that captures the
variety of its island and river destinations. PNG has the greatest potential of any PIC through a range
of niche markets, like bird watching and walking, but distance, visitor security and pricing remain
barriers to growth.
59.     Tonga has a strong culture, historic sites, surfing and an outstanding yachting environment in
the islands of Vava’u. It is one of only three places in the world where swimming with whales is
permitted. Internal transport issues have diminished the scale of diving and sailing markets, but Tonga
has potential that could be realized with improved access and products more closely aligned to market
expectations.
60.     Solomon Islands have outstanding dive and World War II historic sites, and a culture
differentiated from other PICs. The chain of islands has potential for tourism, but is restricted by

                                                    12
       access. The range of nature experiences provides an opportunity for eco-tourism, but facilities are
       limited. A 2014 visitor survey showed swimming/snorkeling most popular with 38 percent taking part,
       followed by shopping at 31 percent, then sightseeing/cultural tours at 30 percent. Visiting war relics
       at 22 percent and diving at 20 percent were the other main activities.
       61.     The four remaining PIC11 countries, FSM, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Kiribati, have less
       developed tourism assets. FSM has, at Chuuk, one of the world’s leading wreck dive sites, and other
       nature-based experiences like sport fishing and surfing are popular among visitors. Tuvalu, a country
       at serious risk from the effects of climate change, has been unable to capitalize on its beach and
       marine assets. Only 25 percent of the 1,232 arrivals in 2011 were on holiday. The Marshall Islands has
       diving potential yet to be realized, including Bikini Atoll where the former testing site has become a
       world-class wreck diving site. Surfing and sport fishing are other potential activities.
       62.       Kiribati has different assets at its two main destinations. Kiritimati (Christmas Island) has a
       major market from the US for sport fishing, with 65 percent of arrivals reporting that as the purpose
       for visiting. On Tarawa, sightseeing and cultural tours are most popular, reflecting the large shares of
       business and VFR visitors. Its Phoenix Islands Marine Reserve is the world’s largest, but has yet to
       attract significant visitors.
       63.    Table 4 below summarizes the main activities undertaken by tourists in each of the 11 PICs.
       Some countries might have potential to develop activities that are not being offered or do not have
       wide appeal.
                                   Table 4. The PIC11 offer a wide range of tourist activities

       Accommodation in PICs
       64.       The PIC11 countries are significantly underrepresented in international brand name hotels.
       This is largely due to the very small average size of hotels in the region. Research by IFC shows that

                                                                13
there are fewer than 60 hotels in the PIC11 with more than 100 rooms and less than 60% of these
carry an international brand. In terms of large international hotel groups Accor (France), Starwood
(US) and InterContinental Hotel Group (UK) dominate the region with 60% of the branded properties.
The absence of a critical mass of international brand names limits recognition in international markets.
65.     In Fiji, there has been major international investment—supported by local institutions—over
the period 1970-1990, with a second wave of international investment 2000-2010. As a result there is
a strong inventory of high standard resorts, large and small, independently run and internationally
branded, as well as a depth of mid-range and budget accommodations, both coastal and urban,
catering to a wide variety of travelers. There is increasing development of timeshares and second
homes as part of integrated resort developments, ensuring a return visitor market. International hotel
chains have made major commitments to Fiji, which has strengthened market perceptions particularly
in North America. Fiji has a number of small high-end resorts that attract high-net-worth individuals,
many located on private islands. 75 percent of rooms available are located on the largest island of Viti
Levu.
66.      The majority of hotels in Vanuatu are located in Port Vila. There are a few larger hotels
catering to the demands of the young Australian travelers. There are two internationally branded
hotels, a Holiday Inn and a Warwick Hotel. In Samoa, most resorts are small and family operated,
although Starwood Hotels now manage the largest resort. For Solomon Islands, Honiara has
international hotels, but there are no major destination experiences within the outer islands. Palau
offers a number of hotels catering to the international dive market. There are three large hotels (each
over 160 rooms) but only one international brand present: Nikko Hotels’ International’s Palau Royal
Resort. There are plans to build the country’s largest hotel—the 400-room Palau Pacific Star Resort—
mainly to cater to the Chinese market. Tonga does not have any internationally branded hotels, but
there are some boutique resorts offering a thatched-roof beach bungalow experience.
67.      There has been some growth in breadth and depth of accommodation offerings in PNG over
the last few years. The luxury segment is still under represented. However, there are some boutique
resorts in the main tourist areas as well as niche products such as village home stays. Internationally
branded hotels in PNG are limited to the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza.
68.     Marshall Islands, Kiribati, FSM and Tuvalu have a limited number of small hotels and B&Bs
offering basic facilities. Marshall Islands also has one 149-room resort formerly operated by Outrigger
Hotels of Hawaii.

Cruise Tourism
69.     The cruising industry brings hundreds of thousands of visitors—many for the first time—and
millions in revenue to the Pacific every year. Cruising offers visitors opportunities to affordably visit
multiple islands in a single vacation and to travel easily between countries. It also opens up
destinations that lack tourism infrastructure or are difficult to access by air or land. This allows the
benefits of tourism to reach isolated communities.
70.     The entire South Pacific region, which includes PNG, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa,
Tonga, and non-member states New Caledonia, French Polynesia, American Samoa and Cook Islands,
received 413,126 cruise passengers from the two top source markets of Australia and New Zealand in
2014 (CLIA Australasia 2014). A few thousand additional arrivals come from trans-Pacific and Round-
the-World cruises originating in North America, Europe and Asia, but precise numbers were not


                                                   14
available. Fiji, PNG, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu received 350,197 cruise passengers in 2014, with the
greatest share going to Vanuatu (Figure 4). Unfortunately, not all member countries track cruise
arrivals. Solomon Islands likely received 3,000 visitors, based on 2014 scheduled port calls. Palau, FSM,
Kiribati and RMI each likely saw less than 1,000 arrivals from trans-Pacific and Round-the-World
cruises.

1.5 Source Market Trends
71.      Over the past decade there has been a major change in travel patterns. China has emerged as
a global force in world tourism, with spending increasing 27 percent year on year and expenditure per
capita lower than any other major travel-generating nation.

Arabia, Norway, Sweden, Spain, India, China Taiwan, the Philippines, Qatar, Thailand, the Czech
Republic and Colombia. China now generates 13 percent of global tourism receipts. International
tourism expenditures by the US increased by 6 percent and Germany by just 1 percent (UNWTO 2015).
Australia’s high travel expenditure per capita reflects that the majority of preferred destinations
involve medium or long haul travel, which encourages longer stays.

73.     The propensity to travel (international outbound as a proportion of total population), gauges
the relative importance of travel within the top tourism spending countries. Australia, the US, Russia
and Japan have potential to continue to grow as other outbound markets have. The potential of China,
however, is the opportunity that can change global tourism. Doubling propensity to 0.14 would add
nearly 100 million new tourists. The high travel propensities of Germany and the UK make these
markets with long-term potential.

PIC11 Source Markets
74.     In the past decade the global financial crisis, the UK travel tax, reductions in flights to the US
and Japan, as well as the rise of China have created shifts in the pattern of arrivals in the Pacific. Inter-
island connectivity has declined, there have been major, well reported natural disasters and global
competition has intensified. Long haul markets have declined in importance and PICs have become
increasingly dependent on Pacific Rim markets.

75.     Two thirds of tourists are visitors from Australia and New Zealand. The US, China, Japan and
Europe are relatively small markets, but still very important as they have the potential to generate
much more growth in arrivals than Australia and New Zealand. Outbound travelers from the US are

1.6 Growth potential for tourism in PICs
76.      The UNWTO expects the number of international tourist arrivals worldwide to increase by an
average of 3.9 percent a year over the period 2005 to 2030. International tourist arrivals worldwide
are expected to reach 1.4 billion by 2020 and 1.8 billion by the year 2030. Over the twenty years 2010-
2030 UNWTO forecasts emerging economies annual tourism growth, at 4.4 percent, will be double
that of advanced economies (UNWTO 2011). Asia and the Pacific will gain most of the new arrivals
over that period. Arrivals in Oceania (including Australia and New Zealand) are expected to grow at
the slower rate of 2.4 percent, of which 2.9 percent between 2010 and 2020 and 2.0 percent between
2020 and 2030. International arrivals in Oceania are expected to increase from 11.6 million in 2010 to
19 million in 2030. Australia will receive the largest share of this market.

Tourism growth in PICs
77.      Total arrivals in the 11 PICs in 2014 are estimated at 1.375 million. Recent growth in PICs has
been 5.0 percent annually, driven by the rapid growth of Chinese visitors to Palau and strong growth
in visitors to Fiji in 2014 and 2015. Chinese visitors to PIC 11 have grown at 27 percent annually since
2010. While this strong growth will not continue indefinitely, it can be expected that China will
become a significant market for PICs in the future.
78.     UNWTO projections for future regional demand for travel tend to aggregate effects across
several markets. This is also true in the case of the PICs as they are included in the Oceania category
along with markets with significantly different behavior such as Australia and New Zealand.
Historically the PICS have performed closer to the global growth rate for visitor arrivals than for that
of Oceania. In addition the UNWTO forecasts were carried out shortly after the GFC and before the
recent rapid discovery of the Pacific by China and India. Thus the UNWTO forecasts may require more
close scrutiny.
79.    Further analysis of demand for travel to the PICs from the key regional sources of visitors
shows that long term average growth rates have been in decline as shown in the table below.

80.     Detailed country source data for each region is only available up to 2013, which is before the
rapid expansion of Chinese travel to Palau and Fiji. While travel from these two markets alone has

                                                     18
the potential to dramatically impact the long-term trends, historic patterns cannot be ignored in the
development of possible scenarios for long-term growth in demand.
81.      Annual growth of 3 percent across the 11 PICs, based on total arrivals of 1.375 million in 2014,
would result in 1.9 million visitors in 2025 and effectively double total arrivals by 2040, to 3.0 million.
This growth rate is achievable and is likely to be exceeded if market changes occur. This is greater than
the UNWTO predicted growth of 2.9 percent through to 2020, falling to 2 percent thereafter and is
closer to the long term projections for emerging markets as a whole. Current indications are that the
UNWTO growth rate is conservative.

                                                                                                                      2039
                                                                                                                        2040
                                                                     3% per annum

82.      The foregoing analysis of individual source markets and the trends above suggest that in order
to ensure long-term, balanced and manageable visitor growth, the Pacific will need to work on several
fronts to maintain its strong position in the short haul markets of Australia and New Zealand, capture
a share of the emerging Asian markets while at the same time significantly improve penetration into
the traditional, but slower growth long haul markets of Europe and North America.
83.     As different Pacific island destinations are driven by different origin markets, each with their
own growth patterns and varying buyer behavior, increased long term growth will require more
strategic evaluation of segmented opportunities in the key origin markets, improved differentiation
of the offer across the individual PIC11s and a careful rebalancing of long haul versus regional market
development strategies.
84.     While earnings from tourism should follow growth in arrivals, there is evidence that this is not
always the case, particularly where high volume markets can reduce earnings per visitor and turn
away higher yielding markets such as reported by tourism authorities in Palau and the Maldives.
Managing growth in the Pacific will require careful balancing of high growth markets and higher
yielding markets at the same time.
85.      Under the assumption of long-term visitor growth of 3 percent, tourism will continue to be
important to PIC11 economies. However, long-term growth at this level will not generate significant
changes in economic performance of the PIC11s. For this, it will be necessary to significantly expand
demand in selected segments. As is shown in the following section, significant growth in visitor
arrivals above trend is possible.



                                                                        19
2 Successful Tourism Transformations
86.      The Maldives and the Seychelles are two examples of remote small island states, which have
developed the tourism sector through transformative interventions. Both countries have adjusted
their strategies, and are now attracting visitors from the new markets, especially Chinese visitors.

2.1 Maldives: From least developed to middle income through
    tourism
87.      The Maldives is made up of low-lying coral islands scattered across the Indian Ocean, located
just north of the equator and southwest of the Indian peninsula, with about 402,071 in resident
population (National Bureau of Statistics 2015). Stretching for more than 800 kilometers from north
to south and covering a total area of 90,000 square kilometers, the Maldivian Archipelago comprises
a total of 1,192 coral islands—of which only about 290 are inhabited—formed around a double chain
of 26 atolls that are formally grouped into 20 administrative atoll groups (JLL Hotels & Hospitality
Group 2014). The history of tourism dates back to 1972 when the first resort opened. Since then, the
government has made tourism a main priority and arrivals have grown substantially. The sector has
become the largest economic activity and a main source of foreign exchange earnings.
88.      While a premium destination, the country presents an attractive value proposal and visitors
enjoy a high level of privacy, secluded beaches and excellent service and food—an all-round high-
quality offering. The quiet monsoon season offers year-round potential, and the country´s offering is
largely about beach, sun, water sports, restaurants and relaxation. Each resort is on its own island, a
policy dubbed “one island, one resort,” which showcases some of the world’s best over-water villas,
innovative resort features and first-class spa facilities. Resorts have been creative in building a truly
unique offering including facilities such as underwater restaurants and spa treatment rooms,
underground wine cellars, over water villas with pools, treetop dining venues, observatories and more.
89.     This prestigious image of the Maldives has sustained solid demand from European source
markets, and more recently from China and other Asian countries. According to information from
surveys, tourism has grown catering to three main segments that constituted more than 90 percent
of demand: i) “beach relaxers” made up mostly of couples and family groups; ii)
honeymooners/anniversary celebrants; and iii) divers and other specialist water sports. Additional
residual segments include business and MICE, cruise ship tourism and free and independent travelers
(Ministry of Tourism, Arts & Culture 2013).
90.      While the upper end of the resort market has been the staple of Maldives tourism, the country
is attempting to grow the “affordable luxury” segment—high quality, though not necessarily 5-star
service, priced between US$150-300—in order to attract more visitors from European and Asian
markets, including would-be repeat visitors. The Government is also promoting locally-run
guesthouses, as a way to increase involvement of SMEs in the accommodation sector, and live-aboard
vessels, seen as a growth area and a natural link for the economic integration of less developed islands.
91.      Tourism has helped transform the Maldives from one of the poorest countries in the world in
the 1980’s to a middle-income country in 2011. The relative role of tourism in the economy has
declined since its peak of 33.3 percent of economic output in 2000 due to a diversifying economy.
Tourism now stands at 25.3 percent of the estimated 2014 economic output (National Bureau of
Statistics 2015). However, when including both direct and indirect effects of tourism spending, it
accounts for nearly three quarters of output. The difference between direct and indirect GDP

                                                  20
contributions demonstrates how tourism is a cross-sectoral industry, and the primary driver of the
economy—it serves as a link and stimulus to most sectors of the economy such as transport,
construction, trade and financial services (MOTAC 2013).

Transformation to a High-End Destination
92.      The Tourism Act of 1979 set the foundation for tourism development. This legislative act
defined the pillars for a competitive investment climate including: no foreign exchange restrictions,
the possibility of legally backed investment guarantees, unrestricted repatriation of earnings and
capital proceeds, and a right to 100 percent foreign ownership. The Maldives has also maintained a
peg with the US Dollar in some form since 1981 1, thus adding to investment certainty.
93.       Following the opening of the first resort in 1972, tourism developed mostly through individual,
uncoordinated initiatives until the advent of the First Tourism Master Plan (FTMP) in 1983. The FTMP
laid the foundation for sustainable development of tourism, emphasized environmental protection
and called for integration of tourism into the social and economic development of the country. Policies
set out in the FTMP limited built-up space on resorts, required building heights to be compatible with
the natural vegetation of the islands and included measures for environment and reef protection that
are still adhered to in current resort development. Rules introduced also set guidelines for the quality
of services and facilities provided to tourists (Kundur 2012). The FTMP established the “one island one
resort” principle and limited the built-up area of a resort to 20 percent of the total land area of an
island. This regulation contributed to creating peaceful and quiet environments on resort islands—
now a key feature of the Maldives´ exclusive tourism brand and a trademark of the luxury resorts
there.
94.       Under these rules, resort development expanded and 16 resorts were built from 1989 to 1997.
The Second Tourism Master Plan, covering 1996 to 2005, sought to expand and develop tourism into
more regions across the country, with the aim of decentralizing tourism from the central atoll of Male’
and spreading the benefits of tourism among more regions, particularly the southern and northern
atolls. It was during this phase that international resort brands began to establish themselves in the
Maldives. Resorts based on a spa concept were also launched with the aim of introducing higher
quality tourism.
95.     As tourism grew, the original 1979 Tourism Act was amended to better address new realities.
It now supports regulations on the lease of islands or land for resorts, hotels and marinas, the
development of guesthouses, and the management of these facilities. In 2006, 35 islands were
designated for tourism development under a competitive bidding process where islands are leased
from the government on fixed-term contracts for a period of up to 50 years. The new system also
allowed developers to secure plots on a sublease model, allowing more than one developer per island
on inhabited islands—an attempt to increase local investor participation and link tourism benefits
more closely to communities. The Third Tourism Master Plan (2007-2011) aimed to place tourism
within a broader sustainable development framework.

 Since a devaluation in April 2011, Maldives has retained a de facto stabilized exchange rate regime. Although the band is
wide at 20 percent either side of Maldivian rufiyaa (Rf) 12.85 per dollar, the exchange rate has remained at the weakest
end of the band (Rf 15.42 per dollar) and operates like a de facto peg.

                                                            21
96.       As a result, tourism foreign direct investment expanded significantly and over 100 islands have
been developed as tourist resorts, with a total capacity of some 31,569 beds 2 as of 2014. The Fourth
Tourism Master Plan (2013-2017) seeks to maintain the Maldives’ position in the market, manage
environmental and conservation issues and engage more Maldivians in a tourism career. During the
initial tourism master plans, resorts and hotels grew in concentration around Male’ (the capital and
main transport hub) due to a pragmatic approach by private investors seeking to develop around
existing infrastructure. The challenge remains creating secondary transport hubs in northern and
southern atolls, currently one of the priorities.
97.     Accessibility also played a key role. The Maldives has bilateral air service agreements with 29
countries (Civil Aviation Authority 2016) and is very welcoming and even inviting to foreign airlines,
both charter and regular schedule services. In addition, the Maldives has a liberal visa policy, not
requiring pre-arrival visas for any nationality, provided that inbound visitors can present a valid
passport and proof of means of stay or a hotel reservation.
98.      Investments in transportation infrastructure are also part of the success story, including
improvements to the primary international airport, Ibrahim Nasir, near the capital Male’, and
development of three new international airports: Hanimaadhoo in the north, Gan in the south, and
Maamigili in the center of the country, a privately-owned airport home to the carrier FlyMe. Also, new
domestic airports are being developed to further the smooth transfer of tourists to far-away resorts.
The Maldives also boasts the world’s largest seaplane fleet serving the tourism industry with over 40
aircraft, a major factor in accessing more distant, underdeveloped and secluded atolls.

Attracting Non-Traditional Source Markets
99.      The main pre-conditions for growth in arrivals from non-traditional source markets are the
maintenance of a solid quality brand and ease of access. Introducing new air routes and increasing
capacity on existing routes can facilitate rapid growth in arrivals. The Maldives is served by 32 air
carriers, compared to other destinations in the Indian Ocean such as Mauritius with 19 air carriers and
Seychelles with 7 air carriers.
100. In 2010, a special decree of the President established the Maldives Marketing & Public
Relations Corporation (MMPRC) to carry out all promotional activities and branding. The marketing
budget in 2012 from the government was US$4 million. Private sector members pay an annual
enrollment fee of US$1,000 plus US$25 per bed for resort operators. This amounted to approximately
US$500,000 in 2012.
101. In terms of developing China as a key emerging and then a leading source market, access and
targeted marketing proved critical. While direct flights from Mainland China to the Maldives were rare
in the past, there are now direct flights from seven cities on five airlines. Mega Maldives Airlines, a
US-Maldives private joint venture carrier setup exclusively to cater to Chinese tourists, began flying
regular charter flights in 2011 to Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing. In 2015, Xian and Changsha were
added and plans have been revealed to add a route to Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning
province. Maldivian Airlines also introduced a once-weekly flight from Wuhan that began in June 2014
(Haveeru Online 2016).

 Per type of accommodation, 23,917 beds were in resort/marinas, 1,704 in hotels, 3,209 in guesthouses and 2,739 in live-
aboard safari vessels.

                                                           22
102. The marketing strategy of the MMPRC for China has been based on a solid online presence
featuring ticket giveaways and fare discounts via social media, in response to the fact that 70 percent
of bookings in China are made online. Marketing to the travel industry has been through participation
in trade fairs in China. Specifically, Maldives has been represented at the China Outbound Travel &
Tourism Market (COTTM) held in Beijing—one of the country’s leading outbound travel exhibitions.
The MMPRC together with 62 representatives from 30 Maldives tourism companies participated in
the COTTM 2015 aiming to boost promotion of the Maldives to China’s outbound tour operators.

Tourism Performance
103. International arrivals have increased from 315,000 in 1995 to 1,204,857 in 2014. Arrivals
dropped in 2005 due to effects of the Indian Ocean tsunami and in 2009 due to the global financial
crisis. While other high-end destinations in the Caribbean were suffering long after 2009, the Maldives
was able to diversify away from the traditional European market and tap into other Asian source
markets. Arrivals quickly recovered in 2010 and reached a new milestone in 2013 of over 1 million
total international visitors.
104. While visitors from Europe represented 70 percent of all arrivals in 2009, this share dropped
to 43.9 percent by 2014. In contrast, Asia and the Pacific source markets showed substantial growth—
arrivals from these markets grew at an average rate of 22 percent in 2013, and market share increased
from 23 percent in 2008 to 48.9 percent in 2014.
105. The Maldives receives higher numbers of arrivals from October to April and lower volumes
during the monsoon season from June to August. This is mostly due to Europeans preferring to visit
during their winter. Yet, with the growing significance of arrivals from Asia and especially from China,
the Maldives is experiencing less seasonality—Chinese arrivals are strong from July to October. In
addition, Chinese arrivals are highest in February due to the Chinese New Year holidays. However,
Chinese and Indian tourists favor a shorter than average length of stay 3, which has led to an overall
decrease in the average duration of stay—from 7.6 days in 2011 to 6.1 in 2014. Overall occupancy
rates have nonetheless remained robust over the past five years, even registering an increase from
69.5 percent in 2010 to 74.3 in 2014.

 The Maldives Visitor Survey of 2015 shows that Asian tourists, especially Chinese and Indians, stay for a period of 3 to 4
days, while European visitors tend to stay longer with an average of 7 to 11 days.

106. Tourism receipts have shown a similar upward trend. While the Maldives received US$211
million in tourism receipts in 1995, they increased to US$2,645 million in 2014. These figures may be
however underestimated as the official methodology is based on extrapolations from tax revenue and
does not capture additional expenditures along the value chain. The IMF (2015) estimates that annual
tourism revenues could be as high as US$4 billion based on a survey of spending habits approach and
an additional 10 percent higher based on a Balance of Payments approach. According to a Maldives
Visitor Survey, 32 percent of respondents spend US$1,000 to 5,000 for their holiday; an additional 30
percent spend US$5,000 to 10,000. Russian and Chinese visitors spend the most per visit. Further, 90
percent of Chinese arrivals to the Maldives were first time visitors and their main purpose of visit was
rest and relaxation (Ministry of Tourism 2015).

Growth of China
107. Arrivals from China have seen a remarkable evolution (Figure 9). It has become the top source
market to the Maldives since 2010, further strengthening its position in recent years. In 2014, China’s
363,626 arrivals represented 30.2 percent of total market share, considerably more than second and
third place source markets Germany with 8.2 percent and the United Kingdom with 7.4 percent. The
strongest growth rate was from 2010 to 2013. Since 2014, Chinese arrivals are showing signs of a
slowdown.

108. While China’s volume and share of arrivals continued to increase in 2014—by 9.6 percent and
0.7 percent, respectfully—these are the smallest gains since 2006. Considering that overall Chinese
outbound tourism still showed robust growth of 12 percent in 2015 (Travel China Guide 2016), the
driving factor for this slowdown appears to be associated with heightened competition. The five
destinations identified in a Visitor Survey as the main competitors to the Maldives—Seychelles,
Thailand, Mauritius, Indonesia, Fiji—have seen robust growth rates, some in the double digits, above
the global average of 11 percent in the two-year period 2009-2011. Thailand especially has shown
dynamic growth in both the mass-market resort segment in Phuket and in some high-end resort
destinations like Koh Samui (MOTAC 2013).

109. The seasonal pattern in Chinese arrivals over the last five years is fairly constant (Figure 10);
arrivals increase during February—except in 2012—with Chinese New Year holidays, and then peak
during July. The fewest arrivals are typically during March, then decreasing again towards the end of
the year. Provisional numbers for the first three quarters of 2015 show continued growth, although
at a slower rate, just 2 percent year-on-year growth for the third quarter of 2015 (Ministry of Tourism
2015).

Impact of Tourism
110. Tourism is the largest contributor to the Maldives economy. According to Maldives
Government figures, tourism’s direct contribution to GDP was 25.3 percent in 2014 and has been 25
percent since 2010. The next largest sector, Transport and Communication, accounts for 17.6 percent.
Tourism spending has increased from US$1.9 billion in 2011 to US$2.6 billion in 2014. However,
tourism’s share of GDP has gradually declined from one-third of the total since the early 2000s as the
Maldives economy has diversified (National Bureau of Statistics 2015). Adding the estimated indirect


                                                   25
effects of tourism within the economy increases tourism’s contribution to 75 percent of GDP (IMF
2015).
111. Tourism is also the largest contributor to government revenue. The share of tourism revenue
to total government revenue has increased significantly, from 26.9 percent in 2009 to 39.8 percent in
2014. Nearly two-thirds of tourism revenue is from taxes on tourism goods and services, while a
quarter is from land rent (Ministry of Tourism 2015).
112. The impact of tourism on the labor market is complex in Maldives, due to the large number
of foreign workers involved. The Accommodation and Food sector is the largest employer, with over
20 percent of workers. Resort workers alone account for a greater share of employment than
manufacturing, the second largest sector. While the unemployment rate is low at 5.2 percent and has
improved from 5.5 percent in 2006, 29 percent of all workers are foreigners (National Bureau of
Statistics 2015). Estimates for the tourism sector put the share of foreign workers at 50 percent.
Women are critically underrepresented in the sector, making up only 7 percent, and Maldivian women
are only 2 percent of tourism workers.
113. The heavy presence of foreign workers and low numbers of women is largely due to two
factors. First, the “one island, one resort” policy isolated resorts away from communities, so local staff
had to spend extended periods away from their families, a nearly impossible task for women. Second,
Maldivians lacked the skills and qualifications for many categories of employment required by the
sector. The government has made various efforts to address these and other factors that limit national
employment in tourism since the Second Tourism Master Plan in 1995, but the share of foreign
workers has only grown with the industry (MOTAC 2013).

Impact of Non-Traditional Markets
114. While Europe still accounted for 43.9 percent of arrivals to Maldives in 2014, Asia and the
Pacific became the largest source market for the first time with 48.9 percent. The Chinese market has
been the driving force behind the rise of Asian arrivals, with 30.2 percent of all arrivals. Russia and
India have not reached that level of dominance, although they are well established in the top ten of
source markets. Russia was the 4th largest source country with 5.5 percent of arrivals. India ranked 7th
with 3.8 percent.
115. Russia has been one of the top five source markets to the Maldives since 2011, growing at an
annual average rate of 12 percent from 2010 to 2011. However, Russia has been losing market share
over the last two years. Though arrivals from Russia posted strong growth rates in 2010, 2011 and
2013, they dropped significantly in 2014, down 13.3 percent. According to UNWTO (2015), this was
due to sluggish economic growth and currency depreciation against the US Dollar and the Euro—
exogenous factors not directly related to Maldives. The monthly arrival pattern of this market
remained consistent from 2010 to 2014: January was the peak month, while June was the weakest.
116. Although recording a small and somewhat constant market share, Indian arrivals have grown
consistently from 2010 to 2014, averaging 25 percent annual growth, and increasing from 25,756 to
45,587. The Indian market has shown irregular monthly patterns, but December has remained the
peak month. It is expected that this market can develop further considering the continuing strong
growth in Indian arrivals to the whole of the Asia Pacific region (PATA 2015).
117. Projections for tourism growth under the standing Fourth Tourism Master Plan place these
source markets as significant drivers for growth in arrivals, with a goal to have 1.4 million arrivals from

                                                    26
Asia Pacific by 2021. These estimates, although not disaggregated by country, imply significant growth
in arrivals from the four Asia Pacific markets in the top ten: China, Russia, India and Korea. Their
combined arrivals were 510,417 in 2014.

2.2 Seychelles: From rapid growth to broad growth
118. Located in the heart of the Indian Ocean, the Seychelles is mainly known for high-end luxury
hotels and resorts, and is a favorite destination for honeymooners and couples. The tourism industry
is the main contributor to GDP, the main employer, and the main source of foreign exchange earnings.
Due to limited carrying capacity, the tourism strategy follows a low-density, high-yield approach.

Tourism Performance
119. Tourist arrivals in the Seychelles increased from 120,716 in 1995 to 231,857 in 2014, an
increase of 92 percent. Arrivals started to decline in 2003 after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and an
outbreak of Chikungunya fever, and did not recover until 2006. In 2008 and 2009 the sector suffered
from the global financial crisis. The country worked hard to diversify tourist source markets as well as
the range of products when the economic crisis hit the main European markets and has experienced
growth in arrivals since 2010. While Europe represented 80 percent of all arrivals in 2005, in 2014 this
share had dropped to 66 percent. Meanwhile, Middle East and Asian markets have become more
prominent. The combined Middle East/Asia market share increased from 6.8 percent in 2005 to 18.2
percent in 2014. The largest growth has come from the United Arab Emirates and China. In 2014,
Germany was the largest market representing 15.4 percent of all arrivals followed by France (13.9),
Italy (8.5), Russia (6.4), UAE (6.0), China (5.7) and South Africa (5.4).

120. Tourism is the Seychelles’ main source of income. Tourism receipts reached US$ 398 million
in 2013. The sector employs one third of the workforce and contributes 70 percent of total foreign
exchange earnings. Tourism contributes an estimated 26 percent to GDP (World Bank, 2013). There
are two major sources of revenue leakage in the Seychelles; most supplies need to be imported and
most hotels are foreign-owned and managed. A 2010 value chain analysis estimated that of the
amount spent on materials/goods in the tourism sector, 88 percent was used for imports.

Growth Strategy
121. During the 2000’s the Seychelles tourism strategy was to attract developers and open five-
star hotels and resorts. The Tourism Incentive Act 2008 was instrumental in achieving that. Hilton, Le

                                                                  27
Meridien, Banyan Tree, Shangri-La and Four Seasons all have properties in the country. Now that the
Seychelles has a firm luxury brand, the country has diversified their strategy. The Seychelles Strategy
2017 set an objective to “attain self-sustaining economic growth by securing targeted increases in the
number of tourist visits to the country and the amount spent by each tourist. In order to achieve these
advances the degree of direct and indirect local participation in all elements of the sector will be
increased”. The rate of expatriate employment in the tourism sector had increased from 8 percent to
23.4 percent between 2001 and 2010. The current growth strategy is then also to ensure the
Seychellois will benefit from tourism as much as possible and that tourism should not negatively
impact the well-being of the population. There is no carrying capacity number attached to this strategy
but there are now restrictions on ownership and size of tourism businesses with a “Seychellois First”
policy as an alternative to high growth and foreign investment. Following the dip in arrivals from
Europe caused by the economic crisis, the government has also focused on a market diversification
strategy. The strategy of sustainable, high yield and inclusive growth as detailed in the 2012-2020
Tourism Plan has been translated into the following policies and strategies:

Seychelles Accommodation Policy
122. This policy was updated September 2015 and sets specific requirements on size and
ownership for new accommodation establishments in each of the islands. No new large-scale
development will be approved, with limits varying from 10 to 24 rooms. In North Mahe on the main
island, only Seychellois developers are allowed and they can propose small establishments that
exceed limits. Projects already approved are allowed to proceed. This policy has not only involved a
greater number of Seychellois, but also increased the number of more affordable accommodations
and supported the market diversification strategy.
123. A similar policy has also been used for tour operators, which must be 66.66 percent owned
by Seychellois, and yacht and dive operators—those with 4-5 boats must be at least 51 percent owned,
while there are no restrictions on those with six or more. Effectively, growth through small businesses
has been prioritized for Seychelles.

Small Establishments Enhancement Program (SEEP)
124. This marketing initiative has been developed to help promote the country’s smaller
establishments under the brand name “Seychelles Secrets”. Owners of these small hotels and
guesthouses have received capacity building support and are being promoted by the Seychelles
Tourism Board.

Restructuring of Ministry of Tourism and Culture
125. After reshuffling of portfolios, the current Ministry of Tourism and Culture (MTC) was created
in March 2012. The Seychelles Tourism Board (STB) is now overseen by MTC but continues to report
to its Board, which is made up of members from the public and private sectors. In 2013, MTC had an
annual budget of US$2.5 million while STB had an annual budget of US$10.8 million. The current
Minister of Tourism and Culture, Alain St Ange was previously the CEO of the Seychelles Tourism Board
and the vice-president of the hotel association. The budgets reflect the important role of the private
sector and there are good working relationships between the private sector and government. The
MTC and STB have been able to leverage their budget through aggressive promotion and public
relations.




                                                  28
Tourism Marketing Act of 2013
126. The Tourism Marketing Tax (TMT) was introduced in January 2013 and is applicable to all
tourism businesses, banks, insurance companies and telecoms with an annual turnover of 1 million
rupees (approximately US$85,000). The rate is 0.5 percent of the annual turnover. Through the new
tourism-marketing levy, STB estimates that it will receive an additional 30 million SCR (US$2.7 million)
to add to its current budget of 120 million SCR (US$10.8 million). The new funding mechanism has
been created with the understanding that STB will need to broaden its efforts in order to improve
occupancy rates and attract new markets.
127. The STB launched the ‘Affordable Seychelles’ campaign in 2010 to move the perception away
from the idea that the country “only exists for the rich and famous”. Under this campaign, the STB has
started offering packages for a safari in Kenya combined with a beach vacation in the Seychelles. This
sub-campaign, From the Big Five to the BEST Five, takes visitors from the ‘Big Five’ of the African
continent to the ‘Best Five’ of the Seychelles Islands. The Seychelles diversification strategy has also
been successful in attracting the growing South African market.

Human Capacity Building
128. An important step towards addressing the tourism sector capacity gap and low local
participation on tourism employment was taken in 2007 with the creation of Seychelles Tourism
Academy (STA) which replaced the Seychelles Hospitality and Tourism Training College and was
moved from the Ministry of Education to be managed by STB. The STA has MoU’s with a number of
hotel companies in the Seychelles and the region and had over 600 students enrolled in 2015. There
is an effective partnership between the STA and the private sector.



3 Transformational Opportunities
129. Historically PICs have achieved higher than average long-term growth. This can be expected
to continue if the current strategies are maintained. However, this level of growth will not be
sufficient to generate transformational change. Significant change is possible as the Maldives and
Seychelles cases demonstrate.
130.     Based on long-term performance, emerging market trends, specific product opportunities
and the natural attractions and selling points, the Pacific has opportunities that hold the potential to
generate transformational change. These opportunities include aggressively targeting the Chinese
visitor market, reconfiguring the rapidly growing Pacific cruising product, expansion of the high-end
resort market and capitalizing on the aging population in key origin markets by developing a long-stay
visitor opportunity for retirees. These opportunities have the potential to deliver substantially higher
revenues but will also bring impacts that will need to be managed.

3.1 Addressing the Underlying Fundamentals for Growth
131. The Pacific faces challenges which constrain growth. These include difficulties in access;
declining competitiveness with dated facilities; limited demand, particularly from long haul markets
and constrained marketing. This is coupled with a lack of effective data for decision making. It will be
necessary for the Pacific to address these underlying fundamentals in order to build a stronger
platform for growth.




                                                  29
132. Realizing the potential growth of tourism in the Pacific requires a strategy of improving yields
and developing markets. It means being less dependent on Australia and New Zealand markets. To
achieve this requires a four-part strategy:
• Improving connectivity with growing and established markets.
• Attracting more and higher yielding tourists.
• Improving the investment climate and the effectiveness of public sector participation in the
    sector.
• Improving efficiency of tourism to deliver higher returns to governments and communities.

Improving connectivity
133. While connectivity is improving, here is a priority for improving to access to medium and long
haul markets, opening up new routes, improved connections between PICs and upgrading ground
facility standards to ensure safety, security, passenger handling for an increase in passenger services.
This may include financial support for airlines to open up new routes, possibly through a regional
market development fund to evaluate and develop new routes and services. A brief examination of
the possible role of subsidies as a form of support for expansion of airline services is presented in
Appendix 3. There has already been some success in using charter flights as a way of building demand,
particularly between China and both Fiji and Palau. Appendix 4 provides further detail on the role of
charters in developing air services between China and the Pacific islands.

Attracting more, higher-yielding tourists
134. Overcoming dependence on Australia and New Zealand as the principal markets for PICs will
require concerted, long-term market development that emphasizes yield, rather than volume. The
environment and resources of the Pacific are less suited to high volume low-yield traffic enjoyed by
the Caribbean, with major markets within easy reach. Applying a research-based approach to
identifying the opportunities for expanding high-yield markets such as weddings; the MICE market;
diving and surfing (including live-aboard); super yachts and private aircraft; game fishing and other
niche markets which match the PIC product offerings, can grow higher-yield sectors. In parallel, re-
establish the Pacific as a destination of choice, through media, the travel trade and contemporary
reservation systems.

Improving the investment climate and the effectiveness of public sector agencies in supporting
the development of tourism
135. The examples of Maldives and Seychelles demonstrate the effectiveness of sound public
policy in driving the growth of tourism. For PICs this requires a greater degree of intervention in
creating the business environment which will make the proposed transformation agenda achievable.
This involves improving the investment environment to overcome the shortage of domestic capital
and provide confidence for investors; the development of a business enabling environment which
makes investment easier to implement, including minimizing legal and administrative impediments
which affect the tourism sector. It also requires greater intervention in physical planning and land
management, as well as ensuring a future labor force has the skills necessary to meet future demand.
Marketing capability and improved statistical information are also critical to effective sector
development, at both a PIC level and for the Pacific region. Development will only occur if the
environment for investment compares favorably with other prospective opportunities.




                                                  30
Improving efficiency
136. It will also be necessary for the PICs to improve the efficiency of the tourism sector. This would
include improving linkages between tourism and the local economy such as food supplies and services
to hotels, improved destination management and strategy, pooling of private sector resources such
as cold storage and access to warehousing financing for this purpose, and regional training facilities.
The Caribbean tourism strategy now incorporates a number these initiatives designed to improve
efficiency. Fiscal revenues from the sector can also be better managed.

3.2 Targeting Opportunities for Transformational Change
3.2.1 The Chinese Market
137. China has been by far the fastest growing tourism source market in recent years and has been
the world’s top spender in international tourism since 2012. According to UNWTO, 109 million Chinese
traveled abroad. Boosted by rising disposable incomes, an appreciating currency, improved travel
facilitation and an easing of restrictions on international travel, Chinese outbound travel has been
growing strongly over the last two decades. According to the recent data released by WTTC (WTTC
2016), Chinese tourists spent US$215 billion outside mainland China in 2015, a 53 percent rise from
the US$140 billion spent in 2014, despite the country’s economic slowdown.
                Figure 12. Chinese Spending has grown substantially during the last 10 years




                                               Source: WTTC

138. China’s economic growth has exceeded that of other large emerging markets experiencing
rapid growth. Continued robust income growth and expansion of China’s middle class will make long-
haul travel even more achievable for Chinese households in the coming decades. The number of
Chinese households earning above US$35,000 per annum—an income level at which long-haul
international travel becomes affordable—rose by 21 million from 2003 to 2013 (IHG 2015). An
additional 61 million households will pass this threshold by 2023 (Table 9).

139. Chinese travelers are a diverse market. Based on an analysis of income and travel spending
by WTTC and Oxford Economics, household income of close to US$20,000 is the threshold at which
Chinese households can afford outbound leisure travel. From there, it is estimated that households
earning US$35,000 annually find international travel more affordable and can take more long-haul
trips. When traveling abroad, many Chinese tourists are willing to pay a premium for accommodation,
dining and shopping. For the higher-end market segments, recent Chinese travel trends show that
cruise, safari and adventure travel are becoming increasingly popular.
140. China has a fast growing market segment of well-traveled, high spenders, looking for new
experiences. A study conducted by the Boston Consulting Group (2013) shows that from 2012 to 2030,
three segments of the outbound leisure market will grow the fastest: young ‘affluents’ (ages 18 to 30),
senior professionals (ages 45 to 55, traveling without an organized tour group), and small groups of
families and friends (ages 30 to 45, also traveling without an organized tour group). Combined, by
2030, these segments will account for additional 100 million annual trips and US$ 340 billion in annual
spending. This is quite different from the past when the outbound leisure market was driven largely
by mass-market travelers and travel in organized tour groups. It implies potential opportunities for
PICs, which offer niche and higher-end products and generally attract more experienced travelers.
141. Opportunities to tap China’s travelers are not just in the country’s largest and most well-
known cities. In terms of location, while well-known super tier 1 cities 4 such as Shanghai and Beijing
all have populations of more than 10 million, by 2030, 29 non-super tier 1 cities will have middle-class
and affluent consumers of more than 3 million. And in many cases, these cities represent unique
opportunities for consumer goods and services. According to 2013 data from TripAdvisor’s China
website, which tends to attract more experienced travelers, more than 70 percent of unique site
visitors researching outbound destinations lived outside the four super tier 1 cities. And online traffic
from these visitors is growing two to three times faster than that of visitors from the super tier 1 cities
(Boston Consulting Group 2013). For travel and tourism companies in the distribution channel for PICs,
looking beyond tier 1 cities may yield more potential opportunities. For example, Australia’s Jetstar
Airways launched flight services from tier 3 city Haikou in 2009 and United Airlines started to offer
three direct flights weekly between San Francisco and Chengdu, which was a destination with no US
airline services before.

142. Large cities, iconic attractions, and beach resorts have been favored destinations in recent
years and will continue to be in the future. Shopping, sightseeing, and relaxing are popular activities
now and will remain so, while outdoor and adventure trips are emerging as new trends. Significantly,
in the first half of 2015, 25 percent of Chinese outbound travelers chose island destinations for their
trips abroad (Meesak 2015). In particular, traveling to lesser-known and often more expensive islands
is an increasingly popular trend, which suggests opportunities for PIC11s.
143. In the Chinese luxury travel market, research has found that island-based locations are among
the most popular destinations. A 2014 survey targeted 203 ‘super tourists’, noted for their extensive
spending, who traveled abroad for an average of 18 days with spending of US$150,000. The results
show that their major tourist destinations were in Europe, the US and island-based locations.
Specifically, 59 percent of these super tourists have island resort experience (Hurun Report 2014).

144. Cities are still the primary destinations of Chinese travelers, with over 70 percent of Chinese
outbound travel to major cities around the world 5. This fits with the pattern of Chinese tourists, who
tend to travel as part of a package trip involving group tours with multiple destination stops. The
current largest city markets for Chinese travel spending are mostly found in the Asia-Pacific and the
US.

145. Shopping has long been central to the outbound Chinese tourism market. A recent analysis by
McKinsey suggested that 29 percent of Chinese tourists choose their location based on shopping
opportunities. The study also found that in 2015 Chinese tourists who traveled abroad devoted about
a quarter of their total annual consumption to their trips, with a half this being spent on shopping
(Zipser 2016).
146. The preference of Chinese leisure travelers for packaged group trips has been a key
characteristic that shapes travel and spending behavior while abroad. Package trips are especially
appealing to new travelers. As the Chinese travel market evolves, the popularity of group leisure is
unlikely to diminish, as a large proportion of the increase in Chinese outbound arrivals will be made
by first-time travelers. However, Chinese travelers making their second international trip and those in
higher income brackets are more likely to opt for independent travel. In addition, there are increasing
indications of preferences for long-haul leisure travel, higher-cost accommodations, and high-end
shopping. It is these markets that are more likely to be attracted to the PIC11.

Nature of Transformational Change
147. Countries are usually required to receive “Approved Destination Status” (ADS) before Chinese
tourists can be allowed to visit although Palau appears to be an exception. Analysis of historical travel
facilitation reforms affecting Chinese nationals shows that, following ADS approval, these reforms can
yield substantial growth in Chinese arrivals (Table 10). Previous travel facilitation reforms include:

•   The removal of inbound travel quotas
•   Introduction of an individual travel visa scheme
•   Government sponsored tourism promotion programs
•   Visa-free travel exceptions for various classes of passport holders
•   Introduction of electronic visa application (eVisa)
•   Visa wavier programs
•   Visa on arrival programs (VoA)

 148. Moreover, recent reforms by the US, Australia and the UK will greatly facilitate Chinese
 outbound travel, though their impacts have yet to be observed in the available arrivals and spending
 data. In November 2014, the US and China reached a mutual agreement to extend the terms of their
 tourist visa from one year to ten years. Chinese nationals can acquire US short-term multiple-entry
 visas for both business and leisure travel valid for up to ten years, and vice versa. In 2014, 2.2 million
 Chinese visitors arrived in the US, up 21 percent over 2013 6.
 149. Similarly, the UK is in the process of improving visa facilitation and processing for Chinese
 travelers. Super Priority Visas, which are processed within 24 hours, have been extended to travelers
 from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. In addition, the mobile fingerprinting service that is required
 to apply for the UK visa has been extended from 9 Chinese cities to an additional 50 cities, making it
 more convenient to apply for the visa. This has been commended by the CEO of WTTC as a great effort
 to welcome more Chinese tourists (WTTC 2015).

Scale of Transformation
150. Based on historical trends, the demand for travel will continue to grow, particularly the
demand for outbound travel. The number of Chinese who travel abroad will reach 220 million in 2025,
according to recent estimates (Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research 2015). In addition, by 2030,
outbound trips will account for 40 percent of China’s total market value up from 30 percent in 2012.
Chinese travelers will be spending about US$700 billion on these outbound trips (Boston Consulting
Group 2013).
151. Between 1995 and 2008, total Chinese arrivals in nine of the PIC11 were reported by the
UNWTO as growing from only 278 to 3,969. Notably, in 2009 the total jumped to 25,988, then
increased to 84,468 in 2014. The main destinations for Chinese tourists in the region are six PIC11s:
Palau, Fiji, PNG, FSM, Samoa and Vanuatu. Figure 15 shows the strong growth of Chinese arrivals in
top PIC11s from 2010 to 2014. The distribution of the arrivals illustrates that Palau and Fiji are key
destinations receiving more than 80 percent of the total Chinese arrivals in the top PIC11s in 2014.
                     Figure 15. Chinese arrivals are concentrated in Palau, Fiji, and PNG

152. The market share of Chinese tourists can be increased substantially beyond its current seven
percent. Between 2009 and 2014, Chinese visitors to PIC11 grew by an average of 27 percent per
annum, and now represent seven percent of the inbound market. Based on the experience of other
destinations that implemented well-targeted policy interventions that facilitated improved access,
such as aviation and visa policies, together with targeted marketing, the annual growth rate of Chinese
arrivals could continue to grow at 20 percent for the next 10 to 20 years in most PIC11.
153. Beyond 2025-2030, it is likely that limitations on carrying capacity and absorption rates would
act to reduce the growth of Chinese visitors to PIC11s. Assuming growth returned to the long-term
average for all markets, Chinese visitors would retain the 26 percent share of total PIC11 tourism
resulting in a figure of approximately 971,000 by 2040. At that time the PIC11 would welcome nearly
3.7 million international tourists.

Economic Impact
154. Spending by Chinese tourists has significant economic value to destinations. Asia-Pacific
destinations, for example, receive more than 40 percent of their total travel spending from Chinese

                                                         36
visitors. South Africa, Canada, the US, Argentina, Brazil and Russia are also among the top 15
destinations in terms of the Chinese share of total travel spending. It is estimated that over the next
eight years, growth in Chinese outbound travel to key destination markets will expand markedly. For
example, in absolute terms, the US will see the greatest increase in Chinese travel spending, more
than quadrupling by 2023 and Thailand will see Chinese travel spending more than double by 2023.
The US Department of Commerce projects that the new visa policy could mean that as many as 7.5
million Chinese visitors will visit the US by 2021 which is three times as many arrivals as in 2013 and
they will inject an estimated $85 billion into the domestic economy (Fuller 2015).
155. Compared to a long term growth rate of around five percent for most PIC11, the additionality
of the transformational scenario estimates the economic potential of the Chinese market opportunity
in 2040 at over 660,000 additional tourists, which bring nearly US$950 million in tourism receipts, and
generate nearly 65,200 additional jobs.

3.2.2 The Cruise Ship Market
156. The cruising industry brings hundreds of thousands of visitors—many for the first time—and
millions in revenue to the Pacific every year. Cruising offers visitors opportunities to affordably visit
multiple islands in a single vacation and to travel easily between countries. It also opens up
destinations that lack tourism infrastructure or are difficult to access by air or land. This allows the
benefits of tourism to reach isolated communities. While the average cruise visitor spends less than
an overnight visitor, that spending demands less capital investment and has greater local benefit.
Passenger spending at port calls goes primarily to private businesses with lower levels of leakage than
average tourism spending 7.
157. The growth of the Australian market has transformed cruising in the Pacific. Since 2004
cruising to all destinations by Australians has grown at an annual rate of 20 percent, reaching 1 million
passengers in 2014. Market penetration is a global high 4.2 percent, considerably ahead of North
America—the world’s largest cruise market—where market penetration is 3.4 percent. Australia has
quickly become the world’s fourth largest cruise market, after North America, Germany and the UK,
accounting for 4.5 percent of global traffic. The most popular cruise length among Australians
continues to be 8-14 days, with 54 percent of the market, although 5-7 day length cruises account for
21.7 percent of passengers and grew by 31 percent from 2013 to 2014. The average ocean cruise

 Most estimates of leakage from overnight tourism revenue in Pacific SIDS are close to 60 percent, while IFC
(2014) estimates that leakage for cruise passenger spending in Vanuatu is 41 percent.

                                                      37
length is 9.7 days, down slightly from 10.25 days in 2013, reflecting the increased popularity of 5-7
and 0-4 day cruises.
158. The most popular cruise route from Australia, accounting for 39 percent of passengers, is the
South Pacific, which includes PNG, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, and non-member
states New Caledonia, French Polynesia, American Samoa and Cook Islands. In 2014 the entire South
Pacific region received 392,549 passengers, up 18.7 percent from 2013 and more than double the
number in 2010 (Figure 16) (CLIA Australasia 2014). Australia is the largest source market for the South
Pacific, contributing 70-75 percent of passengers (IFC 2014). However, growth of the Australian cruise
market has been a factor in the slowing growth of air travel to Vanuatu. From 2010 to 2014, average
annual growth in air arrivals from Australia to Vanuatu was only 0.9 percent, while the same figure for
New Zealand was 8.1 percent.
      Figure 16. Australian Cruise Departures to the South Pacific are experiencing double digit growth

159. The total number of cruise passengers from New Zealand increased by 10.6 percent in 2014
reaching a record of 65,609, the third highest growth rate globally. Since 2009, passenger volume has
increased an average of 17.3 percent a year, more than doubling over the period. With market
penetration increasing to 1.4 percent, New Zealanders are more engaged with cruise travel than major
markets Spain and France, and there is still plenty of room for growth. The preferred cruise length
remains 8-14 days, accounting for 51.8 percent of passengers and up 6.3 percent from 2013. 5-7 day
cruises saw the largest year-on-year increase of 40 percent, and made up 23.8 percent of passengers.
The average cruise length decreased to 10.4 days in 2014, down from 11.1 days, due to growth in the
shorter duration cruises. The South Pacific attracted 20,577 passengers from New Zealand, 31.4
percent of the total number, and a 12.7 percent increase over 2013 (CLIA Australasia 2014). Because
of shorter sailing times from Auckland versus Australia, a greater share of New Zealand cruises visits
Tonga.
160. The world’s fastest growing cruise source market is Asia, with 34 percent average annual
growth in cruise passengers 2012-2014. Chinese outbound cruise passengers have increased by 80
percent, comprising almost 50 percent of the 1.4 million Asian cruise passengers. There will be 52
ships based in Asian ports in 2015, but mainly on a seasonal basis, operating in other areas during
Northern winter, including the South Pacific. Most cruises are short duration, up to 6 days, with

                                                       38
gaming, shopping and entertainment the main activities. Operations from Chinese ports cannot reach
Pacific Island destinations on the most popular length itineraries, but Caissa Touristic is marketing a
46-day cruise from Tianjin with 8 port calls in the South Pacific sailing in November 2016. The Asian
fly-cruise market is growing. Asian passengers choosing to fly-cruise outside Asia make up 9 percent
of the market—126,000 passengers—and this segment averaged 5 percent annual growth from 2012
to 2014. Only 3 percent of these passengers made Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific their
fly-cruise destination, leaving significant room for the South Pacific to increase its share (CLIA
Southeast Asia 2015).
161. Cruise arrivals to South Pacific destinations have generally increased since 2008 (Figure 17).
Each country records arrivals, so a single cruise passenger can be counted as multiple arrivals when
an itinerary includes multiple countries. Similarly, a passenger is counted as one arrival even if a cruise
ship stops at multiple ports in a country. Figure 17 also illustrates the rapid growth and dominance of
New Caledonia as a cruise destination. New Caledonia’s primary advantage in the cruise market is
proximity to Australia. The French territory is located just 1,210 km east of Australia—the closest
South Pacific destination to Brisbane and Sydney—and is featured on the most popular 7- 10-day
itineraries. New Caledonia has four ports of call at Nouméa, Isle of Pines, Lifou and Mare offering a
variety of attractions. Cruising is also the most affordable way to visit New Caledonia due to high
airfare and accommodation prices. As a result, it received nearly four times more cruise visitors than
overnight visitors in 2015. As long as New Caledonia remains safe and politically stable, it will be a
major cruise destination. The deployment of cruise ships in PICs further east could shift some of the
market to more distant countries like Fiji, Samoa and Tonga.

162. Fiji, PNG, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu received 350,197 cruise passengers in 2014, with the
greatest share going to Vanuatu. Unfortunately, not all member countries track cruise arrivals.
Solomon Islands likely received 3,000 visitors, based on 2014 scheduled port calls. Palau, FSM, Kiribati
and RMI each likely saw less than 1,000 arrivals from trans-Pacific and Round-the-World cruises.
163. Vanuatu is the most popular PIC11 destination in the South Pacific. Only New Caledonia, sees
more cruise arrivals. In 2015 Vanuatu received a total of 197,471 cruise passengers, more than double
the number of overnight visitors. While this represents a decline from 2013’s record high — partly

                                                                                  39
due to the effects of Tropical Cyclone Pam—arrivals have increased 58 percent since 2009. Just under
half of these arrivals visited multiple ports within the archipelago. The capital, Port Vila, is the primary
port of call. Ships that make additional calls favor Luganville (Santo) and Mystery Island (Aneityum).
These three ports account for 85 percent of calls. Ships also call at Champagne Beach, Wala and
Pentecost. According to a 2013 survey by SPTO, 93 percent of passengers were Australian and 70
percent were first time visitors. Of the 30 percent who had visited previously, 77 percent had done so
on a cruise. Respondents reported high levels of satisfaction with their visit, with strong majorities
expressing a desire to return and to recommend Vanuatu to others (SPTO 2014).
164. Cruise operators, their passengers and crew spent US$34.6 million in Vanuatu in 2013. This is
equivalent to approximately 10 percent of Vanuatu’s exports. 90 percent of this spending went to
private businesses. One cruise ship passenger brings US$125 of spending distributed over three ports.
It is estimated that the number of jobs created or sustained by cruise ship tourism in Vanuatu ranges
from 1,170 full-time jobs to 3,250 part-time jobs (IFC 2014).
165. Fiji receives Australian- and New Zealand-based cruises, and trans-Pacific and Round-the-
World cruise vessels. The ports of call in Fiji are Suva, Dravuni Island, Port Denarau (Nadi), Lautoka,
Savusavu and Yasawa-i-rara. Lautoka also serves as an embarkation port for a few small luxury and
expedition cruises a year. While cruise arrivals are not tracked by country of origin, the majority of
cruises that include Fiji in their itinerary depart from Australia. The cruise industry has become an
important tourism sector for Fiji. Cruise arrivals have increased dramatically from 41,669 in 2008 to
113,760 in 2015. Estimates by the government indicate that cruise passengers spent US$3.9 million,
or US$35 per arrival, in 2013. Suva port hosted 64 cruise liners in 2014 and was scheduled to host 53
cruise liners in 2015. Port Denarau is home to two local cruise lines, which offer itineraries up to 7
nights around Fiji’s islands on small ships.
166. Approximately half of the cruise ships visiting Tonga are from Australia and New Zealand, but
a significant number of total port calls are trans-Pacific and Round-the-World cruises. Arrivals have
fluctuated dramatically in recent years, demonstrating the unpredictability seen in more
geographically isolated markets. In 2015, Tonga received 17,375 cruise visitors, down from a peak of
27,641 in 2009, but up from the low of 7,957 in 2012. Nuku’alofa and Vava’u are Tonga’s two ports of
call. Nuku’alofa is the primary destination, with Vava’u receiving about half of the ships that have
called at Nuku’alofa. Most ships calling at both ports are Australia- and New Zealand-based. A 2014
survey by SPTO showed that 90 percent of cruise arrivals had never visited Tonga before. 55 percent
wanted to return on a cruise and 29 percent wanted to return on an overnight trip. Australians
represented 39 percent of all visitors, with Europeans accounting for 23 percent, Americans for 22
percent and New Zealanders for 12 percent (SPTO 2014). The strong presence of Europeans and
Americans highlights the significance of Round-the-World and trans-Pacific cruises in Tonga.
167. Samoa is visited regularly by Round-the-World and trans-Pacific cruises and occasionally by
Australia- and New Zealand-based cruises. Ships call at the capital Apia, bringing 26,145 cruise visitors
and an estimated US$1.2 million in spending in 2013 (Samoa Tourism Authority 2015). Distance from
Australia means the shortest cruises calling in Samoa are 18 days, above the most popular length of
8-14 days (CLIA Australasia 2014). Inconsistent demand for long cruise itineraries has dramatically
affected annual passenger arrivals. While 2008 saw 13,509 arrivals, the following three years saw zero
passengers. Relatively low average passenger spending of US$28—compared to Port Vila’s average of
US$79—is partially due to lower spending by passengers on long cruises.


                                                    40
168. Cruise tourism in PNG has been growing fast since the government recognized it as one of
their main priorities for growth. Arrivals have nearly doubled since 2009, with over 9,000 in 2014. PNG
has been able to open up destinations previously undeveloped by land-based tourism due to access
challenges. There are 11 ports of call receiving trans-Pacific, Round-the-World and Australia-based
cruises: Alotau, Conflict Islands, Doini Island, Kiriwina Island, Kitana, Madang, Port Moresby, Rabaul,
Sepik, Vitu Islands and Wewak. PNG is implementing a cruise development strategy, which is viewed
as very successful within the industry, developing new destinations and tapping into both Australian
and global markets. Eliminating the visa requirement for passengers has been critical to the
introduction of new itineraries to PNG by Carnival Australia in 2013. PNG is also considering linking
with Indonesia or the Philippines for island cruising experiences (Vincent 2015).
169. The geographic distance from the main ports in Australia and New Zealand is the main
hindrance for cruise tourism development in some of the other PIC11s. The 2015 initiative by SPTO
supported by CLIA for regional cruise development cooperation among the South Pacific countries
could open up new itineraries and add new ports. In the North Pacific, the Pacific Asia Travel
Association is investigating the viability of home-porting vessels in Guam, a US territory that could also
visit Palau, FSM and the Marshall Islands.

Learning from Barbados: Small Island State Home Port Success
170. The Caribbean is the world’s largest cruising destination market, with 39 percent of cruise ship
capacity and 25 million passenger arrivals in 2014. While the majority of ships are based in the US,
Barbados has established itself as a successful home port in the Eastern Caribbean. Part of this success
is based on geography. Barbados sits near the middle of the chain of islands that make up the Eastern
Caribbean, allowing for a variety of cruise itineraries where ships sail only at night, eliminating
unpopular days at sea. US-based ships cannot reach these islands on the most popular 7 day-length
itineraries.
171. Barbados opened its dedicated cruise terminal at the Bridgetown port in 1994, the result of a
public-private partnership investment. In 1996 when annual cruise passenger arrivals already
exceeded 500,000, Barbados created a Cruise Tourism Development Strategy. The new strategy set
out two goals: maximizing the value added from cruise tourism and; maximizing the rate of conversion
for cruise tourists to over-night tourists. Home porting was a central recommendation in achieving
the goals of the strategy. While Barbados was not likely to attract the major US cruise lines, the island
was suited to attracting European and smaller US cruise lines. The island offered European operators
the opportunity to distinguish themselves within the market, rather than being dwarfed by
competitors in a large US port. Barbados also offered them shorter relocation voyages in the spring
and fall. European and smaller US operators were attractive because they typically brought higher
spending passengers on smaller ships (Egret Communications/ARA Consulting 2001).
172. Between 2000 and 2011, over 20 percent of cruise ship calls to Barbados were homeport calls
where passengers embarked and disembarked and ships resupplied. In 2006, the rate was over 37
percent. This performance exceeded all other Caribbean ports, even Puerto Rico and the Bahamas. In
2010, 127,314 passengers of the total 745,145 arriving, or 17 percent, were on home porting vessels.
Even in the aftermaths of 9/11 and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the share of home port calls was
unaffected, largely because most operators were Europe and UK based (Caribbean Shipping
Association 2012).



                                                   41
173. Barbados was able to make home-porting a successful part of cruise shipping by providing
quality services through a dedicated cruise terminal and effectively promoting to European and small
US operators, with the support of strong policies focused on increasing the value of cruise tourism.

Transformational Opportunity: Fly - Cruise in Fiji
174. One way to increase both the number of visitors to PIC11s and the socioeconomic impact of
cruising is by selectively basing large cruise ships in PIC11 countries. Not only would this bring benefits
to the homeport country, but it would also bring more cruise arrivals to PICs that are too far from
Australia to reach on the most popular 7-10 day-length cruises. Fly-cruise is a key strategy in the
development of new markets. This is seen as a longer-term development in the Chinese market. A
potential Fiji-based vessel provides an opportunity to capitalize on the strong Australian market and
fast-growing Asian interest in developing fly-cruise options with vessels based in the region. While this
would begin with Fiji, it could become an opportunity for Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, PNG and Samoa.
175. Countries benefit in numerous ways when cruise operators base ships at their ports. In
addition to the fees paid directly to port facilities, cruise lines spend significant sums to provision and
supply their vessels, generating revenue for local providers. Passengers traveling to and from the port
increases airline traffic and revenue for ground transport providers. Hotels, restaurants and other
tourism businesses can benefit further when passengers choose to extend their visits pre- and post-
cruise. Provisioning cruise ships and increased over-night stays can have the additional effect of
improving local supply chains, especially for food, stimulating producers and distributors to improve
quality and service.
176. A few small island states have been successful homeports. In the Caribbean, Barbados, the
Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Guadeloupe have the most consistent turnaround traffic,
although Puerto Rico and Guadeloupe are territories of the US and France respectively, offering them
privileged positions for those major source markets. French Polynesia, also a territory of France, is the
only small island state outside the Caribbean with steady homeport use.

New Itineraries for the South Pacific
177. Australia-based cruise ships visiting Pacific islands operate primarily from Brisbane and
Sydney, with a few sailings a year from Melbourne. Recently, Cairns has emerged as a new base for
cruises to PNG and Solomon Islands. Return itineraries range in length from 7 -18 days, though the
most popular are 7-10 days and feature 3-5 port calls, depending on the departure port. New Zealand-
based ships visiting the Pacific islands operate from Auckland and return itineraries range from 8 -22
days, with 8-10 day lengths including 3-5 port calls most popular.
178. In order to maintain competitiveness and increase sales, cruise lines are constantly working
to develop new itineraries and unique destinations. Cruise lines consider a number of factors when
designing itineraries: marquee ports and destinations; number of ports; mix of cultures, countries and
experiences; shore excursion revenues; port costs; shoreside activities and infrastructure; competitive
itinerary comparison; passenger sourcing; timing in port and fuel consumption; geography; cruise
length; and operational considerations, like navigation and logistics. In the Pacific, itineraries include
at least one city port call that offers shopping and cultural attractions, as well as soft adventure
activities. All other port calls are beach-focused, which primarily offer “untouched” natural
environments with water- and land-based soft adventure activities. Some beach port calls are on
uninhabited islands, but most also offer shopping and cultural activities with local communities. In


                                                    42
PNG and Solomon Islands, a few ports of call are exclusively cultural attractions, focused on unique
“tribal” practices and ceremonies.
179. Based on the results of its 2014 research on economic impacts of cruising in Vanuatu, the
International Finance Corporation commissioned a feasibility study, in conjunction with Carnival
Australia and Australian Aid, to determine the market demand, potential economic impacts, air access
arrangements, infrastructure requirements and commercial feasibility of a Pacific-based cruise ship.
The study, released in 2015, illustrated the strong potential for a fly-cruise package embarking in
Lautoka, Fiji with 7-day itineraries to Fiji and Tonga and to Fiji and Vanuatu for a 1,500-passenger ship.
Fiji was chosen as home port because of air connectivity with source markets and infrastructure
potential. The two itineraries were developed based on market demand, distance and existing call
port infrastructure.
180. Projected demand for the product in Australia far exceeded the capacity of a proposed 8-week
pilot voyage program and 75 percent of potential customers planned to include a resort stay before
or after their cruise for an average of 3 nights. Only a minority of those interested in this fly-cruise
product had visited the Pacific Islands recently on a cruise or at a resort. Further, the study found that
the substitution effect on the existing holiday market would be small—only 6 to 10 percent.

Economic Impact in the South Pacific
181. Economic impacts for all three countries would be substantial. The study showed that an 8-
week pilot program would bring a total of AU$9.1 million of direct and indirect benefit: AU$6.6 million
to Fiji, AU$1.5 million to Vanuatu and AU$1 million to Tonga. This benefit includes passenger
spending, port fees, provisioning of local goods in Fiji, resort stays and Fiji Airways revenue, and also
accounts for substitution effects in Fiji. Each additional week of voyages would add AU$1 million to
the two countries on each itinerary, so a full 6-month cruise season would bring AU$27.4 million:
AU$19.8 million to Fiji, AU$3 million to Tonga and AU$4.6 to Vanuatu (IFC 2015).
182. Of the direct spending contribution to the totals above for each country, a portion is
passenger spending at the home port and ports of call. Proposed itineraries include three port calls in
Fiji and two in Vanuatu or Tonga. According to the Government of Fiji, average cruise passenger
spending at a call port is AU$42, so the three communities would see an estimated AU$1.26 million
from an 8-week pilot program. The two ports of call in Vanuatu would receive AU$1.11 million and
Tonga’s two ports would see AU$703,500 8. Possible additional ports could include Vanuatu, Solomon
Islands, PNG and Samoa.
183. Home-basing cruise ships in the Pacific can generate multiplier effects in the hosting country,
and open up new destinations. One way to increase both the number of visitors to the PIC11 and the
socioeconomic impact of cruising is by basing large cruise ships in Fiji and PNG. Not only would this
bring benefits to the homeport country, but it would also bring more cruise arrivals to PICs that are
too far from Australia to reach on the most popular 7-10 day-length cruises.

    Table 13. Home-basing cruise ships in the South Pacific can bring over 266,000 tourists per year in by 2040

184. In 2040, the economic potential of the home-basing cruise ships market opportunity 9 is
estimated at nearly 266,000 tourists, which bring nearly US$67 million in tourism receipts, and
generate nearly 4,700 jobs. The country hosting the cruise ship can earn over two thirds of these
benefits.

3.2.3 High-End Resorts
185. For PIC11s, with limited ability to serve mass markets of the scale emerging globally, it will
also be important to pursue strategies that increase yield. Achieving yield, however, requires
properties that meet the demands of discerning international travelers, with either international
standard resorts or specialty resort products. The Pacific has few international brand properties
outside of Fiji.
186. Globally there are many hotels which cater to the High-Net-Worth Individuals 10 (HNWI)
market and there are a number of brands that specialise in this segment. The luxury accommodation
segment away from major cities has two discrete components:
•    The luxury exclusive hotel 11, often less than 100 rooms and with unique characteristics of location,
     architecture, interior design and hospitality standards;
•    Small exclusive resort properties, often less than 20 rooms, which cater for HNWI guests and
     which offer privacy, exceptional standards of hospitality, food and guest activities.

187. There has been an established group of small high-end resorts within this latter category in
Fiji for more than forty years, including Turtle Island and Wakaya Club. Low profile, small and in most
cases on private islands or away from major settlements. They have a global reputation among HNWI
and are frequently visited by celebrities and others seeking a holiday in an exclusive property where
their presence is not noticed, particularly by the media. These properties are generally promoted
through luxury accommodation networks and by word-of-mouth. The major markets are the US and
Australia, but they attract a global clientele. Usually operating on a fully inclusive basis with high
quality cuisine, daily rates are rarely available, but generally exceed US$1,500 on a per-person basis.




9Estimates are built based on home-basing two ships in Fiji, which visit Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu as destinations; and two in
PNG, which visit Solomon Islands. This results in 113,056 individuals that visit two countries on each itinerary, therefore
adding up to 266,112 visitor arrivals.
10
   HNWIs are defined by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management (www.worldwealthreport.com) as those
having investable assets of US$1 million or more, excluding primary residence, collectibles, consumables, and
consumer durables. This criteria best defines consumers with the highest level of disposable assets.

                                                            44
This is significantly above the luxury definition used by STR 12 of US$175 per day for the top 15 percent
of hotels.
188. While visitor numbers are small the yield is high. These resorts are in most cases protective of
their natural environments and work closely with their local communities. Their very existence adds
to the reputation of the Pacific as a location for exclusive accommodation away from crowds. They
also complement the well-established and effectively marketed lodge product in New Zealand, which
has a number of small high-end lodges with global reputations. There are also properties in French
Polynesia and the Cook Islands which conform to these standards. In Asia a number of properties, for
example the Aman collection, carry a similar cachet. Globally there are specialist marketing groups,
such as Relais & Chateaux, and publications featuring small luxury hotels and resorts. Several Fiji
properties are included in these groups.
189. The further development of this product, both in Fiji and selectively in other Pacific Island
countries, including Samoa, Vanuatu and FSM would strengthen the high-end product offering. In
addition, there is an opportunity for luxury-exclusive chains to enter the Pacific market.

The High-End Market
190. Luxury is the fastest-growing segment of the travel industry, having grown 48 percent in the
past five years. In 2014 alone, the world population undertook 46 million international luxury trips,
worth US$219 billion 13. The market share of these trips rose from 3.9 percent in 2009 to 4.6 percent
in 2014 (ITB Berlin 2015).
191. Tourism New Zealand (2015) has defined the market for their premium offering as High-, Very-
High-, and Ultra-High-Net-Worth Individuals with liquid assets of US$1-30+ million who purchase
luxury itineraries of US$20,000-100,000+. In 2014 the upper tiers Ultra- and Very-High-Net-Worth
Individuals represented 1.5 million individuals, which together represent 57 percent of HNWI wealth.
The total sector represents 14.6 million individuals (Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management 2015).
Tourism New Zealand (2015) suggest that successful marketing to the top two luxury tiers will ensure
success with the bottom premium tier of HNWI, which is influenced by the tiers above them. Two-
thirds of this market is located in four countries: the US, Japan, Germany and China, with China’s HNWI
population growing 17 percent in 2014. Annualised growth of Asia-Pacific HNWI’s total wealth is
forecast at 10.4 percent through 2017.
192.     Tourism New Zealand (2015) profiles the sector as:

•    They are global citizens who live and work throughout the world.
•    Their life is one of almost permanent travel, driven by a desire for unique destinations and
     authentic experiences for both work and pleasure.
•    Although the age profile is broadening the 40-60 year age group dominates.
•    They take 4 to 6 trips annually, 50 percent of them long haul, 50 percent domestic.
•    75 percent fly first or business class, with UHNW often traveling privately.
•    Typical trip value: HNWI US$20-50K, VHNWI US$50-100K, UHNWI US$100K+.
•    Their time is a precious commodity and they demand value in exchange.

•   They are thirsty for knowledge and seek unique interactions with talented and cultured people.
•   Often the target audience is not necessarily the consumer, more often the gatekeeper or advisor.

193. A review of TripAdvisor comments on Fiji properties Turtle Island and Wakaya Club shows a
majority of guests coming from the US, particularly Western states (2016). Local sources report that
private aircraft with US registrations are common at Fiji’s Nadi Airport, and that some Chinese HNWI
and groups from the Middle East have visited Fiji’s exclusive resorts. The market is supported by Fiji’s
popularity as a stopover for trans-Pacific super yachts, although there is little direct connection with
exclusive resorts. There is a significant global honeymoon market that selects exclusive resorts for a
once-in-a-lifetime experience, but which is not necessarily HNWI. The growing Chinese HNWI market
offers a major opportunity for growth of this sector with little impact on other sectors of the tourist
experience.
194. This market reflects the concentration of wealth and the influence that VHNWI have on their
peer group and on those who would wish to move in similar circles. The market is driven by luxury
travel advisors and there are international luxury travel shows presenting this market to the
specialised travel trade. It is a separate marketing stream from normal travel marketing.

Transformational Opportunity
195. The Pacific has many islands or secluded waterfront areas that could be developed for this
market. The region is uncrowded and national authorities have accepted the exclusive resort concept
as economically beneficial. The way in which the Fiji resorts have worked with their communities has
lasting local benefits. There are some privately-held islands which would be suitable for development.
It is a model capable of being replicated without cannibalising the market, which is growing and has
depth through its aspirational nature.
196. The development of the sector in the Pacific and in New Zealand has been in part driven by
investors who are HNWI themselves, and who have taken an active interest in the development and
standards maintenance of their properties. Many come from the US. Their deep pockets and personal
commitments have overcome the difficulties of building and sustaining properties of this quality
through the development phase. David Gilmour, a Canadian entrepreneur, established the Wakaya
Club & Spa on his private island in Fiji. It has ten luxury villas and a staff of 300 (Wakaya Club & Spa
2013). The property is included in Forbes list of the world’s most expensive hotels. As part of its
philanthropic mission, the resort constructed a primary school for children of staff on the island.
Philanthropy in local communities is often a feature of similar resorts.
197. A new resort in Fiji, Dolphin Island, has been developed by the owner of New Zealand’s
longest-established luxury property, Huka Lodge, and the properties are marketed together.
198. The essential components of this resort category are small size, exclusive location with no
outside visitors, often dedicated aircraft for transfers, absolute privacy for those who want it,
impeccable service and outstanding cuisine. At the same time a proportion will find expansion a
commercial option, taking advantage of a high market profile to expand the number of rooms or move
towards the luxury exclusive category. In the medium term the sector has the potential to attract
international chains and hotel groups specialising in the sector and which, through their operating
standards and marketing, can grow the total luxury accommodation sector in the Pacific.

199.    The entry strategy requires:

                                                  46
•   Acceptance of the strategy at a national level to minimise concerns of elitism;
•   Support by governments to assist the purchase or lease of land under conditions acceptable to
    investors but ensuring full protection and benefits to traditional land owners;
•   Identification of prospective locations, their characteristics and suitability for development as well
    as accessibility;
•   Identification of a Pacific champion to lead, guide and assist in the development of a regional
    strategy, an individual respected by his or her peers and who can, with assistance, bring investors
    and opportunities together;
•   Development of a Pacific luxury marketing strategy similar to Tourism New Zealand’s Premium
    Strategy and, if possible, establishing links to enhance the South Pacific offering;
•   Availability of private jet aircraft facilities at the gateway airport;
•   Direct access via commercial flights from the US West Coast and Asia.

Economic Impact
200. Assuming there are currently 7 existing exclusive first-tier luxury resorts of 14 keys each
operating at 65 percent occupancy at Average Daily Per Person Rate of US$1,500, the annual revenue
generated would be nearly $70 million. Doubling the number of resorts across the region with similar
operating ratios could increase the annual revenue generated to nearly US$140 million at current
prices, although there should be scope to grow average resort size and rate. A fifteen-year program
to double the number of resorts is seen as a practical proposition if it is a supported program, as
expansion of the sector in prior years has been very slow. The program has the potential to be
extended if proven effective in growing the luxury travel sector for the Pacific.
201. This revenue would be subject to leakages for beverages, food, hotel supplies, fuel and
investor returns, but experience in existing properties shows high levels of locally sourced food,
increased use of alternative energy and low impact activities.
202. More importantly, stimulation of this market and the development of new properties would
encourage further resort development at two levels:
•   Additional small resorts at a lower price point, still offering many of the features of high end
    resorts but without the exclusivity factor. There are already second-tier luxury resorts of this
    standard in Fiji and Samoa. There is an opportunity to develop 10 additional second-tier resorts
    averaging 20 rooms across the region by 2030, primarily in Fiji but also in Tonga, Samoa and
    Vanuatu at an ADR of $US875 per night, the additional revenue generated would be nearly US$75
    million at current prices. This would include all other expenditure such as food, beverage and
    activities.
•   Generating interest from luxury exclusive chains or super-luxury brands of major chains to acquire
    and/or develop small high end resorts. This could include chains such as Six Senses, Four Seasons,
    Rosewood or Banyan Tree, and specifically chains which are succeeding in attracting the Chinese
    luxury market, including Chinese luxury chains. Assuming over the fifteen-year period 10
    properties in this third-tier category were developed with an average of 70 rooms and an ADR of
    US$750 per night, they could generate revenue of approximately $US218 million at current prices.




                                                   47
203. In 2040, the economic potential of the luxury market opportunity 14 is estimated at over
138,000 additional tourists, which bring nearly US$490 million in tourism receipts, and generate over
32,000 additional jobs. Fiji would be the main beneficiary of a luxury resort initiative, although there
would be opportunities in Tonga, Samoa, Palau, and Vanuatu.

3.2.4 The Retiree Market
204. The United Nations Population Division is projecting the world population to grow from 6.9
billion in 2010 to 9.7 billion by 2050. Following a gradual aging process, the elderly are expected to
grow faster than other age groups. This trend is evident in the targeted markets for PIC11s (Table 15).
The shift in age structure associated with population ageing can have a profound economic impact.




14Assuming the new development of 7 exclusive resorts (14 rooms each), 10 second-tier luxury (20 rooms each), and 10
luxury (7 rooms each) by 2030, and a subsequent growth of 3 percent per year. Employment estimates use a multiplier of
0.7 per US$10,000 in receipts. Taxes use the weighted average of $56 per tourist.

205. The number of Australians over the age of 65 is projected to increase by 75 percent over the
next 20 years, from 3.3 million in 2012 to 5.8 million in 2032, and post-retirement assets will grow
from around US$300 billion to US$1.3 trillion by 2032. Although the Australian government is
encouraging workers to retire at 67, people are taking earlier retirement. The Australian Bureau of
Statistics revealed that the average retirement age is closer to 59 for men and 50 for women
(Hutchens 2013). The average age at retirement for people ages 45 years and over in 2012-2013 was
53.8 years.
206. As Australia’s standard of living has risen over the past three decades along with the cost of
daily living, some Australian retirees are moving overseas. The number of age pensions paid to
Australians living overseas increased 30 percent between 2007 and 2012 (Wyatt 2014). For those who
move overseas, some of the popular destinations in the Asian Pacific region include Indonesia,
Malaysia and Vietnam.
207. Similarly, New Zealand’s population is aging. The number of people age 65 and over has
doubled since 1980, and is likely to double again by 2036. The largest growth will occur between 2011
and 2036, as the baby boomers move into the 65 age group. Similar trends in key Asian markets such
as China and India suggest that there may be a substantial retiree market for the Pacific by 2040 if
conditions are right.

Decision Drivers
208. The current senior tourism market is disaggregating into three segments by length of stay:
leisure travelers, long-stay travelers and home owners or permanent stay. For the home owners and
permanent-stay segment, long term certainty of residency, access to high quality medical care, ease
of communication, and ease of visa and immigration process are critical factors. In addition,
affordability, safety, ease of international and local connectivity, tax status and property ownership
rights, including disposal on death or departure with repatriation of assets, are also important to this

                                                         49
segment. Some destinations are offering access to retirement villages, which allow independent and
assisted living without the hassle of home maintenance; physician consultations and medical facilities
are also close to these villages. Based on the current conditions and trends Fiji, Vanuatu and Samoa
have the greatest potential to grow the retiree market. In addition, Micronesia may have the particular
potential to attract Chinese retirees and those of other Asian markets.

Nature of Transformational Change
209. Forbes has published a list of the ten best retirement destinations using various criteria from
ease in securing a visa to quality of life. Besides Malaysia, other developing destinations on this list
include Panama and Thailand (Morais 2009).
210. Costa Rica was the first country to make a concerted effort to attract foreign retirees with a
program of special benefits. It launched Pensionado and Rentista Program in 1971 to attract foreign
investments and retirees. Specifically, the Costa Rican government created an immigration scheme to
provide annual residency status to retirees who meet the minimum monthly income requirements.
The Program also introduced income tax incentives and import duty waivers on cars and household
goods. However, tax and customs incentives have been largely removed amidst concerns over rapid
increases in foreign retirees.
211. Panama is another country that has successfully attracted foreign retirees. With an
internationally well-regarded healthcare system and affordable property prices, it ranks favorably as
a retirement destination by the International Living Magazine (2016).
212. In Thailand, the Longstay Program has been implemented to assist foreigners in purchasing a
second home. Thailand Longstay Management Company was established in 2001 and endorsed by the
Thai Royal Government to support the long stay program. The Tourism Authority of Thailand is a major
shareholder of the company. This program targets long stay retirees over 50 years old. Participants
receive a one-year retirement visa, fast tracking for immigration and custom procedures and Thai
driving licenses. Long-stay visitors arrive throughout the year, with slight increases during winter
months.

Learning from Malaysia’s “My Second Home Program” (MM2H)
213. Malaysia was ranked fifth highest as a retirement destination by the International Living
Magazine (2016), after Panama, Ecuador, Mexico and Costa Rica, making it the best place to retire in
Asia. Malaysia is also well recognized as a regional center of excellence for medical tourism. The
Malaysian government launched the Silver Hair Program in 1988, later renamed as the Malaysia My
Second Home (MM2H) scheme. It is an international residency scheme that allows foreigners to live
in the country on a long-stay visa for up to 10 years. To qualify for the program, applicants must meet
certain financial and medical criteria. Applicants aged below 50 years are required to show proof of
liquid assets worth a minimum of RM500,000 (US$127,866) and offshore income of RM10,000
(US$2557) per month. Applicants aged 50 and above may comply with the financial proof of
RM350,000 (US$89,507) in liquid assets and offshore income of RM10,000 (US$2557) per month.
Successful applicants are then entitled to enter and leave the country on a largely unrestricted basis
(Abdul-Aziz 2014).
214. Participants of the program enjoy incentives including rights to property purchase, vehicle
purchase, children’s education, tax incentives, part-time employment and investing in local companies.



                                                  50
Participants are also allowed to bring their children who are below 21 years old and not married as
their dependents. In addition, participants’ parents can also receive a long term visa.
215. Currently the Ministry of Tourism and Culture is responsible for promoting MM2H, with
approval of applicants and issuance of visas made directly by the Immigration Department of the
Ministry of Home Affairs. The program is operated through a network of registered immigration
agents. As Figure 18 shows, 29,390 people have been approved for the program between 2002 and
2015. Sixty percent of these approved participants are from China, Japan, Bangladesh, the UK and Iran.

216. Malaysia is positioning itself as a “relaxing retirement” destination. For MM2H participants,
some country specific attractions include affordable and high quality health services, political stability
and a comfortable climate and pace of life.
217. Notably, gaps in Malaysia’s current offering still exist. For example, high quality health care
offering outside urban areas is limited and suitable quality accommodation is also limited outside the
main centers. At present, the MM2H program does not have a long-term targeted marketing strategy
or adopt annual targets for participant numbers. The Program also lacks support if MM2H participants
face issues with local and state governments on varying restrictions such as those related to property
transactions.



                                                      51
Economic Impact
218. Due to the existing constraints of medical facilitates and other supporting infrastructure, the
growth of foreign retirees in PIC11s may not be significant in the next two to five years. However,
based on the experience of other destinations and with appropriate conditions, it seems reasonable
for PIC11s to target a total of 5,000 retirees by 2025. The growth is likely to slow after 2025 and it is
reasonable to assume that retirees would only stay for a period of up to ten years. Growth is likely to
continue beyond 2025, although at a slower pace. PIC11s could potentially have 10,000 resident
foreign retirees by 2040.
219. According to current incentives for overseas retirees in Fiji, the principle applicant must either
deposit a sum of F$100,000 (US$48,000) in a resident account of a local bank upon application
approval or purchase a property in the Fiji Islands. In addition to the initial investments these retirees
bring, the policy of Fiji also requires F$30,000 (US$14,500) for a family of two or F$40,000 (US$19,500)
for a family of up to five members must be deposited annually in the resident account of a local bank
(Fiji Department of Immigration 2016).
220. Retirees could also spend a substantial share of their income locally while they live in PIC11s.
As the Thailand Longstay program shows, most program participants do not spend the entire year in
the destination. Even if retirees spend six months annually in PIC11s and spend 80 percent of their
monthly income locally, PIC11s would still benefit from foreign retirees’ local expenditures. Using
MM2H Program’s minimum monthly income US$2500 as a benchmark, one foreign retiree could
spend up to US$30,000 annually. Assuming retirees spend half of the year in a PIC, this could
potentially bring US$15,000 per year in addition to the US$50,000 in initial investments.
221. The economic potential of the retiree market opportunity 15 is estimated at 10,000 retirees,
which bring US$200 million in receipts, and generate almost 14,000 jobs.

4 Capturing Transformational Change
222. There are visible opportunities to grow tourism in the Pacific by capitalizing on changing
markets and reinvigorating established markets with new and improved products and stronger
marketing. In addition to the strategies required to address the underlying fundamentals in order to
build a stronger platform for growth–improved connectivity, attracting higher-yielding tourists,
improving the investment climate and effectiveness of public sector participation, and improved
efficiency–Pacific governments will need to take specific actions to capture these transformational
opportunities.


        Opportunity                                      Actions Required
                                  •   Negotiate new air routes between PIC’s and Chinese cities
                                      with frequencies to fit with limited holiday opportunities,
                                      price points to match competitive destinations and minimal
                                      stops. Scheduled routes may initially be developed by
                                      charters or supplemented by charters at times of high
                                      demand.
                                  •   Upgrade airports and provide support to attract new carriers,
                                      to cater for larger aircraft and volume traffic, to minimize
    Increasing the                    processing delays on arrival and departure and facilitate
                                      transfers to their destination.
   Chinese Market
                                  •   Tailor offerings to Chinese tourists, such as providing
                                      translators, improving service standards, installing Chinese
                                      signage and coverage of Wi-Fi. Prioritize market segments
                                      and understanding the preferences of these segments.

Appendix 1: International Arrivals in PICs
1.       While the majority of PICs are dependent on Australia and New Zealand as their main
generating markets there are changes occurring in other markets. Fiji is the aviation hub for the South
Pacific and the entry point for long-haul passengers traveling to other Pacific destinations and this role
has gained from changes in connectivity from other PICs. It is the administrative center, with major
regional institutions and a strong meetings and business base. Australians have consistently provided
50 percent of visitor arrivals in Fiji over the past five years. The New Zealand share of the Fiji market
has increased from 15 percent in 2010 to 18 percent in 2014.

Fiji
2.       The US market to Fiji is particularly strong, and is attracted by the range of high end resorts
and secluded smaller luxury properties, particularly in the northern islands of Fiji. There have been
significant falls in the volume of United Kingdom and European visitors since the GFC. Japanese visitor
numbers began falling dramatically in the late 1990s. Chinese visitors have been increasing and
charter flights are now operating at selected periods of the year. There are strong seasonal patterns
of visitor arrivals to Fiji, with Australians and New Zealand arrivals peaking in the southern winter
months through to September, while northern hemisphere markets primarily arrive in the northern
winter. This new year-round pattern has significantly improved the financial viability of the Fiji tourist
industry, and operators are using Chinese New Year as a prime opportunity to access the China market.

Vanuatu
3.      Vanuatu shares the pattern of dependence on the Australian market—50 percent of all
arrivals—and as is the case of Fiji the pattern of arrivals is static or declining. The introduction of low
cost carriers in 2005 opened the market to Australia and New Zealand packaged visitors, and there is
a range of resorts primarily on the principal island of Efate. Vanuatu has always had visitors from New
Caledonia, as a neighboring francophone PIC.

4.      For Vanuatu the cruise industry is a major component of the tourist sector. Visitor numbers
for 2015 and 2016 will be affected by Cyclone Pam. There are six ports of call in Vanuatu, which
provides a greater spread of benefits, as the majority of international overnight visitors stay on Efate,
with Tanna and Santo as the second level destinations. Vanuatu has been the principal cruise
destination from Australia as the closest PIC.

Palau
5.       The quality of the dive experience in Palau generates visitors from across the globe and Palau
has one of most diverse source markets of all PICS. However China, China Taiwan, Japan and Korea
are the largest generating markets, with the first three each generating 30 to 40,000 arrivals each and
Korea nearly 15,000 arrivals. The introduction of charter flights from China has driven rapid growth
over the past two years. There have been year on year fluctuations between markets but the Chinese
market grew exponentially in 2014 and the first months of 2015, with year on year growth rates of
over 300 percent in the second quarter of 2015, creating significant pressures on facilities and natural
attractions and impacting on visitors from other established origin markets.

Samoa
6.       New Zealand is the dominant market to Samoa, generating 41.8 percent of arrivals in 2014,
but there is consistent visitor traffic from American Samoa (14.0 percent) as Apia provides a transfer
point to Australia and New Zealand. Australia has become the second most important market,
generated by lower cost carrier direct flights and competitive pricing as well as direct Government
support. However, the withdrawal of direct flights to the USA has impacted the development of long
haul markets. Connectivity between Polynesian PICs is limited, with Fiji and New Zealand as the airline
hubs for PIC visitors. As noted, the strong influence of visiting friends and relatives is a major driver of
arrivals. Visitors from the USA include both holiday and VFR.

Papua New Guinea
7.       The high proportion of business and short-term employment arrivals to Papua New Guinea
includes a wide spectrum of nationalities. Australians dominate, both on holiday and business, while
Philippines arrivals are primarily contract workers. The ranking of source markets for the number of
holiday visitors does not follow the same ranking as the overall ranking of the number of visitors (table
below). While Australia still ranks first, it is then followed by the US, the UK, Germany and Indonesia.
The Australian holiday market has increased since 2005 when the PNG Tourism Promotion Authority


                                                           63
office opened in Sydney. The close relationship between the two countries, the distance and the
frequency of flights make PNG a convenient destination for Australians. In 2011, PNG received 3,452
US holiday travelers and by 2014 this had increased to 6,233. The marketing efforts in the US have
helped create awareness and the unique natural resources receive a strong interest from the US niche
markets. Australian holiday arrivals are probably affected by a restrictive visa regime, although this is
now being modified.
8.      Arrivals from Europe have increased sharply over the last years as well. Holiday arrivals from
the UK increased from 1,679 in 2001 to 3,087 in 2014. Arrivals from Germany increased from 1,626
(2011) to 2,572 (2014). PNGTPA opened an office in London in 2013 and arrivals from the UK increased
by 35 percent since.
9.      In 2010, Japan was the third largest market (2,350 holiday arrivals) for PNG but arrivals have
dropped since then. This has been partly caused by a decline in the number of flights to Tokyo and a
change in Japanese travel patterns. Holiday arrivals from China are low, 916 arrivals in 2014, despite
PNG being an “Approved Destination” since 2006.

Tonga
10.     Tonga depends on New Zealand as its principal source of visitors, which includes a significant
proportion of Visiting Friends and Relatives, as do arrivals from the USA and Australia. Northern
Europe visitors have continued to decline, a pattern shared by other PICs. New Zealand, which is
frequently a shared destination with PICs, also experienced a significant decline in Northern Europe
in the period following the advent of the GFC. Evident is the low level of visitors from other PICs,
constrained by lack of transport links.

Solomon Islands
11.      Australia again dominates arrivals into the Solomon Islands, but the diversity of diving and
natural experiences draws a much wider market, and although numbers are small European visitors
are increasing. Inter-PIC traffic among the Melanesian PICs is much greater than in Polynesia, with
better linkages and shared borders. Australia has been operating a peace-keeping operation in the
Solomon Islands for more than ten years which generates visitor and service personnel arrivals.

Appendix 2: PIC Source Markets Trends

1.      In the past decade the global financial crisis, the UK travel tax, reductions in flights to the US
and Japan, as well as the rise of China have created shifts in the pattern of arrivals in the Pacific. Inter-
island connectivity has declined, there have been major, well reported natural disasters and global
competition has intensified. Long haul markets have declined in importance and PICs have become
increasingly dependent on Pacific Rim markets.

2.      Two thirds of tourists are visitors from Australia and New Zealand. The USA, China, Japan and
Europe are relatively small markets, but still very important as they have the potential to generate
much more growth in arrivals than Australia and New Zealand. Outbound travelers from the USA are
already more than double the combined populations of Australia and New Zealand, at half the travel
propensity.

Travel by established markets, Australia and New Zealand
Australia
3.       Australia’s outbound departures have increased steadily from 4.3 million in 2005 to 8,125
million in 2014. Departures increased by 4.6 percent between 2013 and 2014; the trend has continued
through 2015. Australia ranked 9th in international tourism spending for 2014 according to the UNWTO.
Growth over the last few years occurred despite fluctuations in the Australian dollar. In 2014, the
Australian dollar reached highs that had not been seen since 2004, making international travel more
attractive for Australians. The top ten destinations for the Australian outbound market in 2014 were:
1 New Zealand, 2 Indonesia, 3 USA, 4 UK, 5 Thailand, 6 China, 7 Singapore, 8 Fiji, 9 India, and Japan.
4.       New Zealand remains the principal destination for Australians, but includes a high volume of
VFR and business traffic. In 2014, VFR was 40.5 percent of arrivals, business visitors were 13.3 percent
and holiday visitors made up only 38.3 percent. 16 Indonesia travel reflects the immense popularity of
Bali as a destination. Even the Bali bombing in 2002 and other security concerns in Indonesia have had

little effect on the rapid growth of Australian arrivals. The top destinations among PICs were Fiji, PNG,
Vanuatu, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Tonga. However, Fiji, ranked 8th, was the only PIC among the
ten top destinations for Australians in 2014-15.
5.      Total outbound departures for Australia are forecast to continue to grow in future years,
albeit more slowly. Tourism Australia expects outbound departures to grow 3.8 percent on average
per annum and reach 12.3 million by 2022-23. Malaysia, China, Indonesia, Fiji and Singapore are
forecast to be the top five fastest growing main destinations to be visited by Australian residents over
the next few years (Tourism Research Australia, 2014).
6.      The profile of Australians traveling to PICs covers the full spectrum, from families, adventure
seekers and mature-aged to VFR and business. There is a strong surfing market to Fiji, PNG, Samoa
and Tonga and a diving market across the region. The wedding market is primarily in Fiji and Vanuatu.
Average daily expenditures by Australian visitors are available for four PICS. The relatively low
expenditure in Samoa reflects the high proportion of VFR traffic.

New Zealand
7.       For New Zealanders, outbound travel has also been increasing steadily from 2 million in 2010
to 2.3 million in 2014. In 2014-15, over 47 percent of the trips were to Australia followed by growing
numbers to the USA (172,000 as of May 2015) and Fiji (135,000 as of May 2015), up by 14.8 percent
and 14.4 percent respectively. Travel to some other PICs was up also: Samoa by 6 percent, Tonga by
9 percent and Vanuatu by 1.8 percent. International outbound leisure travel trips by New Zealand
residents are estimated at 1.9 million in 2014, and are forecasted to grow by an average of 3.3 percent
per year to reach 2.3 million trips by 2020. Outbound departures increased 2013 (1 percent) and 2012
(4 percent). Again, geographic distance plays an important role in this as Fiji, Tonga and Samoa are
relatively close to New Zealand; 3 hours travel and in the same time zone. Much of the travel can be
attributed to VFR, especially for Tonga. The Cook Islands are also a major destination for New
Zealanders, with 79,959 arrivals in 2014.

8.       New Zealanders travel to PICs for family holidays, weddings (11 percent of visitors to the Cook
Islands are attending weddings), adventure and sports, as well as beach holidays by couples or groups.
The Pacific is also a destination for meetings and New Zealand is a major supplier of food and
manufactured goods, so there is frequent business travel.
9.        New Zealanders are twice as likely to visit PICs as Australians are: the travel propensity of
Australians is 0.24, while for New Zealanders it is 0.52. If the Cook Islands are included, the propensity
increases to 0.70. Although the population is only 19 percent of Australia, it is a primary market for
PICs. In PICs where data is available, New Zealander’s average daily expenditure is just above that of
all visitors (see table below).
                       Table A10. Average Daily Expenditure by New Zealand Visitors

10.     The two main markets for PICs—Australians and New Zealanders—are, therefore, traveling in
increasing numbers both to some PICs as well as other destinations. Increased flight connections from
the main carriers (Air New Zealand and Qantas) and low cost carriers such as Virgin Australia are
helping to increase traffic. However, outbound travelers total 9 million (Australia) and 2.3 million (NZ)
are relatively small bases from which to expand. Especially compared with the Caribbean islands,
which can draw upon the USA market of more than 300 million.

USA
11.     Americans took a record 68.3 million international trips in 2014, a 1 percent increase over
2013. Of that, 55 percent traveled no farther than neighboring Canada and Mexico. In 2014, just 1
percent of US outbound travelers visited Oceania, including Australia and New Zealand. The region
received 601,000 Americans, an increase of 5 percent over 2013.

12.     From 1995 to 2008, American arrivals to PICs grew from 47,601 in 1995 to a high of 98,368 in
2006, this was then surpassed in 2014 with more than 98,781 US arrivals reported. Fiji has long been
the favorite destination for Americans ranging from 83 percent to 57 percent of all Americans visiting
PICs from 1995 to 2009. Papua New Guinea has been and continues to be the second most popular
destination among the target PICs beginning with the first recorded US arrivals in 2009 of 6,630
increasing to 11,668 by 2014, in part driven by major US resource extraction projects.
13.     Geographic distance is less of concern for American visitors based in western states—
California and Hawaii together account for 38 percent—but accessibility and attractiveness of the
destination are the key decision makers. Fiji is the only PIC with direct flights to Los Angeles. Fiji is a
mature destination for Americans offering a wide variety of accommodation including international
brands. Fiji is a well-known honeymoon destination for this market. The arrivals to PNG include
business travel, but the country has also become a destination for niche travel markets for divers and
eco-tourists. The dive market drives much of the US travel to FSM and Palau, 65 percent of USA visitors
to Palau dive 17. Traditionally, US visitors to the Pacific have been largely drawn from western states,
as travel times are significantly shorter and they are home to significant Pacific Island diaspora
populations.
14.     US investment in hotels, resorts and second homes in the Pacific, particularly in Fiji, creates
confidence in the destination for US travelers. A number of high profile US personalities have homes
or resorts in Fiji. The success of Fiji Water (8 percent of Fiji’s exports), as a premium brand, has also
created market awareness. Total USA arrivals to the Indian Ocean is smaller than to the Pacific,

increasing from 10,149 in 1995 to 29,895 by 2013, with most of these arrivals concentrated in the
Maldives ( 20,034 arrivals).
15.      Data from a series of surveys conducted in PICs enable daily expenditure to be calculated for
US visitors to five PICs. Americans tend to spend more than average visitors, except for in PNG where
a majority of US travelers comes for business purposes but still making them a good high-yield target
market.

Japan
16.     Japanese international outbound travel has undergone fluctuations over the last ten years.
Japanese outbound travelers stood at 17.5 million in 2006, but then gradually dropped to 15.4 million
in 2009. In the following years outbound travel increased up to 18.5 million in 2012. Departures
dropped again to 16.9 in 2014. Outbound trips are forecasted to grow by an average of 1.1 percent
per year to reach 18.4 million trips by 2020. The outbound travel growth rate in Japan is one of the
lowest in the region.

17.       Japanese arrivals to PICs were 48,204 in 1995, but by 2013 the total had only increased
marginally to 53,221. As of 2014, the main markets for Japanese travelers in PICs were Palau (37,986),
Fiji (5,888), FSM (4,570) and PNG (3,117). Japanese arrivals to Fiji dropped precipitously from a 1995
high of 45,300 to the 2014 total of 5,888. Palau began receiving large numbers of Japanese starting in
1998 with 21,571 visitors and then fluctuating within a few thousand in subsequent years. There are

                                                         70
direct flights from Narita to Palau and many of the Japanese visitors are coming to dive or snorkel.
Japanese arrivals to Kiribati, Samoa, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands are under 600 arrivals
annually. Apart from Palau, overall Japanese visitation to the target PICs has been low considering
that the Maldives received almost 40,000 visitors in 2013.
18.     As with Japanese arrivals to the Pacific region destinations, arrivals in the Caribbean have
declined substantially. They reached a 1996 high of 53,791 and have dropped to an all-time low in
2013 of 12,686. In the Indian Ocean, Japanese arrivals have been fairly static hovering between 35,044
in 1995 and 42,054 in 2014 with approximately 93 percent concentrated in the Maldives.
19.     Japanese expenditures in PICs has only been measured by surveys in PNG and Palau. For PNG
in 2011 average daily expenditure by Japanese visitors was US$491, well above the average of US$308.
In Palau it was US$318 in 2014, slightly higher than the average US$280. While limited, these
observations demonstrate the high-yield potential of the market.
20.      Generally, the Japanese market appreciates quality products and attention to detail. Two
interesting markets are seniors (age 65+) and young women. Japan’s population is graying and retirees
have an increased interest in traveling abroad. Young women in their twenties and thirties are some
of the keenest groups of travelers in Japan. They often travel in small groups and are very interested
in discovering new destinations. Japanese groups are also interested in visiting World War II historic
sites, particularly in PNG.

Republic of Korea (ROK)
21.    Outbound travel in the Republic of Korea has been increasing since 2009 when the number of
departures increased from 9.5 million in 2009 to 15.5 million in 2014. The strong value of the Korean
Won, combined with the expansion of low-cost carriers, is the main reason for the increase in
outbound travel. Preliminary statistics indicate outbound travel in 2015 will increase by double digits.

                                    Sources: UNWTO 2015 and NTOs
22.     Of all PICs Palau is the closest to ROK and there are four direct flights a week between the two
countries. In 2014 Palau was the number one destination among PICs with 14,650 visitors, a decline
from the 2012 peak of 19,465. Fiji, which has three direct flights a week, received 5,676 visitors in


                                                  71
2014—a 34 percent increase from 2013 and the highest number since 2010. PNG received 1,649 in
2014, the second year of declines from a 2012 peak of 1,764. Surveys show Korean travelers are
interested in beaches and experiences.
23.      Competitive destinations in the Pacific and Indian Ocean have seen year-on-year increases in
arrivals from ROK. Korean arrivals to Guam tripled between 2009 and 2014, reaching 293,437 arrivals
in 2014. Northern Mariana Islands and Maldives also experienced growth.
24.      Average daily expenditure for Korean visitors is only available for Palau in 2014. At US$257, it
is just below the average US$280. This limited data makes it difficult to draw conclusions on their
spending habits in PICs.

India
25.      India is just behind China in growth rates of outbound travelers, but not yet in the top ten of
global tourism spending countries. International tourism departures from India have grown from 3.7
million in 1997 to 18.3 million in 2014. With more than 1.1 billion inhabitants and a fast growing urban
middle class wanting to travel, India is expected to continue to be one of the fastest growing outbound
travel markets. Tourism Australia expects the number of Indians traveling overseas to rise from
around 18 million in 2014 to 50 million by 2020.

26.     Indian arrivals in Fiji have increased from 1,836 in 2010 to 3,057 in 2014 and saw an 8.3
percent increase compared to 2013. Arrivals to PNG increased from 2,382 in 2009 to 4,475 in 2014,
down from a peak of 5,480 in 2012. While numbers are still low, India promises to be a strong growth
market for Fiji and PNG. Fiji’s Indian diaspora offers a potential opportunity for VFR arrivals. Bollywood
movie producers have recognized Fiji’s appeal as a shooting location, which can raise public awareness
of the destination.
27.     Maldives and Mauritius both experienced strong growth from the Indian market in the six
years to 2014. Indian visitors to the Maldives tripled, reaching 45,587, while arrivals in Mauritius
almost doubled to 61,167. Indian arrivals in both destinations are strongly driven by the wedding and

honeymoon market. Direct flights from Mumbai to Malé in Maldives take approximately five hours.
There are no direct flights from India to Fiji and travel time is about 18 hours requiring a stopover in
Hong Kong or Sydney. Fiji hopes to negotiate an air services agreement with India in January 2016,
made possible by the addition of direct flights between Fiji and Singapore starting April 2016.

Europe
28.     European outbound travel (including inter-European) increased from 497 million in 2010 to
575 million in 2014, and represents 51 percent of all international outbound travel. Average annual
growth was 2.7 percent between 2005 and 2014, the lowest growth rate of all regions (World Tourism
Organization, 2015).
29.     Europe is considered an important market for PICs as European visitors have on average a
much longer length of stay than travelers coming from Australia, New Zealand, China or Japan. This
longer length of stay translates into higher revenue per tourist. Europeans are more likely to travel
away from main resort areas and to have specific interests or experiences. For countries like PNG and
Solomon Islands, which have diverse natural and cultural experiences, they form an important market
for regional areas. Results from a 2014 tourism survey in Palau shows that many European tourists
come specifically for diving.
30.     UK residents took 60.1 million visits abroad in 2014; this was up 4 percent compared to 2013.
This was a return to positive growth after the 1 percent decline of 2012. British travelers spent 3.0
percent or £1.0 billion, more during these visits in 2014 than in 2013. Growth had been hampered
since the global financial crisis. UK outbound travel is expected to grow by 1 percent annually the next
few years as consumers regain their confidence in the economy.
31.      The four-tier UK Air Passenger Duty (based on the distance from London to the destination’s
capital city) as introduced in 2009 caused flight fares to increase. Asia Pacific fell in band D, the most
expensive. The most expensive bands, C and D, were scrapped in April 2015 so all long-haul
destinations now fall under A and B. Destinations in the Caribbean and Asia Pacific are expected to
see visitor numbers from the UK rise as a result of the tax changes.

32.      The main markets for the UK in PICs in 2014 were Fiji (16,782), PNG (6,994), Samoa (862 in
2013), Solomon Islands (460 in 2013) and Palau (390 in 2013). UK arrivals to any other PICs are under
1,000 arrivals annually. UK arrivals in Fiji have decreased significantly in the last three years. This
follows the overall trend for long-haul destinations from the UK. Based on visitor surveys, Fiji is mainly
considered a honeymoon destination, while PNG is an adventure destination. Palau and the Solomon
Islands attract a small but steady number of UK divers each year. UK visitors to PNG spent US$255 per
day in 2011, compared to an average US$308.
33.     Germany was the third largest spender on international tourism in the world in 2014, after
China and the US. Total spending in 2014 is estimated at US$92 billion, a 2 percent increase over 2013.
In 2014, German departures to long-haul destinations recovered from their dip following the global
financial and Euro crises. In 2014, Germany’s departures were back at 4.2 percent growth, compared
to 2013 when the outbound market grew by only 0.5 percent.
34.       The number one destination for Germany within the targeted countries is Fiji with 7,841 in
      18
2012 . The second most popular destination is PNG, where arrivals increased from 1,219 in 2009 to
3,330 visitors in 2014. Palau is third with 629 visitors in 2009 and 1,233 in 2014. Samoa and Tonga
each received less than 1,000 German visitors in 2013 with Samoa declining from 1,450 German
visitors in 2009 to 955 in 2014 (World Tourism Organization, 2015).
35.     Based on visitor surveys, Fiji is primarily considered a honeymoon destination, while the main
reason to visit the other to five countries is diving and nature. Arrivals to Samoa, PNG and Tonga were
driven by historical associations and successful marketing by German-owned resorts. As these have
declined, and as access has been reduced, the Pacific Islands are no longer the aspirational
destinations they once were. German visitors to PNG in 2011 spent an average of US$323 per day,
just above the US$308 average for all visitors.
36.       France, while sixth in terms of tourism expenditures, has very low visitation to PIC11s. Fiji is
the most popular country within PICs, as it received 4,375 visitors in 2012. Papua New Guinea is the
second most visited PIC with 1,278 visitors in 2013. All other PICs received less than 1,000. However,
French Polynesia and New Caledonia, French Pacific collectivities, together received over 70,000
visitors in 2014. The French market to the Maldives and Mauritius is of a similar scale. French visitors
to PNG in 2011 spent an average of US$419 per day, significantly more than the total average of
US$308.
37.    The Netherlands, a relatively small country, has been able to make it in the top 15 source
markets for Fiji, PNG and Solomon Islands. Fiji received 2,077 Dutch visitors in 2009, but by 2012 this
number had dropped to 1,590. Papua New Guinea has experienced an increase in arrivals from the
Netherlands increased from 515 in 2009 to 674 in 2014. Solomon Islands received 63 Dutch visitors in
2013.
38.     Russia is currently the fourth biggest spender on tourism expenditure, after China, the United
States of America and Germany. The Russian market has yet to find the PICs, yet in 2014 66,308
Russians visited the Maldives. This is a market with future potential, if access issues can be resolved.

China
39.      China, the number one tourism generating in the world in terms of spending since 2012, has
experienced substantial growth over the last year. In 2014, 109 million Chinese traveled abroad, an
increase of 19 percent compared to 2013. These numbers include Hong Kong and Macau. Chinese
tourists spent a record US$164.8 billion overseas last year, a 28 percent increase over 2013. Outbound
growth for 2015 is estimated between 15-20 percent. The increase in outbound travel is a result of
the fast growing middle class combined with fewer restrictions for international travel. Mintel 19
expects the volume of outbound travelers to grow at a CAGR of about 12.8% over 2014-19, reaching
213 million person-times in 2019.
40.      Approved Destination Status (ADS) is a bilateral tourism arrangement and lets Chinese holiday
travelers travel in a group to the country and allows the other countries to advertise their destination
in China. ADS was granted to Fiji, Tonga and Vanuatu in 2004 and extended to FSM, Samoa and PNG
in 2006. ADS has only been granted to countries that support China politically and not to those that
support China Taiwan. Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Palau do not have ADS
status. The countries that have ADS status also often received infrastructure support from China. In
November 2015, the Chinese Government announced that the PICs that have ADS status, and
presently receive grants from China, will have a representative tourist office in Beijing. The South
Pacific Tourism Organization (SPTO) will manage the office. Du Jiang, deputy director of the China
National Tourism Administration, said: “We hope to launch more direct routes to the region, in order
to provide more convenience for visitors. We encourage Chinese companies to invest in the island
nations and help develop tourism”.
41.      Between 1995 and 2008, total Chinese arrivals to nine of the eleven target PICs were reported
by the UNWTO as growing from only 278 to 3,969. However, in 2009 the total jumped to 25,988, then
increased to 83,517 in 2014. The main markets among the PICs in 2014 were Palau (39,383), Fiji
(28,333), PNG (9,553), FSM (2,732), Samoa (1,998) and Vanuatu (1,563). Chinese arrivals in Palau
rocketed from 8,804 in 2013 to 39,383 in 2014. In February 2015, Chinese visitors represented 62
percent of all visitors, which Agence France Presse reported as a 500 percent increase. The rapid
increase prompted concerns by Palau residents and President Tommy Remengesau, which resulted in
cutting the number of flights from China in half in April 2015. The size of the Chinese travel market
means that increased interest will lead to remarkable growth figures. While there are no detailed
statistics, considering the current flight schedule, most Chinese are originating from Hong and
Shanghai.
42.      The other five destinations have experienced relative small growth numbers from China.
Statistics for the most recent year available are Marshall Islands (87), Tonga (391) and Tuvalu (60). No
data on Chinese visitors was available for Kiribati and Solomon Islands.

Chinese Arrivals to other countries in the region
43.     Chinese arrivals to other countries in the Pacific region increased from 1.43 million in 2009 to
4.92 million in 2014. Australia, New Zealand and the Northern Mariana Islands have overwhelmingly
dominated the market, with an average 99 percent of all Chinese arrivals. Among these countries,
Australia is the main receiving country with an average 71 percent market share between 1995 and
2014.
44.     The Northern Mariana Islands has been grown quickly as a destination for Chinese visitors,
due to the establishment of direct airline connections with China and increased marketing by Chinese
agencies. The country received 29,528 in 2009—by 2014 arrivals had increased to 170,121. The other
island states in the region include American Samoa, Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Guam, New
Caledonia, and Niue. The only place among them that has seen substantially more Chinese visitors is
Guam, which has doubled arrivals from 7,069 in 2011 to 14,547 in 2014.

Chinese Arrivals in Indian Ocean and Caribbean Sea
45.       Chinese arrivals in the Caribbean are just approximately 10 percent of their numbers in the
Indian Ocean. In the Caribbean, approximately 70 percent of arrivals have been concentrated in Cuba
since 2007 with 22,218 arrivals in 2013. The next largest destination is Trinidad and Tobago with 3,657
arrivals.

46.    Chinese arrivals in the Indian Ocean totaled 381,377 in 2013, with 87 percent concentrated in
the Maldives. Aside from the Maldives, Chinese visitors are also visiting Mauritius in increasing
numbers with nearly 42,000 visiting in 2013.
47.     Among Chinese, diving is fast growing in popularity. The first China Dive Expo was organized
in 2005 and now 10 years later, the Expo will be held in five Chinese cities. The sport is becoming
increasingly popular especially among High Net worth individuals 20.

Appendix 3: Use of Subsidies in Pacific Islands Air Transport
Introduction
1.       This Appendix approaches subsidies from the perspectives of routes and tourism. This is a
different type of subsidy regime than those being discussed today in the airline industry in the U.S.,
where U.S. based carriers are arguing that the Middle Eastern carriers of Qatar and Dubai are receiving
state subsidies in terms of capital and land, and are therefore accused of competing unfairly according
to the U.S. Open Skies framework. The subsidies discussed here are payments to airlines for
connecting certain city or airport pairs, usually a tourism destination with its target market of
originating tourists.

Extent of Use and Known Impacts of Airline Subsidies
2.      Subsidies for air routes have been in existence for a long time, and are regaining popularity in
some markets. A formal approach to subsidies is applied by the U.S. Department of Transportation:
Since deregulation of air services in 1978 meant that may smaller rural communities would lose air
connectivity, a subsidy program was put into place that now serves roughly 163 communities with
commuter airlines. 21 The routes are seen to require what is termed “essential air services”. The
program, however, has gone through significant reforms in the last four years, reducing the amount
of subsidies and raising eligibility requirements.

 Box 1: The World Routes Forum

 The power imbalance between airlines and airports is so large that there is actually an entire
 industry supporting the relationship between the two. The World Routes Forum, an annual event
 managed by Routesonline.com owned by UMB (UK) Ltd. out of Manchester, UK, specializes in the
 matchup between airlines and airports. The paying guests are airports, who, for a fee, can set up
 booths showcasing their location and features, and are staffed with airport officials. The invited
 guests, who do not have to pay an entrance fee, are the airlines, whose executives then stroll
 through the event hall looking at the different exhibits. If an airline becomes interested in an
 airport, the two have the option of heading off to a speed negotiation in a private meeting room,
 with a set time limit of 15 minutes. At this point the primary agreement between the two parties is
 struck, to be completed in detail later.

 In 2015, the event had 522 airports (241 from Europe and 101 from the Americas, with the UK
 having had 24 and the US having had 38) and 191 airlines as attendees, as well as 75 destinations
 (often represented by tourism authorities or boards).


3.      In general there is a significant power imbalance between airlines and airports (see Box 1).
Except for the largest hubs, where traffic is carefully allocated with gate slots, airlines in general have
the upper hand and control the supply of traffic, and it is the airports that court airlines to serve them.
This implies that airports often see it in their best interest to offer either direct subsidies or indirect
subsidies through steep discounts in airport fees.
4.      Not much specific is published on the use of subsidies by governments in support of their
country’s tourism industry, however it is known they are widely used in the Caribbean, their use has

service

                                                     78
been recently suggested to ministers of tourism in the Africa region22, and even the state of Maryland
in the U.S. subsidizes the connection by British Airways of Baltimore-Washington International Airport
(BWI) with London’s Heathrow International Airport (LHR). 23 It appears that as a new trend airlines
seem to seek subsidy mechanisms as a potential precondition for assuming new, riskier routes.

Use in the Caribbean
5.      Subsidies are widely used in the Caribbean, at the airlines’ request. The Caribbean Hotel and
Tourism Association established in 2009 that of 35 countries surveyed, with only 9 responding, a total
of US$ 50 million was spent on subsidies for airlift. 24
6.      There are two types of agreements that form the backbone of airline subsidy mechanisms in
the Caribbean:
         1. Minimum revenue guarantee agreements, and
         2. Marketing agreements

7.      Revenue guarantee agreements are usually with carriers from the U.S., where subsidies of
routes are legal. These act as insurance policies for carriers that if they fly a specific route they will
have a guaranteed minimum return.
8.      The agreements are negotiated with individual airlines, and are usually contained in
confidential memorandums of understandings. Because they are confidential, the competitive
position of one airline vis a vis another airline is not publicly revealed. After the agreements are signed,
usually an escrow deposit is made by the agreeing government for the amount the government has
agreed to insure the services.
9.      Minimum revenue guarantees are based on load factors: An airline agrees to fly a given route
on a given schedule with set frequencies, and the government agrees that if load factors fall below a
specified limit, the airline is entitled to funds from the escrow account to guarantee a minimum
revenue. In this case the government assumes the risk for the projected tourism traffic, which is
influenced by (a) the attraction of the country’s properties in targeted markets, and (b)
macroeconomic forces affecting the demand for tourism overall.
10.     Marketing agreement occur generally with Europeans carriers, since agreements in the form
of minimum revenues are not legal in the EU. The marketing agreement mechanism, therefore, is a
method of governments to support a route with a given airline while staying within the boundaries of
EU law.
11.     Marketing agreements also work with funds set aside, and a set minimum for traffic levels.
Should these minimums not be met, the airline (and in some cases the government also) can withdraw
from the funds to increase marketing for the route.

12.     Through confidential interviews and discussions it was revealed by a tourism minister that
one island nation in the Caribbean is willing to subsidize air services by up to US$ 50 per passenger.
With a distance of roughly 6,600 km between the island and London, UK, this amounts to 0.008
US$ per passenger kilometer, or US$ 0.01.

Criticisms and Impact
13.     Economists in general see the use of subsidies for non-essential air services routes in a
negative light for several reasons:

       •   Subsidies cause distortions in the marketplace by keeping ticket prices from reflecting the
           true cost of the air services being purchased by the traveller;
       •   Subsidies shift the risk of operation away from the airlines to the governments;
       •   Related to the two points above, subsidies in themselves reflect a market failure, since in
           itself the tourism and airline industries cannot price themselves sustainable in the
           marketplace:
                o Airline subsidies send a market signal that the tourism and hotel industry are not
                    sustainable
       •   Subsidies cause out-of-sector tax receipts to support the tourism and hotel industry
                o For example, it could be argued that the small-scale banana farmer on a Caribbean
                    island is paying, with his taxes, for the hotel industry, though he is receiving no
                    benefit.

14.      One common theme is that subsidies, in reality, reflect a lower quality of room stock. For
example, it has been argued that because of the high quality of properties in Jamaica, the Bahamas,
and the Dominican Republic, demand has been so consistent that though subsidy agreement exist, no
payments ever needed to be made.25 The argument continues by stating that because of the lack of
large, high-quality properties in the OECS, the islands’ tourism sectors are volatile, and thus the
airlines face more risk.
15.      Proponents for subsidies argue that the economic impact of air services is significant, and that
lack thereof places vital connectivity at risk. Airlift is an absolute necessity for islands’ tourism industry,
even for islands well within the reach of mainland ferries. Subsidies, so the argument is made,
rightfully shift risk away from airlines to governments, thus assuring the transport artery that can
supply visitors. In the OECS islands, for example, stay-over tourism provides roughly 90% of all tourism
revenue, and almost all stay-over tourists arrive by air. This can be estimated as roughly US$ 1.02
billion overall revenues, or US$ 1,042 per stay-over visitor. Proponents would argue that a $50
investment in airline subsidies per passenger produces nearly $1,000 in net revenues after subtracting
the subsidy. Similarly, the subsidy of British Airways flying between BWI and Heathrow is said to have
an economic gain of US$ 117 million per annum, which amounts to US$ 1,034 per passenger once the
subsidy is subtracted.

Subsidizing routes from China to Fiji, Samoa, and Vanuatu
16.    In 2015 there were no direct connections between the target islands and the key markets of
Shanghai, Beijing, and Chengdu (see Table A12). In addition, amongst the proposed hubs only Sydney
connects to China, and only via Beijing. Sydney also connects with Fiji, Vanuatu, and Samoa. With

     In reality, the Bahamas did make subsidy payments in 2012.

163,000 estimated seats with Beijing, the Sydney-Beijing route seems solid, as does the Sydney-Fiji
route, with over half a million seats. The Sydney-Samoa route does not seem sustainable in the long
run.
17.      Auckland also has healthy traffic between Fiji and Samoa. The traffic between Vanuatu and
other destination seems sustainable, though not to the sense that competition is likely. Between the
islands, the only connections existing are between Fiji and Samoa, which, with less than 50,000 Seats
does not seem sustainable 26, and between Fiji and Vanuatu.

18.      From a purely theoretical point of the view the best hub overall would be Fiji, keeping the
route lengths to a minimum for all origin/destination pairs except Chengdu-Vanuatu. The second-best
choice would be Brisbane, which also happens to be the best choice for Chengdu-Vanuatu. Sydney is
geographically not optimally placed – the only advantage Sydney would have is the already healthy
traffic with Beijing.
19.      Several route options emerge. One obvious route that could be marketed now and would not
require subsidies at this point would be Beijing-Sydney-Fiji. However, from this point forward other
options need to carefully account for the distances found in Appendix I. The most obvious set of
choices would be all routes going through Fiji. Though Fiji and Chengdu are not optimal, the
connections to the other islands from Chengdu still make Fiji the most efficient hub distance-wise,
and Fiji could feed its own tourism along with the same flights that bring in passengers for Samoa and
Vanuatu.
20.     Table A13 shows the lowest (or second lowest, in the case of Chengdu-Fiji-Vanuatu) per
passenger costs for the origin-destination pairs studied, based on the assumed cost of $0.01 per
passenger kilometer. 27 Of importance is the last row showing the cost per passenger for Fiji and the
three origins. If Fiji became a busy hub, this cost may go away as the route becomes sustainable
(50,000+ passengers annually). This would reduce the other costs by the amount apportioned to Fiji
as shown in Table A14.


26
   The route has 47,000 seats, and since load factors are assumed to be less than 100%, the number of
passengers would be below this threshold.
27
   The $0.01 price per passenger kilometre is derived from two sources: The $50 per passenger price cap
reported in the Caribbean mentioned in an earlier section of this report, and the annual subsidy of US$ 5.5
million paid by BWI for British Airways services with Heathrow, divided by an annual 108,000 passengers,
divided by 5,848 km, which amounts to US$ 0.009 per kilometre.

 Except for the 2nd row, Fiji is assumed to be the hub for
                     the other islands.

21.     A different case would emerge if existing services were considered. The route Beijing-Sydney
already exists, and if Sydney were to serve the other islands, subsidies could be lower as shown in
Table A15 below.

22.     Table A16 shows that even with existing services Auckland would still be more expensive, with
the exception of Chengdu.
23.    A mix of options would most likely not be advisable, since the purpose of using one hub is to
concentrate traffic and therefore load factors, making subsidies minimal. Guaranteed revenue
agreements only kick in when load factors fall below a giving threshold, for example 75%.

Caveat: Putting the Cart before the Horse
 Box 2: The Case of St. Lucia

 The interplay between hotel capacity and airlift is complex. One of the more dramatic examples
 of revenue guarantees gone wrong comes from the case of St. Lucia in 2007/2008. St. Lucia was
 making agreements with larger hotel developers to increase the quality of hotel stock through
 new hotels, and was counting on an expansion of 40% in hotel capacity in by 2008, with an
 additional 2,500 rooms coming on line. Hence there was much pressure to increase airlift: Since it
 takes a year for airlift capacity to come into place, St. Lucia started negotiating with American
 Airlines and others as soon as the new hotel development was expected. However, investment in
 new hotels dried out during the economic crises, and none of the anticipated expansion occurred.
 The airlines kept on flying with low load factors, and the final bill from the airlines came in the
 neighborhood of US$ 3 million for 2008.

24.    Historically the Caribbean payment of subsidies to airlines has been deeply tied to the quality
of properties and hotels. Though hotels deeply rely on airlift to fill rooms, airlift does not create

                                                             82
demand. Anecdotally Jamaica, for example, with its northern coast properties being in high demand,
has not needed to pay up on revenue guarantees, and the Bahamas, until 2012, also had a reputation
for not needing to subsidize. The OECS islands face the high cost of airlift precisely because of a
weakness in to properties. The story of St. Lucia (Box 2) is a telling.

Policy Recommendations
25.     The debate on using subsidies for non-essential air services can be approached from two
different directions:
    1. Because of the market distortions caused by subsidies, one can choose not to “play the
       game” at all, and refrain from applying any subsidy program to airlines, or
    2. One can claim that even though overall subsidies are a bad idea, they are now the trend in
       the industry, and rather than bucking the trend one has to play along.

26.    Many economists would choose the first option, but for the argument’s sake if the second
option were chosen, there would be a suggested framework for developing a subsidy program. The
program would have at minimum these features:
    •    The rise of airlift would be coordinated with the development of room stock
    •    Ideally, funding for the subsidies would come from within the tourism sector, for example a
         hotel association
    •    A clear limit per passenger kilometre would be set (suggested maximum at US$ 0.01)
    •    A clear load factor ceiling would be set above which no payments are due (suggested 75%)
    •    The government or implementing organization would monitor traffic and load factors real
         time, with the right to demand that an airline reduce frequencies if load factors falls below
         the defined floor.

Appendix 4: Development of air services between China and
the Pacific Islands - The of role of charters and the experience
of other small island states

Introduction
1.       The China Outbound market is now the world’s largest single country outbound market,
growing in volume terms and evolving in its sophistication and appetite for international travel. This
report describes the work and outcomes of a study project to provide insight into the characteristics
of the air travel and visitation market between China and various small Pacific states. The current state
of the Chinese market would suggest that opportunities exist for Pacific Island nations to develop a
Chinese travel market. There are significant visitor demographics which have previous international
travel experience and sufficient funds to consider a medium-haul destination. The Chinese outbound
travel market is highly seasonal, making it ideally suited to a charter tourism model. Peak periods for
travel are Chinese New Year in January/February, Golden Week in May and national holidays in
October.
2.        The research inquired how potential success factors, market support schemes and/or in
conjunction with air charter programs might be best used to generate economic benefits and to
encourage Chinese visitation to Pacific Island destinations. The study is primarily based on a study of
travel trends and outcomes for different small island destinations to establish best practices
applicable to supporting new target travel destinations in the Pacific. A number of experiences dealing
with the initiation of air services between China and the small island states is explored, by means of
initial charter programs.
3.      This Annex is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the charter models encountered during
the study; Section 3 describes the success factors encountered based on the views of interviewed
stakeholders that participated in the organization of such charter schemes, and provides
recommendations.

Charter models
4.      Based on the research conducted, it is not possible to single out individual models of charters
as the distinction and nature in which these air services are provided can be blurry. Nonetheless, in
broad terms, a definition of charter services can be conceptualized along 3 dimensions, which may or
may not be intertwined: (i) scale; (ii) operational delivery modality; (iii) push or pull-oriented.
    (i)   Scale
5.    From the interviews conducted, initial air service programs fell into three broad categories,
dependent on the scale and by nature of the service, whether strategic or commercial:

    •     Proof of Concept charters: or “First time” charters are the bare minimum in size and scale, as
          small as 2-3 return flights, which would include a ferry/positioning flight at the beginning and
          end of the program.

    •     Seasonal charters: generally tie into a traditional Chinese holiday period with broadly 6-7
          charters, operating 2-3 times per week over a 2-3 week period.


                                                    84
    •      Commercially-led charters: need to be significantly more sizeable in order to drive economies
           of scale, cover overhead, set up costs of the program, and ferry flights. Industry advice is that
           such programs would typically operate for a season or a minimum 16-week period at a once-
           weekly frequency

    (ii)    Operational delivery modality
6.       Within these categories there are also varying operational models for charters, each with
differing sets of client stakeholders. The following table provides a description of the type of
engagement, relationships, and structure of incentives between the main stakeholders involved.

    (iii)  Push or pull-oriented
7.     As far as the third dimension is concerned, it is important to have an understanding as to
whether a charter is supply-led or demand-led to appreciate what market is driving the charter service.
Over the course of the research, a number of core topics were identified as potentially relevant for
the successful initiation and completion of a charter program. The following chart tabulates and
summarizes the responses.

                    Supply-Led charters                     Demand-led charters from China

                    demand and demonstrate to local
                    tourism stakeholders.
 Initiation         In     two     instances,   tourism
                    organizations in the destination
                    country initiated the process; and
                    in the third a tour operator (in the    n/a
                    absence of a strategic lead from
                    government/tourism

 Risk bearing       The         initiator      (tourism
                                                            Tourism agents bear all the risk, not airlines. Airlines are
                    organization/industry     in     the

                    risks.

                    two of the cases. In the third case
                                                            n/a
                    the NTO was a partner, but did not

 Importance of      This was critical in all cases. All
 national carrier   three cases used the national
                    carrier. However the national
                    carrier did not take any part of the    n/a
                    commercial risk. The carrier
                    provided transport and undertook
                    the operational risk.
                    From the cases encountered:             Palau is an example of a demand-led charter launched
                    → One was a proof of concept            by a Chinese tour operator out of Hong Kong. This kick-

                    been repeated.                          2010 and 2014 (CAGR). Nonetheless, the rapid growth of

 EXAMPLE: SUPPLY-LED CHARTERS BETWEEN MAURITIUS-CHINA

 This third Supply-led charter initiative mentioned in the table above, which started out as a charter
 from Mauritius – China (and which has since led to scheduled airline service) was initiated and led
 by the tourism organization and government with the (state-owned) airline and tourism industry
 operators all partnering.

 In July 2011, the airline commenced connecting flights to Shanghai over Kuala Lumpur, which it
 operated once weekly until October 2012. During 2012, it operated two direct Shanghai services,
 (one service per season) as a proof of concept, and then direct air services commenced in January
 2013. From Shanghai, the Chinese program grew to encompass an additional destination per year,
 with Beijing added in 2013 and Chengdu in 2015.

 The program essentially operated at cost on the Chinese routes to keep the airfare component
 down. This is done in the interests of the greater tourism spend made by Chinese visitors in the
 destination (ideally) resulting in the economy deriving greater benefits than the actual cost. The
 initial scheduled model saw the majority of seats block-sold to Chinese travel agents, however the
 airline is looking at switching to a majority of direct sales as the market matures and Chinese
 consumers look to buy direct through online travel agents in China such as CTRIP/CYTS etc.


Success factors and recommendations
8.      During the research, a number of vital factors repeatedly surfaced as contributing to success
of charters from China into different small island states. How these factors impacted the charters will
be described in more detail in this section. The main identified success factors are: (i) Leadership; (ii)
Involved Stakeholder Partnership; (iii) No regulatory or policy barriers; (iv) Local Investment; (v)
Geography; (vi) Price; (vii) Brand Positioning; (viii) Commercial Focus; (ix) Understanding Strategic
Value of Charters; (x) Funding model; (xi) Seasonality; (xii) Sales and Distribution; (xiii) Itinerary; and
(xiv) Choice of Air Carrier. The section below also includes the main recommendations under each of
these success factors.

Leadership
9.       Research showed that successful charter programs had one clear leader in the overseas
market, a “local champion”, who was responsible for leading the charter initiative. It was important
for the leader to: be at a very senior level; be empowered to speak and act on behalf of all partners,
and; have connections at the highest levels to ensure things got done; engage the support of
government officials such as provincial governors or mayors in China; and typically be key member of
a tourism organization. One example provided in the interviews was the signing of a Memorandum
of Understanding between two municipalities, giving confidence of political support to the
prospective air service. In some instances the destination leader role was matched by a single point
of contact or entity in a leadership role in China (typically a tour operator/travel agent), incorporating
political support. It was found when this role was lacking in China, it was problematic to solve
problems from the destination, particularly as the charter date neared and details and queries arose
from the operational side of the charter.




                                                    87
-   Recommendations

10.     The development of two leader roles, leading the initiative for charters at both the local
destination end and also in China. The local leader, typically a tourism organization leader; and a tour
operator / travel agent in China.

Involved stakeholder partnership
11.     Once the process has been decided and advanced, the interviewed parties advised that
Chinese counterparts expect quick responses, prompting for good destination project management
and timely interventions. A clear partnership approach was seen as crucial to giving the risk-taker
confidence that it had the support of other entities and that they were committed to achieving a
common goal. To ensure the success of charter operations, it has proved vital that all partners are
aligned with each other; supportive of the leader; and clear on their roles and relative funding.

-   Recommendations

12.      It is recommended forming a Destination Team, led by the elected leader(s). The Destination
Team will be made up of all stakeholder partners and will be aligned with a clear understanding on
the charter strategy and the long-term vision of the air service. Stakeholder partners could include
tourism agencies, local government, hoteliers, tour companies, airports and airlines. It is
recommended that all parties within the Destination Team undertake cultural training and gain an
appreciation and understanding of the Chinese business culture. Chinese investment interests in the
Pacific islands are noted and an upcoming charter to Fiji for a Chinese government delegation/party
may seem irrelevant in the commercial world, but is highly significant in China.

No regulatory or policy barriers
13.      It is critical to enable movement of visitors in either direction through timely policy decisions;
and negotiations between nations and regulatory bodies, partly through the removal of any visa
restrictions and timely negotiation of air service rights or bilateral agreements ahead of demand. One
airline reported an oversight relating to visas for cabin crew in the immediate short term before the
first charter. Other stakeholders reported entering the Chinese market initially over Hong Kong
because of lower risk exposure to competition; greater familiarity with the market; reduced language-
based challenges; and access to a greater choice of supply side factors such as ground handlers, tour
operators etc. Moreover, another stakeholder reported major challenges, inconvenience and cost for
Chinese visitors related to visas. The same market was also challenged with a bilateral air service
agreement which was highly protectionist on high yielding hub to hub routes. The barrier was
overcome with lobbying.

-   Recommendations

14.      It is recommended that, should the long-term vision be to achieve direct scheduled services,
bilateral agreement negotiations should begin at the time of charter services discussions begin to
ensure no barriers restrict the growth of the service. Whilst charter licenses may appear relatively
easy to procure bilateral agreements can take years to negotiate. As a priority, we recommended
reviewing visa requirements, identifying any barriers there may be and working to remove these
barriers. Where no visas are required, promote this fact to the travel trade, as a strategic advantage
over competing destinations.

                                                    88
Local investment
15.      Successful programs actively engage local tourism partners early in the process so they
understand and appreciate the Chinese travel culture on a basic level. Examples include: hotel
infrastructure (i.e. reconfiguration of public areas for shopping or dedicate room blocks to the Chinese
market in alignment with a charter program); language services (tour guides); utilizing translation apps
for occasions when the language barrier cannot be overcome and a tour guide is unavailable/out of
hours; translation of printed material; welcome packs; signage or wayfinding in Chinese language;
Chinese specific food and beverage offers; wireless internet; payment options (China Union
Pay/AliPay); and general hospitality and specific cultural awareness training of customer facing staff.

-   Recommendations

16.     It is recommended that the Destination Team local tourism partners invest in key components
of the visitor experience such as language services (tour guides), translation of printed material,
welcome packs, signage, and food and beverage offer, wireless and payment options (China Union
Pay/AliPay).

17.    Tourism stakeholders need support to see the benefit of investment, in adapting their existing
product and the associated costs against the result of diversification of visitor market and greater long
term sustainability of their business through reduced risk exposure to core markets.

18.       Long term strategies for destination management and economic development to encourage
investment in infrastructure such as shopping centers, which enhance the appeal of the destination
for all visitors (not just Chinese) and benefit locals is recommended. It is recommended that ground-
based tourism partners invest in technology, such as Wi-Fi, enabling Chinese visitors to be online and
connected to their preferred social media apps.

Geography
19.     Second tier cities (and airports) in China appear to offer greater flexibility and greater initial
potential for charters than the major hubs of Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. The major hubs are
home to the first tier Chinese carriers and often have barriers to entry for overseas carriers due to the
following issues: congestion; protectionism; and slot availability; competition with existing scheduled
services. Some secondary cities and provincial governments have invested in the development of
aviation strategies and are keen to grow their aviation sectors. It was apparent that a secondary city
offers a smaller pool of direct destinations (less competition for the charter), and in one instance a
provincial government is reported to be paying subsidies for scheduled services to operate to
outbound destinations. It would be counterproductive to compete with other subsidized services.

20.      Markets such as Guam and Palau are relatively close to China and can be reached with a
narrow body aircraft. Equally, from within China, Beijing is further away from the majority of target
destinations than Guangzhou. Proximity will impact: overall ticket cost; flight time; fuel burn; ferry
costs; and aircraft choice, as narrow body aircraft have roughly half the seats on board of a wide body
aircraft, further reducing risk as there are fewer seats to fill.




                                                   89
-   Recommendations

21.      A serious consideration of second tier cities (and airports) in China over the major hubs of
Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou should be given. The major hub markets are busy, and an overseas
carrier with an island destination will struggle to gain a foothold, given the relatively niche volumes of
visitors generated by the proposed charter, the assurances that there is no lack of demand, and the
more compelling argument that a medium sized travel agent could be highly significant to the success
of the charter. The benefit of a medium sized travel agency is that the charter program will not
overlooked as a great value proposition as it may be in a large national travel agency but at the same
time, isn’t so small that the agency has a shortage of communication and sales channels in marketing
to the consumer.

22.      We recommend a secondary Chinese city as an initial source market and a strategy to form a
relationship with a provincial government to support the development of relations between the two
communities. Geographically, the closer the source market, the lower the costs. Cities such as Wuhan
or Chengdu have been active in recent aviation announcements and may also be viable secondary
cities to consider.

Price
23.     Respondents did not identify price as an issue, reporting successful islands positioned
themselves for high yield markets. Respondents commented that volumes are so great that pricing
does not become a factor as the market demand exists; and that high yield can be achieved by
charging significant rooms rates, rather than discounting and starting at the bottom of the market.

Brand positioning
24.     Chinese travelers are highly aware of brands when they choose their travel destination. Hotel
brand has been identified as an important success factor and should be pushed when marketing the
Island product.

25.     Chinese consumers have: a comfort factor around known, major brands (e.g. Sheraton /
Hilton); the consumer can equate these brands to an expected level of service and facility (in
comparison with an SME-based, independently run accommodation provider).

Commercial Focus
26.      Adopting a long term view of how to make a market sustainable and have commercial
outcomes for all partners is a significant success factor. Long term sustainability and moving from
charter to scheduled services should always be built on commercial imperatives. To achieve this,
airlines, tour operators, hoteliers and tour providers need: a clear understandings of why they are
taking risk in a charter program; and a vision of where the strategy is taking them to justify the
investment required.

27.     For an airline with mobile assets, “what’s in it for me” may be two-fold, with benefits from:
short term access to the Chinese market as a first mover advantage; and longer term assurance of the
opportunity to operate the route, extract yield and grow its business in line with the strategic
objectives of its business plan. A small charter program suffers from barriers in terms of economies of
scale. For example, a charter tour operator in a mature (non-Chinese) market reported they would
never consider a charter program of less than 16 weeks, in order to distribute the cost of the

                                                   90
positioning/ferry flights across the greatest possible cost base and recover the overheads associated
with operating to a new market and finding new partners. A dilemma exists whereby a charter is
enormously costly to set up and cannot possibly cover its costs and be viable in a purely commercial
environment.

28.       More than one respondent commented on the importance of a two-way visitor market
impacting the financial viability of the program, i.e. the ability to sell outbound travel from the non-
Chinese destination, to spread the risk of a fully-inbound market and offset some of the costs of
aircraft positioning flights, which otherwise operate empty and add to the overheads of the program.
It is unlikely in the case of the Pacific Islands that outbound markets wishing to travel to China would
be high in volume, but a local travel agent with good direct sales and marketing efforts could be
effective in selling cut price tickets and offsetting a small proportion of the costs.

-   Recommendations

29.    It is recommended a charter strategy firmly focused on the long term and clearly articulated
around a five year vision. The first charter is the stepping stone to the long term program, which
should be focused on being commercially driven by market forces, without the need for market
support mechanisms and incentives. The strategy can remove over time, as partners become
confident in the viability of the Chinese visitor market to the Pacific Islands.

Understanding the strategic value of a charter
30.     Whilst a charter might never happen for purely commercial reasons, when considered for
strategic reasons it might be seen to have merit on two levels:

31.      Familiarity/debunking myth: One respondent reported a first tier Chinese carrier had
consistently been reluctant to consider a destination because of perceived risks at an unfamiliar,
regional airport (compared to the carrier’s core market of major cities). By being contracted to operate
a charter, the carrier was forced to concede it could operate successfully to the airport and therefore
made a future proposal to consider the destination for more services more realistic/viable, as the
carrier was forced to go beyond its comfort zone by a charter program.

32.       Proving the market/demonstrating the destination’s commitment: One tourism organization
and tourism ministry commissioned a charter program primarily as a proof of concept to both the
travel trade in China and to its own local tourism stakeholders, who were forced to stop
procrastinating and invest in adapting their existing services and facilities to the needs of the Chinese
visitor (language, signage, printed material, food and beverage etc.).

-   Recommendations

33.    It is recommended to utilize the “Proof of Concept” charters as the model under which to
develop the first series of charters. It is recommended that the “Proof of Concept” program is created,
funded and executed in order to demonstrate to all parties (island-based stakeholders as well as
Chinese travel trade) that the market is viable.




                                                   91
Funding model
34.      One single funding model, incorporating all partners with a clear timeline, deliverables and
measurable is another key factor to overall success. Funds allocated should be transparent to all
partners internally within the deal, whilst being commercial in confidence from the outside, with
potential for two separate funds: (i) long term marketing fund; and (ii) short term charter specific
fund. One respondent cited a key learning in this area arising from multiple funding models with an
airline chartered and therefore paid to fly on one hand; and taking incentives from an airport on the
other hand, thereby creating tension with the risk-taking tour incentivized by the tourism organization
on a per-visitor basis. Hoteliers advised some challenges with getting paid and as such their preference
was to work through Inbound Tour Operators rather than attempting to procure payment, particularly
when the contract was short term and there was no previous relationship or credit history with the
Chinese entity.

-   Recommendations

35.      A single funding model, incorporating all partners with a clear timeline, deliverables and
measurable is recommended. All parties should be under one incentive structure, not disparate side
deals (for example: airport and airline in one deal, tourism organization and travel wholesalers in a
separate deal on the same flight/program). Funds should be spent on marketing the destination or
directly supporting the charter, ensuring seats are sold, the service is a success and ultimately leads
to sustainable tourism growth. Marketing incentive funds should be transparent and spent on
marketing.

36.      Once the level of base support has been determined the most appropriate and effective
‘vehicle’ to support a charter proposal is through a cooperative marketing agreement. The agreement
is a formal agreement initially drafted by the client government’s tourism agency and signed by both
parties. The agreement prescribes a range of brand and tactical marketing programs over the charter
season. This can extend to web ads, newsletter offers, destination branding, flyer membership
incentive offers, email alerts etc. As a guide, approximately 50% of the final payment is made on
presentation of the charter report along with proposals for the following season. While China’s airlines
(RPT and Charter) may have experience at operating at this level of sophistication, they provide access
to high value media and sales networks.

Seasonality
37.     An important success factor is to time the charter to coincide with lower-demand or lower-
yield periods.

38.      Target charter programs should be considered for a time period when: the destination has
the capacity to absorb new visitors; and tourism operators are incentivized to participate and
potentially reduce rates in the interest of countering seasonality. One interviewee noted a charter
failure when a charter eventuated at a high yielding period from an established source market creating
many difficulties for hoteliers and tour providers in accommodating a lower yielding market,
impacting the destination’s ability to have a team/partnership approach to the charter. A further
benefit of smart scheduling of charters with existing markets is extending shoulder seasons, offsetting
trough periods and no necessity to invest in developing new properties and room stock, to
accommodate a higher risk new market.


                                                  92
-   Recommendations

39.     It is recommended that the charter is timed to coincide with lower-demand or lower-yield
periods.

40.     As previously observed, there is a strong fit between the seasonal outbound profile of peak
Chinese demand and the seasonal shoulder/trough periods in the Pacific Islands. A degree of risk exists
around Chinese New Year travel and the cyclone season, making that the least favorable of the three
peak Chinese periods. In addition it is also one of the most expensive periods to be considering
chartering aircraft, therefore May and October are recommended in the first instance. It is
recommended for hotels segregating their visitor market seasonally, and dedicating certain periods
to Chinese market, aligned with the charter program. This strategy has been successfully deployed in
the Maldives, where cultural differences between traditional source markets and Chinese visitors had
created tension.

Sales and distribution
41.     Successful charters adopted a range of sales and distribution strategies to cover multiple
markets and channels and monitored results and relative success. In terms of the existing sales
channels, understanding the role of the travel agent is crucial, with consumers being told where to go
by the travel agent rather than requesting assistance of getting to somewhere they have already pre-
determined they want to visit.

42.     Currently, the role of travel agents is significant, however the market is fast moving from
distribution by traditional channels (such as travel agents) to online/direct sales. Travel agents will be
required for small charter programs but as the model shifts to direct scheduled flights and awareness
of the destination rises, a parallel shift in direct sales is possible.

43.      Identifying a target Chinese consumer market for the future would be needed; ideally this will
be in a secondary market in China where there will be less competition from the traditional scheduled
services from large Chinese hubs. Also, identifying travel retailers/wholesalers best placed to sell
seats/beds in China market. In a small scale program, such distributors are typically niche operators
with their own clientele and own methods of selling (e.g. seminar-based dinners etc. not just
traditional marketing channels). Being visible on Chinese distribution systems, such as CTRIP, CYTS etc.
and to have airfares on TravelSky will be important as trends change.

44.      One charter operator experienced its best sales from a travel agent adopting an unusual direct
sales approach. It is noted, however, that the volume of visitors a relatively short charter can deliver
is small, therefore the product is relatively niche and likely to be less attractive to major wholesalers
working in the mass market. All Chinese partners will need to be flexible and have an appetite for risk
and a passion for the destination; this attribute in Chinese partners was seen to be a key learning in
one first-time charter experience.

-   Recommendations

45.     It is recommended investing in a parallel sales, marketing and PR strategy alongside the
charter program to raise awareness of the destination with consumers and travel trade and to develop
long term demand.

46.     The strategy should be multi-channel, and incorporate traditional business to business
elements focused on the travel trade and digital marketing targeted directly at consumers, as well as
innovative PR, maximizing opportunities as they arise. It is recommended that aspirational imagery is
used to capture visitor imagination and position the markets for high yield.

47.       Charters, being a small volume program, will initially sell best through travel agents, but the
Chinese market is quickly evolving and direct sales will be the future. Working with online entities
such as CTRIP and CYTS who are leading development, to position for direct sales is recommended. It
is also recommended that packages be structured around branded hotels and in units commensurate
with ground transport, e.g. 22-seater mini buses and blocks of 10 rooms. It must be understood that
the demand for charters to Pacific Island destinations will be a niche market in China. This will re
typically demonstrated by an experienced traveler (rather than first-time international traveler), who
will be looking for something different and unique. Identify USP of each Pacific Island travel experience
and market accordingly to niche travel agents, building on the success of each destination’s existing
branding (e.g. Vanuatu/volcano experience or Fiji/island hospitality/smiles etc.)

Itinerary
48.      The success of the execution of the initial charters is a high determining factor in whether
there will be future activity. It has repeatedly been determined that a vital key to customer satisfaction
in Chinese charter programs include: ground content; extensive tour programs; incorporating key
activities and lots of photo opportunities; language investment; and food investment. If these factors
are not in place, or visitors are dissatisfied, the program is unlikely to perpetuate. One respondent
commented a poorly executed ground program on an initial charter lived long in the memories of the
Chinese, and it impacted on the market and took eight years to negotiate a scheduled service in a
major market.

-   Recommendations

49.      It is recommended to invest in bringing activity and tour operators “on the journey” to the
Chinese market as a Destination Team, to ensure they develop appropriate programs for Chinese
visitors as ground content is key to customer satisfaction. Chinese visitors want an extensive program
incorporating key activities and lots of photo opportunities. Where destinations lack for expected
content, such as shopping and casinos, consider approaches which have been successful elsewhere in
places like Mauritius, Palau and the Competitor set. We recommended partnering with another
destination for a two-center program as visitation and volumes grow (e.g. Maldives/Dubai) in the case
of Vanuatu and Samoa.

Choice of carrier
50.      Markets in which a local (Island State) carrier is available saw early success as they were able
to enter the Chinese market without the additional challenges of negotiating capacity with Chinese
carriers. Reasons to pursue a local carrier is due to the fact that generally local carriers are: keen to
enter China and develop the market, and could be government owned. Government-owned carriers
are strategically able to operate to China without as strong a focus on commercial outcomes as the
key imperative is to cover costs only and enable access in the interests of in-market Chinese spending
and flow through economic benefits.

51.     When pursuing a local carrier is not an option, a second tier carrier in China may have a greater
interest in developing business in tourism than the first tier carriers at the major hubs. The same
degree of detail paid to the ground experience at the Island state airport for that non-local needs to
be ensured so that the carrier is satisfied in terms of service, language, food etc. One first-time charter
had poor feedback due to a relatively minor issue when a locally-based carrier failed to anticipate the
ordering of Chinese breakfasts.

-   Recommendations

52.      It is recommended pursuing initial charters with a local airline partner (from the destination
island in the Pacific) where possible. Non-Chinese carriers are generally more engaged in entering the
market than Chinese carriers, and prepared to take more risk. Generally local carriers have strong
relationships with the local leader and other tourism partners, presenting a team approach to the
charter opportunity. However it should be noted that local carriers can be challenged in the regulatory
environment, operationally and logistically when entering China for the first time. Local carriers are
generally easier to negotiate with and bring into the Destination Team in the first instance.
