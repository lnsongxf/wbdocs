Methodology overview
Introduction
The World Bank Institute (WBI) contracted Keystone to carry out a formative
evaluation of the OnTrack Platform for Citizen Feedback and design a
methodology for evidence-based improvement in implementation going forward.

As stated in the terms of reference (ToR) for this assignment and emphasized by
project leader, Natalia Agapitova, the overall approach is to learn from the past
in order to ensure that evidence for real-time improvement is available for
future projects that seek to establish ICT-enabled citizen feedback mechanisms.

The assignment had two main objectives:

      Evaluate the quality the OnTrack program and distill lessons of
       experience about identification, piloting and scaling out of innovations in
       the WBG including evidence-based decision making process; Identify the
       initial conditions and factors that should be in place for the successful
       deployment of OnTrack and other innovations.

      Develop a framework for adaptive management of digital engagement
       initiatives using the experience and findings from the assessment of
       OnTrack.


The work started on 5 December 2013 (formal contract from 27 December
2013) with virtual and in-person discussions with key members of the OnTrack
team and ODTA to set the expectations and the parameters for the work to be
carried out. A focal point was established within the OnTrack team (Alexandra
Endara) who provided Keystone with internal documents relevant to the
evaluation, as well as necessary explanations and clarifications regarding the
platform and the way the work of OnTrack is structured and organized.

Keystone’s approach to reviewing the OnTrack pilots has been to start by
clarifying the program’s theory of change. On the basis of that, a series of
indicators for the evaluation were developed and the accompanying data sources
and data collection methods were identified. They comprised a combination of
quantitative and qualitative inquiry, covering the whole spectrum of involved
stakeholders, from end project beneficiaries to WB senior management. The
tools used for data collection, as well as the list of consulted documents and
stakeholders are included in this annex. Keystone’s Constituent Voice
methodology has been used as the analytical framework for the review.
OnTrack’s theory of change
On 17 December 2013, an in-person 3-hour session was held at WB offices. The
session was facilitated by Keystone’s David Bonbright, with participation from
OnTrack and ODTA team members that have a stake in the evaluation. The
purpose of the session was to gather input on the project’s theory of change,
which can be used by Keystone as a basis for setting the indicators and metrics
for the evaluation and evaluation framework. We have used this input to sketch
out a theory of change for OnTrack, which is presented in the following section.

OnTrack aims to create the conditions for effective feedback loops between
users, governments and public service providers. This will lead to improved
public services and, ultimately, to better development outcomes from World
Bank finance and advice.

OnTrack is based on the premise that the use of ICTs enables broader citizen
participation and contributes to making the feedback process more efficient and
effective.

The key constituents of the theory of change are:

      Users of public services: They monitor the state and quality of public
       services in their area and report complaints and suggestions using the
       OnTrack platform. They also provide stories on project implementation.
       These people are identified as the beneficiaries of the World Bank
       supported projects in which the OnTrack program is being tested.

      Project Implementation Units/public service providers: Their role is to
       ensure that the OnTrack platforms are in place and functioning correctly.
       They promote awareness of OnTrack among service users and are in
       charge of the management of the platform. They ensure that the feedback
       provided by citizens is used to take actions to improve the quality of the
       public services. They also report back to citizens on actions taken in
       response to their feedback.


      OnTrack program staff: Their role is to act as innovators, facilitators and
       advisors in establishing effective feedback mechanisms. They provide an
       advisory service for WB supported projects to set up and run platforms
       for citizens to provide feedback on the services they receive and for
       governments/public authorities to respond to it.

Two other constituent groups play an important role in ensuring the
preconditions for OnTrack’s success:

      The government authorities responsible for the PIUs. They have the last
       word on key decisions regarding targeted public services and are in a
       position to create the enabling environment. They also provide the
       necessary authorization for PIUs to implement OnTrack effectively.
       Project Team Leaders and WB country offices. Their buy-in is crucial in
        developing and implementing OnTrack in WB supported projects. They
        provide key insights on local and project-specific context, as well as
        ensuring in-country support and managing relations on the ground.

In order for all these actors to contribute effectively to the OnTrack feedback
loop, a series of key preconditions and intermediate outcomes are necessary.
These are shown in the following graphic representation of OnTrack’s theory of
change:

Sampling

Purposeful sampling was used for the interviews with World Bank staff and PIUs,
as well as for the online survey of World Bank staff, aiming to collect information
and perceptions from as many as possible of those stakeholders that have been
directly involved in the implementation and/or supervision of the OnTrack
pilots.

A mix of convenience and purposeful sampling was used for focus group
discussions held with project beneficiaries in Santa Cruz, Bolivia and Kapilvastu,
Nepal. They included both beneficiaries that have and have not received
orientation regarding OnTrack.

For the face-to-face survey of PAR beneficiaries in Santa Cruz Bolivia, stratified
sampling with random selection of alliances and members was used to design a
representative sample. A detailed methodological report prepared by the
company who carried out the data collection on the ground (Ipsos) is included at
the end of the next section.

Analytical framework

In order to examine OnTrack’s relevance and potential in achieving its stated
outcomes, Keystone’s work was guided by its core methodology, Constituent
Voice1. We use the Hirschman Voice Cycle as a framework against which to
assess OnTrack program quality. The Hirschman Voice Cycle is a distillation of
over 7 years of work in implementing successful citizen feedback systems.

This evaluation framework is not rigid, and is not applied in a mechanistic way.
Rather, it is an exhaustive checklist, albeit an organized one, of the features one
would expect to see in an effective feedback mechanism. It is not assumed that
OnTrack will meet the Hirschman Voice Cycle elements in any particular way.
The evaluation, however, describes precisely how OnTrack addresses each of the
features in the five-step cycle: design, collect, analyze, dialogue, and course
correct.

 For more details on Keystone’s Constituent Voice method, please see Constituent Voice - Technical
Note 1.
Figure 2 The Hirschman Voice Cycle




Specifically, for each step of the cycle we analyze a series of elements that speak
directly to OnTrack’s likelihood to contribute to better results for public service
delivery and its efficiency in enabling and tracking behavioural changes of key
stakeholder groups, as stated in the evaluation questions included in the TOR.

The table below presents the elements that are examined under each step.

Limitations to the evaluation

The following are the main limitations that we encountered in the process of
reviewing the OnTrack pilot implementations:

     Lack of information on project design
There is little information available, at least in written form, regarding the design
of the OnTrack program. We are lacking documents that clearly state the
objectives and goals of the project and that lay out the strategy and assumptions
behind it. Similarly, we are lacking a monitoring plan for the project with the
corresponding indicators. This circumstance poses a limitation to the evaluation
in the sense that additional inquiry has been required for clarifying the project’s
theory of change, which includes sense making and pulling each element from
different documents and sources. Furthermore, no monitoring data are available
except from monthly reports on website traffic.

     Limited use of the platforms
OnTrack operated in 2 out of 4 pilot countries, where it was live for just over a
year. As we discuss in the findings, there were almost no addressable issues
reported by users on any of the 3 project platforms. This gave us little
information to work with, especially in correlating the reporting of issues with
actual fixes/development results.

     Difficulties in consulting with certain key stakeholders
Namely, a key member of the OnTrack team has not made themselves available
for an interview with the Keystone team.

Furthermore, we were not put in touch with the company that has developed the
platform, as their contract with the WB was being renegotiated and the team
considered that it was not adequate to include them in the process. This has led
to having to rely solely on information provided by OnTrack staff regarding the
process for developing and technical specificities of the platforms. It has also
implied the impossibility of running an online survey of website visitors, as the
collaboration of the developers was necessary (see below).

Limitations regarding reaching the designed sample in the survey of PAR
beneficiaries in Bolivia, are discussed in Ipsos methodological report included at
the end of the next section.


    Difficulties for remotely surveying platform users
OnTrack staff have brought to our attention the following limitations for carrying
out an online and SMS/phone survey:
           o Privacy issues/lack of authorization by users to contact them using
              the phone numbers and email addresses registered on the
              OnTrack platform
           o Very limited use of the platforms
              o Impossibility to make changes on the platform support (website),
                so not possible to place a banner for the online survey.
              o Political sensitivity by PIUs who may not want a third party to
                contact directly their constituents for a survey

 Due to these difficulties we were only able to carry out a test SMS survey for PAR
 beneficiaries in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. However this test was unsuccessful as the
 phone numbers extracted from the back log of the platform were mainly those of
 agricultural extension workers (PAR employees) that had registered their
 personal phone numbers for demonstration purposes during the orientation
 sessions they had held with beneficiaries.

    10. Could you put us in contact with them? We would like to have a
        similar discussion with them?

It might not be practical, due to time constraints, to schedule the focus group
with people that have not participated in the information sessions after this
FG is done. So, it might be better that this information is solicited at the
moment that they are invited to participate in the FG.

Staff online questionnaire


Email for sending out survey:

Dear [FirstName]

At the Annual Meetings last year, World Bank President Jim Kim said " "[We]
must become a better listener. Last year, we had beneficiary feedback on 34
percent of our projects. We promise that for our projects with clear beneficiaries,
we will get feedback – from every single one of them, 100 percent."

Keystone Accountability has been assigned by WBI’s Innovation Labs to review
the experience of its innovative online tool for beneficiary feedback -- OnTrack.
In particular, we are studying OnTrack experiences of Nepal, Bolivia, and Zambia
to create a real-time adaptive management methodology that OnTrack and other
ICT-enabled feedback mechanisms may use going forward.

As part of this assignment we are carrying out an online survey of all World Bank
staff that have been involved in the design and implementation of OnTrack.
Please take 15 minutes to take the survey using this link [SurveyLink]
Please answer the questions based on your experience so far with OnTrack. If
you do not know the answer to a question, please choose “I don’t know” or leave
it blank.

All individual responses will be treated confidentially. We will however
acknowledge the contribution of the different staff members that respond to the
survey (hopefully ALL of you!).

Should you have any questions regarding the survey or this assignment, please
do not hesitate to contact me at natalia@keystoneaccountability.org or the
Project Lead from WBI: Natalia Agapitova at nagapitova@worldbank.org.

Thank you for your time,

Alliances Project) beneficiaries in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. The survey was
carried out in 33 Rural Alliances. The main objective of the study was to
understand the reasons for using or not a system of feedback from project
beneficiaries, through mobile phone. This objective was accomplished by means
of face-to-face household interviews among the beneficiaries of the selected
rural alliances. Respondents were selected by random contact through listing
method. The survey took place from May 24th to June 30th 2014.

Units of analysis and sampling:
The unit of analysis was the beneficiary in a rural alliance; the sampling units
were rural alliances.

Sampling technique and selection method:
The technique applied corresponds to a three-stage stratified sampling method:

                                                      beneficiary

Due to the reduced number of Rural Alliances, a random selection within 141
alliances was conducted with a total of 46 selected Rural Alliances. In our
experience, while working with a national representative sample; 40 localities
are more than enough for national study coverage. According to this, 46 alliances
were randomly selected in order to provide a representative sample to a
universe of 141 alliances. Also the client’s budget and timeframe were taken into
consideration in order to have equal weighting between representativeness,
timings and budget.

Nevertheless, once fieldwork started, Ipsos had some difficulties due to the lack
of updated information on the provided list, 82 alliances were discarded during
the telephone contacts and visits to localities. This represents a 58% of the
sampling units, leaving a 42% of available alliances to contact.
        The final sampling frame was built using the remained available data, which
        contained 2488 available beneficiaries named primary sampling unit. These
        beneficiaries were distributed into 59 rural alliances.

        Also a proportional dispersion of provinces and municipal sections were taken
        into consideration during the random selections of Rural Alliances, in order to
        have a representative sample among Rural Alliances. The list of Rural Alliances
        selected for the proposal can be found below:

        Women members’ Rural Alliances.

        Within the universe of beneficiaries of the PAR (5.992) a total number of 362
        interviews were estimated to obtain a representative sample with a margin of
        error of + 5% at a confidence level of 95%. The sample was adjusted into 500
        interviews for a lower margin of error: + 4.2% estimated at a confidence level of
        95%.

        Due to the lack of updated information on the provided list, cancellations of
        appointments by heads of alliances (that discarded 57% of the alliances), and a
                     deadline to complete the project; Ipsos had to recalculate the sample so that it
                     managed to reach the minimum 362 surveys. In order to accomplish this sample,
                     Ipsos increased the number of interviews to be applied in those alliances where
                     an appointment was effective, to reach the minimum of surveys reflecting a
                     margin of error of + 5% at a confidence level of 95%.

                     As a final result, Ipsos was able to achieve 439 effective surveys on 33 visited
                     alliances, this represents a margin of error of + 4,5% at a confidence level of
                     95%. The final list of Rural Alliances visited and the final sample can be found

                     For the selection of respondents, initially there was a first telephone contact with
                     the heads of the Rural Alliances.
   •   The Rural Alliance was replaced if the phone number called was busy, and
       only after 10 missed call attempts at least.
    • The Rural Alliance was replaced when the contact phone number was not
       available, and only after 3 attempts at least.
    • If a phone number did not correspond to the universe, the client was
       informed in order to remove the number from the base or in order for the
       client to provide an updated phone number.
To replace the discarded Rural Alliance by any of the reasons described above,
the non selected Rural Alliances were used. Subsequently, we checked for the
province, the municipality and the number of beneficiaries of the discarded
Rural Alliance to choose a replacement that met the same features and
proceeded to contact the heads of those alliances, using the following
methodology:

Replacement of Alliances by Listing
Contacts marked in blue were the first selected (those who meet the
requirements to replace the discarded alliance). If rejected, we continued with
the following alliance of the list until effective contact with the head of alliance
was achieved.




Source of above table: Based on previous studies.

When telephone contacts with the heads of alliances were effective, we briefly
explained the reason for the call, requiring them to prepare a list of all members
of the alliance and we programmed a date for the interviewers to visit them at
the locality.

Once in the locality, our staff contacted the head of the alliance first, in order to
give him or her, a letter (provided by Ipsos and previously approved by the
client) explaining the reason of our presence and to ask for the list of all the
members. Subsequently, with the list of all partners provided by the head of
alliance, our staff firstly selected the potential interviewees, according to the
methodology outlined below.

Surveys by Listing
Contacts marked in blue were the first selected. If rejected, the team continued
with the following person on the list until an effective contact interview was
achieved.
Source of above table: Based on previous studies.

Quotas:
The fieldwork conducted applied soft gender quotas when possible. The lack of
knowledge of the gender distribution within each alliance, could not ensure
strict enforcement of quotas.

REPRESENTATIVENESS OF THE SAMPLE
The final design represents 54% of the total beneficiaries available of the 59
Rural Alliances left (2.488 available beneficiaries) once 82 alliances were
discarded due to lack of updated information (wrong numbers, non responses,
non existing alliances and cancelled visits).

CHARACTERISTICS OF FIELD FORCE
In this project, 11 interviewers and 12 supervisors were able to work in the
project. These were mostly part-time university students or adults with a
technical or university diploma, who were selected based on a two-stage
process: a personal interview and an evaluation of logical reasoning.

No junior personnel were allowed to participate, due to the interviewee selection
methodology. Only interviewers and supervisors that had 1 or more years
working at the company were able to participate of the project. Also 80% to 90%
of them had experience with prior studies that inclued the selection
methodology of interviewees.

The list of characteristics of interviewers can be found below:

Ipsos was responsible for carrying out the local training of interviewers and
supervisors.
The primary trainer was the Ipsos Research Executive in charge of the project
(Daniel Loza); this primary trainer personally conducted the first training to
interviewers and to the secondary trainer (the local field coordinator).

The training provided to interviewers was two-fold. On the first hand, when
interviewers started working with Ipsos on any project, they were trained on
how to read and follow the route card instructions in order to conduct their
route adequately. When being trained on a specific project, this training is
repeated to ensure that all interviewers follow route card instructions correctly.

In the second part of the training (the order is indifferent), the Research
Executive in charge of the study, or the secondary trainers explained the general
objective and nature of the study. The sampling instructions were clarified in
terms of the skip to be applied between contacts of the list provided by the head
of alliance, interviewee selection, and interviewee replacement.

Then a detailed training was conducted on the application of the survey itself.
This was done using a projection of the survey on the wall/board or by using
Smartphones and asking the interviewers to read and apply the questions out
loud to the trainer. This made the training session more interactive and allowed
the trainer to “set up possible unexpected or biased answers” for the
interviewers, giving incomplete or inaccurate answers to provoke the
interviewer to react and ask the “pretend interviewee” (trainer) to clarify his
answer. In other cases the trainer gave an accurate answer but difficult to code in
the response table, to check whether interviewers understood how to register
the answer given by the interviewee. Special emphasis was placed on the
application of filters, consistencies and any other complex question.

During the training session every interviewer had the smartphone survey, a
printed copy of the questionnaire and the showcards in front of them to be able
to take notes and ask questions about the survey.

At the end of the training session, the trainer asked the interviewers to conduct a
“pilot test” amongst themselves, allowing them to practice the application of the
survey and allowing the trainer to resolve any doubts that may arise from the
application of the survey. If the trainer detected any interviewers who did not
fully grasp the correct application method of the survey, the trainer decided to
re-train them or to leave them off the team for the specific project.

FIELDWORK PROCEDURES
Fieldwork was conducted Monday to Sunday with a focus on Monday to
Saturday; between 6am or 7am to 8pm.
Considering the nature of the study, Ipsos considered it was not necessary to
provide incentives to respondents.
QUALITY CONTROL
100% of each interviewer’s production was directly observed (accompanied
supervisions); additional back-checking was done by telephone where there was
telephone service.


DATA PROCESSING
Data coding:
The open-ended responses were prepared for data entry by elaborating a
codeframe.

Data entry control:
A data entry software was developed based on the final questionnaire. This data
entry software had controls which allow to minimize errors in the data entry
process.

Furthermore, during all data entry process, the research team in charge did daily
verification the data in order to control progress at field.


Data checking:
Once the database was complete, the data was thoroughly checked to control any
filters and inconsistencies in the data. The data checking was carried out by the
programmer in charge of creating the data entry software together with the
Executive Analyst and Research Asistent in charge of the study.

SAMPLE SIZE
The final data base included 439 interviews.

INTERVIEW LENGTH
The average length of the field survey was of 10 minutes.

PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED
All problems encountered during fieldwork were reported to the client.
82 Alliances were discarded due to lack of updated information from May 24th to
June 27th.
    a) Wrong phone numbers
    b) Non response at phone numbers
    c) Non available phone numbers
    d) Incomplete phone numbers
    e) Blocked or out of service phone numbers
    f) Non existent or dissolved alliances
Also PAR members helped update some of the phone numbers during the first
week of June, but it couldn’t prevent 58% of the sampling frame being discarded.

See below the list of all 82 alliances discarded:

                         During fieldwork 4 head of alliances cancelled the appointment the same day of
                         the visits or asked to re-schedule them, because they were out of the locality, sick
                         or too busy to receive the interviewers. This had an impact on the project’s
                         budget and timings. The following alliances are the ones that re-scheduled the
                         visits one of them in 4 opportunities:

                         At least 3 head of alliances agreed to schedule a visit and to provide the list of
                         members. However, when Ipsos’ interviewers arrived to the localities and asked
                         for the list of members, the head of the alliances said that their asociations
                         dissolved 2 or 3 years ago. This also had an impact on the project’s budget and
                         timings. The following alliances are the ones that agreed to schedule a visit and
                         provide the list of members even when theirs alliance were already dissolved:




                         Further difficulties were faced during fieldwork, that had a direct impact on the
                         project’s timings:
                            a) Bad highways, landslides and rain that involved re-scheduling the visits at
                                the following alliances:
                                      Asociación Comarapeña de Fruticultores – ACOFRUT
                                      Junta Pirai
                                      Asociacion de Productores de Ganado "10 de Abril"
   b) Long distances between households at localities, that involved extra costs
      for transportation and a longer timing staying at the locality:
           Asociación de Productores de Maíz El Torno – APROMA
           Asociación de Apicultores de Vallegrande
           Fruta de Nuestra Tierra, de Vallegrande (FUNDACIÓN PARA EL
              DESARROLLO FRUTÍCOLA)
           Competitividad de La Cadena Apicola Comunitaria Yapacani
   c) Head of alliance and member who live at Santa Cruz capital city an not at
      the localities. They were interviewed at their households:
           Asociación 25 de Octubre La Guardia
   d) Head of alliance that spoke with a PAR member who did not know about
      the project and order the head of alliance to not answer or provide any
      information to Ipsos:
           Asople-La Purita
