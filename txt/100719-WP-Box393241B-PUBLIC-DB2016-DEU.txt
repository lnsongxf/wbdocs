THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the eco nomy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        Obtain building permit

        The Building Procedures Regulation was amended on March 22,
        2013 and corrected on May 2, 2013. According to the
        amendment the building permission procedure documents must
        be submitted electronically since April 1, 2013.

        The building permit grants the right to build on a plot and
        authorizes construction as well. There are several building
        departments (Bauaufsichtsämter) located in the districts of Berlin.
        The location of the building site in Berlin determines which
        building department is responsible for issuing the building
        permit.

        To obtain a construction permit, BuildCo must provide the
        building authority with, among other documents, project design
        drawings, a building specification including a detailed
        description of the future use of the building, proof of stability,
   1    and other necessary proofs (e.g. heat insulation, sound                    25 days               EUR 6,451
        insulation). The architect needs to sign the application for the
        building permit and must attach the design drawings, usually
        scaled at 1:100. Static calculations must be added. The building
        authority will produce static expert double-check calculations
        (carried out by a "Pruefstatiker"). The building authority will then
        forward the application to other relevant departments (e.g., the
        fire department, planning department).

        The Building Procedures Regulation (Bauverfahrensverordnung,
        abbreviated as BauVerfVO) was amended on 22nd March 2013.
        According to the amendment, the applicant is now obliged to
        submit the building permission procedure documents
        electronically in Portable Document (PDF/A).

        Under a revised Berlin State Law, the Building Code Berlin
        (Bauordnung Berlin, abbreviated as BauO Bln), effective
        September 29, 2005, amended by Regulation from June 29, 2011,
        certain constructions require only a simple building permit

                                                                               complete
      (Section 64 BauO Bln) or a waiver (Section 63 BauO Bln,
      maximum value EUR 3,000.00). In the case of a simplified
      building permit under Section 64 BauO Bln, the application will
      be deemed to be complete and sufficient unless the building
      department notifies the applicant to the contrary within three
      weeks of receiving the application. If the building department
      remains silent for four weeks, the application will be deemed
      granted and construction may commence (Section 70,
      Paragraphs 3 and 4 BauO Bln, and Section 71, Paragraph 7, Item
      1 BauO Bln). It is the duty of the architect or the engineer to
      supervise compliance of the construction project with the
      applicable state law.

      In addition, upon receiving the application for a normal building
      permit, the building department has to notify the applicant
      within 14 days if the application is complete or if additional
      documents or plans are required (Section 70, Paragraph 1 and 2
      BauO Bln). If the applicant fails to amend the application within a
      period determined by the building authority, the application will
      be deemed abandoned. If the application is complete, the
      building department will contact other departments involved
      (i.e., the fire safety and public street supervision departments). If
      the other departments fail to make a decision within a month,
      they will be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the
      permit. If the application is not complete for the purpose of
      these other departments, then this period of a month is
      interrupted until the application is completed by the applicant.
      Upon receiving consent from the other departments, the
      building department again has a month to decide on the
      application for a building permit.

      Apply for approval of static calculation

      The building authority appoints an independent engineer (either
      from a private company or from within the authority) who is
      responsible for verifying the static calculations (the
      “Pruefingenieur”).

      A legal certificate of static stability, issued by a “Pruefingenieur”,
      must be available at the time of start of construction.

      Prüfungsverordnung, abbreviated as BauPrüfV, effective February
      12, 2010, amended by Regulation from August 23, 2010). In the
      case of the warehouse considered here, the cost for an
      independent engineer is about EUR 3,586. The calculation is
      based on a volume of 3900 cubic meters and a chargeable
      building value per cubic meters (Appendix 1 to Section 27
      Paragraph 1 BauPrüfVO, Item 15). A structural framework of

      Receive fire safety inspection from District Chimney Sweeper

      Before completion of the building shell, BuildCo must provide
      the building authority with a certificate confirming the suitability
      of the chimneys. Such a certificate by the District Chimney
      Sweeper is mentioned in Section 81, Paragraph 4 BauO Bln. The
      cost is EUR 31.20 per hour " Applicable law: Verordnung über die
      Kehrung und Überprüfung von Anlagen (KÜO), effective June 16,
      2009, amended by Regulation from April 8, 2013.
      Changes relate to the harmonization of different ordinances in
      the federal states. Cost for inspection are based on Paragraph 6
      KÜO). The inspection may take more than one hour, but it will
3     not take more than a day. An appointment can be made on short            1 day         EUR 31
      notice, probably 1 -- 2 weeks before the day of inspection.

      This procedure is for fire safety and for the cases where the
      heating is done by gas boilers. However, some buildings in Berlin
      will use a so called "long distance heating" system to heat the
      building, which is essentially heating by hot water from a
      centralized boiler. In this case, this procedure would not be
      required.

      License) or via a “guest pass” from another German distribution system
      operator (Guest License). There are no costs for the registration process.

      The installer identification from any other DSO of the electrician or the
      Master craftsman’s diploma, trading license and a standard form of the
      distribution operator is needed for the listing process. To be authorized
      to install internal wiring, an electrician has to be a Master electrician
      (“Elektromeister”). Master electrician ("Elektromeister") means he/she is
      licensed with the Chamber of Commerce and has a Craftsman Diploma.
      This is the general procedure and requirement to be allowed to work as
      electrician in Germany and to do the internal wiring. The Master
      electrician ("Elektromeister") is always legally responsible for the internal
      wiring. All Master electricians (“Elektromeister”) in Berlin are registered
      with Vattenfall. This license is valid for all his/her projects in the area of
      the local DSO.

       Electricians working in the field of industrial (warehouses) connections
      are registered with Vattenfall in a second form through training. Those
      electricians receive a number ("Installateurnummer") and are allowed to
      install the meter. All electricians in Berlin that are working in the field of
      industrial (warehouses) connections are certified by Vattenfall. The list of
      those certified electricians is on the website of Vattenfall and can be
      obtained at the Guild of electricians ("Elektroinnung") as well. There is no
      external and no internal inspection. The internal wiring is never inspected
      by Vattenfall DSO, as they trust the electricians through a process of
      registration and diplomas.

      Make payment and await completion of external works and meter
      installation by utility

      The customer pays the estimate at a bank through a wire transfer. The
      required external connection works are underground work for the cable,
      building of metering, building of the grid connection, and connection of
      the building to the grid. The meter gets installed at the same time when
      the connection is done and by the same or another department if the
      meter installation is done by Vattenfall DSO. However, in most cases, the
      private electrician (the Master electrician) who did the internal wiring
3     would install the meter.                                                  14 calendar days     EUR 15,500

      At this moment, this private electrician has to hand over to Vattenfall
      DSO a form ("Errichterbescheinigung") that certifies that he installed the
      internal wiring according to technical and safety standards. In 98% of all
      cases, the internal wiring and the external connection works are done at
      the same time and usually the external connection works are completed
      before the internal wiring as this is usually more complex. Electricity
      starts flowing immediately

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      The consent or negative attest of the competent authority regarding any
      statutory pre-emption rights is required and applicable to all properties
      in Berlin. The civil council ("Bezirksamt") issues the consent or a negative
      attest to the transaction. The time limit given by the statute is that the
      civil council may exercise the right of pre-emption two months
      (preclusion period) after the delivery of a copy of the notarised sale and
      transfer agreement (The notary is usually requested to execute the
      agreement). The city council usually responds within two months even if
      it does not exercise the pre-emption right. The respective preemption 1 week - 3 weeks EUR 100 (consent

      authorities could have a statutory preemption right to coordinate the
      urban land-use planning. These rules are applicable to all properties in
      Berlin. It is necessary therefore to provide the land register with either a
      consent of the public authorities to the transfer or an attest that the
      statutory right of preemption either does not exist or is not exercised.

      * Fulfillment of the pre-conditions for the validity of the purchase
      price and notarize sale agreement

      The following pre conditions have to be fulfilled for the maturity of the
      purchase price:

      (i) Consent or negative attest of the competent authority regarding any
      statutory pre-emption rights, applicable to all properties in Berlin.
      (ii) Registration of the priority notice in the Land Register (not mandatory
      but usual practice to secure the purchasers rank in the land register and
      avoid a third party purchasing the property in good faith).
      (iii) Consent to the cancellation of existing encumbrances
      (i)The civil council ("Bezirksamt") issues the consent or a negative attest
      to the transaction. The time limit given by the statute is that the civil
      council may exercise the right of pre-emption two months after
      informing the civil council of the notarised sale and transfer agreement.
      (ii)The priority notice prevents a purchase by a third party of good faith
      between the conclusion of the purchase agreement and registration of
      the purchaser; it usually ranks after the existing encumbrances and prior
      to any future encumbrances at the time of notarisation. This notice
      provides a very high level of legal and economic security and certainty.
      Upon registration, the notice protects against all intervening interests
      (including seller’s insolvency) pending completion of the transaction and
      actual change in registered ownership. By use of this notice, a purchaser         20 days         EUR 1428
      is legally protected against potential risks at an extremely early stage of   (simultaneous (registration fee of

      entered in the public register by the notary immediately following
                                                                                         and 4)             fee)
      authentication of the purchase contract. From that moment onward, the
      purchaser can rest assured that he can acquire title to the property if all
      prerequisites to maturity of the purchase price are fulfilled.

      The items (i, ii, and iii) above which are not accepted or taken over by the
      purchaser have to be in place. It might take substantial time to obtain
      them, particularly if they have come from public authorities. Such
      consents will be delivered to the notary and will usually be presented to
      the land register later when applying for the registration of the new
      owner (Procedure 4).
      Registration fee of the priority notice depends on the value of the
      property.

      If all pre-conditions to the maturity "Fälligkeit" of the purchase price,
      usually collected and examined by the notary, have been fulfilled, the
      notary issues a statement of maturity "Fälligkeitsmitteilung" to the
      purchaser. The purchaser is then obliged to pay the purchase price. The
      payment is evidenced by the seller confirming payment or a bank
      statement.
      If the respective declarations in rem have already been provided for in
      the sale and transfer agreement, the notary is usually bound by an
      escrow agreement not to forward them to the land register until the
      purchase price has been paid.
      In case of real property the law says the agreement has to be notarized

      (Section 311b German Civil Code). The transfer of title of a real property,
      governed by the law of disposition "Sachenrecht", also has to be in a
      certain form: the declarations in rem, which are in a format according to
      the land register regulation (Grundbuchordnung), and the transfer has to
      be registered in the land register. Such declarations in rem which are
      pre-conditions to the registration of the purchaser to be registered as
      new owner may either already be in the notarial deed or be given in a
      separate notarial deed.

      * Payment of the transfer tax and obtaining the confirmation

      The notary is obliged to provide a copy of each notarised sale and
      transfer agreement to the responsible tax authority. The tax authority will
      then issue a tax assessment and send it to the purchaser. The land
      register clerk will not register the purchaser as new owner if the transfer 15 days, possibly
      tax has not been paid. After payment of the real estate transfer tax, the up to one month       6% of purchase

      Application for the registration of the new owner and deletion of
      the priority notice to the land register

      After the purchase price has been paid and the tax authorities have
      provided the innocuousness statement, an application for the
      registration of the purchaser as new owner and deletion of the priority
      notice is submitted. A registration fee is paid depending on the property
      value. The deletion fee for the cancellation of the priority notice also
      depends on the value. It is important to note that there is a possibility to
      register the title through an expedited Procedure, whereby the notary                            EUR 2,755

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
