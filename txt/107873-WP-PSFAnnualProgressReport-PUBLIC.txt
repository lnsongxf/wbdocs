The PSF’s support is highly relevant to the frontline
service delivery pillar of Indonesia’s 2015–2019 National
Medium Term Development Plan. Building on the
successes of PNPM and PNPM Generasi projects, the PSF
is implementing an increasingly robust frontline service
delivery program, particularly in the delivery of health,

clear guidelines for closing down PNPM, and helped to
monitor their progress in the field: 98 percent of projects
were completed and handed over to communities,
with progress on the remainder ranging between
77 and 99 percent. The PSF team also engaged in a
series of technical discussions to develop a new Village
Law facilitation structure, providing guidance on the
planning, design of activities, regulatory development
and implementation activities. Several pilot activities
were wrapped up during the year, including Creative
Communities II, the Village Training Program, and the
Pro-Poor Planning Budgeting and Monitoring (P3BM)
Project, all focusing on conveying lessons learned for the
new Village Law environment.

Lessons learned through the implementation of the
program have served as input for the development of the
National Slum Upgrading Project (NSUP).

The experience of BKM in preparing community
development plans has played a major role in developing
the capacities of village governments to formulate
medium term village development plans. Under the new
Village Law, such plans are required as the reference point
for the utilization of village funds. Some local governments
have adopted the PNPM Urban planning cycle to ensure
the participation of communities in the formulation of
these village plans.

The CSPs that were developed under ND have been
effective as a means to address settlement and tertiary
infrastructure issues at the ward level. However, it has
been found that wards with more complex settlement
problems, including those with significant areas of slums,
cannot address these issues solely through interventions
implemented at the ward level. Rather, the CSPs need to
be integrated with the city-level settlement plans, with
these plans establishing connections between tertiary
infrastructure and city-wide systems and taking into
account the needs and aspirations of communities at a
wider level.

Local governments have played an increasing role in the
selection of priority areas and the implementation of the
program in partnership with facilitators, urban planners
and communities. However, it has been found that there is
a significant variation in the capacity of local governments
to implement urban upgrading projects. Therefore,

Because of the delays, no activities were carried out under

workshop for 210 master trainers.

Although the World Bank continued to engage in
consultations with MoHA and MoF to facilitate the
restructuring and alignment of the project with the
broader implementation of Village Law and to reflect the
new institutional arrangements at MoHA, the Recipient
did not submit a letter to extend the project prior to the
deadline and nor did they allocate funding for the project
in the Government budget (DG Bina Pemdes 2016 DIPA).
Thus, the project was closed on December 31, 2015,
as scheduled.



FUTURE PLANS
The PSF will continue to engage with MoHA and possibly
seek to develop a new project that is adapted to the new
context created by the implementation of the Village
Law and the establishment of the new institutional
arrangements described in the previous section.



LESSONS LEARNED
A major lesson learned is that it is not always possible to
predict or manage the impact of major restructuring to
high level institutional arrangements. In particular, the
project was unable to anticipate or manage the impact of
the transfer for the responsibility of the implementation of
the project from one ministry (MoHA) to a new one (MoV ).
Budget re-allocations, new institutional arrangements,
and a number of bureaucratic obstacles lengthened the

disrupting subsequent activities.                                 pilot commences.
The transfer of the responsibility for the implementation
of PNPM Rural from MOHA to a newly-created ministry
without an adequate administrative infrastructure resulted
in the loss of smaller, but still important, pieces of work.
For example, the web-based data management prototype
described in the previous section was not operational
after April 2015. RLF pilot project locations can no longer
use this prototype, despite its demonstrated usefulness
because MIS data was not transferred to the relevant
ministry and a new server facility was not activated.

Another important lesson learned from the
implementation of the project was necessity of securing
high-level commitment from key stakeholders regarding
the project’s objectives and scope. Throughout most
of the period of implementation of the project, key
stakeholders continued to hold varying perspectives
and opinions regarding the project’s objectives and
scope. There was no strong support for the PNPM
RLFs project’s exit strategy, for a strategy to phase out
poorly-performing RLFs, or for the need to convert all
RLFs into legal entities. Any future program would need
to ensure a much higher level of commitment, including
through the development of the strategy with the active
and close collaboration of key Government stakeholders.

In addition, the proposed scale-up of RLF reforms by
the Government needs an effective inter-governmental
agency joint secretariat such as existed in the latter
part of the project, with dedicated staff from each
participating ministry. The role of local governments
should be strengthened to support the further growth of
RLFs in such areas as market and product development.
As a program rooted in community empowerment
and intended to facilitate poverty alleviation, regular
supervision by relevant local government agencies should
be conducted to monitor the RLFs’ compliance with
relevant regulations and to ensure that the RLFs’ mission
remains focused on serving the poor while at the same
time becoming financially sustainable.

government stakeholders and development partners
(such as KOMPAK). Internal coordination has helped the
project team to capitalize on the linkages between the
program’s activities and on linkages with other projects
in the PSF’s operational portfolio. Coordination with
external stakeholders has been critical to ensuring that
the program remains responsive to Government needs
and that it avoids duplication with the activities of other
government partners. The first year of the Program
coincided with the Government’s implementation
of the Village Law and with the implementation of
other programs such as KOMPAK, which means that
coordination was necessarily conducted on an ad
hoc basis. It is anticipated that coordination will be
more structured in 2016, which will reduce transaction
costs involved.

The need to bridge policy and technical engagement:
A key challenge to a program of this nature, particularly in
the first year of implementation, is to deliver both high-level
policy advice and in-depth technical inputs. The program
has managed to bridge these levels of engagement well,
as evidenced by the achievements under Intermediary
Outcome No. 2 in the results framework. The lesson from
2015 is that it is vitally important to have key staff members
who are directly engaged in both technical discussions and
high-level policy dialogue.

Comprehensive package of policy and technical
advice: From its very beginning, the Program was
established as a cross-Global Practice engagement, with a
particularly strong relationship between the Governance
GP and the Social Development unit of the Social, Urban,
and Rural Resilience GP. This collaboration has been
essential to delivering a comprehensive package of policy
and technical advice to the Government that is particularly
well suited to supporting the institutionalization of
community development into Government systems. This

  9 Perception of Local          Qualitative      •	 Local governments generally perceived PNPM (Rural and Urban) as
    Governance Study             (2010)              programs with very high participation rate, better transparency and

                                                     should focus on building the capacity of the community through

    Women’s Participation (2012)                     not maximized
    in PNPM                                       •	 Women’s involvement in the project cycle is still low beyond the

    studi-kelompok-                                 •	 At the village level, power is often concentrated in the hands of

                                                       with power from other institutions (e.g. BPD) to serve as a control
