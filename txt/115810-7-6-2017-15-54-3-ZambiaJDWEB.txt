EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Jobs need to be at the center of economic development policies in Zambia. Since the early 2000s, a
copper-driven boom and a private sector investment response to the better business environment has led to
rapid economic growth. While the economy was badly affected by the triple shocks of 2015 and 2016 (copper
downturn, poor harvest, power shortages), there are signs of recovery in 2017. However, the number and
distribution of jobs did not change in a meaningful way and thus the poverty rate hardly declined during the
period of growth; absolute poverty remains very high, especially in rural areas. Indeed, although structural
transformations have started, with labor moving out of rural areas and agriculture into Lusaka and into wage
employment, most workers are still own account smallholder farmers, and off-farm jobs have been created
mainly in low-productivity activities, often in the informal service sector. The objective of this report is to identify
the main jobs challenges facing Zambia and to highlight the types of policies and programs that would need to
be part of a jobs strategy to strengthen economic growth and improve standards of living through the creation
of more and better jobs.
Zambia remains one of Africa’s youngest countries by median age. Over the next two generations, demog-
raphy will move in Zambia’s favor as the dependency ratio falls. But this fall in dependency will only be an asset if
Zambia’s economy can generate faster growth of jobs with higher productivity. According to the UN’s mid-range
population projections, at least 375,000 young people on average will enter the workforce each year to 2030.
Between 2030 and 2050 this average number doubles to 747,000 jobs per year,1 just to keep the present-day
rates of labor force participation and employment fixed.
Zambia’s impressive economic growth has delivered less impressive jobs outcomes. The economy
grew by an annual average of 7.3 percent between 2000 and 2014, and per capita GDP grew by 4.3 per-
cent. At the same time, employment grew by only 2.81 percent per year. The implied employment elasticity
of growth for the period of just 0.28 is significantly lower than the 0.49 estimated elasticity for comparable
Lower Middle Income Countries.
Labor productivity growth came not from within sectors, but from employment shifts across sectors
(the movement of workers out of agriculture and into services and industry). Of the 4.35 percent annual growth
in value added per worker in Zambia between 2000 and 2014, 3.6 percentage points came from the shift of
employment out of agriculture and into services and to a lesser extent, to industry. Throughout the period,
labor productivity in agriculture and services was nearly stagnant.
At the heart of Zambia’s challenge to reduce poverty with economic growth seems to be the low pro-
ductivity of agriculture for the majority of poor Zambians, who are farmers – but it may also present an oppor-
tunity. Eighty percent of Zambia’s poor work in agriculture where value added per worker has remained flat since
2000. However, commercial farming and agro-processing in Zambia expanded in recent times, and agro-based
goods account for almost half of non-copper exports. Given that this sector tends to be more labor intensive than
mining, and potentially have more supply-chain linkages to the local economy, it could become a driver for Zam-
bia’s economic diversification and a catalyst for more, better jobs.

      The increased rate of growth of the labor force is due to the larger population rather than due to a fertility boost. In fact, population growth
      is expected to be slower in the 2030–2050 period as secondary schooling improve, health advances and higher prosperity lead to lower
      fertility.

                                                                                                                                                         1
    SUPPLY-SIDE TRENDS
    Economic transformation is underway but requires more off-farm formal sector jobs and better jobs
    in rural areas. Evidence from the household-based Labor Force Surveys (LFS) indicates that economic trans-
    formation could support the demographic transition with diversification out of agriculture, especially for young
    people, increased urbanization (especially to secondary towns outside of Lusaka), increase in wages and contract
    work that yields better income.
    Skills development is the key to ensuring poorer people benefit from economic growth. Skills are
    fetching a premium on the labor market, and those without skills are less likely to get better jobs, and more
    likely to be inactive. Gender does not matter so much as experience for the decision to work, but it is a strong
    determinant of the type of work a person is able to get, and of their earnings in the job. The public sector is
    absorbing more skilled people, and pays more.
    However, the structural shifts in jobs in Zambia are not without challenges: underemployment seems
    to be rising, for both rural and urban workers, youth, and those working in service sectors, especially youth in
    urban services. Hours worked in urban areas hours are falling, and in rural areas inactivity has increased. More-
    over, despite an upward trend, about two-thirds of young wage workers are without a contract.
    Many of the new jobs were created in self-employment and household-based unpaid work in the
    informal sector in urban centers, where underemployment is rising, especially for youth. Includ-
    ing unpaid family work and omitting non-respondents, the share of workers aged 15–64 in agriculture in
    the Labor Force surveys fell from 71 percent in 2008 to just 33 percent in 2014. The share in services rose
    from 21 to 36 percent, whereas the share in industry remained at 7 percent.2 It has mostly been young
    people who moved to the urban areas and who moved into service sectors. There have been healthy signs
    of increases in the shares of both formal and waged jobs in Zambia. Excluding non-respondents, the share
    of working-age workers who were employed in waged jobs rose from 17 to 29 percent, with private sector
    waged work rising from 12 to 21 percent. The share of self-employed non-agricultural workers rose from
    11 to 28 percent, while the share of self-employed in agriculture fell from 31 to 18 percent. However,
    the bulk of the new jobs in urban-based services are in the informal sector. The average number of hours
    worked by an informal service worker in urban areas fell as more and more young people moved to the
    towns and cities (see chapter 2).
    Widening gaps in productivity and in earnings contribute to the rising inequality in Zambia. Earnings
    gaps in Zambia have widened; between formal and informal workers, between rural and urban workers, between
    regions in the country, and between unskilled and skilled workers. Women earn about 20 percent less than men
    (13 percent less after adjusting for selection into particular types of work), but the gender wage gap seems to
    be narrowing slightly over time. Gaps also widened between public sector workers and the private sector, as the
    government granted quite generous pay raises. These dualistic trends go some way to explaining why despite
    globally high GDP growth, Zambia has done much less well in reducing poverty than several African countries
    which have grown more slowly.
    Zambia also faces jobs challenges and opportunities to include women and the bottom 40 percent
    of poor Zambians in the growth process. Most of the poor in Zambia are farmers, and the least mobile
    workers have been found to be women. To be inclusive, a jobs strategy for Zambia would need to promote
    higher productivity jobs in the places where the poor, and especially where poor women live. Spatial analysis
    shows clusters in of dense poverty in the east and north; and the data on agribusiness firm creation suggest
    high potential for wage job growth and improved smallholder linkages in the same places.




    2	
         The 2014 LFS in Zambia has a high share of respondents missing in employment type and sector share, and weights differ between the
         2008 LFS (based on the 2002 census) and the 2012 LFS (based on 2010 pop census), so comparisons over time between 2008 and 2012
         are only approximations.

DEMAND-SIDE TRENDS
Zambia has a relatively good investment climate, a relatively healthy size and age structure to estab-
lishments, a good track record in attracting foreign investment, and relatively high formality in
employment (in common with other Southern African economies). Whereas most firms are informal,
young and small, most employment among establishments is in larger, formal and slightly older firms. Sixty
eight percent of firms in the 2012 Economic Census were reported as informal, and only 32 percent were for-
mal. However formal firms in the Economic Census were much larger on average, accounting for 72 percent of
employment in establishments, compared to only 28 percent in informal firms. Firms and jobs are concentrated
in services, although a significant share of jobs in Zambia, particularly within larger firms, are in traded goods sec-
tors (agriculture, mining, and manufacturing) and in particular, in commercial agriculture and agro-processing.
Most of the ‘good’ formal sector waged jobs and most of the jobs in new formal sector firms, are in Lusaka and
the central road corridor from Copperbelt to Lusaka.
Nothing in the analysis of the structure and dynamics of firms, nor in regression analysis of employment, pro-
ductivity and wages gives unexpected results, nor points to obvious unhealthy symptoms of the investment
climate in Zambia.
The following findings warrant further analysis however, and could have implications for a jobs strategy
for Zambia:
     Micro firm survival seems low, and yet smaller firms while having lower output per worker, seem to have
	 i.	
     value added per worker that is similar to larger firms.
      Whereas entry and foreign investment in the manufacturing sector has been buoyant, manufacturing pro-
	ii.	
      ductivity (output per worker) shows up in regressions controlling for other characteristics, to be lower than
      in other sectors.
iii.	
	     Productivity among the largest firms’ (50 staff or more) is lower than for small young entrants after
      adjusting for other factors.
iv.	
	    The distribution of labor productivity across mining, manufacturing and commerce is bimodal in Zambia,
     pointing to either asymmetric costs, unfair competition, or (most likely) dualism in these sectors.
    There are large (and foreign) firms of all ages across most sectors, mixed in with plenty of smaller and infor-
	v.	
    mal firms and self-employed workers. This not only sends the message that Zambia is open for business, but
    it allows potential scope to connect large and small-scale firms in value chains in specific locations.
The most common locations for incumbent firms and for entrants and job creation are in the central
corridor running from Copperbelt through Lusaka to Livingstone. This is an area of high crop potential, is
densely populated, has good access to markets by road, and has a high poverty density also. A jobs strategy for
Zambia should investigate the potential to develop more jobs with higher productivity in the densely populated
and poor regions of Eastern and Northern Province.


ZAMBIA’S JOBS CHALLENGE
Zambia’s jobs policies need to achieve three objectives in order to capture the demographic dividend of
an expanding workforce and falling dependency and ensure inclusive growth:
•	 Create more formal sector jobs
•	 Improve the productivity of informal jobs in smallholder farming, while encouraging commercialization and
   links to agribusiness supply chains;
•	 Connect vulnerable groups to jobs
To increase labor productivity growth and create more jobs, Zambia’s economy has to see continued
structural change, with faster agricultural productivity growth, increased rural non-farm employ-
ment, and with more formal and more productive informal jobs in secondary towns and Lusaka.
Most Zambians are still farmers. Therefore to avoid a collapse in agricultural labor productivity as many young
people enter the workforce in rural areas, new jobs for young people will increasingly need to be created outside

                                                                                                                          3
    of own-account agriculture, and in higher productivity occupations both within agriculture and in industry and
    services. Faster growth in formal employment and – since workers tend to leave agriculture as productivity rises
    - in urban based jobs, will be necessary.
    Zambia will need to move toward more targeted sectoral and regional policies focusing on vulner-
    able population groups. To reach a large enough number of poor Zambians, a job rich and inclusive growth
    path will need to be designed around agro-value chains, and cross border export trade in these products. Zam-
    bia has abundant land resources, a very low population density, land borders with 8 neighboring countries, and
    relatively close proximity from different regions to major commercial centers in Harare, Lilongwe and Lubumbashi,
    meaning that there are ready markets in the region for higher value agro-produce. Agro-based firms tend to
    be more diverse in location across Zambia than other manufacturing firms and services, which are very strongly
    concentrated around Lusaka and the Copperbelt, producing mostly for these markets.
    The rest of this report is organized as follows: Chapter One explores the underlying macroeconomic, demo-
    graphic and productivity trends defining the jobs challenge. Chapter Two explores the supply side of jobs using
    the household-based Labor Force Surveys (LFS) to first explore labor market demography, then to better under-
    stand who is benefiting from which sorts of jobs in the processes of economic transformation. Chapter Three
    focuses on the demand side, analyzing jobs constraints from the perspective of firms.

    Zambia’s Main Jobs Challenges:
    Zambia will need to put jobs at the center of development planning and at the center of the macro
    fiscal corrections under the economic recovery program3 to achieve its potential. Zambia has a relatively
    good investment climate which improved further during the 2000s, and until the recent decline of copper prices,
    had established a good track record of stable macroeconomic and fiscal policies. The country scores significantly
    above the IDA average on building human resources (health and education), just above the IDA average on prop-
    erty rights and rule-based governance and on public sector management and institutions, but significantly below
    on social protection (having declined in the Bank’s rating in 2012). An ambitious road development program has
    seen transport infrastructure within the country improve, although border crossings for trade remain slow on
    most routes. More recently, a loosening of fiscal policy in the face of external instability and an energy crisis, have
    sparked macroeconomic reforms under the Government’s economic recovery program.
    Zambia will also need to move towards more targeted sectoral and regional policies focusing on
    vulnerable population groups. To reach a large enough number of poor Zambians, a job rich and inclusive
    growth path will need to be designed around agro-value chains, and cross border export trade in these prod-
    ucts. Zambia has abundant land resources, a very low population density, land borders with 8 neighboring
    countries, and relatively close proximity from different regions to major commercial centers in Harare, Lilongwe
    and Lubumbashi, meaning that there are ready markets in the region for higher value agro-produce. Agro-
    based firms tend to be more diverse in location across Zambia than other manufacturing firms and services,
    which are very strongly concentrated around Lusaka and the Copperbelt, producing mostly for these markets.
    To increase labor productivity growth and create more jobs, Zambia’s economy has to see continued
    structural change, with faster agricultural productivity growth, increased rural non-farm employment,
    and with more formal and more productive informal jobs. Most Zambians are still farmers. Therefore to avoid
    a collapse in agricultural labor productivity as many young people enter the workforce in rural areas, new jobs for
    young people will increasingly need to be created outside of own-account agriculture, and in higher productivity
    occupations both within agriculture and in industry and services. Faster growth in formal employment and—since
    workers tend to leave agriculture as productivity rises—in urban based jobs, will be necessary.
    These jobs challenges are framed by the need for the economy, and especially Government, to adjust to lower
    copper prices and lower tax revenues. As economic growth slows in response, Zambia will need to ensure a soft
    landing, and hasten a rebound for jobs in the upturn in the economic cycle.

     3	
          At the time of writing, international copper prices have just started to recover from a five-year decline from historically high prices. In the
          2017 Budget Speech, the Finance Minister announced an economic stabilization and recovery package of fiscal measures.

1.  THE BIG PICTURE
SUMMARY
Zambia’s economy has been growing sufficiently to create employment for the youthful population but is failing
to create enough good jobs. Growth has been unequal and the poverty head count has increased. Labor pro-
ductivity growth drove close to all of the increase in per capita income between 2000 and 2014 as labor shifted
out of informal and rural agriculture and into formal and urban employment in industry and services. Since 2008
demographics and improvements in the employment rate have also contributed to a small extent.
At the heart of Zambia’s challenge in reducing poverty through economic growth seems to be the low pro-
ductivity of agriculture for the majority of poor Zambians, who are farmers—but it may also present an oppor-
tunity. Eighty percent of the poor work in agriculture, where value added per worker has remained flat since
2000. However, commercial farming and agro-processing have expanded in recent times, and agro-based goods
account for almost half of non-copper exports. Given that agriculture tends to be more labor intensive than
mining and potentially has more supply-chain links to the local economy, it could be significant for Zambia’s
economic diversification and for jobs.


RAPID GROWTH WITHOUT POVERTY REDUCTION
Zambia’s economy has been growing sufficiently to create employment for the youthful population4
but is failing to create enough good jobs. Following the resumption of continuous economic growth in
the late 1990s after a prolonged period of volatility and decline, a decade-long surge in world copper prices
propelled service- and construction-driven growth in Zambia. Before the late 1990s, copper prices had been
declining systematically, and the economy had faced volatile and weak growth in real GDP (figure 1). From 2000
to 2014 real GDP grew by 7.3 percent per year on average, whereas employment is estimated to have grown by
only 2.8 percent per year on average.
In contrast to expectations, Zambia’s rapid economic growth came with an increase in the poverty
head count. According to World Development Indicators (WDI) data, despite the rapid growth in real GDP
between 1998 and 2010, Zambia saw poverty rise and the income share of the bottom 40 percent fall from
2003 to 2010 (figure 2). The poverty head count ratio, at $1.25 per day (purchasing power parity), had declined
when GDP growth was relatively stagnant in the 1990s, yet the income share of the bottom 40 percent of the
population remained close to 10 percent.
Zambia exhibits a dual economy structure across locations, with firms and jobs concentrated in the
central corridor running from Copperbelt Province in the north through the capital city of Lusaka to Living-
stone in Southern Province (for more discussion, see chapter 3). Sixty-six percent of all firms and all jobs in firms
are in Copperbelt and Lusaka provinces alone. Adding Southern and Central provinces, this share rises to over
80 percent of firms and 88 percent of jobs; particular drivers are the main cities and towns of Lusaka, Ndola,
Kitwe, Livingstone, Kabwe, Kafue, and Chingola.

The rapid economic growth has not been inclusive: According to the latest poverty numbers from the
Central Statistical Office (CSO), in the Key Findings from its Living Conditions Monitoring Survey, the rural
poverty head count was estimated to be 76.6 percent in 2015. This was barely changed from 77.9 percent
in 2010, with urban poverty declining to 23.4 percent in 2015 from 27.5 percent in 2010. This translates to
a national poverty head count of 54.4 percent in 2015—down from 60.5 percent in 2010 but still relatively
high and illustrating the rural–urban gap in living standards. Indeed, Western, Luapala, and Northern provinces
recorded poverty head counts in 2015 of 80 percent or higher. This contrasts with the 30.8 percent recorded in
Copperbelt and the 20.2 percent in Lusaka Province. In the 2013/14 crop season, the 2015 Living Conditions
Monitoring Survey found that 89.4 percent of rural households engaged in agricultural activities.
At the heart of the challenge to reducing poverty through economic growth seems to be the low produc-
tivity of agriculture for farmers—the majority of the poor. This jobs diagnostic does not analyze agricultural
productivity at the farm level, but a sector-level analysis of real GDP and employment between 2000 and 2014
reveals an important dynamic: In the 2010 population census, more than 50 percent of workers identified them-
selves as working in agriculture, accounting for over 80 percent of poor Zambians. Labor productivity in agriculture is
thus a key determinant of prosperity for the rural poor. As table 1 shows, annualized average growth in value added
per employee in agriculture was -3.3 percent from 2000 to 2005 and -5.2 percent between 2005 and 2008. Only
after 2008 did average labor productivity in agriculture grow, and as figure 3 shows, part of the impetus for this was
a move of labor out of agriculture and into services and industry. Another factor contributing to the rise in average
labor productivity in agriculture after 2008 was the big increase in foreign farmers and livestock producers that
began in the mid-2000s. A decomposition of Zambia’s economic transformation is discussed later in this chapter.
Despite this low productivity, commercial farming and agro-processing have expanded in recent
years. Agro-based products made up close to half (47 percent) of non-mining exports from 2008 to 2014
(figure 3). Of these, about half (49 percent) of food and live animal exports went to Sub-Saharan Africa. Agri-
culture and agro-processing jobs in firms made up 52 percent of non-construction jobs in industry in 2010
(compared with 25 percent of such jobs in mining). These industries tend to be more labor intensive than
mining and potentially have more supply-chain links to the local economy. Therefore regional trade in food and
agro-processing could be important for Zambia’s economic diversification and for jobs.
Faster growth in non-mining production and exports would likely lessen the impact of commodity price
fluctuations and can help Zambia recover from the 2015–16 slowdown. A number of macroeconomic
trends provide grounds for optimism in 2017. After five years of annual declines, copper prices have regained some
losses and are back to their May 2015 levels, and annual production is expected to increase. Since the kwacha
plummeted in 2015, the exchange rate has stabilized, staying in a 10 percent band for the past nine months. Infla-
tion is back in single digits (6.8 percent in February 2017). Zambia has enjoyed above average rainfall, resulting in
a 10 percent larger harvest in 2016 over 2015 and projections for above-average cereal production in 2017. All
these positive trends can help Zambia achieve a softer landing in adjusting to lower copper prices, if exports of
higher-value agricultural products and agro-processed goods can be increased. The continuation of a lower-value
kwacha would increase the price of important inputs such as petroleum, fertilizers, veterinary drugs, and animal
feed supplements, but it could also make some of Zambia’s agricultural exports cheaper and more attractive in the
region and on global markets.

    YOUTHFULNESS AND THE PRIORITY OF JOBS
    Zambia’s population is youthful and growing quickly, meaning that the workforce is set to grow
    rapidly. The UN population projections for Zambia are for population growth of 3.02 percent between 2014
    and 2030, with the working-age population growing by 3.35 percent (figure 4). Between 2014 and 2050, the
    UN projects that the population will grow by 2.83 percent, and the working-age population by 3.27 percent.
    Zambia’s population is entering a period of falling dependency, potentially offering a demographic
    dividend. The share of working-age to total population will increase from 51 percent today to about 58 per-
    cent by 2050 (table 2). The ratio of workers to dependents will increase from 1.05 today to 1.22 in 2030 and
    as high as 1.41 in 2050 (figure 5). This means a demographic window is opening. If Zambia can generate more
    and better jobs for young people in the coming years, the country could start enjoying a demographic dividend
    on economic growth.
    Zambia must create many more jobs per year than it has in recent years. Assuming no increase in the
    labor force participation rate or the unemployment rate, Zambia will need to create 11.8 million new jobs by
    2050: over 328,000 jobs each year on average. This would be 252 percent more jobs every year than during
    Zambia’s fast-growth years of 2000–14, when the average annual increase was 130,000 jobs. According to
    UN projections, Zambia will have 294,000 more working-age people each year on average between 2014 and
    2030. That figure rises to 446,000 each year on average between 2030 and 2050. Employment would have to

increase by 3.51 percent per year between now and 2030, and then by 3.0 percent between 2030 and 2050
in order to keep rates of unemployment and labor force participation the same as they are today.
To create more and better jobs, future economic growth will need to be both more labor intensive
and higher in labor productivity. Between 2000 and 2014—Zambia’s period of historically (and globally) high
economic growth—employment rose by only 2.8 percent. Assuming future growth is slower than during those
copper boom years, the first of Zambia’s job challenges is to create sustained and more labor-intensive economic
growth than before. Between 1991 and 2005, Zambia did achieve employment growth of 3 percent, but average
labor productivity grew by a relatively low 0.2 percent, and labor productivity in agriculture fell. To create better
jobs that help reduce poverty in the future, Zambia is going to need agricultural productivity to grow (figure 6).
Yet international evidence5 shows that as agricultural productivity grows, employment in agriculture typically falls.
To create better jobs on average, Zambia will therefore also need to create off-farm employment in industry and
services, ideally in services that support the processing and export of agricultural products.
Generating enough better jobs off-farm for the growing labor force will require a combination of
labor-intensive growth and economic transformation. For all Sub-Saharan countries for which data are
available in WDI since 1991, nearly half (9 of 21) have seen annualized employment growth higher than 3 percent
for a period of at least 10 years.6 Of these, only six7 managed to also attain positive growth in within-sector
labor productivity (that is, better jobs within sectors) during the period of employment. Only three8 saw

     a positive contribution to overall productivity from structural change in addition to this growth in employ-
     ment and within-sector productivity, and only one—Tanzania (1991–2001)—has managed to achieve all these
     improvements plus both a shift of labor into industrial sector employment and an increase in industrial labor
     productivity. Other countries for which WDI data are available and which achieved this advantageous structural
     change since 1991 are Cambodia, Chile, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Honduras, Malaysia, Pakistan, Panama,
     and Trinidad and Tobago.


     TOWARD LABOR-INTENSIVE GROWTH AND ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION
     The annual per capita GDP growth of 4.3 percent from 2000 to 2014 was driven entirely by growth
     in labor productivity, which grew at 4.35 percent annually in terms of value added per worker. The contri-
     butions to annual growth in per capita income of the increased unemployment rate (0.03 percent) and the
     decreased labor force participation rate (0.06 percent) were negative. At the same time, the contribution to
     annual growth in per capita income from changes in the share of the working population (0.04 percent) was
     slightly positive and was in fact increasing through the period as dependency started to fall (see chapter 1).
     Labor productivity growth came not from within sectors but from employment shifts across sectors
     (the movement of workers out of agriculture and into services and industry). Of the 4.35 percent annual growth
     in value added per worker, 3.6 percentage points came from the shift of employment out of agriculture and
     into services (86 percent) and, to a lesser extent, to industry (14 percent). This means that the share of services in
     total employment almost doubled from 2000 to 2014. Between 2008 and 2014, the share of jobs in informal
     agriculture fell as urbanization accelerated rapidly around Lusaka and some secondary towns, and as the avail-
     ability of waged jobs in agriculture and informal services increased in rural areas.9
     Throughout this period, labor productivity in agriculture and services was disappointing. In agricul-
     ture the growth rate was just under 0.6 percent per year. And although average labor productivity in services
     rose between 2000 and 2008, it fell subsequently as labor moved into service sectors. Over the full period from
     2000 to 2014, labor productivity in services rose by only 0.14 percent per year on average, as compared with
     the 2.2 percent annual average growth in labor productivity in industry. These patterns reflect the small size and
     informal nature of the firms and jobs that have been created in Zambia’s economic transformation.

           This report bases employment shares by sector on the LFS collected by the Zambian Central Statistical Office. The top-line numbers given
           here are consistent with their published reports for the 2008, 2012, and 2014 surveys (http://www.zamstats.gov.zm/index.html). However,
           as noted elsewhere in this report, the LFS data are subject to volatility in employment shares by sector over time, which appears to be
           driven by unpaid family workers. Adjusting for this category of workers leaves the trends in economic transformation the same, but the
           shifts are less dramatic.

Nevertheless, economic transformation seems to have started in 2005, with diversification, urban-
ization, and formalization under way.10 Although the economy remains largely rural, agricultural, and
informal, employment has been shifting—as noted—to urban-based jobs in services and, to a lesser extent,
industry. In addition, the rural economy seems to be formalizing, with an increase in formal jobs in agriculture,
presumably on commercial farms and in agro-processing. Figure 7 shows the sectoral pattern of employment
across sectors observed in the LFS of 2000, 2005, 2008, and 2012. Agriculture continued to dominate employ-
ment and new jobs from 2000 to 2008, although employment in industry was increasing throughout this
period. From 2008 to 2012, the sectoral breakdown suggests a big shift toward services and a decline in total
employment in agriculture; this was also observed in the 2014 LFS.
Annual growth in the urban share of the population between 2000 and 2014 was faster in the capital,
Lusaka, than the average experienced by low-income countries, but slower in secondary towns. As
figure 8 shows, Zambia’s population remains predominantly rural, even though the share of people in urban areas
has been rising annually. According to WDI data, in 2014, 9.4 million of Zambia’s 15.7 million people lived in areas
defined as rural, compared with an estimated 4.3 million in urban areas outside of Lusaka and 2.1 million within
the administrative boundaries of Lusaka. Growth in urban share was more focused on the capital city than is the
pattern for the average for low-income countries (figure 9). It is also significantly more focused on the capital city
than is the average for Sub-Saharan Africa (see figure 8c). At 2.2 percent, the growth rate of the population share
in Lusaka is more than twice the average in the largest city for all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (1 percent). Since
annual growth in the share of the rural population is declining in line with the Sub-Saharan average, the share
of secondary towns in Zambia is growing more slowly than in the rest of Africa—by only 0.7 percent compared
with 1.8 percent (unweighted by population size). In rural low-income economies, the employment and poverty
reduction potential of the rural non-farm sector has been found to depend on the impact of farm–non-farm links
and urban–rural links (Binswanger-Mkhize, Samboko, and You 2015). Hence, Zambia’s low poverty elasticity of
growth may be related to the lack of urban–rural links around secondary towns.
In common with other countries in southern Africa, “informal is normal” for workers in Zambia;
however, the formal sector is quite well represented in the jobs landscape, and formality has been
increasing. Figure 11a uses data from the 2010 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey to show the breakdown
of employment. In 2010 the data suggest that only 17 percent of employment was in waged work; of this, only
13 percent was formal and just 7 percent was private and formal (6 percent—roughly half of formal waged
workers—were employed in the public sector). The 2008 and 2012 LFS were used to assess changes in the
share of employment, classifying workers as rural or urban, and formal or informal, as shown in figure 10b and
in table 3. The definition of formality used here depends on the worker having a contract or receiving overtime
or social security benefits.


   This section uses LFS data for 2000, 2005, 2008, and 2012. The 2014 survey has also been analyzed and points to patterns similar to
 10	

   those in the 2012 survey, but the variable for employment sector seems to suggest overrepresentation of services compared with past
   surveys, and underrepresentation of agriculture.

The decomposition between location and formality shows that employment in rural informal agriculture fell from
43.5 to 32.9 percent of total employment between 2008 and 2012. However, formal employment in rural agri-
culture increased from 17.6 to 21.6 percent, and formal and informal employment in urban agriculture together
increased their collective share of employment by 1 percent. The share of employment in rural informal and formal
wholesale and retail, and in rural informal construction and other services also increased as the share of employ-
ment in rural agriculture fell. Within urban areas, formal employment in manufacturing, construction, wholesale
and retail, and other services increased. The net effect was an increase in formal and urban jobs relative to rural
and informal jobs.
Labor productivity growth drove nearly all of the increase in per capita income between 2000 and
2014, although since 2008 improvements in the employment rate and demographics have contrib-
uted to a small extent. Figure 11 shows the decomposition of yearly changes in per capita GDP value added,
showing those due to changes in (a) value added per worker (productivity), (b) employment per labor force
participant, (c) labor force per working-age person, and (d) the share of working-age people in the total
population. Globally, this decomposition of per capita GDP value added into productivity and labor market
demography typically shows that productivity improvements drive 80 percent of per capita income growth.11
For Zambia, over the period 2000–14, productivity accounts for 100 percent of the per capita GDP growth of
4.35 percent annually. For the period 2000–05, labor market demographics contributed negatively to per capita
income growth: a falling employment rate in particular shaved off on average 0.72 percentage points, while an
increase in dependency chipped another 0.1 percentage points. After 2005, and especially between 2008 and
2012 when it added 0.75 percent annually, an improved employment rate made a positive contribution to per
capita GDP. From 2012 to 2014, the employment rate again made a negative contribution (minus 0.12 percent)
to per capita GDP. But in 2008 Zambia’s working-age population began rising faster than the school-age popu-
lation (under age 15), raising per capita GDP by 0.12 percent per year on average between 2008 and 2012 and
then by 0.33 percent per year from 2012 to 2014. As noted previously, this trend will continue, providing the
opportunity for a demographic dividend. Nonetheless, with the labor force participation rate falling from 2000
to 2014, and the employment rate (that is, the number employed as a share of labor force participants) falling
between 2012 and 2014, Zambia has yet to fully reap the benefits of its demographic gain.

Most of Zambia’s increases in labor productivity between 2000 and 2014 came from the shifts of
labor out of informal and rural agriculture and into formal and urban employment in industry and
services (figure 13). Figure 12 shows that by 2014 the average value added per worker in industry and in
services (in constant 2005 U.S. dollars) was 16 and 7 times that of agriculture,12 respectively. Consequently any
shift of labor from agriculture into industry and services would be productivity enhancing on average. However,
figure 12 also suggests that this shift from agriculture into services and, to a lesser extent, industry, has coincided
with a decline in average productivity of the service sector, and with the flattening out of productivity in industry.
Despite the positive transformative sign of strong growth rates in urban and formal employment, the high share
of informality suggests that in absolute numbers, many of the workers moving from agriculture into services
and industry have moved into informal services.13
Economic transformation in the coming years will likely depend upon Zambia’s ability to increase
agricultural productivity and catalyze the development of processing industries. The fall in copper
prices was matched with an increase in mining production, and 2017 and 2018 might bring higher prices and
more production. The mines that laid off workers in the 2015 slowdown are now rehiring. However, public
investment seems unlikely to recover to 2014 levels. Despite these signs of recovery, employment growth in
services is unlikely to continue as it did in the peak of the mineral boom (from 2008 to 2012), and so the move-
ment of labor out of agriculture and into services is likely to slow unless agricultural productivity can be raised
more. Whereas average labor productivity in agriculture was about the same in 2014 as in 2000, the observed
shift of remaining agricultural labor from informal agriculture to formal commercial farms (figure 11) seems to
have boosted average productivity in agriculture since 2008. The rising average, coinciding with capital-intense
formalization, suggests that some smaller informal farmers most likely have stagnant or falling productivity,
which will need to be addressed in a national job strategy.


 12	
    Several studies of productivity in Africa adjust for hours worked and conclude that productivity in agriculture is not far from that in services
    or industry. Given the orders of magnitude of the differences in sectoral productivity in Zambia, and the relatively strong presence of highly
    capitalized formal sector employment in Zambia, it seems unlikely that this holds true in Zambia.
 13	
    De Vries, Timmer, and de Vries (2015) observe this phenomenon in several African countries. They differentiate static and dynamic gains
    from structural transformation: static gain comes from a shift to a sector with higher average labor productivity, whereas the dynamic
    loss comes from the shift to less productive subsectors or informal firms. The authors invoke the metaphor of moving up a floor but onto a
    down escalator. In contrast, Rodrik (2015) notes the productivity gains that countries can attain by increasing employment in productivity-
    enhancing and globally traded formal manufacturing industries. He refers to these as elevator industries—capable of lifting average labor
    productivity and of generating dynamic productivity gains.

Zambia’s most likely path for diversified net export growth is in agriculture and agro-processed
products. Figure 3 showed that agro-based products were nearly half of non-mining exports from 2008 to
2014 and that agriculture and agro-processing jobs accounted for 52 percent of non-construction jobs in indus-
try in 2010 (compared with 25 percent of such jobs in mining). There should be scope to both industrialize and
stimulate productivity gains in agriculture by connecting smallholder farmers with large-scale farmers in aggre-
gation schemes, by developing agro-processing for export, and by linking smallholder farmers to higher-value
meat, dairy, and horticulture value chains of domestic supermarkets for domestic consumption. Given that the
majority of Zambians still live in rural areas and secondary towns (see figure 9), a strategy to raise rural incomes
and stimulate agro-industrial exports from secondary towns should also boost demand for services in rural areas
and secondary towns.

     2.  TRENDS IN THE SUPPLY OF LABOR
     SUMMARY
     This chapter uses household-based Labor Force Surveys (LFS) from Zambia’s CSO to explore labor market
     demography and then to better understand who is benefiting from which sorts of jobs in the process of eco-
     nomic transformation described in chapter 1. The key findings:
     Economic transformation is under way but requires more off-farm, formal sector jobs and better jobs
     in rural areas. Economic transformation could support the demographic transition with diversification out of
     agriculture—especially for young people and increased urbanization—especially to secondary towns outside of
     Lusaka, as well as both increases in wages and contract work that yields better income.
     Skills development is the key to ensuring that poorer people benefit from economic growth. Skills
     are fetching a premium on the labor market, and those without skills are less likely to get better jobs and more
     likely to be inactive.
     Underemployment is rising, and labor force participation rates are declining: Hours worked in urban
     areas are falling, and in rural areas inactivity has increased. Young people especially are affected by these changes.
     Gender does not matter as much as experience in the decision to work, but it is a strong determinant of
     the type of work that a person is able to get and of earnings in the job.
     The public sector is absorbing more skilled people and pays more.


     LABOR MARKET DEMOGRAPHICS
     Labor force participation is generally high; it seems to be falling in rural areas but rising in urban ones.
     High labor force participation is common in low- and lower-middle-income countries, where poorer people cannot
     afford not to work. The 2014 LFS put the shares of employed women and men even, at 91.4 and 91.5 percent,
     and estimates male unemployment at just 3.8 percent and female unemployment at just 3.5 percent (figure 14).
     Compared with 2008, this suggests a decline in male employment (97 percent in 2008 and 94.4 percent in 2012)
     and a very slight increase in female employment (90.7 percent in 2008 and 91.6 percent in 2012). Labor force
     participation in aggregate had declined slightly since 2008, when 1.6 percent of working-age men and 6.9 percent
     of working-age women were recorded as not in the labor force. By 2014, 4.8 percent of men and 5 percent of
     women were not in the labor force. The drop seems to be due to a decline in participation in rural areas. The share
     of Zambians who were not in the labor force and were living in rural areas grew more than fourfold, from
     9.1 percent in 2008 to 40.1 percent in 2014. In contrast, the share of working-age people in the labor force in
     urban areas seems to have improved between 2008 and 2014.
     Youth (ages 15–24) are a significant and growing share of the working population but are becoming
     less likely to be employed. Figure 15 breaks down the observed decrease in dependency mentioned in chap-
     ter 1. By 2014, the share of children below age 15 had declined to 45.1 percent, and the share of elderly people
     was just 2.5 percent. This means that 52.4 percent of the population was of working age and 21.2 percent of
     working-age Zambians were youth. It is common for young people to take time to find their first job, and if
     youth are staying longer in school, a decline in labor force participation may be a good thing for future worker
     productivity. That said, figure 16 suggests that youth who are about 20 years old are taking longer to transition
     from school to work, as the share at that age who were neither working nor in school had increased by 2014.

     In 2008 about 80 percent of 25-year-old men and 16 percent of 15-year-old men were working, compared
     with about 70 and 10 percent in 2014. But a larger share of youth (both ages) in 2008 were both in school and
     working, perhaps implying an increase in youth work for family businesses. Figure 15c also suggests that youth
     have become a higher share of those who are not in the labor force.


     ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION WINNERS AND LOSERS
     Further disaggregation of who is making the transition out of agriculture to new jobs in services and
     industry suggests that younger workers and men are benefiting.14 Figure 17a shows that the big shift
     in employment out of agriculture took place in commerce and other services, with gains also in construction,
     manufacturing, and transport and communications. Figure 17b suggests that men have moved out of agricul-
     ture into industry and services, whereas women have moved out of agriculture into services, and that about half
     of women have remained in agriculture compared with only about 35 percent of men. Figures 18 and 19 shows
     that a significant share of those leaving agriculture were youth. In 2008, 37.4 percent of those employed in
     agriculture were youth, whereas by 2014 that share had fallen to 27.8 percent (figure 19). Nonetheless, agricul-
     ture remains the biggest sector of employment in all provinces other than Lusaka and Copperbelt (figure 18b).
     Better jobs seem to be being created through the increases in formal work, including agricultural
     and off-farm work. There are more people engaged in formal and waged work, and fewer people self-
     employed in agriculture. Formal and waged work is better remunerated on average than informal work (see
     discussion later). As a share of employees, paid workers rose from 17.3 percent in 2008 to 29.4 percent in
     2014, whereas unpaid workers dropped markedly from 40.6 to 24.5 percent (figure 20). Within the rising
     share of paid employees there seems to have been a healthy increase in private waged work, from 12.0 percent
     in 2008 to 21.4 percent in 2014 (figure 20b). The increases in waged work are occurring in rural areas—
     especially for young people—but more dramatically in urban areas, for young people and for men (figure 20c
     and 20d). Furthermore, as figure 21 shows, the quality of jobs seems to be improving for those who are working,

           The sampling frame for the LFS was developed by the Zambian CSO with technical assistance support from the ILO using population
           trends across surveys. The results generated here are consistent with the CSO for the 2008, 2012, and 2014 LFS. However, these yield a
           suspiciously high drop in agriculture employment from 2008 to 2012. The drop was caused by a large shift of (female) unpaid employees
           out of agriculture and into “other services,” a shift that stopped in 2014. Excluding both unpaid workers and the “other services” category
           would not represent the actual story, so such analysis is not presented here. However, considering only paid and self-employed workers
           and excluding “other” confirms the story of structural change. On this basis, 80 percent of workers were engaged in agriculture in 2008,
           65 percent in 2012, and 48 percent by 2014.

including for young people, with increases in social security coverage and a rise in the share of youth who have
a work contract.
Zambia’s youth seem more likely to migrate to urban areas for jobs, as one would expect. Urban jobs
are becoming more important quite rapidly. Employment rates increased in urban areas between 2008 and
2014, but seem to have fallen in rural areas, which hold a larger share of working-age youth who are out of
the labor force. The share of all youth in urban areas has increased since 2008 as the share of youth in rural
areas has fallen (figure 22).
Those with skills, as proxied by education level, are more likely to benefit from the economic trans-
formation under way. Figure 23 shows that not only are unskilled people more likely to work in agriculture
than skilled workers, but also that the proportion of those with no education or with incomplete primary edu-
cation in elementary occupations has increased. Even in skilled agriculture, the share of workers with completed
primary and some secondary education has increased over time, perhaps suggesting that the increase in formal

     meaning that the findings for informality may not be statistically robust in some cross-tabulations.

     waged work in agriculture is also more demanding of worker education. People with all kinds of skills seem to
     have moved into services, where jobs are more heterogeneous and earnings reflect this fact (as shown in the
     section on earnings and duality). Education also seems to become increasingly important for those who partici-
     pate in the labor force, as indicated by the increasing shares of both female and male workers who have higher
     education levels (figure 23d). This holds true for rural as well as urban areas. The public sector and professions
     absorbed a growing share of university graduates between 2008 and 2014.
     The public sector is absorbing a large and increasing share of skilled labor and is paying more on
     average than the private sector. Figure 24 shows that between 2008 and 2014, the share of those with
     some tertiary and postsecondary education who work in the public sector increased from about 50 percent to
     about 55 percent. Furthermore, waged earnings are higher on average in the public sector (figure 25). Table 4

shows that by 2014 this was true for average wage earnings, even after controlling for education. There are
relatively few unskilled public servants, but the public sector pays significantly more for all levels of education
than the private sector does. The exception is tertiary graduates, who were paid just above the mean of the
private sector wage in 2014. Public servants also seem to have benefited from the high growth period through
more generous wages.


RISING UNDEREMPLOYMENT
The structural shifts in jobs are not without challenges: underemployment seems to be rising, for
rural and urban workers, for youth, and for those working in service sectors, especially youth work-
ing in urban services. Figure 26 shows the proportion of workers working fewer than 35 hours per week in
2008 and 2012. It shows the shares of youth underemployed by gender in rural and urban areas by sector (26a
and 26b), the sectoral breakdown of youth underemployment in rural and urban areas by gender (26c and
26d), and the age breakdown of underemployment by location and gender (26e and 26f). Across the board,
youth underemployment rose during this period. The share of young people in total urban underemployment
rose, whereas their share in rural underemployment fell. There was a dramatic rise in the share of service jobs
in youth underemployment in all locations. By 2012, over 90 percent of youth underemployment in urban
areas was in service sectors compared with about 40 percent in 2008. Both young women and young men saw
this increase in underemployment. These findings point to an important conclusion: although better jobs are being
created in the economy, Zambia is not creating enough of them. Possible explanations are examined in chapter 3 in
the section that looks at the demand for labor by firms. The rest of this chapter considers earnings from waged
work and presents the results of regressions of the determinants of labor force participation, employment type,
and earnings.


EARNINGS AND DUALITY
Wages seem to reflect the duality in Zambia’s economy. Figure 27 shows the kernel densities of the log
of monthly earnings in the 2014 LFS for paid workers, comparing formal and informal earnings, by education
and by sector. As one would expect, wages are higher for formal workers. Given the definition of formality used
here, this is especially true of contract workers (figure 27b). However, the distribution of earnings for formal
workers with contracts is bimodal, with a peak near the higher earnings and a lower mode much closer to that
for the informal sector (without contract). This bimodal distribution repeats in the earnings distributions by
secondary education (figure 27c) and in the services sector (figure 27d). The cause is twofold and likely reflects
Zambia’s dual economy. First, the public sector pays more for a given skill and hires more skilled people. Second,
the formal sector is much more capital intensive and potentially higher in productivity, especially in the emerg-
ing modern service sectors of retail, commerce, finance, transport and communications, and hotels and restau-
rants (see chapter 3). As labor shifts into services across the economy, it is likely that informality in employment
in services is increasing; and as noted in the preceding section, the number of hours worked is likely falling also.

Earnings gaps have widened over time, and duality has become more pronounced. Figure 28 shows
that not only are gaps higher for those with higher education, for men, and for formal sector workers, but also
that the nominal earnings gap—as revealed by kernel densities—grew between 2008 and 2014.
A significant jobs challenge is to help improve productivity and earnings for jobs in informal services
while promoting the development of and job creation in more productive modern services in the main
urban centers. Informal service jobs are already showing signs of underemployment, which could be a symptom
of market saturation in the main urban centers. As seen in chapter 1, most of the urbanization in Zambia has
occurred around greater Lusaka. One option would be to explore the possibility of stimulating stronger service
economies in secondary towns, which could serve agricultural zones and support agro-processing.
It will be important for policy makers not to be too dogmatic about the merits of self-employment ver-
sus waged work. Like most economies in southern African, Zambia has a higher share of formal waged work than
do many other youthful African countries, and this is a strength. However, until Zambia is able to generate much
higher growth in formal sector waged jobs than it has managed to date, the youthful and fast-growing workforce
is going to have to find informal work and engage in self-employment. LFS data suggest that the earnings potential
of self-employment, especially off-farm, is not significantly different from that for waged work (figure 29).

DETERMINANTS OF LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION AND EARNINGS
This section first presents the findings of logistic regressions of labor force participation, to better understand which
household characteristics are associated with higher probabilities of participating in the labor force. It then presents
the results of applying the same technique to employment types. Finally it presents the findings of Mincerian adjusted
earnings regressions, looking at how individual workers’ characteristics determine their earnings in the labor force.
These statistical techniques validate the descriptive data findings presented earlier in this chapter, where the focus
was on understanding the dynamics of the labor market in response to structural changes in the economy.
For the multinomial logit estimation of labor force participation and employment, all individual-level and
household-level characteristics are used, as are regional dummies and urban and rural dummies. The average
marginal effects are shown in figures 30 and 31. The full set of results appears in appendix A. In the multinomial
logit estimation of employment type, gender interactions are also included to see if the impact of individual
characteristics is significantly different for females. All individual-level and household-level characteristics are
used in the employment logit estimations as well as the region and urban and rural dummies used in the labor
force participation logit regression. The log odds are shown in figure 31. The base category is self-employed in
agriculture. Again, a full set of results for alternative models is set out in appendix A.

Employment and Participation
Older, more experienced workers are more likely to be working and less likely to be inactive. As
figure 30a shows, age has an equally positive impact on employment and negative impact on inactivity. A one-
year increase (decrease) in an individual worker’s age increases the probability of employment (inactivity) by
0.5 percentage points.
Gender matters in the decision to work and is a strong determinant of both the type of work a per-
son is able to get and their earnings in the job. Figure 30a shows that gender has a strong impact on the
labor force participation decision. Being female increases the probability of inactivity by 0.7 percentage points
and decreases the probability of employment by 0.8 percentage points. As discussed later, however, women
earn less than men for the same work, and there are some jobs that they are clearly more likely to select into.
Education is the most important determinant of labor force participation. Whereas in most cases the
impact of education on unemployment is not statistically significant, its impact on employment and inactivity is
significant. Having some primary or secondary education, whether complete or not, increases the probability of
employment by 4 to 4.5 percentage points compared with having no education. Having some tertiary education

     increases the probability by 2 percentage points but increases a worker’s earnings much more (see below). This
     is an important if not surprising finding for worker mobility. Having no education seriously hinders a worker’s
     ability to find work, and so for a rural person, living on a subsistence farm is a recipe for being trapped in pov-
     erty. Almost all education categories—with the exception of postsecondary education—have similar negative
     impacts of 3–5 percentage points on the probability of inactivity.
     Employment probability is highest in rural locations and in Copperbelt Province, because of the
     increased job creation in that area. An average individual of working age in a rural area is 3 percentage points
     more likely to be employed than a working-age person in an urban area, 1.3 percentage points less likely to be
     inactive, and 1.9 percentage points less likely to be unemployed. The regional pattern of employment and labor
     force participation therefore masks wide differences in the quality of jobs. In the regressions for figure 30b, mar-
     ginal probabilities of employment in various provinces are compared with the probability in the base province
     of Copperbelt. In all those provinces, working-age people have lower probabilities of employment than in the
     base province. For instance, the probability of employment is lower by 12 percentage points in Luapula, by
     7 percentage points in North Western, and by 9 percentage points in Western.
     Not surprisingly, in the less prosperous provinces, the probability of inactivity is higher, suggesting a
     lack of job opportunities in these areas. The probability of inactivity or unemployment is higher in all those
     provinces than it is in Copperbelt. For example, an average worker in North Western is 3.3 percentage points and
     in Lusaka 5.9 percentage points more likely to be unemployed. Workers in North Western, Central, and Lusaka are
     between 3.3 and 6.6 percentage points more likely to be inactive than workers in Copperbelt.
     Age does not seem to affect a worker’s job type by much, except for off-farm self-employment. That
     is, younger and older people have almost equal likelihoods of being waged or self-employed. Figure 31 shows
     the results of the multinomial logit estimation of employment type. Older workers are more likely to be
     self-employed in sectors other than agriculture and in other employment (unpaid and employer) than youth,
     but the magnitude is well below 1 percentage point per year.

     Women are less likely to find private waged work, less likely to be self-employed farmers, and much
     more likely to be unpaid family workers. Gender does not have a significant impact on the probability of
     being a waged worker in the public sector or being self-employed in sectors other than agriculture. However,
     being female decreases the probability of being a private wage worker by 2 percentage points and of being
     self-employed in agriculture by 1 percentage point. Women are also almost 4 percentage points more likely
     than men to be unpaid family workers.
     Education matters, and more education matters more for the type of employment a worker can get.
     Educated people are less likely to be unpaid family workers and less likely to be self-employed in non-agricultural
     activities. A higher education level has a significant and stronger impact on the type of job a worker can land,
     with the highest impact of education being on the probability of being a waged worker in the public sector.
     The public sector, which tends to hire mostly teachers, nurses, administrators, and clerks, is almost as significant
     for employment as private waged work. Thus, having completed secondary education and having some tertiary
     education increases the probability of public sector employment by about 2 and 6 percentage points respectively.
     The public sector clearly seems to be attracting skilled women, especially those with tertiary educa-
     tion. The analysis in figure 31a shows that secondary education and some tertiary education increases a worker’s
     likelihood of finding waged work. Using gender interaction terms in the employment multinomial logit regression
     makes it possible to check whether the impact of individual characteristics on the probability of getting employment
     of a certain type differs significantly for women and men. The significant and positive results are shown in blue in
     figure 31b. The analysis shows that having secondary and tertiary education increases the probability of a female
     worker being a waged worker in the public sector by more than it does for male workers. The same is not true for
     private waged work: having tertiary education has a positive impact on the probability of being a wage worker in
     the private sector, but being female does not change the impact of education on that probability. Women with
     tertiary education are less likely to be in the self-employed and other categories of work (unpaid and employer—
     mostly unpaid in Zambia) than are their male counterparts. Conversely, if a female worker has incomplete primary
     education, she is more likely to engage in unpaid family work than her male counterpart.

     Earnings
     The Mincerian wage estimations—covering only waged workers—were run for all workers and then separately for
     female and male workers. Four specifications were used: without dummies, with three industry dummies, with eight
     sector dummies, and with dummies for occupation type. The full set of results is presented in appendix A, and the
     main highlights are reflected in tables 5 to 7 and discussed here in turn by worker characteristics, occupation,
     sector, and location.
     Although experience and education lead to higher wages, women earn less than men for the same
     work. As in the employment analysis, cross-sectional wage regressions reveal that education makes the biggest
     difference—and the more education, the bigger the wage premium (table 5). However, the relative returns to
     education seem to be falling over time. In 2008 incomplete primary education had a positive and significant
     effect on wages relative to no education, but by 2014 the coefficient was not significant. In 2008 the premium
     on completed secondary education over no education was between 90 and 115 percent depending on the
     model used, but by 2014 this had fallen to between 65 (model 3) and 89 percent (model 1). The exception is
     tertiary education, which has maintained broadly the same high return to education as in 2008, indicating per-
     haps the higher public wages over time or an increase in demand for skills in the formalizing private sector. A
     significant part of this high return is related to occupation selection; after occupation dummies are introduced,
     the increment over no education in 2014 falls to 105 percent instead of 176 percent. Women earn 20 percent
     less than men (model 1), with the gender gap dropping to 13 percent after controlling for the sector of activity
     (model 4). The wage gap for women seems to be declining over time, as does the premium on age.
     Earnings from waged work are higher in industry and services, and highest in skilled occupations.
     Industry offers the more lucrative jobs on average, along with more technical service occupations (table 6). The
     average waged worker employed in industry earns about 34 percent more than the average worker in agricul-
     ture. This premium remains significant at 30 percent even after controlling for occupations. The increment for

service work over agriculture wages is half of the increment for industry work over such wages. An average
worker employed in services in 2014 had about 17 percent higher wages than one in agriculture. Given the
heterogeneity of service occupations, this premium is mostly explained by selection into occupations. Market
sales workers, craft workers, machine operators, and elementary occupations do not have a premium com-
pared with agricultural workers, after controlling for observable characteristics. However, the premiums are sig-
nificant for other occupations such as senior officials (by 73 percent), professionals (by 79 percent), technicians
(by 48 percent), and clerks (by 46 percent), compared with their agricultural counterparts. This finding suggests
that Zambia’s pathway to more and better jobs depends not only upon the transformation of workers out of
agriculture, but also on the creation of more jobs in more skills-intensive technical and clerical occupations.
Indeed, as table 6 shows, diversification into commerce (wholesale and retail trade)—unless it is in the modern
sector—will not do much for earnings as workers move out of agriculture. And as of 2014, the highest wage
premiums were to be found in public utilities, public administration, and mining.
Urban waged jobs enjoy a wage premium, both on average for the same jobs and because of
the composition of work in urban areas. Over time, however, wage gaps have narrowed between rural and
urban on average, presumably as workers moved to the cities. In 2014 rural wages were 8 percent lower than
urban wages, but this gap seems to be mostly due to variation in sectoral distributions in rural versus urban areas
(table 7). The only province that seems to have significantly higher returns than Copperbelt is Southern (table 8).
An average worker in Southern would earn 29 percent more than an average worker in Copperbelt. This differ-
ence remains significant at 27 to 29 percent even after controlling for the sector of activity. It is still 22 percent
even after controlling for occupation. In contrast, Central Province has 19 percent lower earnings on average
than Copperbelt, and about half of this difference is due to sectoral distribution differences between the regions.
Even after controlling for the sector and occupation of workers, the difference remains significant. This means
that an average worker employed in the same sector with the same occupation would still earn 14 percent less
in Central than in Copperbelt. Lusaka Province also has significantly lower average earnings than Copperbelt;
however, the 8 percent difference disappears after one-digit sector dummies are included. This means that dif-
ferences in the sector composition of jobs in Lusaka explain the wage difference between the two provinces.

     3.  EMPLOYMENT DEMAND FROM FIRMS
     SUMMARY
     This chapter analyzes the demand side of jobs, the firm perspective. The analysis suggests that Zambia’s
     investment climate has been generally favorable to firm entry and hiring for more formal and larger firms.
     Nothing in the analysis of the structure and dynamics of firms or in the regression analysis of employment,
     productivity, and wages gives unexpected results or points to obvious unhealthy symptoms of the invest-
     ment climate. The following findings warrant further analysis, however, and could have implications for a
     jobs strategy:
     Survival of small firms seems low, and yet smaller firms seem to have value added per worker that
     is similar to larger firms, despite having lower output per worker than larger firms.
     Whereas entry and foreign investment in the manufacturing sector has been buoyant, productivity
     (output per worker) in the sector appears to be lower than in other sectors, in regressions controlling
     for other characteristics.
     Productivity in the largest firms (50 staff members or more) is lower than for small young entrants,
     after adjusting for other factors.
     The distribution of labor productivity across mining, manufacturing, and commerce is bimodal, pointing
     to asymmetric costs, unfair competition, or (most likely) dualism in these sectors.
     There are large (and foreign) firms of all ages across most sectors, mixed in with plenty of smaller and informal
     firms and self-employed workers. This not only sends the message that Zambia is open for business, but also
     allows potential scope for connecting large- and small-scale firms in value chains in specific locations.
     The most common locations for incumbent firms and for entrants and job creation are in the corridor running
     from Copperbelt through Lusaka to Livingstone in Southern. This corridor has high crop potential, is densely
     populated, has good access to markets by road, and also has a high poverty density. A jobs strategy for Zambia
     should investigate the potential to develop more jobs with higher productivity in the densely populated and
     poor regions of Eastern and Northern provinces.

     DEMAND FOR WORKERS BY FIRMS
     This chapter considers jobs in firms—that is, the demand side of the jobs agenda. The first section uses census
     data to assess the structure of firms and employment in them. The second section considers spatial aspects of
     firm location, linking the pattern of firms and jobs to patterns in poverty density and employment and drawing
     conclusions for regional policy as part of a jobs strategy. The third section uses the proxy of firm age to analyze
     firm dynamics. The fourth deepens the diagnostic by analyzing the distribution of productivity by firms’ char-
     acteristics and then presenting the results of standardized regressions of firm size (employment), productivity,
     and wages.

     STRUCTURE OF FIRMS AND EMPLOYMENT IN FIRMS
     Zambia has a relatively good investment climate, a relatively healthy structure of firm size and age, a
     good track record in attracting foreign investment, and relatively high formality in employment, in com-
     mon with other southern African economies. These conditions likely reflect Zambia’s history of political stabil-

36
ity, the traditional urbanized mining sector in Copperbelt, and more recently, stable macroeconomic management
and the open and private sector and foreign investor-friendly business environment. The country’s ranking in the
World Bank’s 2017 Doing Business survey was 98th out of 190 countries, 20th out of the 52 lower-middle-income
countries and 7th out of 48 economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. The biggest relative weaknesses in its scores are on
trade across borders (160th, reflecting long waits rather than high financial costs), registering property (145th), and
enforcing contracts (135th). Recent severe power cuts reduced Zambia’s score on getting electricity from 109th to
153rd. In contrast, Zambia does very well on getting credit (20th globally) and relatively well on paying taxes (58th).
In the 2013 investment climate survey, Zambia scored well relative to other African economies on corruption, but
despite its good score on credit, relatively few firms actually seek credit from banks, and collateral requirements
and rejection rates are reportedly high relative to those in other countries. A large share of Zambian firms complain
about competition from informal firms. The Zambian employers’ association regularly complains that overprotec-
tive labor regulations create a disincentive for firms to hire. Some employee benefits—annual leave (between
23 and 24 days for a workers with five years of service), maternity leave (126 days), and severance pay (86 weeks
for 10 years of tenure)—are high relative to those in other countries in the region.15 Nonetheless, few firms com-
plained about labor regulations in the investment climate survey. In addition, Zambia performs below regional peers
on the regulatory environment.
Most firms are informal, small, and young, but most employment in firms16 is in formal, larger, and
slightly older firms. Zambia’s firms share some of the dual economy features reported in the discussion of work-
ers, in that most firms are informal, but most waged jobs are in formal firms. Figure 32 shows that in phase 1
of the 2012 Economic Census, 68 percent of firms were reported as informal and only 32 percent as formal.
However, formal firms were much larger on average, accounting for 72 percent of employment in establishments,
compared with only 28 percent in informal firms. This result accords with the findings in the 2010 population
census (see figure 11 in chapter 2), which recorded that 24 percent of wage workers reported working in the
informal sector.
The small number of large formal firms employ significant numbers of workers. Firms with more than
100 employees represent less than 2 percent of firms but account for almost half (46.8 percent) of all jobs in
firms. Medium and large firms (20 staff or more) account for over two-thirds of jobs in firms. Figure 33 shows
the size distribution of firms and jobs in firms. Those with fewer than 10 employees accounted for 89.4 percent
of firms but only 22.3 percent of jobs in firms. In part this is explained by the relatively large average sizes of

   Data for this chapter come from the CSO’s 2012 Economic Census, phases 1 and 2. The first phase of the Economic Census was a listing
 16	

   phase, which involved collecting data from all firms across the country that had fixed business premises. The second phase was a national
   accounts survey of all large and medium firms, as well as a sample of small firms. Total coverage in the first phase was 47,000 firms,
   whereas in the second phase it was 7,053 firms. Both phases covered all sectors of the economy. Household-based enterprises and
   self-employed farmers and fishers were not included, although commercial activities in farming and fishing, and informal establishments
   with fixed premises were included. Data refer to the 2010 business year.

     commercial farms (62 staff members), mining operations (145), and construction firms (52). Together these
     sectors account for a quarter of employment and only 2.6 percent of firms.
     Firms’ age structure suggests symptoms of healthy firm entry; most firms are young, and young
     firms tend to be smaller. Over half (58.3 percent) of the firms in the Economic Census were under five
     years old, with 19.5 percent one year old or less (figure 34). Only a quarter of the firms in the Economic
     Census were more than 10 years old. This suggests a healthy level of new business entry, some undoubtedly
     due to privatization and private sector–friendly reforms that started in the late 1990s and accelerated with
     the privatization of the copper mining company ZCCM.17 But older firms are significant employers: just over
     two-thirds of jobs are in firms that are more than five years old. Furthermore, although there is no way of
     analyzing growth over time given that there is only one Economic Census, older firms are larger on average,

and larger firms are older. Figure 34 shows the distribution of firms and employment by age, and figure 35
shows the age and size relationship for Zambia compared with other countries. Nothing in these results
suggests any irregularity in Zambia’s firm dynamics.
The structure of firm ownership indicates relatively high foreign investment across age and size
categories. As is normal everywhere, the number of foreign firms is much lower in Zambia than the number
of domestically owned firms. But these firms are much larger on average, partly reflecting the sectors of foreign
investment: mining, manufacturing, construction, transport and communications, and banking all have active
foreign companies. There are a healthy number of global firms operating in these sectors, with several foreign
investors having taken business interests in Zambia following the privatization reforms in the late 1990s. Con-
sequently foreign firms are present, and employment in foreign firms is high, across a range of age and firm
size categories (figure 36).
Most firms and most jobs are in services. Four-fifths (80.2 percent) of firms are in retail (commerce) and
hotels and restaurants (figure 37). Service firms are much smaller than the average Zambian firm but quite large
compared with the average service firms in East African countries. For commerce, the average firm size is
3.6 employees, and for hotels and restaurants it is 4.9. Consistent with the age and size dynamics, established
firms (three years and over) in service sectors are larger than new entrants. For commerce, the average entrant
had 2.6 employees compared with 4.2 for established firms. The average new firm in the hotels, bars and
restaurants subsector had 3.3 staff members compared with 5.8 for established firms.
Despite being a predominantly service driven economy, and despite having seen rapid growth in
services value added, a significant share of private sector waged jobs is in traded goods, with
52 percent in agriculture and agro-processing in 2010. Commercial agriculture (12.9 percent), mining
(9 percent), manufacturing (13.6 percent), and construction (4.9 percent) together account for 40 percent of
jobs in firms. Agriculture (commercial farms), mining, and manufacturing made up just 21 percent of jobs in
new firms (less than three years old). In contrast to the dominance of services in firm distribution, commerce
and hotels accounted for just over a third (36.4 percent) of jobs in firms (figure 36). There are several possible
explanations for the relatively low share of jobs in new tradeable firms relative to all firms. One is that tradeable
firms survive and grow with age whereas smaller service firms experience more churning and exits. Another
is that the service economy was creating more service jobs in and around 2010, and tradeables were growing
more slowly with the appreciating kwacha. It is impossible to know with only one census of firms, but what-
ever the explanation, it will be important for a jobs strategy in Zambia to nurture growth in firms and jobs in
non-copper traded products, especially agro-processing, given the potential for backward links to the rural
economy and rural poor.

Zambia also exhibits a dual economy structure across locations, with the overwhelming major-
ity of firms and jobs in these firms being in Lusaka and Copperbelt. Most firms and jobs are in
the central corridor running from Copperbelt in the north through Lusaka to Livingstone on the south-
ern border with Zimbabwe and Botswana. Two thirds of all firms and all jobs in establishments are in
Copperbelt and Lusaka alone. Adding Southern and Central provinces, this rises to over 80 percent of firms
and 88 percent of jobs in establishments that are concentrated in the road corridor running through the center
of the country (figure 38). A much more dramatic picture emerges when employment is placed in the three
dimensional map in figure 39a, with the vast majority being in Lusaka, Copperbelt and Southern provinces,
and in particular the main cities and towns of Lusaka, Ndola, Kitwe, Livingstone, Kabwe, Kafue, and Chingola.

     LOCATION OF FIRMS AND JOBS
     Growth in agro-processing could bolster a jobs strategy in Zambia, because agro-firms are colocated
     with high poverty density, which correlates closely with high concentrations of self-employed and
     unpaid family workers in agriculture. Figures 40a and 40b show that although the poverty head count
     is high across most districts, especially in North, Eastern, and Western provinces, poverty is concentrated
     in parts of the country with high population density. Even though the poverty rate is lower in the central
     corridor, because population density is highest there, the density of poverty is still high. Other areas of high
     poverty density include Eastern Province around Chipata and north to Lundazi and through Muchinga,
     Northern, and Luapula provinces. Figures 40c and 40d show the colocation of self-employed farmers
     and unpaid family workers in agricultural households with commercial farms and agro-processing firms.
     Consistent with figure 39, the spatial pattern shows high concentrations of jobs around the cities and
     towns in the central corridor, but it also shows that agro-firms—especially the smaller ones—are located
     closer to the areas of high poverty density and where self-employment in farming (and poverty) is most
     heavily concentrated. Ongoing research by World Bank staff18 indicates that outside the growth corridor,
     the Eastern and Northern provinces have the potential to create more jobs in agro-based firms if more
     commercial farming can be attracted to these provinces, including through investments in transport access
     and electricity connectivity.


     FIRM DYNAMICS
     Without panel data, firm dynamics can only be deduced. This section uses firm age (data on the year that a firm
     was established) to conduct analysis of new and established firms. This makes it possible to check whether the
     patterns and structure of firm entry offer clues to firm growth dynamics that could reflect weaknesses in the
     policy and institutional environment or public infrastructure deficits that may need to be dealt with in order to
     create more and better jobs.

The age and size distribution of firms and jobs suggests that barriers to entry are not a significant
constraint. Young and small firms do enter the market, and although firm survival rates seem quite low, firms
that survive do seem to grow. Figure 41 shows that although most firms are young micro-enterprises, jobs are in
fact spread broadly across firm age and size groups, both for the economy as a whole and for the manufacturing
sector. Compared with other African countries, in Zambia most waged jobs are in relatively large and formal firms.
Most firms are small and young, especially in services, but large and medium firms are the source of most manu-
facturing jobs. This means there are already lead firms in most subsectors, suggesting that a job strategy designed
around supply chains of large leading firms may be feasible in Zambia. Furthermore, job creation through firm
entry looks promising—as evidenced by relatively high shares of entrants (age 0–4) among manufacturing firms
and of manufacturing jobs across all firm sizes. Deeper analysis reveals that formal medium and large firms seem
to start quite large and then grow. Young, formal, entrant firms fall disproportionately into the medium and large
categories but are smaller than incumbent formal firms in the same sectors, on average. Smaller and informal
firms seem not to grow over time, on average. Entrants in this category have the same average employment size
as incumbents, and the share of entrants among small and informal firms is much higher than for formal firms,
suggesting that survival rates in micro and small firms could be low (figure 41).

     Entrants tend to follow incumbents by agglomerating in the central corridor, and whereas most
     entrants are small, informal service firms, there are encouraging signs of entry of manufacturing
     firms. The pattern of entrant firms and jobs closely follows the pattern of incumbent firms and jobs, show-
     ing strong agglomeration around Lusaka and in the central transport corridor connecting Copperbelt to
     Livingstone (figure 42). Figure 43 shows that the booming mining sector created a significant number of new
     jobs in entrant firms in the three years prior to the Economic Census: 9 percent of firms were new, accounting
     for 11 percent of mining jobs. But otherwise, retail (commerce) accounted for most new entrants and most
     new jobs. Figure 43 also shows that about 22.5 percent of firms in commerce and about 16 percent of jobs in
     commerce were in entrant firms (fewer than three years old). Fifteen percent of manufacturing firms and
     6.5 percent of manufacturing jobs were in new entrants.
     Most of the new manufacturing jobs were in the manufacture of food products, and most of these are
     in firms located in Lusaka, Copperbelt, and Southern provinces. Nonetheless, there is some evidence that
     new, smaller agro firms (commercial farms and agro-processors, largely in grain mill products) are entering
     in Northern and Eastern (around Chipata) provinces. Given the colocation of high densities of poorer, self-
     employed farmers and good agricultural potential, near markets with high population density, further and

more updated analysis of the nature of new firms in these provinces would be warranted in appraising a jobs
strategy for Zambia. On the face of it, there could be potential to generate substantial jobs in commercial
farming and agro-processing in these provinces, with possible spillover effects to poor farmers, if value chain
links can be encouraged.


PRODUCTIVITY, EMPLOYMENT, AND WAGES
This section presents evidence from standardized analysis of productivity and standardized regressions of pro-
ductivity, employment and wages using data from phase 2 of the 2012 Economic Census.19
Employment and labor productivity are positively correlated in all sectors except agriculture, which
is a normal and healthy sign for the investment climate. Figure 44 displays standardized plots of the
log of value added per worker against the log of employment for firms in phase 2 of the Economic Census
for which the necessary data are available. Results are shown for all firms in the economy and then for firms
in five main sectors; agriculture, manufacturing, mining and utilities and construction, commerce, and other
services. The relationships are broadly healthy—on average, for all firms, larger firms have higher value added
per worker, which one would expect given their economies of scale and their access to capital. Manufacturing,
commerce, and services seem to hit diseconomies of scale (though confidence intervals widen because of the
smaller number of large firms). Mining seems to require a minimum efficient scale before higher productivity
can be associated with higher employment (the graph shows an upward slope following an initial downward

     slope). The patterns between value added per worker and firm employment size are very similar to the patterns
     for output per worker and firm size (not shown here, for that reason).
     Analysis of the distribution of productivity by firm characteristics also suggests general good health
     in the investment climate. Figures 45–48 show the distribution of value added per worker and output per
     worker for firms by size, age and sector, and where data were available, the distribution of output per worker
     by ownership and formality (figure 45). These graphs are unadjusted for firms’ characteristics, so the regression
     results in the final section of this chapter adjust for their characteristics and locations. As should be expected,
     firms are more productive with size and age. Foreign firms and exporters are not only larger than domestic firms,
     but are also more productive. Domestic private firms are more productive than public firms, and formal firms
     are more productive than informal. All of these results suggest that the business climate is normal and healthy.
     Output per worker is more dispersed across firm age and size than is value added per worker.
     So whereas larger and older firms are more productive in output per worker, their costs per worker (either
     materials or else indirect costs of rent, fuel and energy, transportation, utilities, and administration and
     financing) seem to be higher on average. This is especially true among manufacturing firms (figure 48) and,
     to a lesser extent, mining.

Firms in commerce and mining are the most productive in terms of both output and value added per
worker. Output productivity varies quite broadly within all sectors, as evidenced in the wide distributions of
productivity. This once again suggests possible dual economy features may be at work, and/or that the econ-
omy may be lacking in spillovers or selection (that is, that inefficient firms can coexist with efficient firms in the
same sectors). The evidence for a lack of selection does not seem to be borne out by the findings on entry and
firm growth with age—both of which would suggest that firms face incentives through competition and entry
to innovate and expand with age. It does seem more likely (and is cited as a competition problem by firms in the
2013 investment climate) that informal firms coexist with formal firms. This may also explain the convergence
of value added per worker with size and age compared to output per worker. It does seem likely that smaller
informal firms face lower cost structures than larger formal firms. Since larger formal firms certainly create more
waged jobs, this aspect of the regulatory environment may need attention as part of a jobs strategy for Zambia.
A jobs strategy for Zambia should seek to exploit the potential for waged work in commercial farm-
ing while also seeking to increase productivity and firm entry in other sectors. Labor is very often more

     mobile within locations and within occupations than across them, and most workers—and the vast majority
     of the working poor—are rural people with strong ties to agriculture. And many (commercial) farms in Zambia
     have higher labor productivity than almost half of all manufacturing and mining companies. Thus, although
     diversification of labor out of agriculture and into manufacturing and services is a healthy long-term structural
     transformation, it is nonetheless worth recognizing these implications of the broad range of productivity distri-
     butions for a jobs strategy.
     Older, foreign, and more productive firms are larger on average than young, domestic private firms,
     as shown by regression results for firm employment. Firms that are 6–9 years old have 30 percent higher
     employment on average, and those that are 10–19 years old have 50 percent higher employment. Firms that
     are 20–29 years old are 77 percent larger on average, and those over 30 years old are 150 percent larger on
     average. Controlling for exporters and productivity, older firms remain significantly larger on average, and this
     effect increases after adjusting for sectors. The relationship between age and size still holds, but less strongly,
     after adjusting for ownership—suggesting again that there is an important role for new foreign firms in Zam-
     bia’s jobs story. The robust result for age appears meanwhile to validate the earlier finding that firms in Zambia
     grow if they survive. Agriculture firms are significantly larger on average, taking into account age. Exporters,
     especially firms producing traditional exports (mining and agriculture), are larger on average, as are firms in
     Lusaka (by 50 percent over Central Province), although the coefficient is significant only at the 95 percent con-
     fidence interval. A full set of regression outputs is attached in appendix B.
     Older, foreign, public, and exporting firms are more productive than small, young, and domestic
     private firms, as shown by regression results for productivity, adjusted for location and industry fixed
     effects. Up to medium-size firms (20–47 staff) have higher labor productivity, using value added per worker. But
     firms with more than 50 staff members tend to be less productive, after controlling for location and industry.
     Regressions also reveal unsurprisingly that Lusaka, Copperbelt, and Southern provinces are the most productive,
     controlling for other factors, and Eastern and Muchinga provinces least productive. Firms with market power
     (sales) are less productive. Perhaps most troubling, manufacturing appears to be the least productive sector in
     terms of value added per worker, after controlling for other fixed effects. Like value added per worker, output
     per worker is also negatively associated with the average size of the firm, suggesting that on average, firms do
     not enjoy economies of scale.
     Larger firms appear to pay workers less—consistent with their lower productivity—but older firms
     pay workers more on average, after adjusting for size. Agriculture pays less than manufacturing.
     Mining pays more on average, adjusting for size and age. For services the story is more complex: bars and
     restaurants pay lower wages than manufacturing on average, whereas wholesale and retail, and transport and
     communications pay more. Wages seem to be negatively related to output (scale) but positively correlated with
     productivity, whether measured as value added or output per worker.
