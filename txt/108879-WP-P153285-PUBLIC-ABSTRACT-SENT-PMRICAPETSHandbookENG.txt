the other hand, the production of biofuels may lead to indirect
land use changes (e.g., tropical deforestation) that actually
increase net emissions.

In cases where all fuel use is regulated upstream, domestic
aviation and shipping are automatically covered. This is the
case in New Zealand. In sectors where downstream regulation
is adopted, the inclusion of aviation is a more active choice.
Shanghai has included aviation, in part because it is a large
contributor to emissions there. Since airlines have detailed
energy consumption records, it is relatively simple to measure
the emissions. Box 1.5 describes the experience of regulating
aviation emissions in the EU ETS, which includes intra-
European flights but not flights outside EU air space.

There are two methods for defining caps. The first, setting
an absolute cap on the quantity of emissions, which is fixed
upfront, is the most common. The second method is to use
an emissions intensity metric. This prescribes the number
of allowances issued per unit of input or output, such as

a	 It is also technically possible to effectively borrow allowances from a future allocation for one year, in order to meet compliance obligations for the current year. This is because
   the allocation of allowances takes place in February each year, but the surrender of allowances for the previous year takes place after this date, by the end of April. However,
   such early access is only permitted within but not across trading periods (i.e., access to phase III allowances for compliance in phase II is not allowed) (EC, 2015b).
b	 Sector-specific true-up dates in early implementation.
c	 The NZ ETS allows unlimited banking, except for allowances bought at the price ceiling.
d	 RGGI states’ number of allowances offered at respective auction accounts is lowered if the number of banked allowances rises.
e	 For example, banking from first to second compliance period is allowed but from first to third it is not.
f	 The Waxman-Markey Bill proposed a national ETS in the United States. It passed the House of Representatives in 2009 as the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009

g	 Unlimited from one year ahead (without interest), up to five years further into the future; is limited to 15 percent of the compliance obligation, and subject to an 8 percent
   interest rate.
h	 Every year, units corresponding to at least 30 percent of former year’s emissions must be surrendered.
i	 Borrowing is not allowed except under limited supply scenarios.
j	 The Australian CPM was repealed in 2014 after a change in government.

  BOX 5.2	 CASE STUDY: Banking in Phase II of the EU ETS

  During Phase II of the EU ETS, a “surplus” of allowances relative to emissions projections developed (see the figure below). Prices
  reflected continued market demand for allowances that could be banked, in the expectation that they would be valuable in the
  future.
  However, this resulted in speculation over future policies becoming the principal driver of changes in the ETS price during

Because allowances have a financial value, they can constitute
an investment opportunity. As such, in many cases, market
participants are not limited to compliance entities, but may

also include financial intermediaries in secondary markets. By
providing temporal flexibility and holding advance auctions
(see Box 5.3), policy makers can facilitate the creation of
financial instruments by financial intermediaries that allow
entities to better manage the risks associated with fluctuating
allowance prices (see Step 6). This can, in turn, improve their
ability to take advantage of the flexibility allowed via banking
and borrowing.

Four financial instruments (derivatives) that can often be
important in carbon markets are detailed in Box 5.5.




99	 From ARB’s Initial Statement of Reasons, justifying the 3-year compliance period:
    “A three-year compliance period provides some temporal flexibility by allowing
    covered entities to manage planned or emergency changes in operations over the
    short term, as well as to deal with low water years that might affect the generation
    of hydroelectric power” (ARB, 2010, II-17). And ARB’s justification for partial annual
    compliance, to address potential adverse selection: “Staff also recognizes that there
    is a need to require covered entities to submit a portion of its compliance obligation
    more frequently to ensure they are making progress toward their obligations.
    Covered entities could emit GHGs and then declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease
    operation before fulfilling their compliance obligations at the end of the three-year
    compliance period” (ARB, 2010:II-22).

            exchanges (allowances, offsets, cash flows) at a given
            time or for a set period of time. Common examples are
            allowance-offset swaps. For example, in some trading
            systems, a limit has been set on the amount of offsets
            installations can use for compliance. Since there is
            often a difference in the price between offsets and
            allowances themselves, companies that have not yet
            reached their quota of allowed offsets may sell their
            allowances and buy offsets, thereby taking advantage
            of the price difference vis-à-vis companies that may
            have more offsets than allowances and are already
            over their quota.

   This drawing shows a simplified example of the standard methodology to monitor and calculate
   combustion emissions from a hard coal fired power plant. Here, emissions are calculated by
   means of activity data for the inputs coal and carbonate multiplied by emissions factors. As the
   energy content of coal varies, an adjustment must be made for fuel quantity multiplied by the
   net calorific value (NCV). The amount of hard coal and carbonate is measured via a truck weigh
   station; for the major emissions source, the steam boiler, the NCV and the emissions factor are
   determined by sample analysis, while for the minor emissions from the flue gas cleaning unit, a
   standard emissions factor can be applied.

through the default factor, entities will not have an incen-

can be improved if flexibility is provided for entities to
adopt more accurate approaches than the default, as the

       Tokyo                                 The following measures may be taken in two stages: 
                                                 First stage: The Governor orders the facility to reduce emissions by the amount of the reduction shortage multiplied by 1.3. 
                                                 Second stage: Any facility that fails to carry out the order will be publicly named and subject to penalties (up to 500,000 JPY [3,828

       California                            Under the Cap-and-Trade Regulation, if an entity fails to surrender sufficient instruments to meet its obligation, California imposes a
                                             non-enforcement incentive requirement that the entity submit four compliance instruments (only one quarter of which can be offsets)
                                             for each instrument the entity failed to surrender. Of these four instruments, one is permanently retired, effectively reducing the cap,
                                             and three allowances are recirculated through the auction mechanism. If an entity fails to meet this untimely surrender obligation (i.e., 4
                                             times per metric ton missed), California may institute formal enforcement actions, including seeking penalties as defined by statute. This
                                             includes statutory penalty provisions setting forth penalty amounts of 1,000-10,000 USD (921-9,204 EUR) per day per violation (i.e., per
                                             metric ton that remained unsurrendered) for strict liability, and increasing amounts depending on the level of intent.

       Québec                                Companies failing to surrender enough allowances to match their emissions have to surrender the shortfall plus a 3 for 1 penalty.
                                             Furthermore, depending on the infraction, they can face additional charges varying from 3,000–500,000 CAD (1,988-331,250 EUR) and
                                             up to 18 months in jail in the case of a natural person, and 10,000–3,000,000 CAD (6,625-1,987,500 EUR) in the case of a legal person.

     on the economy.                      economy money. RGGI, for example, is thought to have produced significant economic benefits despite long periods of low allowances
                                          prices. A well-designed ETS may be able to reduce those emissions more cheaply than other policy options.

     A carbon tax is better than an       A carbon tax and an ETS each have strategic merits and differences that should be considered by each jurisdiction. Both an ETS and a
     ETS.                                 carbon tax result in a price on emissions that can change behavior. Under an ETS, the government constrains emissions quantity and
                                          the market sets the price, whereas under a carbon tax the government sets the price to provide a constant signal and the emissions
                                          quantity is not constrained. Both can involve policy uncertainty regarding future ambition and both can provide special measures for
                                          managing leakage and competitiveness impacts. When an ETS includes auctioning, it can generate revenue that can be reinvested or
                                          returned to the economy, as does a carbon tax. An ETS adapts more readily to changing market conditions than a carbon tax, and allows
                                          international cooperation.

     Emissions trading allows polluters   An ETS limits the system’s total contribution to net global emissions, and then offers flexibility as to whether participants invest in
     to avoid responsibility for          reducing their own emissions or help reduce someone else’s emissions. Participants that choose not to reduce their own emissions bear
     reducing their emissions.            the full costs of that decision.

                                          that improve their emissions intensity and innovate, which can help improve their competitiveness in the longer term, especially as
                                          carbon regulations develop around the world.

     Free allocation is a subsidy from    Free allocation, whether permanent or temporary, can help businesses and other affected entities to adapt more smoothly and gradually
     the government to polluters.         to carbon pricing, and can reduce perverse leakage effects that raise global emissions and cause job losses. Free allocation under an ETS
                                          is not considered a subsidy under international trade rules.

     Participants who receive free        Free allocation helps recipients manage the costs of ETS obligations, while they still retain the economic incentive to reduce their

      revisiting New Zealand’s climate change policy objectives
      and deciding whether to proceed with an ETS. After this
      review, the new government chose to retain the NZ ETS
      with substantial amendments to moderate its expected
      impact on the economy.
      The first mandatory NZ ETS review was conducted in 2011
      by a panel of seven nongovernmental experts under the
      government’s terms of reference.b It included a six-week
      consultation period with public submissions and the
      preparation of expert reports. The panel publicly released
      an in-depth review report that the government took into
      consideration in its 2012 proposal for amendments to
      the NZ ETS.c The government ultimately chose to accept
      some—but not all—of the panel’s recommendations. The
      process helped influence the government’s decisions and
      build public understanding of the system.
      In its 2012 legislative amendments, the government
      changed the NZ ETS review process.d Reviews are now
      optional at the discretion of the Minister, no guidance
      is provided on the scope of the terms of reference, and
      there is no requirement to use an independent panel.
      If no panel is involved, the Minister must consult with
      stakeholders and representatives of Maori iwi (indigenous
      people) who are likely to have an interest. This change in
      review provisions reflected the perception that the initial
      review provisions were resource-intensive and resulted in
      a very lengthy process. The new review provisions reflect
      a trade-off between less onerous responsibilities for
      government and less certainty about the review process
      for stakeholders.
