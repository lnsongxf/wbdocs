                                                            1. Introduction

Why and What

The financial crisis that hit the global market in the middle of 2008 gave way to the sharpest
contraction of the European economies since the Great Depression. In 2009 the economic
output in the countries of the European Union shrank 4.5 percent, the largest reduction in
GDP since its creation. Since then, the economies have slowly recovered, but unemployment
has continued to rise, reaching 11 percent in 2013, up from 7.1 percent in 2008.

The economy of the European Union shrank 4.5 percent, the largest reduction in its GDP
since the Union’s creation. Furthermore, for the European Union as a whole, long-term
unemployment among 15- to 64-year-olds has increased from 37.2 percent in 2008 to 47.5
percent of total unemployment in 2013. In several countries more than half of those
unemployed are long-term unemployed, that is, they have been looking for jobs for more
than 12 months. In Greece and Bulgaria the share of long-term unemployed in 2013 was 67.5
percent and 57.3 percent, respectively. Youth unemployment, on the other hand, has
increased almost 8 percent since 2008, reaching 23.3 percent in 2013 in the EU-28 countries.
In Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary, around a fourth of 15- to 24-year-olds are unemployed;
in Greece close to 60 percent of youth were unemployed in 2013.

Long spells of unemployment expose individuals to impoverishment. They can also lead to
deterioration of skills and detachment from the labor market. Youth unemployment is
particularly concerning as it risks damaging longer-term employment prospects for young
people, leading them to face higher risks of exclusion and poverty. Youth unemployment also
has growth implications as a generation of educated and productive people are not working
at their potential. Finally, very high levels of youth unemployment for long periods of time
can become a threat to social stability.

Another issue of concern is the demographic change in Europe. As the baby boomers’ cohort
approaches retirement, the younger cohorts entering the labor market are smaller due to the
low birth rate of the past decades. The results are a population that is older, and an active
labor force that is shrinking over time. This demographic change, coupled with high youth
unemployment, will have significant effects on Europe’s fiscal balances at a time when the
size of the older generations in need of adequate pensions and health care continues to
increase.

With government budgets under stress and an environment marked by demographic
changes, using the labor force to its full potential is key. Knowing what the out-of-work
population looks like is fundamental to a holistic approach to policymaking with respect to
the inactive and the unemployed. To this end, this report presents “profiles” or “portraits” of
individuals who have no or limited labor-market attachment. The profiles are derived using
the latest available European Union Statistics of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC)

surveys and focus on those who defined themselves as unemployed, retired or inactive at the
time of the survey.

The portraits attach stories to statistics. They identify distinct groups of individuals who are
the potential clients of income - and employment - support policies by examining detailed
labor market, demographic and social circumstances. The analysis is a pragmatic way of
looking at individuals through the lenses of both poverty/welfare status and labor market
indicators. In a sense it combines labor market analysis and poverty profiling.

 Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion analysis takes a comprehensive view of policy making,
focusing on both the labor market attachment of a country’s out-of-work population and the
social assistance package and poverty profile of the same segment of the population.
Through this examination of the characteristics of different subgroups, this analysis aims to
contribute policy-relevant information about the social and economic risks these subgroups
are facing, and on the barriers that hold back their labor market integration. In doing so, it
can facilitate effective formulation and targeting of policies that seek to alleviate these
barriers. In this sense, the portraits help move the dialogue on activation from a labor
market-centric view to a broader dialogue that includes social policy as a whole. This is an
important shift; for instance, social protection programs, such as family benefits and
maternity benefits, and broader social policy issues such as retirement ages, often have a
great impact on who remains inactive. By creating a space for dialogue between citizens and
between different public organizations (social, labor, health, child care, and so on) who

normally do not speak to each other, analyses such as Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
take additional steps toward more successful labor market inclusion of citizens.

Specifically, the report presents portraits of the out-of-work population of six countries
(Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania and Romania) in terms of distance from the
labor market, human capital, and labor supply conditions, as well as demographic
conditions. The analysis relies on the EU-SILC surveys for the years 2007 to 2011.1 1Latent
class analysis methodology allows multidimensional profiling of the out-of-work population,
and identifies classes or groups of out-of-work individuals that are as homogeneous as
possible within each class according to a set of observable characteristics, and as distant as
possible between classes. In so doing, this analysis provide a much richer glimpse of the very
different barriers to labor market integration that these various groups experience,
considerably augmenting the limited amount of information contained in traditional
descriptive statistics.

Box 1.1 tries to provide an intuitive understanding of latent class methodology, while Box 1.2
explains the statistical underpinning behind this methodology. The emerging profiles can
then be contrasted with the design and targeting of current activation policies, to identify
potential gaps and to enhance their design features.


Box 1.1 Latent Class Analysis —a Sweet and Intuitive Example

Latent class analysis (LCA) is used in several fields, including the medical profession and
behavioral sciences, to identify hidden and underlying subgroups of individuals that share
observable characteristics within a population of interest. To intuitively understand how this
statistical methodology works, a simple example may help. WeMakeTheWorldHappier Ltd., a
producer of “all things sweet,” is interested in better understanding patterns behind the
consumption of its products (ice cream, chocolate, and so on) among children and early
teenagers so that it can more efficiently target marketing campaigns. Also, for prevention
purposes, policymakers are trying to identify specific groups at risk of obesity or diabetes
that are not noticeable to the naked eye. Now assume that individual surveys were
conducted among a diverse group of children that included data on ice cream and chocolate
consumption. Think of these data as “indicators,” the noticeable symptoms of an underlying
vulnerability or disease. For simplicity, let’s say that individuals were asked about the
frequency of their chocolate and ice cream (ab)use; each activity could be categorized as
frequent/regular (I sneak to the fridge once dad and mom are asleep), occasional
(unfortunately the fridge is usually locked at night), or non-existent (we have actually never
seen such a child but we are told they exist).




1   Years the survey is available differ among countries analyzed.




                                                                     Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 19
Furthermore, the survey collected information on certain main demographic characteristics
(such as gender—we are told women enjoy chocolate more than menage, and having
siblings), and early-stage behaviors that are typically associated with high consumption of
sweets (regular attendance at friends’ parties, spending lots of time at grandparents’
house(s), and regularly playing sports or not). Think of these as the main correlates of a
given condition (for example, chocolate addiction); in LCA jargon, these are the active
covariates. Finally, the survey includes other demographic information such as economic
and social background, race, nationality, and so forth; in LCA terminology, these are the
inactive covariates that will simply help describe the unobservable groups.

By running latent class analysis on the dataset, each child surveyed will be placed in a
specific group (or latent cluster), based on his or her probability of answering the sweets-
consumption questions in a certain way given his/her active covariates (which, in this
example, are the main demographic and behavioral characteristics). The number of groups
obtained is not predetermined and will vary based on how well a certain model fits the
available data; however, the groups are such that every individual can be assigned to one
group only (the groups are mutually exclusive) and all observations will be assigned to a
group (collectively exhaustive). Each group can then be further analyzed along additional
demographic lines (the inactive covariates) that do not affect the fit of the model but allow
us to get a more detailed profile of candy-devourers.

For illustrative purposes, LCA methodology applied to the described dataset will construct
unobservable clusters of children that, given certain features, have the same probability of a
certain pattern of consumption. For instance, LCA might detect the existence of a cluster of
“will-eat-ice-cream-in-my-sleep” young children of both genders, who are very active, mostly
started binge-eating ice-cream at their grandparents’, and attend the birthday parties of
every child in town (even if they are not invited). LCA might also define a smaller group of
young chocolate-addicted girls who do well in school and have one or two older brothers
who are often mean to them. It might identify a group of “candy monsters” (undiscriminating
candy eaters), who consume as much chocolate and ice cream as they can, often stash
goodies under their beds, live in open defiance of their desperate parents, are not very active
in sports, and so on. The analysis could identify more clusters, each of which would differ
from the others in at least one dimension. Knowledge of these groups would allow for the
identification of early–warning signs of candy addiction, and would allow parents to take
preventive measures. Note to kids: you may want to hide this research.

Box 1.2 The Statistical Basis behind Latent Class Analysis

Descriptive statistics enable the illustration of the heterogeneity of a particular population in
a limited number of dimensions. Without other measures, it is challenging to synthetically
describe individuals in the population according to their prevailing characteristics.

The main purpose of latent class analysis (LCA) is to identify an organizing principle for a
complex array of variables. This latent variable model uses “categorical observed variables,
representing characteristics, behaviors, symptoms, or the like as the basis for organizing
people into two or more meaningful homogeneous subgroups” (Collins and Lanza 2010).
Formally, LCA enables a characterization of a categorical latent (unobserved) variable,
starting from an analysis of the relationships among several observed variables (named
“indicators”), using a maximum likelihood estimation method. The estimation model used in
this study also includes covariates, which are “variables that may be used to describe or
predict (rather than to define or measure) the latent classes and if active, to reduce
classification error” (Vermunt and Magidson, 2005).

Through LCA, individuals are scored according to the likelihood of belonging to each of the
computed latent classes, and then assigned to the class to which they have the highest
posterior probability of belonging (modal assignment) given their observed characteristics.
Statistics such as the Bayesian Indicator Criterion (BIC) are used to identify the most
appropriate number of classes, that is, the model that has on average the highest likelihood
of predicting class membership for all individuals in the given sample.

A fundamental assumption underlying LCA is that of local independence, which implies that
each of the chosen indicator variables is related to the others uniquely through the latent
class membership, and a random error. Advanced computational techniques allow detecting
and, in part, controlling for the correlation between the residuals of selected indicators, thus
enabling the use of the available information to construct categories.

The identification of latent classes relies on a number of “indicator variables” to capture
different “symptoms” of an overall latent condition (in this case, joblessness). The challenge
in such models is to identify a discrete number of variables that can best explain the
heterogeneity of individual outcomes. In this report, two or three sets of categorical
variables were selected to show the extent of labor market distance and to capture some of
the main factors that can affect employment on the supply side: labor supply conditions
(household-level incentives to work and physical ability to work), prior work experience,
and human capital (Box 1.3 explains the definitions of labor market status and education
levels used in this report).

In addition to indicators, the model includes active covariates, which are used to improve the
classification of individuals into each class. Demographic variables that are normally used to
disaggregate labor market outcomes, like age, gender, highest educational level achieved and
degree of urbanization are typically active covariates.

Once the latent classes have been defined, inactive covariates that were not included in the
model can be used to characterize the individuals in each class and the households in which
they live in great detail. Examples of these covariates are variables that indicate household
welfare conditions, such as income quintile, labor market status of a partner and household
ownership, and variables for household demographics such as household size and whether
the household has children under six years old, among others.

The resulting groups are then labeled according to their main distinguishing characteristics.
Given that a large number of characteristics describe each group, often a few salient ones are
used to name the group. In short, the labeling of groups can be considered more of an art
than a science. However, the names do represent an important starting point in the design of
social policies, and in the prioritization of activation policies.


Box 1.3 Definition of Labor Market Status and Educational Levels Used in this Report

In order to categorize the out-of-work population according to labor market status, we first
use the EU-SILC household register variable corresponding to the self-defined current
activity at the time of the household interview. This variable allows for the classification of
individuals as employed, unemployed, retired, or “other inactive.” Next, the variable from the
personal questionnaire, in which individuals again self-define their labor market status, is
used to further classify the inactive into disabled or “other inactive.” 2 The EU-SILC self-
defined employed status differs from the standard ILO (International Labor Organization)
definition used in European Union Labor Force Surveys (EU-LFS), which classifies as
employed anyone who has worked for at least one hour or had a job from which they were
temporarily absent during the reference period. Self-reporting of employment may lead to a
larger out-of-work population, to the extent that individuals working very few hours may
not perceive themselves as employed. In the same vein, the EU-SILC definition of
unemployment also differs from the standard ILO definition, which restricts the unemployed
to those who have actively searched for work during the reference period (usually two to
four weeks) and who are also available for work in the near future.3 Moreover, it is worth
noting that because disability status (that is, permanently disabled or unfit for work) is also
based on self-perception, individuals who self-report as disabled do not necessarily also
report limitations on their activities due to health problems, and vice versa. Finally, in this
report, individuals who self-define as unemployed are further classified as (short-term)
unemployed and long-term unemployed. Specifically, individuals who report having been
unemployed for the calendar year prior to the survey year are considered to be long-term
unemployed.




2 Individuals aged 16 to 24 who self-classified as students were excluded from the sample.
3 This explains why a variable indicating whether or not the individual has been engaged in an active
job search is also included as part of the inactive covariates that describe the clusters.

As regards the education variable used as an active covariate, this variable is divided into
three main categories: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education refers to
individuals who have completed at most ISCED4 level 1; secondary refers to individuals who
have completed at most ISCED level 3 (upper secondary school) and tertiary refers to
individuals who have completed ISCED levels 5 or 6 (the first or second stages of tertiary
education).5 In order to provide greater detail on educational attainment, education levels
are further disaggregated in the list of covariates, this time among the six ISCED levels:
distinguishing between no education or some primary education; primary; lower secondary;
upper secondary; post-secondary; and tertiary (levels 5 and 6 are combined into one level
due to a very low number of out-of-work individuals with level 6 education, that is, doctoral
degrees). Unfortunately, EU-SILC data does not provide further detail regarding the
qualification status of individuals, such as vocation versus general education, or any training
or certificates received.

The overarching objective of this activity is to help reduce the risk of poverty and/or labor
market exclusion by strengthening the evidence base for designing and targeting income
support, activation, and employment support policies. In this sense, LCA is not an
operational tool, but one that can guide policy making.

Nevertheless, “without demand, everything is nothing in the labor market.” In
economies where there is little or no growth, it is difficult to create demand for workers in
an open labor market, even with the most sophisticated profiling and targeting of activation
policies. This is not to say that labor supply side interventions like training, activation or
payment of benefits (linked to activation) would be useless, but they can only “grease the
wheels” of the labor market. Linkage of activation with job creation and local economic
development policies, enterprise growth policies and overall market conditions is critical.

A second caveat arises from the use of survey data from 2011. The suggestions for future
policy discussions have been derived from the analysis of the EU-SILC data from 2007 to
2011. Since that time, general economic development and country level policy reforms might
have improved the labor market integration and activation of some of the groups identified.
The World Bank team remains willing to use national EU-SILC complete datasets to update
analysis and provide more up-to-date results (provided additional reimbursement advisory
servicesRASor trust funds are available).

The report presents the analysis for six countries: Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Lithuania,
Hungary and Romania. The current set of countries represents a pilot group for this first-
time analysis. The priority for analysis in these countries was decided by the European
Commission, Directorate General of Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (EC DG EMPL),

4 ISCED refers to the International Standard Classification of Education, developed by UNESCO (United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) in order to facilitate the comparison of
education statistics and indicators across countries.
5 The educational classification used in EU-SILC data is the International Standard Classification of

Education (ISCED1997), coded according to the seven ISCED-97 categories.

The Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion country analysis reports were written based on EU-
SILC/Eurostat data according to a common methodology. After a first draft was submitted by
the World Bank team, a first review with the respective EC DG EMPL Country Desk was
conducted in Brussels. Following feedback, changes and additions received from these
meetings, a second draft of the report was presented and discussed during joint country
missions of EC DG EMPL and the World Bank with the respective Member States. Joint
country missions occurred on the following dates (all 2014): Bulgaria (January 23),
Lithuania (March 13), Estonia (March 14), Romania (April 7), Greece (April 10), Hungary
(April 25). During and after the joint country missions, Member States provided feedback
and additional material for the reports.

The report proceeds as follows: Chapter 2 starts by presenting an overview of the general
economic background and unemployment situation of the countries, followed by the main
facts. The following chapters present Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion reports for each
country separately.

Box 1.4 Limitations of EU-SILC Data

This report relies on 2011 harmonized EU-SILC data (published in 2013) in order to present
profiles of the out-of-work population according to their socio-economic and labor market
characteristics. EU-SILC data, as opposed to EU-LFS data, was chosen for this analysis
because it provides more detailed information regarding income; EU-LFS income data, on
the other hand, is limited to labor earnings and does not provide information on income
from benefits6 or other sources. Having this more comprehensive income information is
useful for prioritizing interventions among the identified clusters according to their risk of
poverty, an important welfare dimension. Furthermore, EU-SILC data allows for the
identification of broad categories of benefits received, as well the percentage of household
income that can be attributable to benefits. Again, this type of information can be
instrumental in analyzing the current welfare situation of the out of work, as well as in
formulating active inclusion policies. Despite this comparative advantage of EU-SILC data,
there are some limitations to the data that are worth mentioning.

One limitation of EU-SILC data is that it does not result in the same official labor market
statistics that are officially reported by Eurostat using the EU-LFS surveys. There are several
reasons for this. First, the anonymized EU-SILC data provided by Eurostat relies on self-
reported labor market status, rather than the standard ILO definitions used by EU-LFS. Self-
definition of employment may overestimate the out-of-work population if individuals who
work few hours self-identify as inactive, and unemployment may be overestimated if
individuals self-identify as unemployed because of their willingness to work rather than
their engagement in an active job search and availability for work in the near future. While
the individual EU-SILC country questionnaires may allow for the calculation of official ILO
labor market status, the May 2011 description of target variables provided by Eurostat
suggests that only out-of-work individuals below the official retirement age should be asked
if they have been actively searching for a job. Thus, unemployment may be underestimated
among the population under 64 years of age that has already reached retirement age.
Another important difference between the two data sources is the time horizon; the EU-SILC
survey is conducted only at one point during the year, whereas the EU-LFS survey is
conducted continuously throughout the year. Lastly, the EU-LFS survey includes individuals
as young as 15, while EU-SILC only surveys individuals aged 16 and over in its personal
questionnaire.




6 The EU-LFS survey only includes information regarding whether or not unemployment benefits are

received.




                                                          Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 25
Unlike EU-LFS data, EU-SILC survey data also provide relatively little detail concerning the
educational status of individuals. In particular, the EU-SILC survey only allows for
differentiation by highest ISCED level achieved. In contrast with the EU-LFS survey, no
information regarding vocational versus general education, field of study, or additional
training or certifications is provided. More detailed knowledge regarding the qualifications
of the out-of-work would be useful for tailoring active labor market policies, especially those
related to training. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that even with a more detailed survey,
sample limitations may still generally preclude the labeling of clusters according to their
educational status. In this report, education was only used in a cluster’s label if a clear
pattern emerged, with the education status of its members visibly differentiated from that of
other groups.

Another limitation of EU-SILC data concerns benefit data. The anonymized EU-SILC
databases provided by Eurostat aggregate social benefits according to nine categories: old-
age, survivor, family/child, unemployment, sickness, disability, social exclusion, housing, and
education. While this categorization can be useful, it is nonetheless limited. On the one hand,
“unemployment” and “old-age” benefits do not distinguish between social insurance and
social assistance. This distinction would be helpful for evaluating the targeting of social
benefits toward more socially disadvantaged groups. What is more, family/child benefits are
not differentiated, for example, between child benefits and maternity leave. These two types
of benefits can have profoundly different effects on female labor force participation.
Differentiating between the two could also aid in further research on how benefits affect
women’s decisions to participate in the labor market. Perhaps in the future Eurostat could
categorize individual EU-SILC country data regarding benefits in such a way that at least the
contributory or social assistance nature of benefits can be identified.

Some of the profiles of the out-of-work, especially those who are most vulnerable due to low
education levels, unemployment, and at-risk-of-poverty status, may comprise a significant
portion of the Roma population. However, we can only arrive at this conclusion because of
what is known about Roma from other sources. EU-SILC survey data do not include
information regarding ethnicity.7 Knowledge of which groups include Roma, and to what
extent, can aid in prioritizing policies that aim toward Roma inclusion, including reaching
out to their often isolated communities and addressing discrimination in the work force.
Information regarding ethnicity could aid in making the vulnerable situation of out-of-work
Roma more visible, and even perhaps in eliminating stereotypes of Roma as not being
interested in participating in the labor market and actively seeking work. As mentioned in
this report, the integration of Roma in the labor market is not only a moral imperative but
also smart economics in light of the aging populations and shrinking working-age
populations among EU countries with significant Roma populations.




7   EU-LFS surveys also do not inquire about ethnicity.



26 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
Finally, it is worth pointing out that latent class analysis benefits greatly from large sample
sizes, as they allow for a larger number of clusters to be identified that can be differentiated
from each other with a certain degree of statistical significance. A larger number of identified
clusters can result in identified clusters that are more homogenous within themselves and
more heterogeneous among each other. It is possible that with a significantly larger sample
size, similar to that of the EU-LFS surveys,8 a greater number of, and more importantly, more
homogenous clusters of out-of-work population could be identified, allowing for the
formulation of policies that are even more specifically tailored toward the activation
potential and need faced by each group.

surveys.

General Economic Background

After years of moderate growth, Europe was adversely impacted by the global financial crisis
and has yet to fully recover. For the countries presented in this study, the period leading to
the global financial crisis was one of high output growth. Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania and
Romania all grew at over 6 percent on average from 2003 to 2007 (Figure 2.1), more than
twice the average rate of the region as a whole.

The timing and magnitude of the contraction that followed the crisis varied among the
countries in the region. On average, the economies of the six countries analyzed contracted
8.5 percent during 2009. While Lithuania and Estonia recovered from the shock more
quickly and have since experienced positive growth rates, post-crisis growth in Bulgaria,
Hungary, and Romania has been more anemic, and has not reached pre-crisis growth levels.
Greece, meanwhile, continued to contract through 2013, with GDP declining by almost 25
percent since the onset of the crisis.

As the crisis unraveled, unemployment rates deteriorated sharply. As unemployment rose,
young workers were among the worst affectedan adverse situation that was observed in
all six countries. Youth unemployment in Greece was a staggering 58 percent in 2012, and
one-fourth of the 15-to-24 cohort remained without a job in Bulgaria and Hungary at the end
of 2013.

A look at the unemployment rates disaggregated by gender shows that there is no common
pattern among all the countries. For the average EU-28 member country prior to the crisis
there was a difference of less than 1 percent between the unemployment rate of men and
women, a difference that disappeared after 2009 (see Figure 2.2). Greece is the only country




30 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
where women had higher unemployment rates throughout the period, with gaps ranging
from 6.3 to 9.5 percentage points.

One of the most worrying developments of the crisis is the significant increase in the share of
long-term unemployed. In 2013, as shown in Figure 2.3, more than 47.5 percent of the
unemployed had been looking for work for more than 12 months in the average EU-28
country. For Bulgaria and Greece, more than half of the unemployed are long-term: 57.3
percent in Bulgaria and 67.5 percent in Greece.

Employment levels also deteriorated following the crisis. The average employment rate for
the EU-28 had been slowly rising and peaked at 65.7 percent in 2009; it had fallen to 64.1 by
2013. The fall in employment in some of the countries studied was more pronounced. After
six years of recession, employment in Greece had fallen more than ten percentage points,
from 61.9 to 49.3 percent, from 2008 to 2013.

In summary, the global financial crisis impacted both output and employment outcomes in
the EU region. While the magnitude and timing of the crisis and subsequent recovery have
varied in the countries studied, unemployment levels are still above pre-crisis levels. Of
particular concern are the increase in the share of long-term unemployment and the adverse
labor situation that youth face. These, along with other key structural issues that have
emerged from the analysis of the EU-SILC data of the countries, are discussed in the
following section.

Stylized Issues Emerging from the Analysis

The analysis of the EU-SILC data using latent class methodology in this report focuses on the
out-of-work among the working-age population (16- to 64-year olds).9 Only the working-age
population is analyzed because labor activation options—the main policy focus of this
note—are only viable for that segment of the population.

The total out-of-work population analyzed in this document has increased in five of the six
countries studied (see Figure 2.4). Estonia and Lithuania had the greatest increase in the
out-of-work population, both increasing 33 percent from 2007 to 2011, but they had the
smallest increase in terms of absolute number of individuals (55,000 and 152,000,
respectively). In Greece this group increased almost 26 percent, by more than 550,000
people. Hungary had a small increase in the out-of-work population (25,000), but had the
highest share of out-of-work in 2008 and second highest in 2011 (37 and 38 percent
respectively). Only in Romania did the out-of-work population decrease (2.5 percent or
106,000), but it remains a large share of the total working-age population (31.2 percent).

Such increases in the out-of-work population are of great concern, particularly given the
rapidly aging populations in these countries. As expenditures on pension and disability

24 who were not employed, in education or training are considered. Individuals aged 16 to 24 who are
out of work and enrolled in education are excluded from the sample; they are considered to be
investing in their final stages of human capital formation and therefore are not a particular target
group for activation policies. Individuals aged 25 and 64 enrolled in school are, however, included in
the latent class analysis and will be grouped under “other inactive.” It is important to note that this
group of students, those older than 24, accounts for only 1 percent of total population of working age in
each of the countries studied.

benefits are expected to continue to grow, increasing labor force participation rates and
addressing the barriers to employment of the various groups emerge as priorities to sustain
the economic recovery and overall standards of living.

Addressing barriers to employment effectively requires first understanding the distinct
groups that make up the out-of-work population. This report determines such groups using
latent class methodology. Integration of distinct groups into the labor market may involve a
variety of solutionssuch as increasing the transport options for rural populations,
providing young mothers with child-care options, back-to-work bonuses, and so on.
Developing comprehensive solutions to the barriers faced by the distinct groups identified is
outside the scope of this report. Rather, this report focuses on the first step in this process:
developing distinct “portraits” of the out-of-work.

The characteristics of the groups of out-of-work population vary from country to country.
Based on the EU-SILC survey for 2011, Estonia, Bulgaria, and Greece have seven groups of
out-of-work individuals, while Lithuania and Romania have eight groups, and Hungary has
ten. Nevertheless, there are some general groups that can be identified in all six countries.
Clusters of middle-aged unemployed, long-term unemployed, retirees, disabled, inactive
women or mothers, NEETs (young people not in employment, education or training) and
young unemployed are present in every country. The size, share and profile characteristics
of these groups differ, reflecting the demographics and labor market of a particular country.

Detailed findings for the groups in each country are presented in their respective country
chapters. In this section, we draw the main stylized facts that emerge in common across
these countries. Against the backdrop of the economic crisis and recovery in the European
Union, the analysis yields a number of insights across countries.

Middle-aged Job Losers

In most countries, the number of middle-aged job losers has grown in absolute and relative
terms. This issue is observed in Greece, Bulgaria, and Lithuania, where clusters of middle-
aged unemployed account for around 20 percent of the out-of-work population. In Lithuania,
there are two middle-aged unemployed groups, the middle-aged poor rural long-term
unemployed and the middle-aged educated unemployed family men. Together they represent
37 percent of the out-of-work population of 2011. Most concerning is that the middle-aged
poor rural long-term unemployed cluster more than tripled in number between 2007 and
2011, and the share that have been unemployed for more than 12 months grew from 49 to
71 percent. Although part of the increase may be ascribed to the global downturn, this group
of low-income unemployed adults is now a structural feature of the Lithuanian labor market.

In Estonia, the largest cluster identified in 2011 is also composed mainly of middle-aged
individuals, but unlike the groups mentioned above, 92 percent declare themselves as
disabled (and thus not unemployed, but rather, inactive). This group represents 21 percent
of the out-of-work population in 2011, has grown significantly since 2007 (24 percent) and
is at high poverty risk,10 as more than half of it is in the poorest income quintile and only 35

percent of households have at least one working adult. Although a large majority declare
themselves to be disabled, and 93 percent say they receive disability benefits, only 43
percent report that they have strong limitations in performing their usual activities because
of health problems.

Households confronted with job losses face increased poverty risk, owing partly to limited
benefit receipts (a low level of social inclusion benefits or the short duration of
unemployment insurance benefits) and to large household sizes. Some households were able
to counter such job losses, possibly with the labor market entry of another household
member.


Box 2.1 At-Risk-of-Poverty Rate in the EU and in This Report

According to Eurostat, “the at-risk-of-poverty rate is the share of people with an equivalized
disposable income (after social transfers) below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold, which is
set at 60 percent of the national median equivalized disposable income after social transfers.
This indicator does not measure wealth or poverty, but low income in comparison to other
residents in that country, which does not necessarily imply a low standard of living.” The
table below shows the “at-risk-of-poverty rate” in the six countries covered in this report, as
reported in the Eurostat data base and based on EU-SILC 2011 data.

Country                                  Eurostat “At-risk-of-poverty rate” (2011)
                                      (% of population below 60% of median income)
Bulgaria                                                         22.2
Estonia                                                          17.4
Greece                                                           21.3
Lithuania                                                        19.2
Hungary                                                          13.8
Romania                                                          22.2

However, for this report’s purposes, we define the at-risk-of-poverty rate as the relative risk
of being in the first quintile of the income distribution. This enables us to provide more detail
on the analyzed population. Instead of simply presenting clusters along the “at risk of
poverty” or “not at risk of poverty” dimension, we present income information for all
clusters divided by quintiles, and we refer to the first quintile as “at risk of poverty.”
Furthermore, as shown in the table above, in five of the six countries analyzed in this report
the at-risk-of-poverty rate in 2011 as defined by Eurostat was very close to 20 percent (that
is, it was very similar to the probability of falling in the bottom quintile of a country’s income
distribution). In other words, by looking at the first quintile of the income distribution in all
countries except Hungary, one can get a good sense of what the at-risk-of-poverty rate would
look like if defined following Eurostat’s guidelines.

Youth not in Employment, Education or Training (NEETs)

An increase in the size of the NEET population was also observed in many countries, with
young adults continuing to live in multi-generational households and struggling to enter the
labor market. Labor force participation was low among youth in many of the countries
studied to begin with (see Figure 2.5). Further, the percent of young individuals aged 15 to
24 that are not in employment, or education, or training (NEET rate) was high and increased
in all countries following the crisis (Figure 2.6). For the region as a whole, the NEET rate,
which had fallen to 10.9 percent in 2008, in 2013 was back at 2003 levels (13 percent).

The adverse labor situation faced by youth is also captured in the latent class analysis of the
EU-SILC data. In all six countries analyzed, it is possible to identify a cluster of youth or
NEETs that make up an important share of the out-of-work population. In Estonia this
cluster almost doubled in size from 2007 to 2011 (from 11,000 to 20,000 individuals). The
NEET cluster in Greece grew more than 25 percent from 2007 to 2011 and accounted for
almost half a million individuals in 2011. In Bulgaria, on the other hand, this cluster grew
from 197,000 individuals in 2008 to 233,000 in 2011. About 80 percent of the Estonians, 60
percent of the Bulgarians, and 46 percent of the Greeks in these clusters have no prior work
experience, and around 40 percent of the Estonians and Bulgarians belong to the first
income quintile (27 percent of the Greeks do). The activation of these individuals should be a
priority for policymakers, to avoid the further depreciation of the stock of human capital
among these young individuals and to promote their long-term wellbeing.

Quite importantly, some of the NEET clusters in the portraits include individuals above the
age of 24 (the usual age limit of NEET categorization).11 It may be crucial to ensure that such
young adults, who continue to remain vulnerable, are also considered for first-time labor
market entrants’ programs.

Note: NEET rate is calculated as the percentage of the population aged 15 to 24 that is not in
employment, education or training.


Early Retirees

The labor force participation rate for older people in the countries under study is, in general,
among the lowest in Europe. As Figure 2.7 shows, this is especially true for Romania, Greece
and Hungary, whose labor force participation rate for both the 55- to 59-year old and 55- to
64-year old cohort is much lower than the EU-28 average of 70.3 and 54.3 percent,
respectively. The low labor participation for the 55- to 64-year old cohort may reflect in part
that a relatively high percentage of the population aged 60 to 64 have reached retirement
age in all these countries, particularly among females.

Retirees (below 64 years) and early retirees (in this report, below 60 years) are a
noteworthy phenomenon in most of the countries under study. Many of the members in
these profiles also declare themselves to be limited in their ability to work. In many
countries, the welfare position (risk of poverty) of the retiree and early retiree households is
rather favorable in comparison to the other out-of-work population groups (due to low but
stable retirement income, small household sizes, and so forth).




11Thirty-five percent of the individuals in the NEET cluster in Bulgaria are between 25 to 34 years old.
This share is 18 percent in Estonia, while in Greece 60 percent are in this age group.




36 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
Retirement and disability are the main reasons for the population in these age groups to be
out of the labor market. Indeed, it is possible to identify clusters of retired or disabled
individuals in all the countries analyzed, and in some cases they make up an important
portion of the out-of-work population. Disabled individuals, on the other hand, identified
either because they declare their labor market status as disabled or otherwise declare strong
limitations on daily activities due to health conditions, make up more than 20 percent of the
out-of-work population in Estonia, Lithuania and Hungary. The combination of rising
numbers of disabled individuals and an aging population will likely increase expenditures on
disability benefits and old-age pensions that governments will have to pay in the coming
decades. As the working-age population shrinks and life expectancy grows, raising the
retirement age and increasing labor force participation among older individuals may prove
important to counteract a shrinking workforce and the increasing fiscal costs related to
aging.

Early retirees account for around half of the out-of-work population in Romania and 30
percent in Hungary. In Romania, half of these people, almost one million individuals, have
not reached retirement age; in Hungary, almost 40 percent of the mostly male early retirees
and retirees cluster are between 45 and 59 years old.12 In Bulgaria, two clusters contain a
large number of early retirees: retired and early retired men and low-educated early retired
and disabled; together they represented 16 percent of the out-of-work population in 2011. In
the first cluster, almost half are between 45 and 59 years old,13 while in the second one, all of
them are under 59 years old, and half of them are retired (another 40 percent are disabled).

A cluster of early retirees also emerged in Greece after the crisis, accounting for 6.7 percent
of the out-of-work population. A striking difference is that almost 70 percent have tertiary
education, unlike the early retiree clusters in the other countries, whose members mostly
had only secondary educations. Also, more than half of the early retirees in Greece are in the
richest income quintile; 77 percent are in the top two income quintiles. Given the dire
economic situation in Greece since 2009, early retirement may be an attractive alternative in
times of high unemployment.

On the other hand, clusters of mainly retired women appear in Lithuania and Hungary
throughout the years analyzed, but their shares have been reduced over time. In Lithuania
the married rural women with old-age pension cluster’s share decreased from 25 percent in
2007 to 18 percent in 2011. Similarly, in Hungary, the urban retired women cluster’s share
also decreased from 20 percent in 2008 to 15 percent in 2011. Unlike the other two
countries, the retired women cluster in Bulgaria emerged in 2010, separating from the
retirees cluster identified the previous years. It represented a share of 20 percent of the out-
of-work population in 2011.

Inactive women and stay-at-home mothers

Inactive women and stay-at-home mothers can be identified as distinct categories in some
countries.

The high rates of inactivity in the working-age population, particularly among women, are an
issue of concern in most of the countries analyzed. Around a third of the population between
15 to 64 years of age in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece does not participate in the
labor market. On the other hand, the share of inactive women is over 40 percent for
Romania, Hungary and Greece, while this share is, on average, 34.1 percent in the EU-28
countries in 2013. On average, these three countries had a gap of more than 15 percentage
points between female and male participation rates (Figure 2.8).

When looking at the EU-SILC data, clusters of inactive women are clearly identified in most
of the countries. In Greece, the top group of the out-of-work population is made up largely of
inactive women. In Hungary, the group of inactive women accounts for 17 percent of the out-
of-work population, while in Romania the clusters containing inactive women make up more
than 30 percent of the out-of-work population. Similarly, a stay-at-home female cluster is
found in Bulgaria, Estonia and Lithuania, accounting for 12, 17 and 5 percent of the out-of-
work population in 2011, respectively.

The large groups of inactive women can be explained in part by cultural and social reasons
or by the limited availability of formal child care and elder care facilities. Figure 2.9 shows
that access to formal child care in all six countries is well below the 29 percent average of the
EU-28. Lithuania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania all have less than 10 percent of children
under three years of age in formal child care. For Hungary and Estonia, the percentage of
women 25 to 49 years old who reported being inactive in 2013 because they were looking
after children or incapacitated adults was 56.5 and 73 percent, respectively. This is much
higher than the 38.5 percent average for the EU-28. Increasing the availability of affordable

that the female addressing one of the main labor market barriers that the female population
faces.

A reduction in the inactivity of women after the crisis can also be identified when looking at
the clusters of inactive stay-at-home mothers, possibly reflecting a fall in this option’s

affordability. This decline is prevalent in all the countries in terms of the stay-at-home
mother clusters’ share of the out-of-work population. Lithuania, Romania and Greece had the
largest decrease, all falling between 8 to 9 points from 2007 to 2011. Romania had the
largest decrease in absolute numbers, with its low educated rural mothers without work
experience cluster decreasing by almost 332,000 individuals. It is interesting to see that the
number of women within the Greek stay-at-home mothers cluster that declared themselves
unemployed or long-term unemployed (versus inactive) increased from 12 to 23 percent;
similarly, in Estonia 7 percent of the young inactive educated mothers with working partner
declared themselves unemployed in 2011 (versus 0 percent in 2007). Notwithstanding this
reduction in the inactivity of women, the clusters of stay-at-home mothers continue to
represent an important share of the out-of-work population, ranging from 12 percent in
Lithuania and Bulgaria to 23 percent in Greece.

Long-term Unemployed

The high share and number of long-term unemployed is another worrisome issue in all the
countries analyzed. The EU-SILC data shows that across the clusters of unemployed, the
share of individuals in long-term unemployment in all countries has grown. In addition, in
Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, and Romania it is possible to identify clusters of long-term
unemployed that account for 12 to 28 percent of the out-of-work population. Long-term
unemployment not only imposes a significant financial burden on households, but affects the
long-term health status of job-seekers, negatively impacts government finances, and results
in a lower overall long-term level of skills among a country’s workforce, with permanent
negative effects on productivity (Katz, 2010). Equally worrisome, many individuals who
have been unemployed for extended periods become discouraged and drop out of the labor
market altogether. Addressing the plea of the long-term unemployed should be among the
policy priorities.

Rural Unemployed

Labor market participation differences and access to services between urban and rural
living contexts can be distinguished as a defining feature in some countries. There is an
important share of the out-of-work population that lives in rural areas, particularly in
Lithuania and Romania. Although in all countries except Greece, more than half of the out-of-
work population lives in rural areas, this share is 62 percent in Romania and 69 percent in
Lithuania. Additionally, the number of individuals of the out-of-work population living in a
rural area grew 40 percent from 2007 to 2011 in Lithuania. In Romania half of the clusters
have more than 60 percent of their members living in rural areas. Taking into account the
urban/rural divide of the out-of-work population in the design of activation policies may
prove critical in order to reach the desired population.

Selected Issues for Further Policy Dialogue

The current general labor market situation, along with institutional and resource limitations,
make the activation and integration of many of the identified out-of-work groups a
demanding challenge. Prioritization of intervention is therefore of great importance. This
section starts by presenting those groups identified in the country analysis that, given their
activation need or potential, should be prioritized. We later discuss the type of activation
that might best address the social or labor market barriers each prioritized group needs to
overcome barriers to employment and outline the main implications for policy discussion.
For this, this section draws on the recent study by the Bank, Back to Work (Arias et al. 2014),
which explores more deeply policies that can lead people to jobs (Box 2.2).

The following should be considered as a starting point for further policy dialogue between
the EC, the World Bank and country authorities, bearing in mind that the groups identified
are heterogeneous in ways that may affect the type of support required. Accordingly these
suggestions are not meant to be an exhaustive set of possible activation measures. It should
also be kept in mind that the groups have been derived from the 2011 EU-SILC data. Since
then, general economic development, policy actions by each government and the EC’s
country specific recommendations might have reflected some of these policy suggestions or
rendered them obsolete.

A first step for prioritization (‘activation priority’) is assessing the activation need and
potential of a group. Activation need refers to a group’s need for inclusion in the labor
market in order to achieve income and reduce or end poverty. Activation potential, on the
other hand, describes the group’s ability or motivation to be included in the labor market. A
high activation need could be driven by high poverty risk, whereas a high activation
potential could be driven by previous work experience or a relatively good educational base.
Overall priority for action can also be supported by the size of the group. Table 2.1 below
shows the groups with high and medium priority for action.

In general, clusters of unemployed have high priority owing to their activation need in terms
of poverty risks and their potential through labor market proximity and/or education level.
Clusters of youth, on the other hand, form prioritized groups because of the potential
scarring effects of labor market detachment for young people at an early age. The Romanian
cluster of low-educated rural mothers without work experience is the only group with low
activation potential who are considered high priority due to the overall size of the cluster
and strong exposure to poverty.

The groups classified with medium priority for the most part have medium activation need
in that they have comparatively lower poverty risk due to having other working adults in the
household or receiving social welfare benefits. Three clusters of inactive women with high
activation need, driven by their high poverty risk (in Hungary, Lithuania and Romania), are
considered of medium priority due to their distance from their labor market and therefore
lower potential for activation. The Hungarian cluster of educated single students, although it
has low activation need, is prioritized (like the other clusters of young individuals) because

of the potential effects of labor market detachment on this group. The clusters of retirees,
retirees’ wives and disabled are not prioritized for action owing to their lower activation
need (many have reached the official retirement age or receive old-age benefits) or extreme
distance (via very low educational attainment or self-declared disability) from the labor
market.

The relative severity of labor market or social obstacles to be overcome for labor market
integration can also be used as an orientation for activation approaches. By mapping the
respective barriers for labor market integration faced by the prioritized groups, it is possible
to discern the respective types of activation that could be undertaken for each group (Figure
2.10).

The clusters mapped near the bottom left corner have relatively lower labor market barriers
and are considered “market ready” (see each one of the six country charts in Figure 2.10
above). In this category of activation type are the clusters of unemployed with work
experience and/or education such as the prime-aged unemployed clusters found in
Estonia, Hungary and Lithuania, the young educated rural unemployed in Lithuania, and the
middle-aged unemployed heads of households in Greece. Two groups of youth without work
experience are also considered for this activation type: the Hungarian educated single
students and the single male NEETs in Bulgaria. Given that these clusters are still quite
close to the labor market, activation measures should focus on market based types of
interventions, such as providing information on job openings and assisting in job
search, application and job-matching intermediationservices that could be provided
through public employment services (PESs) or private employment agencies.

The upper left quadrant clusters are individuals that will require more intensified
activation. Clusters whose individuals have been detached from the labor market for a
longer time such as the working-age long-term unemployed and the long-term unemployed
single youth in Romania, the middle-aged unemployed in Bulgaria, and both the middle-aged
poor rural long-term unemployed and middle-aged educated family men in Lithuania are
considered to need this type of intensified activation. The Hungarian unemployed youth
cluster and the single NEET groups in Greece and Estonia are also mapped in this quadrant
as they could probably benefit from adding practical skills to their education.

Among the measures to be considered in such “intensified activation” are those that help
with job market re-entry, training and mobility. Taking into account the years of work
experience and potential industry and trade knowledge of the individuals in these groups,
reconnecting them to their previous field of employment, building on their acquired skills
and upgrading missing functional or technical skills may strengthen their case with new
employers. The older out-of-work population in these groups is particularly at risk of skills
obsolescence as the skills demanded by employers change. Activation policies should
promote effective, age-sensitive training and create the conditions for the development of a
market for adult education and training services. Moreover, in order to combat any

behavioral and attitudinal detachment from the labor market that may result after long
periods of unemployment, programs that subject individuals to a (time-limited) public
works requirement, combined with training, job search and skills support could also be
implemented. Finally, mobility measures should also be taken into account, particularly
when considering long-term unemployed in rural areas.

Additionally, linkage with regional economic development activities, self-employment and
entrepreneurship support could help some of these unemployed individuals attain self-
sufficient lives and improve their welfare. Broader structural reforms that improve the
business climate, such as those that lower the cost of starting and closing a business,
improve access to financing, and promote more favorable attitudes and social norms toward
risk taking can go a long way in fostering new ventures. Tapping into the latent
entrepreneurship of the out-of-work population not only helps them enter the labor market
but has the potential of playing an essential role in creating new jobs for the economy.

Given the potential scarring effects of labor market detachment at an early age, special
consideration should be taken to the clusters of youth. Job-start programs that offer
placement through subsidized internships accompanied by professional and life-skills
training could be a promising line of action, breaking the common barrier of required work
experience for many entry-level positions. Another line of action is larger labor market
policies that encourage flexible work schedules and part-time work. These would allow
youth to combine work and study, help them gain the necessary experience, and facilitate
full entry into the labor market. Job-search offerings by PESs should consider virtual
platforms, since the use of mobile technology will be taken for granted by many members of
these groups. Mobility support within each country and the EU (including foreign language
training) could also be considered, particularly for those with higher qualifications,
considering their low level of caregiving responsibility.

As Arias et al. (2014) emphasize, for younger cohorts, having the wrong set of skills
(both generic and technical) is often an issue. Some educational systems still track
students into vocational streams too early, neglecting generic skills that are valuable in
today’s workplace. Postponing this early tracking and promoting a diversified supply of
courses (from traditional apprenticeships to IT skills), as well as providers that have strong
linkages with employers and labor markets would be steps forward in closing the skill gap.
On the other hand, while tertiary schooling has expanded quickly among youth, quality and
relevance vary. Broader reforms that manage the expansion of tertiary education through
quality assurance systems and which make information available about the labor prospects
of various careers will also be key for new entrants to the labor market.

Clusters in the two right quadrants of the figures above have relatively higher social
barriers and therefore will require additional activation support. Most of the clusters of
inactive women are mapped in these two quadrants, depending on years of work
experience, education level, and/or poverty. For instance, the low education and lack of
work experience of the Romanian low-educated rural mothers without work experience and
the inactive middle-aged wives limit their activation potential; these groups are therefore
considered hard to serve. Similarly, the low-educated rural inactive mothers without work



                                                         Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 45
experience in Hungary and single poor rural unemployed women in Lithuania are also mapped
in the upper right quadrant. On the other hand, the clusters of stay-at-home mothers in
Greece, Hungary and Bulgaria are younger, more educated, and may have work experience,
and therefore face fewer labor market barriers. Given the lower poverty risk, age and work
experience of the Estonian cluster of inactive mothers, this group mapped in the border
between “market ready” and “special support” activation type.

In general, women face important disincentives and barriers to work, which are reflected in
the appearance of female out-of-work clusters in all the countries analyzed. Labor taxes and
social protection systems create strong deterrents for second earners (generally women) to
seek formal jobs. Along with these disincentives, women also face labor market barriers such
as lack of services (child or elder care), limited flexibility in work schedules, and imperfect
access to productive inputs, networks and information. Adverse attitudes and social norms
may also limit women’s access to jobs and in many cases reinforce each other (Arias et al.
2014).

Potential activation measures for all the clusters of inactive women are similar in nature,
ideally with options that enable women to sort into the measure that would correspond best
to their needs. In general, these groups could benefit from greater access to social and public
services near their home (such as child care) as well as from job-search assistance and
professional training. Those with previous work experience could build on it to gain labor
market entry. Opening a “window” for mothers with children in public works programs that
include child care and training opportunities might help some of these women get initial
work experience and address their poverty situation. Short “second chance” schooling with a
focus on professional skills tailored to the needs and skills of individuals could be offered.
Another possible line of action would be offering community-based social work and
entrepreneurship education to help in labor market integration. In addition to training in job
hunting and basic functional skills, (temporary) mobility support for transportation and
housing should also be considered to help women in these groups find employment in
regional or larger cities. Improving access to child care and school after-care offerings would
on their own enable many women in these clusters to better participate in the labor market
or to take part in professional training or entrepreneurship offerings. Moreover, improving
flexibility in work schedules including part-time and home-based work in order to
facilitate combining work with other responsibilities would make it easier for women to
hold jobs.

Finally, clusters that contain a large of share of individuals who declare their work
capacity to be strongly limited (in Estonia and Hungary) and clusters of low-educated,
long-term unemployed (in Estonia and Bulgaria) are also mapped to the upper right
quadrant, and will require policies that address strong social and labor market barriers.
Standard PES job search assistance and placement support, while also reassessing the labor
market status of those who declare themselves disabled, could be a potential activation
measure. For those considered fit to work, a set of support measures and continuing benefits
(potentially with a phase-out period) ought to be provided to cushion the transition to labor
market integration. By reconnecting individuals in these groups with previous employment

experiences, they could be equipped with missing functional or technical skills, second-
chance apprenticeship programs and upper secondary school certificates. Mobility support
could be an important service. Finally, improving social inclusion benefits and linking them
to activation could improve the welfare of those in low-educated, long-term unemployed
clusters.

Looking at household income composition allows assessing potential cross-dependencies
of the benefit system with labor market status. In general, only disability and old-age
benefits contribute an important share to household income, and only in those groups where
these benefit receipts correspond to the social-demographic situation of the cluster. This
highlights the fact that social protection in most of these countries is largely centered
upon pensions, providing little protection in terms of unemployment insurance or
social assistance.

Nevertheless, in Estonia, Romania, and Hungary, the high percentage of individuals receiving
disability receipts in the middle-aged educated disabled with previous work experience, early
retirees, and disabled with previous experience clusters, respectively, attract attention when
considering that only a small percentage in each group report strong limitations on daily
activity. These countries could potentially profit from a review of the disability benefit
allocation. At any rate, this significant group of out-of-work citizens needs to be followed
closely and any new applications for disability benefits closely monitored and controlled.
Limiting the inflow into this group (via more stringent disability benefit criteria) will be
easier than forcing the activated exit of members from these groups. Prevention of long-term
disability benefit dependency should also be addressed through a review of work capacity,
together with early identification of people with disabilities who can work and their
integration into the workforce through financial incentives for disabled workers and their
employers.

Although social protection systems seem to have little impact on the household incomes of
most of the out-of-work clusters in the countries studied, it is important to keep in mind that
labor taxation in conjunction with these protection systems may play a role in deterring
entry into the labor market, particularly for second earners (generally women) and lower
wage earners (such as youth). Redesigning these systems by reducing or eliminating the
abrupt withdrawal of social benefits when a person starts formal work, and eliminating
filters that make a household ineligible for a benefit if one of its members is employed,
should be considered part of the policy agenda. The challenge for these countries lies in
expanding social protection systems without creating disincentives to work.

Retirees and early retirees, on the other hand, represent a large (and growing) share of the
out-of-work population, which has important implications for fiscal expenditures. Given
their overall low need and activation potential these groups are not further considered for
activation policies during times of low labor demand and high unemployment. As with
disability recipients, stemming the outflow of new retirees may be more effective than
attempting to increase the inflows back into activity. In times of high unemployment, early
retirement may become more attractive for the long-term unemployed. Policies can and
should be implemented to delay early retirement, including reforms to pension systems and

the promotion of skill maintenance and life-long learning, along with flexible work
schedules, adaptable work environments (for example, to health requirements) and working
from home.


Box 2.2 Back to Work: Growing with Jobs in Europe and Central Asia

In early 2014, the World Bank published Back to Work: Growing with Jobs in Europe and
Central Asia, a report that studies the labor markets and enterprise dynamics in the region to
address how economies in Europe create more jobs, and what specific policies help workers
access those jobs. The findings of Back to Work intersect with those of this report, as the
policy areas that bring workers into productive jobs are the same as those that will promote
inclusion in the labor market of the inactive and unemployed individuals identified by the
“Portraits” analysis.

The main findings of Back to Work are: (a) market reforms pay off in terms of jobs and
productivity growth, although with a time lag; (b) a small fraction of superstar high-growth
firms, largely young but not necessarily small, account for most new jobs created in the
regionthus, countries        need to unleash the potentially high levels of latent
entrepreneurship to start up new firms; (c) skill gaps hinder employment prospects,
especially of youth and older workers, due to the inadequate response of the education and
training systems to changes in the demand for skills; (d) employment is hindered by high
implicit taxes on work for those transitioning to formal jobs from inactivity or
unemployment and by barriers that especially affect women, minorities, youth and older
workers; and (e) low internal labor mobility prevents labor relocation to places with greater
job creation potential.




48 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
In order for more people to access jobs, the report emphasizes that countries must carry out
institutional reforms to establish the fundamentals to create jobs for all workers. A first step
is taken by instituting reforms to create an auspicious environment for firms, allowing
existing firms to either grow and become more productive, or exit the market and make way
for new firms to emerge and succeed or fail, quickly and cheaply. A second set of policies that
should be implemented are those that support workers and prepare them, in terms of skills
and incentives, for the new jobs being created. These policies need to address those
additional barriers to productive employability that disproportionately affect younger and
older workers, women and ethnic minorities, including lack of adequate skills, low mobility,
lack of child and elder care options, limited flexible work arrangements, imperfect access to
productive inputs, networks and information, and adverse attitudes and social norms
(Figure 2.11). These barriers not only interact with other disincentives from labor tax and
social protection systems, but also reinforce each other in aggravating exclusion from labor
markets. Activation policies that help overcome these employability barriers will be
fundamental for the region’s future prospects.

Broader Policy Issues

In general, further policy dialogue with the authorities ought to focus as much on the general
level and setup of resources devoted to labor market integration and activation of the
inactive and out-of-work as on the ongoing improvement of services on the national and
local level.

From the potential activation policies mentioned in the previous section, there are a few
areas that may transversely benefit different groups within the out-of-work population and
could constitute a starting point for further policy dialogue. As stated before, the policies
outlined are by no means an exhaustive set of possibilities, and their relevance will depend
on the particular institutional framework of each country and the characteristics of its out-
of-work population.

For many out-of-work individuals, particularly youth, the older population and those who
have been out-of-work for longer periods, skill deterioration or not having the adequate set
for the employer’s needs are important employability barriers. Policies should tackle this
skill gap by prioritizing the development of a strong foundation of generic skills, ensuring
quality and relevance in expanding the tertiary education system, and making the training
system responsive to market needs and age-sensitive to enable life-long learning.

In parallel to broader education and training policies, activation services should build on
previous work experience for training and work placement. Considering that a large share of
the out-of-work population have years of work experience, training measures combined
with temporary work placement in companies, nonprofits or social enterprises could help to
strengthen labor market attachment. Reconnecting individuals with their previous industry
or profession can build on existing ties and professional knowledge, improving re-entry into
the labor market after unemployment or maternity leaves.

Meanwhile, greater coordination between social protection policies and labor market
measures will allow for more effective provision and better targeting of governmental
programs, particularly for individuals with disabilities or greater poverty risk. For some
inactive and unemployed clusters, labor taxes, social protection systems, and labor
regulation can pose strong disincentives to work. This can be particularly true in the case of
second earners (generally women), older workers (nearing retirement) and those who will
access low-paying or part-time jobs. Overall pension reform and improvement to the design
of social assistance and unemployment benefits, particularly by removing explicit bans or
penalties to (formal) work, would reduce disincentives to work. Social programs should not
only provide adequate protection to the poor and vulnerable but be compatible with work
and linked to job search and activation. Additionally, reforms that make labor taxation more
progressive and take into account hours worked and family structure may also pay off in
weakening the disincentives to work, particularly for those inactive women who are
”market-ready” and youth who wish to balance work and study.

Women, youth, older population members and minorities also face additional barriers that
should also be considered in the policy agenda. Lack of services, such as child or elder care,



50 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
limited flexible work schedules, imperfect access to productive inputs, networks and
information, or adverse attitudes and social norms limit their access to jobs. Extending child
care and early childhood development offerings as well as alternatives for elder care will
play an important role in enabling earlier labor market integration of women. Broader labor
market reforms that consider more flexible work schedules and encourage age-sensitive
work environments may be relevant in bringing women youth and the older population
closer to the labor market. Finally, the policy agenda should also consider influencing
changes in culture and social norms in favor of greater labor market participation by women,
and a more positive perception of older workers and minorities.

Geographic mobility is another policy area that is relevant for many of the clusters identified.
For those living in rural areas, improving regional transportation and other policies to
support mobility may prove necessary for access to more dynamic labor markets and
employment matching. Additionally, linking mobility to training offerings may enable some
jobseekers to participate in higher-quality training in central places. Promoting labor
migration within the EU, coupled with foreign language training, can be an important
measure to prevent the deterioration of human capital, particularly in the younger
population with higher qualifications and fewer caregiving responsibilities.

Policies that foster mobility (both internal and international) should look to remove barriers
when people want to move in search of better opportunities, and make their investments
and benefits portable. Arias et al. (2014) highlights several factors or barriers that can affect
internal mobility. Among others barriers, such as skill and lack of information networks,
underdeveloped housing and credit markets increase the cost of migration, especially for
those with liquidity constraints. Moreover, social benefits, insurance, and regional
development policies can either help or hinder mobility. Inasmuch as these policies help
people overcome financial constraints, they will allow people to connect with better jobs in
more productive regions. On the other hand, if poorly designed, social benefits (like some
housing benefits) and territorial policies (such as agricultural subsidies) can end up limiting
internal mobility, tying people to economically lagging regions and decreasing incentives to
work.

Finally, while active labor market policies, activation and job-matching support can help
smooth frictions in the labor market, they will not lead to stable, sustainable employment.
Demand for jobs comes from the economic activity of firms and the social sector; therefore
the integration of labor market policy with regional economic development policy is
especially important. Broad economic reforms to the business climate that strengthen job
creation and entrepreneurship will likely be effective in fostering the attachment to the labor
market of the out-of-work population. Additionally, any mix of activation and enabling
measures that help inactive or unemployed citizens reconnect to the labor market will need
to take a wide-ranging approach (from training to self-employment), ensuring at all times
linkage with firms (through work placements and so on), integration with efforts at regional
economic development, and building on the activity and experience base of the jobseekers
concerned. In this sense, all efforts need to be embedded into activities for economic growth
and job demand creation.

                         of-Work Population in Bulgaria
                                                                   2007−2011
Background

After years of economic expansion, Bulgaria was strongly affected by the global
financial crisis and has yet to recover pre-crisis growth rates. Between 2003 and 2008,
the country grew at an average rate of 6.3 percent, well above the 2.2 percent average
among the EU-28 Member States during the same period. Like most countries in the region,
Bulgaria was hit in 2009 by the crisis, causing the economy to contract 5.5 percent. Though
this contraction was larger than the EU-28 member state average (4.5 percent), it was
considerably smaller than countries like Latvia and Lithuania that contracted 17.7 and 14.8
percent that year, respectively. Nevertheless, Bulgaria’s recovery has been less dynamic:
gross domestic product grew 1 percent on average over 2010–2013.

Following the economic downturn in 2009, and given the anemic recovery that followed,
unemployment rates in Bulgaria have failed to recover to pre-crisis levels. The joblessness
rate for the population aged 15 to 64 in Bulgaria had declined steadily earlier in the decade,
reaching 5.7 in 2008. However, as the effects of the global financial crisis unraveled, the
country suffered a large and extremely rapid increase in unemployment; by the end of 2009,
joblessness had risen to 6.9 percent. Although the economy has been growing since 2009,
the unemployment rate has continued to grow and has doubled since the onset of the crisis,
reaching 13 percent in 2013. While the growth in unemployment is significant, such an
increase is only slightly larger than those observed in the EU-28 (11 percent) or the euro
area as a whole (12 percent).

As unemployment rates continue to rise, youth are among the worst affected.
Unemployment for individuals aged 15 to 24 years old, independent of gender, has grown
dramatically since 2009, increasing from 12.7 percent in 2008 to 28.4 percent in 2013. High
youth unemployment is also reflected in very low employment rates for youth: in 2013, this
rate was astonishingly low at 21.2 percent, compared to an average of 32.3 percent for the
EU.

The percentage of youth not in education, employment or training (the NEET rate)
increased. The NEET rate, which measures the share of youth aged 15 to 24 not engaged in
education, training or employment, rose from 17.4 percent in 2008 to 21.6 percent in 2013.
However, it is noteworthy that the NEET rate has been decreasing (falling almost 9
percentage points in the last ten years), perhaps reflecting the fact that many youth, facing a
tight labor market in which their lack of work experience puts them at a disadvantage, have
chosen to stay longer in school and/or training.

In Bulgaria, long-term unemployment as a share of total unemployment has been usually
higher than the average for the EU-28 countries. In 2013, according to Eurostat and as
shown in Figure 3.1, in the average EU-28 country almost 48 percent of the unemployed
have been looking for work for more than 12 months, up from 33 percent in 2009. Long-
term unemployment in Bulgaria has been considerably higher than the EU-28 average
during the last 10 years. In 2009, it had declined to 43.3 percent—still 10 percentage points
higher than the average EU-28 country. By 2013, 57.3 percent of the unemployed were long-
term unemployed.

Following the crisis, low-educated individuals were especially affected by the rise in
unemployment. Unemployment rates were already considerably higher for the group of
less educated individuals. After the crisis hit in 2009 the gap was accentuated, reflecting
structural changes that increased the demand for more-skilled workers (Figure 3.2). In fact,
the difference in unemployment rates for low- and higher-educated workers grew from 12.6
percentage points in 2008 to 23.9 percentage points in 2013. However, all educational
groups saw an increase in their unemployment rates from 2008 to 2013. For those with
tertiary education and upper secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education,
unemployment rates more than doubled, from 2.3 to 5.9 percent and from 4.5 to 11.7
percent, respectively.

Employment levels have fallen since the onset of the crisis, but less drastically than for
the highly educated. The employment rate for the population aged 15 to 64 peaked in 2008
at 64 percent; it was significantly lower in 2013 at 59.5. Employment rates have fallen across
all education groups, but this fall is more pronounced for individuals with an upper-
secondary education. Individuals with lower levels of education are more susceptible to
seasonal volatility. Such seasonality has also affected individuals with an upper secondary
degree since the crisis.

During the period from 2008 to 2011, the sample of out-of-work population considered
in this note increased, from 1.49 to 1.56 million individuals. The analysis of the out-of-
work population in this note focuses on the working-age population (16 to 64 years old).
Specifically, only individuals aged 25 to 64 years who are not employed, and individuals
aged 16 to 24 who were neither employed nor in education nor training were considered.14
Only the working-age population (16 to 64 year olds) is analyzed, as labor activation
options—the main policy focus of this note—are only viable for that segment of the
population. In 2011, 1.56 million out of the 4.7 million individuals in our sample, or 33.3
percent, were out-of-work. There have also been significant increases in the number of long-
term unemployed and inactive among the out-of-work population (see Figure 3.3).
Moreover, the group of disabled group of disabled has more than doubled, from 13,000 in
2008 to 29,000 in 2011(Table 3.1).

14Individuals aged 16 to 24 who are out of work and enrolled in education are excluded from the
sample; they are considered to be investing in their final stages of human capital formation and
therefore are not a particular target group for activation policies. Individuals enrolled in school
between 25 and 64 are, however, included in the latent class analysis and will be grouped under “other
inactive.” It is important to note that these students (older than 24) account for less than 1 percent of
total working-age population.

Methodology: Latent Class Analysis

In Chapter 1 a general overview of the latent class analysis methodology was presented. This
section explains in detail the variables and covariates used to identify classes or groups of
out-of-work individuals that are as homogeneous as possible within each class according to a
set of observable characteristics, and as distant as possible between classes. The emerging
profiles can then be contrasted with the design and targeting of current activation policies,
in order to identify the potential gaps and to enhance their design features.15

Variable selection: The definition of latent classes relies on a number of indicator variables
to capture different “symptoms” of an overall latent condition (in this case, the typology of
joblessness). The challenge in such models is to identify a discrete number of variables that
can best explain the heterogeneity of individual outcomes. In this case, two sets of
categorical variables were selected: the first set to show the extent of labor market distance
and the other to capture some of the main factors that can affect employment on the supply
side, such as labor supply conditions (household-level incentives to work and physical
ability to work).

         Distance from labor market: short-term unemployment, long-term
          unemployment, (early) retirement, disability, and other inactivity (largely unpaid
          domestic work).16
         Labor supply conditions: whether the individual’s household has at least one
          working adult,17 and perceived limitations on activities due to health problems.18

In addition to indicators, the model includes active covariates, which are used to improve the
classification of individuals in each class. In this case the active covariates are the
demographic variables that are normally used to disaggregate labor market outcomes:

         Age-group category (four groups)
         Gender
         Human capital: the highest educational level achieved (three groups)
         Urban/rural location

Once the latent classes have been defined, inactive covariates that were not included in the
model can be used to characterize the individuals in each class and the households in which
they live. The inactive covariates chosen describe those characteristics that may provide
valuable information for the design of tailored policies that address barriers to employment,
including income level. They include:


15 For the latest developments on active inclusion in Bulgaria, see EC (2013b).
16 This  variable is constructed using the self-reported current work status in the EU-SILC survey that
has four categories: at work, unemployed, retired and inactive. The unemployed are further classified
into short- and long-term based on how long they have been actively looking for a job. The inactive is
combined with another question to separate this group into students, disabled, military and other
inactive.
17 In order to construct this variable, individuals aged 25 or older are considered adults.
18 This is a binary variable that takes the value one if an individual answered “yes, strong limitations” to

whether they had been hampered in their usual activities because of health problems for at least the
last six months. The value is zero if the answer is “yes, limited” or “no, not limited.”

        Household welfare conditions:
             • Income quintile (defined by equivalized disposable household income19, 20)
             • Labor, benefit, and other income as share of total gross household income21
             • Binary variable denoting whether at least one working adult (aged 25 and
                 over) is present in the household
             • Household ownership
             • Household able to keep dwelling warm
             • Partner’s labor income
             • Quintile of partner’s labor income
             • Binary variables denoting whether individuals or their households are
                 beneficiaries of any of eight social protection benefits22
        Household demographics:
             • Household size
             • Household composition
             • Binary variable showing whether there are children under 6 in the
                 household
             • Binary variable denoting whether there are three or more under-16
                 children in the household
             • Children under 13 receiving child care in the household: all, some or no
                 children under 13 present
             • Older person (65 and over) in the household
        Other individual-level demographics:
             • More refined age groups (seven groups)
             • Marital status
        Individual human capital:
             • More refined highest educational level achieved (six groups)
             • Work experience in years
             • Binary variable for previous work experience
        Household location:
             • Degree of urbanization:23 densely populated, intermediate area, sparsely
                 populated

19 The equivalized household income takes into account an equivalence factor to weight the number of
household members used in the denominator when calculating household income per capita. The first
adult aged 18 or over has a weight of 1.0, children under 14 have a weight of 0.3, and other individuals
14 and older have a weight of 0.5. The sum of the weights of all household members is equal to the
equivalent household size.
20 Note that income reported in EU-SILC surveys is for the year preceding the survey year.
21 Total household gross income is defined as the sum of: (at the individual level) gross employee cash

or near-cash income; company car, gross cash benefits or losses from self-employment (including
royalties); unemployment benefits; old-age benefits; survivor benefits; sickness benefits; disability
benefits; education allowances; and (at the household level) income from rental of property or land;
family/children related allowances; social exclusion not elsewhere classified; housing allowances;
regular inter-household cash transfers received; interests, dividends, profit from capital investments in
unincorporated business; pensions from individual private plans; and income received by people
under 16. Total household net income, in turn, was calculated by subtracting from total household
gross income regular taxes on wealth, taxes on income and social insurance contributions, and regular
inter-household case transfers paid.
22 Social benefits are aggregated in eight branches using the European System of integrated Social

PROtection Statistics (ESSPROS) definitions. For more information, see Eurostat (2011).
23 According to EU-SILC guidelines, dense areas have more than 500 inhabitants per square kilometer,

where the total population for the set is at least 50,000 inhabitants. Intermediate areas have more than

Group labeling. The resulting groups are then labeled according to the greatest
proportional characteristics within groups that also aid in distinguishing among groups.
Granted, a large number of characteristics describe these groups, and only a few are taken
into account for the purpose of labeling. In part, some of these characteristics may exhibit a
large degree of heterogeneity and may thus not be relevant for defining a group.
Additionally, some characteristics may be more relevant for the purposes of policy design
than others. In short, though the labeling of groups can be considered more an art than a
science, when taken together with detailed descriptions of a group’s most prominent
characteristics, labeling can serve as an important starting point in the design and
prioritization of activation policies.

The analysis relies on cross-sectional as well as panel data from the European Union
Statistics of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) surveys for 2008–2011, which combine
individual-level information with household characteristics. The first part of the note
presents a cross-sectional analysis for the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. In particular,
the latent class analysis on 2008 data shows the main characteristics of the out-of-work
before the global economic crisis hit the Bulgarian economy, and thus highlight what could
be considered more structural issues of the country’s labor market. The 2011 latent class
analysis will contrast this initial assessment with more recent developments. The second
part of the note exploits longitudinal data between 2008 and 201024 to trace the prior labor
market status of individuals observed last in 2010 in various classes, and will shed light on
the relative persistence in the out-of-work status among different classes of individuals. The
set of variables chosen for the cross-section and the longitudinal analysis are slightly
different, due to minor differences in the set of variables recorded in each of the two types of
datasets.




100 inhabitants per square kilometer, and either a total population for the set of at least 50,000
inhabitants or a location adjacent to a dense area. The remaining areas are categorized as sparsely
populated.
24 The EU-SILC longitudinal survey consists of a four-year rotating panel. In each year, approximately

three-quarters of individuals present in the previous year are retained. The samples used in the latent
class analysis include about 3,000 observations for each year in the cross-sectional analysis and 500
observations in the longitudinal analysis. The population is weighted with individual weights.

Out-of-Work Population: Group Profiles from Cross-Section Analysis
The latent class analysis categorizes the out-of-work population into six major groups prior
to the crisis and into seven groups in 2010 and 2011. The groups are named according to
their most salient characteristics. Figure 3.4 shows the share of each of the seven classes
identified in 2011, while Table 3.2 presents their summary characteristics.

Note: Percentages in parentheses following the group names refer to the share of the total out-of-work
population. Years of work experience refer only to those individuals who have worked before. Dependent
children include children under 18 and household members aged 18 to 24 who are economically inactive
and living with at least one parent. Working adult refers to adults aged 25 and over. For this report’s
purposes, we define the at-risk-of-poverty rate as the relative risk of being in the first quintile of the
income distribution. The reference period for income reported in EU-SILC surveys is the year preceding the
survey year.


The seven major clusters emerging from the LCA can be characterized as follows for the year
2011 (see Annex 2: Latent class analysis profiles–Cross-sectional model for more detail):

           Cluster 1: Middle-aged unemployed. This group represents 23 percent of the out-
            of-work sample of 2011. They are mostly of prime age—35 to 59 years old. A total of
            33 percent of males in this age bracket were unemployed; more worrisome, an
            additional 50 percent were long-term unemployed. This group is relatively
            educated: although only 7 percent have a tertiary degree, a significant majority (67
            percent) have completed upper secondary school. In terms of the economic status of
            their partners, this group is fairly mixed: 52 percent have a working partner earning
            a relatively high income, whereas 48 percent either have an inactive partner or are
            without a partner altogether. In part, this explains why 37 percent of this class is in
            the poorest 20 percent of the income distribution. A little more than 50 percent live
            in households with at least one child, and 65 percent are receiving at least one type
            of social protection benefit.
           Cluster 2: Retired women. This group made up 19 percent of the out-of-work
            population in 2011. It is composed of retired women aged 60 to 64, 53 percent of
            whom have no more than an upper secondary education, and 12 percent of whom
            have a tertiary education degree. They report an average of 33 years of work
            experience, are likely to live in relatively small households, and do not have a
            working partner: they are for the most part widowed (23 percent) or have a retired
            partner (about 50 percent). Additionally, 82 percent receive old-age benefits and 17
            percent receive disability benefits. In part, the old-age benefit receipt, along with the
            fact that their households are relatively small (three members), may explain their
            relatively low risk of poverty; 22 percent of this class is in the bottom-income
            quintile.
           Cluster 3: Stay-at-home young mothers. This group, whose share of the out-of-
            work population for 2011 was 15 percent, comprises young women aged 16 to 34. A
            slight majority of them report having children under 6 years of age, and about 70
            percent live in households with two or more children. This group consists of mostly
            inactive women (67 percent), although it is noteworthy that one-third are also
            unemployed. They are low-skilled: 47 percent have not completed upper-secondary
            education. Another characteristic is that 58 percent report a working partner whose
            average income is the highest among all the clusters in this analysis, while 79
            percent report at least one working adult within the household. However, as this
            group’s households are relatively large (5.1 members, on average) it is not
            surprising that despite available labor income, more than 36 percent are in the
            bottom 20 percent of the income distribution. A little more than 50 percent of the
            women in this group have no work experience and a majority (61 percent) receive
            family benefits at the household level (10 percent also report receiving social
            exclusion benefits).
           Cluster 4: Single male NEETs. Members of this class are predominantly male (73
            percent), largely under age 35, and concentrated among those aged 16 to 24.25 They
            resemble the unemployed youth who have been particularly hit by the economic
            crisis across Europe, as 43 percent are long-term unemployed and 25 percent are
            short-term unemployed, although almost one-third are also inactive. They have
            never been married and most (61 percent) report having never worked before.
            Around 17 percent have a tertiary education while another 48 percent have


25   Sixty-one percent are 16 to 24 years old, and another 35 percent are 25 to 34 years old.



62 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
    completed upper secondary school, making them relatively educated among the
    out-of-work population. Most may live at home with their parents, since despite
    being single, 69 percent report living with at least one working adult and in
    households with an average size of more than four members. Their income situation
    is nonetheless precarious, as 38 percent live in the bottom-income quintile. Like the
    stay-at-home young mothers, this group represented 15 percent of the out-of-work
    population in 2011.
   Cluster 5: Retired and early-retired men. This group represented 13 percent of
    the out-of-work population in 2011. The group is composed of early-retired men
    aged 45 to 59 (about 47 percent) and retired men aged 60 to 64 (about 47 percent).
    Although 87 percent have a partner who is not working, 65 percent do live in
    households where at least one adult works. They belong to households with
    relatively high incomes in comparison to the rest of the out-of-work groups
    identified, with only 20 percent living in the bottom-income quintile. Their relatively
    favorable economic situation is partially explained by the fact that they live in
    relatively small households without children (65 percent report no children in the
    household, the highest percentage among the groups identified). They have on
    average 30 years of work experience. Some 63 percent receive old-age benefits and
    31 percent receive disability benefits (14 percent report being strongly limited in
    their activities because of health conditions).
   Cluster 6: Low-educated, rural, long-term unemployed. This group, representing
    12 percent of the population out of work in 2011, consists of individuals of prime
    age (25 to 54) who are largely long-term unemployed (61 percent), although a
    minority are short-term unemployed (31 percent). They have very low levels of
    education (82 percent have at most completed lower secondary school) and
    predominantly live in rural areas (70 percent). The majority of this group (68
    percent) has previous work experience, an average of 15 years. They live in
    households with high dependency rates, as their partners tend to also be
    unemployed. Only one-third report living with at least one adult who is working,
    and 65 percent live in households with two or more children. The majority (71
    percent) receive at least one social benefit; just over half have access to family
    benefits and 23 percent to social exclusion benefits at the household level, but only
    13 percent receive unemployment benefits. Nonetheless, the benefits received are
    not sufficient to take them out of poverty, as a startling 69 percent are in the poorest
    quintile of the income distribution.
   Cluster 7: Low-educated, early-retired and disabled. This group represented 3
    percent of the out-of-work population in 2011, with 80 percent receiving disability
    benefits and 77 percent reporting a strong limitation in their daily activities due to a
    health condition. They are mostly of prime age (25 to 59 years old), mostly male (60
    percent) and without a partner. Fifty percent report their labor market status as
    retired and another 40 percent as disabled. They are relatively low-educated: 40
    percent received at most a lower-secondary education, while 37 percent completed
    upper secondary school. A third of this group is in the bottom quintile of the income
    distribution, putting them at a moderate risk for poverty.

Although most of the identified out-of-work population classes have been quite stable
over the last few years, they have experienced some changes in composition and in
their share of the total out of work. Table 3.5 shows the evolution of the classes identified
from 2008 to 2011 as a share of the total out-of-work population, while Figure 3.5 graphs the
absolute numbers. From the graph, the first important observation is that the size of the out-
of-work population has increased only slightly, by 5 percent, between 2008 and 2011.
However, some classes have changed across time; for example, classes identified in 2011 that
were present in previous years changed in relative size and also in composition. The fact that
the composition of the classes changes over time is particularly important to keep in mind
when interpreting changes in class size. For instance, significant increases (or decreases) in
class size are sometimes due to reassignments of individuals across classes, resulting in
changes in class composition. Thus, although some classes may retain similar names across
years due to their most salient characteristics, their composition may nonetheless vary. The
evolution of particular classes’ size and composition over 2008–2011 can be summarized as
follows:

        Across time, one of the most significant changes is the increase in size of the
         group of single male NEETs, which grew by 18 percent from 197,000 to 233,000.
         The composition of this group also changed. While 76 percent of this cluster was
         between 16 and 24 years old in 2007, by 2011 this share had fallen to 60 percent of
         the group. The proportion of males also increased, from 61 to 73 percent. Moreover,
         the group became more skilled as the share of individuals who had tertiary education
         increased from 7 to 18 percent. Although the share of this group that belonged to the
         lowest 20 percent of the income distribution decreased, it is worrisome that the
         number of long-term unemployed increased in this group, from 38 to 43 percent.
        Most importantly, the previous class labeled as unemployed and early-retirees
         split into two groups starting in 2010: a smaller group of retired and early-retired
         men and a relatively large group of middle-aged unemployed, which now accounts for
         23 percent of the out-of-work. The emergence of this new group of unemployed
         results from the increase in joblessness following the crisis.
        On the other hand, although the total number of retirees also grew during the
         period,26 many of the individuals in the newly emerged group of retired and
         early-retired men may have in earlier years been grouped in the retirees
         cluster. Starting in 2010, these individuals are now grouped together with early
         retired men in the newly emerged “retired and early-retired men” cluster. The retirees
         group identified in 2008 and 2009 was only 65 percent female; by 2011, it had
         evolved to become 83 percent female and had also diminished in size. Due to its
         changed composition in terms of gender, it is labeled as retired women starting in
         2010.
        The stay-at-home young mothers’ cluster remained fairly stable in terms of its
         share of the out-of-work population during the period, although its composition
         varied slightly. In 2007 this cluster’s population was younger: 40 percent were
         between 16–24 years old, compared to 25 percent in 2011. Another important
         difference is in the young mothers’ partners. Although in 2009 the percentage of this
         group that had a working partner increased to 82 percent (from 77 the previous

26From 2008 to 2011, the number of (early) retired men and women in our sample rose by 2 percent; in
contrast, the number of short-term and long-term unemployed increased by 6 percent.

         year), the figure decreased rapidly following the crisis to 58 percent in 2011. This
         loss of income in the household meant an increased risk of poverty in this cluster; the
         share of those in the poorest-income quintile increased 9 points from 2007 to 2011.
        The low-educated, early-retired, disabled group maintained the same relative
         share of the out-of-work population, between 3 and 5 percent, during the
         period. In terms of composition, a larger share of the individuals in this group
         became disabled—from 15 to 40 percent—and a larger share also became long-term
         unemployed, up to 8 percent in 2011 compared to 0.1 percent in 2007.
        Finally, the cluster of low-educated, rural, long-term unemployed was a
         decreasing share of the out-of-work population, falling from 15 to 12 percent from
         2007 to 2011. (Note, however, that in 2009 this share went up to 17 percent before
         falling sharply.)

Structural Aspects and Emerging Trends in the Profiles of the Out-of-Work

The clusters identified in the out-of-work population for the 2008 -2011 period reflect both
structural aspects of the Bulgarian labor market and uses cross-sectional and longitudinal
analysis of clusters of the out-of-work population to further examine the effects of the crisis
on the Bulgarian labor market.

Not only is unemployment high among youth and employment low, but youth labor force
participation rates in Bulgaria are among the lowest in the EU. In recent years, Bulgaria’s
NEET rate has consistently been among the highest among the EU, while youth labor force
participation rates, at only 29.6 percent in 2013, are well below the EU average of 42.2
percent (Figure 3.6). In part, low labor force participation and employment rates among
youth reflect a full-time work tradition in Bulgaria. In many EU countries, youth have higher
labor force participation rates because they are able combine their studies with part-time
work. For example, as many as 75 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of youth in the
Netherlands and Slovenia report working part time (Dimitrov and Duell, 2013). In contrast,
only about 4 percent of youth in Bulgaria work part time, and this figure has remained steady
in recent years (ibid).

Disabled individuals face significant barriers to employment, with important consequences
for spending on disability benefits. In 2011, 53 percent of individuals of working age with at
least one permanent difficulty in their daily activities were inactive, and only 31 percent were
employed (Dimitrov and Duell, 2013). In this analysis, the low-educated, early-retired, disabled
cluster represented, on average, 4 percent of the out-of-work population (around 50,000

individuals), and 80 percent of this group received disability benefits. Although the
percentage of expenditures on disability benefits as a share of GDP in Bulgaria is among the
lowest in the European Union, this proportion has been increasing and will likely continue to
rise significantly in coming years, as the Bulgarian population continues to age at rapid rates.
Moreover, the identified cluster is not only heavily reliant on benefits but is also relatively
young,27 implying that benefit payments are likely to continue for decades to come. Low levels
of education and lack of work experience, as well as an inaccessible physical environment and
employer reluctance to hire individuals with disabilities, represent some of the structural
barriers faced by this population.

A relatively large percentage of the working-age population is already retired. In the
working-age sample used in this analysis, two main clusters of retirees emerge, representing
around a third of the out-of-work population. This may partly reflect the fact that a relatively
high percentage of the population aged 15 to 64 has reached retirement age.28 As shown in
Figure 3.8, Bulgaria’s population is expected to age dramatically in the coming years. The
median age has already increased from 30.3 in 1960 to 42.7 in 2012. This presently
represents the third highest median age in the EU, surpassed only by Germany and Italy. In

27 In 2011, 42 percent of this group was younger than 35, and 36 percent was between the ages of 35

and 54.
28 The current retirement age in Bulgaria is 60 for women and 63 for men.

addition, labor force participation rates for both men and women close to retirement are
lower than the EU-27 average.29 Delaying retirement and increasing labor force participation
among older individuals and the general working-age population thus emerge as important
policy priorities.

Not only has the number of unemployed grown with the crisis, unemployment has also
changed in nature. A new distinct class of unemployed (the middle-aged unemployed) has
emerged, representing 354,000 mostly-unemployed individuals, many of whom were affected
by the financial crisis. The length of unemployment spells also increased following the crisis,
with a resulting rise in the number of long-term unemployed individuals. It is also evident
that youth—who as a group are already at a disadvantage in the labor market for structural
reasons—were also affected by the crisis, as can be seen by the increasing number of single
male NEETs.

Despite their high reliance on benefits, many of the unemployed and stay-at-home mothers
identified in this study remain at risk for poverty. The key transmission channel of income
shocks during the crisis was the labor market, with less-educated individuals, including most
Roma, being the most likely to have been affected by labor market shocks. The public
response, which included an increase in pensions and other social protection spending,
prevented a sharp increase in poverty (World Bank, 2012). However, the stimulus under-
utilized Bulgaria’s battery of well-targeted programs including child allowances and
especially the guaranteed minimum income program, which covers a very small part of the

EU27 average; for women aged 60 to 64, labor force participation is about 5 percentage points below

population and of the poor. As such, inefficient targeting and low generosity have thwarted
poverty reduction, even though on average more than 60 percent of the middle-aged
unemployed, stay-at-home young mothers, and low-educated, rural, long-term unemployed
identified in this study receive at least one form of social benefit. This is especially the case for
the low-educated rural long-term unemployed, 69 percent of whom are in the poorest income
quintile. The groups of retired individuals, on the other hand, are well-protected from
poverty, in part due to a generous old-age benefit.

Out-of-Work Population: Group Profiles from Longitudinal Analysis

Finally, by looking at longitudinal EU-SILC data for the 2008–2010 period, one can
better understand the dynamics within clusters and notice other movements in the
labor market. The latent class analysis of the out-of-work in the 2010 longitudinal dataset
(which comprises a subsample of around 500 observations), yielded similar results in terms
of latent classes, though in light of the reduced sample size it became necessary to combine
some categories of out-of-work individuals, producing only four distinct clusters. Since there
are some similarities in the size and characteristics of these four clusters compared to the
cross-section analysis, the findings from the panel data can be used to understand further the
dynamics of the previously described sample. The four identified classes, in order of
magnitude, are:

        Married or widowed retirees (30 percent)
        Low-educated rural unemployed (30 percent)
        Single NEETs (26 percent)
        Stay-at-home mothers (14 percent).

Annex 3 shows the statistical description of the latent classes in full, while Table 3.6
summarizes the most salient characteristics of the four classes.

Note: “Years of work experience” refer only to those individuals who have worked before. “Dependent
children” include children under 18 and household members aged 18 to 24 who are economically inactive

An advantage of the dynamic panel analysis is that the labor market status of individuals in
these four classes can be observed across time, providing information on the flows in and out
of jobs two years later (Table 3.7 and Table 3.8).

The longitudinal analysis indicates that the reduction in employment between 2008 and 2010
is predominantly explained by job losses and movement into unemployment. Table 3.7 shows
the flows of the 2008 working-age population,30 according to their labor market status in
2008 into any of the four latent out-of-work classes or into employment. The table shows that
11 percent of the individuals who were employed in 2008 moved into one of the four out-of-
work classes in 2010, whereas the remaining 89 percent continued in employment. The group

sample in 2010 because they are above 64. Also, students under 25 years old in 2010 are excluded from
this analysis as they are not considered a target group for activation policies.

of low-educated rural unemployed absorbed almost half of the job losses—around 5 percent
of the previously employed, versus only 2 percent in the case of married or widowed retirees,
single NEETs and stay-at-home mothers, respectively. Given that single NEETs are
predominantly unemployed (68 percent), it can also be inferred that roughly 7 percent of
those who were employed in 2008 moved into a largely unemployed cluster in 2010, while
the remaining 4 percent predominantly moved into an inactive class.

A significant proportion of all of the out-of work groups identified in 2010 were hit by job
losses, meaning that they were employed in 2008; this is especially so among low-educated
rural unemployed and stay-at-home mothers. Table 3.8 allows for the identification of the
groups in the 2010 population that were most affected by job losses. The group of low-
educated rural unemployed is the hardest hit, with 34 percent of its members formerly
employed in 2008. The second group to be affected by job losses is the class of stay-at-home
mothers, 27 percent of whom lost their jobs. Comparatively, only 13 percent of single NEETs
lost their jobs. However, this may explain the fact that many single NEETs who are
unemployed are first-time job seekers, so few were likely to have been employed in 2008 in
the first place. During economic downturns, youth are generally more likely to lose their jobs,
since they tend to work in cyclically sensitive industries such as construction or hold
temporary contracts (Eurofound, 2012).

Longitudinal analysis suggests a lack of flow into employment. Table 3.8 also shows that
90 percent of those employed in 2010 were already employed in 2008. In addition, from the
previous table, it is clear that only 25 percent of the unemployed and 28 percent of the “other
inactive” (that is, not retired or disabled) in 2008 moved into employment in 2010. This
pattern might then reinforce the divide between the employed and the unemployed.

Box 3.1 Roma Population and Labor Market Exclusion

Labor market exclusion in Bulgaria cannot be discussed without giving special consideration
to the situation of the country’s Roma population, a population that faces significant
structural barriers. Because EU-SILC data does not include a differentiating indicator for
Roma and non-Roma, the out-of-work population classes identified in this exercise cannot
directly be linked to a Roma/non-Roma pattern.

According to national census information, there are about 370,000 citizens of Roma origin
living in Bulgaria (approximately 5 percent of the total population). This number reflects the
lower bound of estimates, in part because many Roma in Bulgaria also identify with the
Turkish ethnicity. Members of the Roma minority achieve lower human development
outcomes and are not fully integrated into economic activity. In 2011, the poverty headcount
rate among Roma was 68 percent, in contrast to a poverty rate of 23 percent at the national
level (see table below). In the same year the employment rate stood at 57 and 52 percent,
respectively, for non-Roma men and women, while for Roma the corresponding figures were
only 42 and 26 percent (World Bank (2013)). Willingness to work, as measured in the labor
force participation rate (LFPR), has been shown to be relatively high among Roma, exceeding
the LFPR in the majority population in the case of men: According to data from the 2007
World Bank Bulgaria Multi-Topic Survey, LFPR among non-Roma stood at 79 percent and 68
percent for men and women respectively; in contrast, among Roma, the corresponding results
were 85 and 59 percent. Unemployment rates are also disproportionately high among Roma,
having reached as high as 53 percent among Roma women before the crisis (data are for
2007). Unfavorable labor market outcomes among Roma population can be in part explained
by a significant education gap between Roma and non-Roma population that is even higher
among women. A World Bank study (2010) finds large gaps in the share of Roma and non-
Roma population with a secondary education: Among Roma, only 16 and 10 percent of men
and women, respectively, had completed secondary education; the corresponding figures for
non-Roma men and women stood at around 87 percent. Only in recent years have educational
outcomes for Roma children started to improve. Lastly, discrimination appears to be the
cause of about a third of the Roma/non-Roma wage gap (World Bank 2010), and may be a
further contributor to low employment rates.




76 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
As World Bank (2010) outlined, the underperformance and exclusion of Roma carries a
significant economic and fiscal cost for countries in the region. For Bulgaria, the economic and
fiscal costs of Roma exclusion were estimated at EUR 0.56 billion and 0.37 billion in 2010,
respectively. In light of the projected decline of the working-age population in Bulgaria, active
inclusion of minority populations in education, labor markets and other areas of society is a

From Profiling to Activation

The current general labor market situation, along with institutional and resource deficiencies,
make the activation and integration of many of the identified out-of-work groups a
demanding challenge. Low labor demand and sluggish growth are exacerbated by deficiencies
in the institutional setup and resources of the public employment service, active labor market
policies and related social services in Bulgaria. Spending on active labor market policies
(ALMPs) has been drastically reduced in recent years, while the guaranteed minimum income
scheme provides low coverage and is generally not associated with activation measures.
Prioritizing interventions is therefore of great importance. This section will (a) give an
overview of activation and inclusion policies in Bulgaria; (b) gauge the activation need and
activation potential of each group of out-of-work persons; and (c) propose a focused set of
interventions for the prioritized groups. It is important to keep in mind that the proposed
interventions are meant only as a starting point in a discussion with country authorities on
general activation policies and their respective priorities. While the latent classes identified in
this exercise points generally toward certain effectively tailored policies, it would be
beneficial to conduct a more detailed profiling exercise at the individual level. Latent class
analysis allows for the classification of a vast population into broad meaningful categories,
but variation within groups still has implications for the level of appropriate support for the
purposes of activation.

Activation and Inclusion Policies in Bulgaria

After the financial crisis started to have economic and employment effects in 2009, Bulgaria
responded with a further cutback of ALMP spending from 2009 onwards. In contrast to the
average OECD spending on labor market policies of 1.44 percent of GDP in 2011, Bulgaria
spent only 0.59 percent of GDP on Public employment service administration, active labor
market policies, unemployment and early retirement benefits combined. Some of the
spending from the national budget on active labor market policies has since been replaced
with funding from the European Social Fund (ESF), allowing for more program flexibility, but
also incurring additional administrative burdens on public employment services.

Figure 3.9 Labor Market Policy (LMP) Spending in Bulgaria as a Share of GDP




The great majority (71 percent) of labor market policy spending in Bulgaria goes to “passive”
benefits, namely unemployment benefits and early retirement. Though, on average, OECD
countries also allocate most labor market policy spending to these types of benefits, the
proportion is considerably lower, at 60 percent.


Figure 3.10 Composition of Spending on Labor Market Policies in Bulgaria (2011)




Even though a large proportion of labor market policy spending goes to passive policies,
coverage of the unemployed by unemployment benefits or the guaranteed minimum income
program is low. Of the registered unemployed (comprising short and long-term unemployed
workers), only 14 percent received unemployment benefits and only 6 percent received
guaranteed minimum income. Activity in the informal economy is high, estimated at 19.5
percent for men and 12.9 percent for women in 2008, which exacerbates the lack of access to
unemployment insurance (Packard, Koettl, Montenegro, 2012: 31).

Participation in the guaranteed minimum income program is not well linked to
activation or work incentives. Recent findings from a World Bank study on the activation of
vulnerable groups in Bulgaria (Dimitrov and Duell, 2013) confirmed that the participation in
the guaranteed minimum income (GMI) program is generally handled in a traditional “social
assistance” type way, with social workers more concerned about enforcing asset and income
tests than providing activation and linkage to social services. The attractiveness of the GMI
and any work incentives are further reduced by a six-month waiting period, mandatory
community work (without activation, employment linkage or skill development) and the
absence of earnings disregards for benefit recipients. Absence of part-time employment
legislation further increases the barriers to entry-level employment for young people, parents
and labor market outsiders (EC, 2013b: 24).

The institutional setup of active labor markets and services is highly fragmented. The
institutional delivery structure for activating policies and services is divided between the
Public Employment Service, the Social Assistance Agency, the National Security Institute and
other agencies, including the Ministry of Education (1iteracy) and Medical Commissions
(disability). Current collaboration between these agencies is limited, focused on rule
enforcement and program crosschecks rather than on activation and job linkage. Strict,
regular enforcement of asset and income tests among the GMI population further reduces the
incentive for (formal) work.

Labor force participation and maternity leave. Potential concerns for female labor force
participants in many countries are regulations and labor market arrangements for (paid)
maternity leave and extended absences from the workplace. Bulgaria grants an OECD record
of 68 weeks of maternity leave, most of it with paid benefits, for formal non-agricultural
workers. While the intuitive conclusion would be to assume a lower female employment rate,
the opposite is true among the active population. Female unemployment (9.8 percent) for 15–
to 64-year olds is actually lower than the male unemployment rate (12.4 percent in 2011).
LFPR for young women is lower (24.9 percent compared to 33.9 percent for men), but this
could be explained by women’s greater participation in higher education. Once women hit
prime age, their labor force participation is actually quite high in Bulgaria compared to EU-27:
79.3 percent for women vs. 84.5 percent for men. The gender gap in LFPR is thus 5.2 percent
in Bulgaria, compared to a 13 percent gap in the EU-27. Overall, Bulgaria could benefit from a
more employment-friendly and human-capital preserving approach to maternity leave, since
the overall LFPR is quite low. Women’s caregiving responsibilities, combined with a lack of
child care options, play a part in this.

Finally, some programs for the inclusion of inactive and marginalized groups deserve
special mention. These are the program for Roma mediators in employment offices
(“Activating inactive people on the labor market”) and the national literacy program for
adults, which help to overcome severe under-qualification and barriers to entry.

Activation Priority, Activation Type and Benefit Receipt by Group

In further considering the approach toward labor market integration, an assessment of the
priorities and potentials of the identified groups is needed. Given the limited resources for




80 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
programs and the low availability and difficulty coordinating staff in the Bulgarian social
assistance and public employment departments, prioritization of interventions is all the more
important. After the first step (“activation priority”) of prioritizing interventions along
activation need and activation potential, a second step (“activation type”) will classify the
groups according to the kind of activation intervention needed, depending on the social or
labor market barriers to be overcome. Lastly, as a third step, information on household
income composition of the different groups will be used to assess potential cross-
dependencies of the benefit system with the labor market status and activation approaches.

Activation priority. The table below gives an overview of the identified inactive classes, their
respective activation need, and activation potential. The total number of persons estimated in
these clusters is 1.56 million, representing about 21 percent of the total population and 33
percent of the working-age (16–64) population of Bulgaria in 2011.

In the table, “activation need” refers to a group’s level of need for inclusion in the labor
market in order to gain income and reduce or end poverty. “Activation potential” describes
that group’s ability or motivation to be in the labor market. High activation need might be
driven by high poverty risk (as in the case of the low-educated rural long-term unemployed),
whereas high activation potential could be driven by previous work experience or a relatively
good educational base (for example, the middle-aged unemployed).

From this overview, an initial set of priorities arises: the middle-aged unemployed, single male
NEETs and low-educated rural long-term unemployed are the highest priority for activation.
Their high priority stems from their relatively large cohort sizes, high or medium activation
need due to high poverty risks, and activation potential through labor market proximity given
their work histories and education. Stay-at-home young mothers follow closely behind these
classes as a priority, but are classified as slightly lower priority owing to their non-declared
unemployment and to the significant share who have at least one working adult in their
households. Retired women (86 percent of whom are over the current retirement age of 60

years)31, retired and early-retired men (who have comparatively low poverty risk, in part due
to old-age benefit income) and the low-educated early-retired and disabled, are not prioritized
for activation measures or policies due to their lower activation need and potential (almost
80 percent of the low-educated early-retired and disabled report a strongly limited capacity to
work).

In a less constrained environment, with more established activation and labor market
integration policies for younger and middle-aged job seekers, additional consideration could
be given to re-prioritizing the group of retired and early-retired men. Nearly half, 47 percent,
are between ages 45 and 59, and could thus be considered to be in early retirement32 and
potentially amenable to reintegration into the labor market. Given the extreme demographic
pressures in Bulgaria, special attention needs to be paid to limiting inflow into this group of
unemployed and avoiding further increases in the number of early retirees. Given the fact that
52 percent of this group’s total household income still derives from labor and 46 percent from
transfers (specifically, old-age and disability benefits for this class represent 29 percent and
11 percent, respectively, of the total spent on such benefits), all three levers need to be
considered: (1) continuing labor income, (2) reducing retirements and pension payments,
and (3) managing entry into disability benefits.

Activation type. As a second step, the relative severity of labor market or social obstacles to
labor market integration will serve as an orientation for activation approaches.

As a result of mapping the barriers to labor market integration faced by the four prioritized
groups, we can quickly discern the respective types of activation that could be undertaken for
them. Whereas the low-educated rural long-term unemployed will require activation across
the labor market proximity and social inclusion axes, the single male NEETs or the stay-at-
home young mothers will mainly require job-search and professional training assistance on
the labor market dimension. For the stay-at-home young mothers group, local social services
(especially child care) will have the greatest effect on activation. The middle-aged unemployed
will mainly require employability-enhancing measures.

Household income composition. When analyzing the 2011 household income of the groups,
we realize that benefits are the major income source for only two of them (retired women and
low-educated, early-retired, and disabled). For the large prioritized groups, no immediate
benefit- or incentive-trap picture emerges from the overview. Households of middle-aged
unemployed rely on pensions for 14 percent of their income, but in terms of actual numbers,
only 7 percent receive old-age benefits. For retired women, old-age benefits make up 46
percent of household income, consistent with the fact that 97 percent of the group is retired
and 86 percent is 60-plus years old.

Stay-at-home young mothers have the lowest benefit incidence among all groups (23 percent
of household income) while single male NEETs are close behind, with 24 percent of household
income. Old-age benefits make up 8 and 11 percent of the household income in these groups,
an understandable fact since someone older than 64 is present in 19 and 23 percent of these
households, respectively. These are interesting household composition effects, but they
present no immediate labor-market participation disincentives for the young women and
men in the stay-at-home young mothers and single male NEETs groups.

Retired and early-retired men receive 29 percent of old-age benefits, 40 percent if old-age and
disability benefits are combined. The same figure for the low-educated early-retired and
disabled is 44 percent (with disability benefits making up 26 percent of the total). Among the
low-educated rural long-term unemployed, incidence of family-child benefits is rather high (13
percent of household income) and old-age benefit income comparatively low. This could
reconfirm the hypothesis that many Roma and Turkish minority citizens are part of this
group, as their benefit receipt patterns show greater use of family than of old-age benefits.

Given the overall picture of benefit receipt revealed by EU-SILC data, no immediate need for
action emerges when looking just at these groups of inactive and out-of-work residents.

Suggestions for Activation Measures and Further Analysis

This section sets out a set of potential activation measures for each of the priority groups.
Areas for further policy dialogue with respect to improving the implementation of activation
policies are also outlined.

The suggestions below should be considered as a starting point for further policy dialogue
between EC DG EMPL, the World Bank and the Bulgarian authorities, bearing in mind that the
groups identified still have some heterogeneity that may affect the level of support required.
Accordingly, these suggestions are not meant to be an exhaustive set of possible activation
measures.

It should be kept in mind that the class descriptions are derived from 2011 EU-SILC data.
Since then, general economic development, policy actions by the government of Bulgaria and
European Commission country-specific recommendations might already have reflected some
of the policy suggestions or rendered them obsolete.

Middle-aged unemployed (23 percent, Priority: High). This group is characterized by a
middle-aged (66 percent between 35 and 54 years) and mainly rural (64 percent) profile
comprising both men and women who are unemployed (83 percent). Their mid-level skill
profile and average of 18 years of work experience makes them a ready-to-work group. They
have an elevated need for activation, as only a small majority (52 percent) have working
spouses, and with 37 percent in the poorest income quintile, their poverty risk is high.
Potential activation measures for this group include the following:

        Build activation on previous work experience and skills. Owing to the fact that
         labor market integration is as much about hard skills as it is about self-esteem and
         self-motivation, activation measures for the middle-aged unemployed could start by
         reconnecting with the job seekers’ previous industry or skill profile. It will be
         important for employment counselors or training providers to avoid narrowly
         looking at the occupation held, but rather attempt to reconnect, update and extend
         the skills that the worker exercised during the last job. In light of the potential for
         informal economy employment for this group, efforts to formalize employment ought
         to be promoted, for example through the introduction of in-work benefits and greater
         use of part-time employment. Generally, however, formalized employment must be
         supported from a multitude of angles (taxes, labor inspection, benefit systems, and so
         on).
        Facilitate part-time work and temporary placement in companies. In order to
         enable job seekers to reconnect with the labor market and with specific (new)
         industries or employers, part-time work experiences or temporary placements could
         be encouraged. This would require working arrangements through the local regional
         employment commissions or district development councils.
        Mobility and training schemes. For individuals in households with limited family
         commitments (at least 48 percent do not have caregiving responsibility for




84 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
         children33), training combined with (regional) mobility support could enhance the
         labor market prospects of some jobseekers in this class, overcoming the shortage of
         employment in rural areas.

Single male NEETS (15 percent, Priority: High). Two-thirds of this group’s members are
unemployed (68 percent), 43 percent for more than one year; an additional 31 percent are
inactive. The class is 73 percent male, between 16 and 34 years old, and has generally never
married or is without a partner. The majority (61 percent) have no work experience. Their
qualification level is more heterogeneous than that of the middle-aged unemployed, with close
to one-third having no more than a lower secondary education and one-sixth having a tertiary
degree. While the activation need for this group is high (long periods unemployment during
youth can have detrimental effects on lifetime employment and earnings prospects), their
activation potential is lower, owing to their lack of labor market experience and relatively
high (32 percent34) receipt of social assistance benefits, which might not encourage job
seeking. Following are some proposed activation policies for this group.

        Second-chance programs. In light of the recent educational experience of some of
         the group’s members, programs to reconnect with technical schools or professional
         education colleges could be attempted with this target group. For “older” candidates
         and those with low educational attainment, these second-chance programs would
         need to take the form of traditional training and work placement schemes, and be
         strongly complemented by basic life and occupational behavior and motivation
         elements.
        Mobility and young-adult housing in cities. In order to provide an orderly and
         supported channel for rural to urban migration and professional experience, a
         “foyer” model could be introduced which provides low-cost housing, professional
         orientation and general guidance for young people moving from rural areas to live
         and work in major cities. This mobility support would need to be integrated with
         general public employment service programs and “foyers” would need to draw on a
         network of partner employers to place and train young people.
        Language skills and training for (temporary) migration. Given the low level of
         caregiving responsibility for this group, labor market integration could also evolve
         around (temporary) migration to other European Union countries and placement
         into jobs that have the potential to provide mid- to high-level employment in
         Bulgaria. Activation and training measures for jobseekers could focus on language
         skills and job-search skills. The government should seek agreements with receiving
         countries to ensure investment in qualification and adequate treatment of jobseekers
         during the work placement abroad. In 2014, Bulgarian nationals will enjoy freedom
         of movement and occupation within the European Union. Labor market policy could
         complement this opening of opportunities.



33 Almost half of this group has no children, and the proportion without child care responsibilities could

be even higher: only 19 percent live in households with children under six years of age.
34 Twenty-eight percent receive family benefits and 11 percent receive social exclusion benefits;

together, 32 percent receive at least one of these two benefits.




                                                                 Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 85
        Youth volunteer mobilization programs. In light of the high proportion of inactive
         members and the low level of work experience in this group, another axis of
         activation and labor market attachment is volunteering and community organizing
         projects. Such programs, which provide a combination of community work, minimal
         remuneration and elements of training on basic skills, self-esteem and physical
         exercise could be supported by public employment services, municipalities, or
         cultural and educational NGOs.

Low-educated rural long-term unemployed (12 percent, Priority: High). This group has
the highest poverty risk in the sample (69 percent fall in the poorest quintile), a very low
education level, high unemployment and inactivity. The class is more rural (70 percent) and
tends to belong to households with caregiving responsibility for children (70 percent live in
household with at least one child). The high poverty risk coincides with a substantial self-
declared share of social assistance receipts (64 percent35). While no “Roma” indicator is
contained in the EU-SILC data, this profile suggests that Roma might make up a significant
part of this group. Any activation policy targeted toward this group would need to be closely
coordinated with national and international efforts to improve Roma integration and access
to services. Among our proposed policies for this group are:

        Integrate basic education into training and employment programs. Given the
         low level of secondary educational attainment in this group, activation measures
         would need to include adult-learning modules and “second chance” opportunities for
         basic numeracy, literacy and general knowledge. If an important share of ethnic
         minority members (Roma) are to be found in this class, appropriate linkage with
         resident and embedded coordinators inside employment offices or social assistance
         agencies should be ensured.
        Provide local employment and training. Given the high share of family-bound
         members in this group, wider mobility support will likely be ineffective. Instead, local
         employment creation and “enhanced” public works programs (for example,
         combined morning training modules and afternoon work modules) could maintain
         labor market linkage and provide support locally or regionally.
        Build on existing work experience. As prime-aged (25 to 54) unemployed, many in
         this group can count on a relatively long tenure of work experience (15 years on
         average). While some of the skills gained in that work experience might have become
         obsolete or atrophied during extended unemployment, re-connecting with prior
         firms, industries and occupational communities can be an important step for this
         group. Active labor market programs should support this through self-help support
         or direct training/individual coaching.
        Address discrimination. It is possible that some members of this group are subject
         to labor market discrimination because of their regional or ethnic origin.
         Discrimination in the workplace would need to be addressed as part of a wider anti-
         discrimination policy in the country.


35 Fifty-three percent receive a family child benefit and 23 percent receive a social exclusion benefit;

together, 64 percent receive at least one of these two benefits.




86 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
Stay-at-home young mothers (15 percent, Priority: Medium). This group of women is
relatively young, with 75 percent between the ages of 16 and 34. Eighty-three percent are
likely to have caregiving responsibility for children (54 percent live in households with
children below six years of age). Their activation potential is gauged as slightly lower, owing
to such family commitments. Although their risk of poverty is similar to that of the middle-
aged unemployed or single male NEETs, a great majority (79 percent) of the members of this
group have at least one working adult in the household. Some possible activation policies for
this group include:

           Linkage of child care offerings with (re)-qualifications for mothers. Given the
            fact that the majority of women in this group may remain inactive due to caregiving
            responsibilities and the fact that at least one adult in the household is already
            working, one of the key steps to enable activation and labor market participation is to
            make available sufficient good-quality child-care offerings. Provision of child care
            could be coupled with training and refresher education classes for women.
           Volunteering, self-organization and training in social services or
            entrepreneurship. In light of the very high level of inactive (67 percent) women in
            this group, novel forms of “activity” attachment could be supported through local
            public employment services or municipalities. Given available free time (that is, if
            child care is provided), women could be encouraged to volunteer in community
            causes or be supported in self-organization of cooperatives or small businesses. This
            volunteering could be combined with on-the-job training units in the respective
            services (for example child care, elderly care, community work, and so on)
           (Temporary) part-time employment as a first step into the labor market. Taking
            a part-time contract (and expanding it to full time after some years) can be an
            appropriate means to maintain labor market engagement for mothers. As a subject of
            labor law policy, this flexibility should be explored, while at the same time creating
            incentives for employers and employees to switch to full-time employment as soon
            as possible36 (given the upcoming labor shortage in the overall economy and
            expected shortfall in retirement income for women with a part-time work history).
           General work placement and training courses. When courses are available,
            women from this group should be given the opportunity to receive training and
            qualification courses by the PES.

The latent classes of retired women (19 percent), retired and early-retired men (13 percent)
and low-educated early-retired and disabled (3 percent) are not further considered for
activation policies in this study. Together, these classes represent 36 percent of the out-of-
work working-age population in Bulgaria. Given the extreme demographic challenges in the
country, the recently-approved increase in the retirement age to around 65 for men by 2018
and 63 for women by 2021 is a necessary step. This increase will need to be matched by
policies to maintain the skills and employment of workers aged 54 and over, along with better
integration of people with disabilities into the workforce, in order to counter the projected
decline in the overall working-age population.


36   That is, as care-giving responsibilities start to diminish.



                                                                   Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 87
In general, further policy dialogue with the Bulgarian authorities ought to focus on areas that
enable the Government and its agencies, municipalities and other labor market actors to
better deploy their resources, increase coordination and improve the staffing and resource
situation of services. Some of the areas for future dialogue include:

        Ensuring the basis for activation policies. When delivering activation policies,
         local and regional actors (Public Employment Service, social assistance offices,
         municipalities, and so on) need to be equipped and organized in a way that
         jobseekers and inactive citizens find the right support networks and are not facing
         “silos” of different public administration. Potential areas of improvement include but
         are not limited to (1) focusing social workers in the GMI program more on activation
         than on rule enforcement, (2) enhancing collaboration with non-profits and social
         economy organizations for delivery of community and training programs and the
         development of an ALMP provider ecosystem, (3) reviewing the staffing level in the
         public employment service.
        Changing the balance between passive and active spending. Even within its
         current budget, Bulgaria could strengthen spending on active labor market measures
         and reduce spending on passive measures (benefits), setting a path for further
         (potential) overall increases in resources for activation policies. Given the extremely
         low level of benefits, there are natural limits to this strategy.
        Maintaining and extending institutional anchors for disadvantaged groups.
         Building on the experience with Roma mediators in public employment offices,
         Bulgaria ought to explore other ways to improve outreach to inactive and hard-to-
         place groups in the labor market, either through facilitators or through collaboration
         with specific community organizations or social economy providers.

In summary, Bulgaria could benefit from improving the activation approach toward its out-of-
work population, especially in light of the projected demographic shift. To maintain its
growth potential and ensure adequate development for all its citizens, Bulgaria must muster
“all hands on deck” to increase the number and qualifications of workers. Allowing high
numbers of citizens to remain inactive or unemployed and not included in the labor market
will exacerbate the grave development challenges ahead.

                           of-Work Population in Estonia
                                                                    2007−2011
Background

Estonia entered the global financial crisis following a long period of high growth.
According to the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, between 2000 and 2007, the
country was one of the fastest growing economies in the world, growing at an average rate of
about 8 percent per year, with a peak of over 10 percent in 2006. These figures are all the
more impressive if compared to the growth rates observed by the EU-28 as a whole, or the
euro area (which expanded 0–3 percent per year over the same period).

Estonia saw a significant downturn associated with the global economic crisis, but it
rebounded quite quickly, at least in terms of GDP growth. The cyclical downturn of the
economy started earlier in Estonia than in neighboring countries. By 2008, the country had
already felt the effects of the global downturn, with GDP growth for the year settling at
negative 4 percent, in stark contrast to neighboring Lithuania, which displayed 3 percent GDP
growth for the same year. The Estonian economy suffered its worst year in 2009, when
output contracted by a staggering 14.1 percent, only slightly better than Lithuania’s 14.8
percent. As with other countries in the region, this decline was mostly due to Estonia’s strong
dependence on exports, which collapsed in the 2008–2009 period. While neighboring Latvia
fared somewhat worse, the Estonian economy’s dip was much more severe than those
suffered by the average EU-28 country or euro-area member, which witnessed negative
growth rates in the 5 percent region in 2009. However, like nearby countries with similar
income levels (for example, Lithuania and Latvia), Estonia recovered from the shock faster
than its European partners. GDP growth was back into positive territory by mid-2009, settled
at almost 3 percent in 2010, and reached a staggering 9.6 percent by 2011almost twice the
rates of Latvia and Lithuaniamaking the country the fastest growing economy in the EU.
Growth rates returned to more modest levels by 2012 and 2013, at 3.9 and 0.8 respectively.

Unemployment levels, which saw a dramatic increase, are taking much longer to
recover. Paralleling the developments observed in Lithuania and Latvia, unemployment in
Estonia had been decreasing since the early 2000s, settling at little over 4 percent in 2007.
However, as the effects of the global financial crisis unraveled, the country suffered a large
and extremely rapid increase in unemployment; by the end of 2008, joblessness had risen to
about 6 percent, climbing to 14 percent in 2009 and eventually peaking at 17 percent in 2010.
Such increases were considerably larger than those in the EU-28 or the Euro Area as a whole,
but comparable to what other countries in the region of similar income levels witnessed.
However, unemployment started decreasing in late 2010. By 2013, the average rate reached
8.9 percent, which is still above pre-crisis levels, but considerably lower than the joblessness
rate observed in the region.

As in Lithuania and Latvia, young Estonians were particularly affected by the
downturn. Like the overall unemployment rate, joblessness among those between the ages of
15 and 24 declined steadily in the pre-crisis period, reaching 10 percent in 2007. As the
recession hit, youth unemployment skyrocketed to 29 percent in 2009 and 33 percent in
2010. However, by 2013 unemployment in the 15–24 cohort had significantly recovered,
reaching 19 percent or so, still almost 10 percentage points the above the 2007 level but
considerably lower that the rates observed in Lithuania and Latvia (22–24 percent).

Men were generally more affected than women by the crisis, at least in terms of
unemployment. As Figure 4.1 below shows, at all age levels, Estonian men suffered larger
increases than women in their rate of unemployment. Both men and women in the 25–64 age
category entered the crisis with unemployment rates close or slightly below 5 percent;
however, by late 2010, women in this age group displayed unemployment rates hovering
around 13 percent, as opposed to the 18 percent or so registered among men of the same age.
Among young Estonians, men were also affected much more than women, with the rate of
joblessness among 15-to-24 year old men peaking at 35 percent, as opposed to 30 percent
among women of the same cohort. Based on data from Statistics Estonia, the OECD (2012)
also points to labor market discrepancies between Estonians and ethnic non-Estonians.
Whereas about 10 percent of Estonians were unemployed in 2011, ethnic Non-Estonians
were unemployed in about 18 percent of the cases.

One of the most worrying developments of the crisis was the significant increase in the
share of long-term unemployed. In 2013, according to Eurostat and as shown in Figure 4.2,
in the average EU-28 country almost 48 percent of the unemployed had been looking for
work for more than 12 months, up from 35 percent in 2009. In Estonia however, the long-
term unemployment share, which had declined all the way to about 27 percent in 2009,
reached a staggering 57 percent in 2011 and settled at 54 percent in 2012, a development
comparable to those observed in Latvia and Lithuania, before declining to 45 percent in 2013.

Another troubling change in the Estonian labor market since 2007 is the rapid increase
in both the absolute number of out-of work individuals and in the share of out-of-work




                                                                  Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 93
population relative to total population and working age population. EU-SILC data
reveals that the number of the out-of-work population between the age of 16 and 64
(excluding students) increased steadily between 2007 and 2011, going from slightly over
167,000 to just over 224,000.37 This is all the more alarming as it occurred in a period during
which both the total size of the population and the total number of working-age individuals in
Estonia remained essentially unchanged (at about 1.34 million and about 0.8 million,
respectively). This resulted in the share of out-of-work population relative to all working-age
population increasing from 21 percent to 28 percent.

The 2007–2011 period witnessed a sizeable increase in the number and relative
importance of unemployment (particularly long-term unemployment) Figure 4.4 and
Figure 4.5 below show the composition of working-age and of out-of-work Estonians in 2007
and 2011, respectively. Not only, as Figure 4.3 above shows, did the size of the out-of-work
population increase between 2007 and 2011 relative to working age population, but long-
term unemployment represent a greater share of Estonians, with the share of those at-work
losing ground. While the share of long-term unemployed relative to total working-age people
was about 2 percent in 2007, the figure had increased to over 5 percent in 2007; similarly,
long-term unemployed accounted for 9 percent of the out-of-work population in 2007, but for
19 percent in 2011. The share of total unemployment (long-term and otherwise) among
working-age individuals (excluding students between 15 and 2438) also more than doubled
over the period, increasing from 4 percent to 10 percent; jobless individuals accounted for 18
percent of the out-of-work population in 2007, but for 37 percent in 2011.

The developments highlighted above, in particular the increase in the size and relative weight
of the out-of-work population and the unemployed, point to a deterioration in the Estonian
labor market from 2007 to 2011. A deeper analysis of the out-of-work population, and
understanding of its composition, is in fact key to ensuring that the right policy measures are
taken and that priorities are set in an appropriate manner.




37 According to Estonian officials, in 2013 the out-of-work population accounted for less than 200,000

people. The analysis that follows is based on EU-SILC 2011 data, the most recent and the only
harmonized survey across the EU at the time of publication. All the numbers are likely to have changed
since.
38 Individuals aged 16 to 24 who are out of work and enrolled in education are excluded from the

sample; they are considered to be investing in their final stages of human capital formation and
therefore are not a particular target group for activation policies. In 2011, In 2011, there were close to
88,170 youth aged 16 to 24 who were out of work and enrolled in education, representing 53 percent of
the total population in this age category and 28 percent of the total out-of-work population of working
age. Military personnel are included in the sample but considered “at-work,” and therefore do not
feature in the latent class analysis below. Individuals enrolled in school above the age of 24 and under
65 are however included in the latent class analysis and will be grouped under “other inactive.” It is
important to note that the two groups combined (military and students older than 24) account for less
than 1 percent of total population of working age.

Methodology: Latent Class Analysis

In Chapter 1 a general overview of the latent class analysis methodology was presented. This
section explains in detail the variables and covariates used to identify classes or groups of
out-of-work individuals that are as homogeneous as possible within each class according to a
set of observable characteristics, and as distant as possible between classes. The emerging
profiles can then be contrasted with the design and targeting of current activation policies, in
order to identify the potential gaps and to enhance their design features.

Variable selection: The definition of latent classes relies on a number of indicator variables
to capture different “symptoms” of an overall latent condition (in this case, the typology of
joblessness). The challenge in such models is to identify a discrete number of variables that
can best explain the heterogeneity of individual outcomes. In this case, two sets of categorical
variables were selected: the first set to show the extent of labor market distance and the other
to capture some of the main factors that can affect employment on the supply side, such as
labor supply conditions (household-level incentives to work and physical ability to work).

     Distance from labor market: short-term unemployment, long-term unemployment,
      (early) retirement, disability, and other inactivity (largely unpaid domestic work).39
     Labor supply conditions: whether the individual’s household has at least one
      working adult,40 and perceived limitations on activities due to health problems.41
     Work experience: if individual has worked before and, in this case, whether he or
      she worked for two or more months in the last year

In addition to indicators, the model includes active covariates, which are used to improve the
classification of individuals in each class. In this case the active covariates are the
demographic variables that are normally used to disaggregate labor market outcomes:

        Age-group category (four groups)
        Gender
        Human capital: the highest educational level achieved (three groups)
        Degree of urbanization:42 densely populated, intermediate area, sparsely populated

Once the latent classes have been defined, inactive covariates that were not included in the
model can be used to characterize the individuals in each class and the households in which
they live. The inactive covariates chosen describe those characteristics that may provide


39 This variable is constructed using the self-reported current work status in the EU-SILC survey that has

four categories: at work, unemployed, retired and inactive. The unemployed are further classified into
short- and long-term based on how long they have been actively looking for a job. The inactive is
combined with another question to separate this group into students, disabled, military and other
inactive.
40 In order to construct this variable, individuals aged 25 or older are considered adults.
41 This is a binary variable that takes the value one if an individual answered “yes, strong limitations” to

whether they had been hampered in their usual activities because of health problems for at least the last
six months. The value is zero if the answer is “yes, limited” or “no, not limited.”
42 According to EU-SILC guidelines, dense areas have more than 500 inhabitants per square kilometer,

where the total population for the set is at least 50,000 inhabitants. Intermediate areas have more than
100 inhabitants per square kilometer, and either a total population for the set of at least 50,000
inhabitants or a location adjacent to a dense area. The remaining areas are categorized as sparsely
populated.

valuable information for the design of tailored policies that address barriers to employment,
including income level. They include:

        Household welfare conditions:
             • Income quintile (defined by equivalized disposable household income43, 44)
             • Labor, benefit, and other income as share of total gross household income45
             • Labor market status of partner
             • Tenure status
             • Household ability to keep dwelling warm
             • Partner’s labor income
             • Quintile of partner’s labor income
             • Binary variables for beneficiaries of social protection benefits46
             • Share of each benefit over the household’s total gross income
        Household demographics:
             • Household size
             • Household family types
             • Binary variable showing whether there are children under 6 in the
                 household
             • Binary variable denoting whether there are three or more under-16 children
                 in the household
             • Children under 13 receiving child care in the household: all, some or no
                 children under 13 present
             • Older person (65 and over) in the household
        Other individual-level demographics:
             • More refined age groups (eight groups)
             • Marital status
        Individual human capital:
             • More refined highest educational level achieved (six groups)
             • Whether the individual is enrolled in school
             • Dummy for previous work experience
        Household location:
             • Urban/rural status


43 The equivalized household income takes into account an equivalence factor to weight the number of
household members used in the denominator when calculating household income per capita. The first
adult aged 18 or over has a weight of 1.0, children under 14 have a weight of 0.3, and other individuals
14 and older have a weight of 0.5. The sum of the weights of all household members is equal to the
equivalent household size.
44 Note that income reported in EU-SILC surveys is for the year preceding the survey year.
45 Total household gross income is defined as the sum of: (at the individual level) gross employee cash or

near-cash income; company car, gross cash benefits or losses from self-employment (including
royalties); unemployment benefits; old-age benefits; survivor benefits; sickness benefits; disability
benefits; education allowances; and (at the household level) income from rental of property or land;
family/children related allowances; social exclusion not elsewhere classified; housing allowances;
regular inter-household cash transfers received; interests, dividends, profit from capital investments in
unincorporated business; pensions from individual private plans; and income received by people under
16. Total household net income, in turn, was calculated by subtracting from total household gross
income regular taxes on wealth, taxes on income and social insurance contributions, and regular inter-
household case transfers paid.
46 Social benefits are aggregated in eight branches using the European System of integrated Social

PROtection Statistics (ESSPROS) definitions. For more information, see Eurostat (2011).

Group labeling. The resulting groups are then labeled according to the greatest proportional
characteristics within groups that also aid in distinguishing among groups. Granted, a large
number of characteristics describe these groups, and only a few are taken into account for the
purpose of labeling. In part, some of these characteristics may exhibit a large degree of
heterogeneity and may thus not be relevant for defining a group. Additionally, some
characteristics may be more relevant for the purposes of policy design than others. In short,
though the labeling of groups can be considered more an art than a science, when taken
together with detailed descriptions of a group’s most prominent characteristics, labeling can
serve as an important starting point in the design and prioritization of activation policies.

The analysis relies on cross-sectional as well as panel data from the European Union Statistics
of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) surveys for 2008–2011, which combine
individual-level information with household characteristics. The first part of the note
presents a cross-sectional analysis for the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. In particular, the
latent class analysis on 2008 data shows the main characteristics of the out-of-work before
the global economic crisis hit Estonia, and thus highlight what could be considered more
structural issues of the country’s labor market. The 2011 latent class analysis will contrast
this initial assessment with more recent developments. The second part of the note exploits
longitudinal data between 2008 and 201047 to trace the prior labor market status of
individuals observed last in 2010 in various classes, and will shed light on the relative
persistence in the out-of-work status among different classes of individuals. The set of
variables chosen for the cross-section and the longitudinal analysis are slightly different, due
to minor differences in the set of variables recorded in each of the two types of datasets.




47 The EU-SILC longitudinal survey consists of a four-year rotating panel. In each year, approximately

three-quarters of individuals present in the previous year are retained. The samples used in the latent
class analysis include about 3,000 observations for each year in the cross-sectional analysis and 600
observations in the longitudinal analysis. The population is weighted with individual weights.

Main Findings

Out-of-Work Population: Group profiles
The latent class analysis supports the classification of the out of work into seven main groups,
some of which have remained stable over time. The groups were named according to their
most salient characteristics. Figure 4.6 shows the shares of each of the seven classes
identified for the year 2011 and Table 4.1 presents their most salient characteristics.

Note: Percentages in parentheses following the group names refer to the share of the total out-of-work
population, Years of work experience refer only to those individuals who have worked before. Dependent
children include children under 18 and household members aged 18 to 24 who are economically inactive
and living with at least one parent. Working adult refers to adults aged 25 and over. For this report’s
purposes, we define the at-risk-of-poverty rate as the relative risk of being in the first quintile of the income
distribution. The reference period for income reported in EU-SILC surveys is the year preceding the survey
year.


The eight main clusters emerging from the LCA can be characterized as follows for the year
2011 (see Annex 2 for more detail):

         Cluster 1: Middle-aged educated disabled with previous work experience. This
          group represents 21 percent of the out-of-work population in 2011. Most individuals
          in this group report their labor market status as disabled (92 percent) and the
          majority are between 35 and 59 years of age (86 percent). However only 43 percent
          report having strong limitations in their ability to work. As Table 5.3 below shows,
          this cluster is relatively well educated as 64 percent have secondary education and
          another 14 percent tertiary education. About 62 percent of individuals in this group
          live in rural areas, which also appears to quite poor, with 51 percent of the group
          belonging to the first income quintile. The large majority of these individuals (93
          percent) receive disability benefits48, and almost all (98 percent) of them receive at
          least one benefit. Finally, benefits account for a large share of these individuals’
          household incomes: almost 70 percent.
         Cluster 2: Prime-age low-income long-term unemployed. This group, accounting
          for 19 percent of the out-of-work population, is made up overwhelmingly (85
          percent) of long-term unemployed. Two-thirds of the individuals in this cluster are
          men, and about 70 percent live in rural areas. Three out of four are between 35 and
          59 and the remaining 25 percent are between 25 and 34. This cluster also appears to
          be at very high risk of poverty, given that 66 percent of individuals belong to the
          lowest income quintile. Importantly, only 20 percent receive unemployment benefits;
          however, about 60 percent receive some form of benefit, even though benefits make
          up on average less than 50 percent of household income.
         Cluster 3: Educated retirees. This third cluster, which makes up 18 percent of the
          out-of-work population, is composed exclusively of retired individuals, of which

48It should be kept in mind that the EU-SILC activity status is self-reported. Therefore, the disabled
population figure may not be accurate when compared to administrative data. Furthermore, in Estonia
there are different benefits that are probably being captured as disability benefits: the incapacity-for-
work pension and the disability benefit for people who incur additional costs due to their disability.

         almost 65 percent are women. More than 90 percent of those in this group are
         between 60 and 64 years old. Most of them hold relatively high levels of education
         (84 percent of them have completed secondary or tertiary education). They are
         mostly married (59 percent) and another 18 percent are widowed. Ninety-eight
         percent receive old-age benefits, which tend to be particularly generous, as benefits
         make up 74 percent of their total household incomes.
        Cluster 4: Young inactive educated mothers with a working partner. This group
         includes 17 percent of the out-of-work population and is for the large majority made
         up of women (94 percent), in their prime age and young (93 percent are between 25
         and 55, and almost 70 percent are between 25 and 34), and mostly engaged in
         domestic or other activities (92 percent). About 85 percent live in a household with a
         working adult, and are relatively well off, as about one-third belong to the top two
         quintiles. This group is very well educated, as more than 50 percent have tertiary
         education. Almost 80 percent of the individuals in this group have a child below 6 in
         their household and 92 percent receive some benefit, while another 84 percent
         receive family/child benefits.
        Cluster 5: Prime-aged, educated unemployed. This group, of which 90 percent is
         unemployed, makes up 13 percent of the out-of-work population and includes a
         majority of men (63 percent). Almost two-thirds of them are between 35 and 59 and
         another 22 percent are between 25 and 34; like Group 4, they are well educated, as
         56 percent have completed upper or post-secondary education and 27 percent
         tertiary. Also, most of them (85 percent) live in households with one or more
         children. Interestingly, 70 percent receive social benefits, but only one-third receive
         unemployment benefits, and, overall, benefits make up only slightly more than 20
         percent of household income.
        Cluster 6: Single NEETs without work experience. This group accounts for 9 percent
         of out-of-work individuals and is mostly composed of unemployed individuals (60
         percent of the cluster, with 40 percent of the unemployed being long-term
         unemployed). The remaining 40 percent is engaged in domestic and other activities.
         All individuals are between 16 and 35, and 82 percent of them are between 16 and
         24, making this cluster the youngest one by far on average. About 80 percent have
         never worked and almost 90 percent are single, with three out of four living in a
         household with a working adult. This cluster is also quite low-income, with 60
         percent of it falling in the first two income quintiles. This cluster is also not
         particularly well educated, as 51 percent have an upper secondary education, but a
         sizeable portion (36 percent) have only primary education.
        Cluster 7: Young low-educated and rural disabled. Members of this cluster, 76
         percent of which report their labor market status as disabled, account for the last 3
         percent of the Estonian out-of-work population in 2011. Nearly all in this cluster, 96
         percent, have never worked despite the fact that only half report a strong limitation
         on daily activities; 82 percent are single and 70 percent are below 35. The individuals
         in this group, which is for the most part rural (75 percent live in rural areas), tend to
         be both low income (as 75 percent fall in the first two income quintile) and low-
         educated (with 71 percent having completed only primary education). Importantly,
         80 percent of them receive disability benefits, and 95 percent receive at least one
         benefit. These benefits make up almost 70 percent of the average household income.

The composition of the classes has also experienced considerable change over the last
few years. Table 4.4 shows the evolutions of the classes from 2007 to 2011 as a share of
total out-of-work population, while Figure 4.7 graphs the absolute numbers. As mentioned
before, one important development between 2007 and 2011 was the noticeable increase in
the size of the out-of-work population, from about 167,000 to roughly 224,000 individuals.
Furthermore, it is interesting how some of the clusters identified by analyzing the 2011 data
could also be identified (broadly speaking) in the 2007 and 2009 data, although the relative
sizes of such clusters might have changed. In particular:

        The most worrying development, arguably as a result of the crisis, is the
         emergence in 2011 of a large cluster of young, long-term unemployed
         individuals. As shows in the first section, the relative weights of long-term
         unemployment and of overall unemployment as a share of the out-of-work
         population have doubled between 2007 and 2011, from 19 percent to 37 percent
         and from 9 to 19 percent, respectively. Within these groups, as the figures below
         show, by 2011 a cluster of mostly young (between 16 and 34) and long-term jobless
         individuals, accounting for about 19 percent of the out-of-work population in
         Estonia, had emerged.
        Similarly, and just as worryingly, the last few years have witnessed the steady
         increase in the size and weight of the clusters of young Estonians who are
         employed in school or in training. In 2007, the NEET cluster accounted for about
         11,000 individuals (or 7 percent of the out-of-work population). By 2011 this
         cluster had grown to include more than 20,000 people, almost doubling in size. And
         while it should be noted that in 2009 the cluster of NEETs was somewhat different
         than the clusters of NEETs observed in 2007 and 2011 (that is, it was “more rural”
         and “less educated”), the fact that the ranks of young NEETs with no prior work
         experience have grown so substantially in such a short time span is troubling from a
         policy and social perspective.
        Furthermore, at least in part as a result of the crisis, the cluster of prime-age
         unemployed individuals has witnessed a considerable amount of movement.
         Such cluster, which included roughly 22,000 people in 2007, almost tripled in size in
         a two-year period along, increasing to more than 61,000 people in 2009, before
         declining all the way back to 29,000 by 2011, still marking a 30 percent increase in
         absolute size from the 2007 figures;
        The number of disabled individuals has also increased significantly over the
         last few years. Over the 2007–2011 period there were two clusters of disabled
         individuals, the combined size of which steadily increased from about 43,000 to
         more than 54,000 individuals. The first cluster, which increased by about 25
         percent, from 38,000 individuals to 47,000 and can be observed throughout the
         period, was composed of middle-aged educated disabled. The second cluster
         changed somewhat during the period and could not be observed in 2009, but
         essentially included young, low-educated disabled individuals. This cluster also
         increased in size, from 5,000 to 7,000.
        The number of adult retirees receiving benefits has been generally stable over
         the years, although with some changes in the features of the cluster. In 2007,
         the cluster including retirees numbered about 38,000 people; by 2011 this cluster
         had only slightly increased to about 39,000. As a result, the share of retirees in the
         out-of-work population decreased from about 22 percent to 17 percent.

         Furthermore, while the cluster of retirees was mostly made of women in 2007, by
         2011 this group had become more gender-balanced.

Structural Aspects and Emerging Trends in the Profiles of the Out-of-Work

The analysis of the EU-SILC data using latent class methodology and the analysis of Eurostat
numbers reveal the existence of a number of clusters or groups of out-of-work individuals
that can be more or less clearly defined and that differ from one another in important
characteristics. Some of the features that we have highlighted are more permanent in nature,
while other can most likely be ascribed to the global downturn and might therefore be more
cyclical.

On the structural side, first and foremost, our analysis shows that young Estonians fare quite
poorly on the labor market in absolute terms, although better than youth in neighboring
countries. Their performance is also in line with EU-wide averages. As per our graphs above,
the unemployment rate in the 15-to-24 year old cohort was about 19 percent in 2013, after
peaking at more than 35 percent among males and 30 percent among females in 2010.
Noticeably, the 2013 data, while quite alarming per se, is better than that registered for the
EU as a whole, and for Lithuania and Latvia (22–23 percent). Employment rates in Estonia
among those aged 15 to 24 peaked, in fact, at 36 percent in 2008, before dropping to 26
percent in 2010 and recovering somewhat to 32 percent in 2013. Again, such figures are
aligned with the EU-28 average (32 percent), and stand in stark contrast to those recorded
in Lithuania (25 percent). Similarly, as Figure 4.8 shows, labor force participation among
youth aged 15 to 24 is in line with the rest of the European Union; in 2013, youth labor force
participation rates settled at about 40 percent in Estonia, considerably lower than the rate
registered in some Nordic and continental European countries, but almost 10 percentage
points higher than countries such as Lithuania and Bulgaria. The female participation rate
for this age cohort was 38 percent in 2013, 1 percent lower than the EU-28, and more than
10 points higher than countries such as Lithuania and Bulgaria.

Second, disabled individuals have been and will continue to be a sizeable portion of the out-
of-work population, and population aging will only increase Estonia’s expenditure on
disability benefits. EU-SILC data shows that the number of individuals who report their labor
market status as disabled (the majority of whom also receive benefits) settled at just under
50,000 in 2011, a year in which there were two distinct clusters of mostly disabled
individuals. In 2007, however, the number of disabled individuals totaled less than 40,000.
Thus, even though the share of disabled in the out-of-work population marginally decreased
over the last few years (from 23 to 22 percent between 2007 and 2011, and mostly due to
the large increase in the total out-of-work population), the absolute number of those
classified as disabled increased considerably, with the increase occurring entirely between
2009 and 2011. Furthermore, as seen, disabled Estonians tend for the most part to have little
or no work experience and to be above 35 years of age. The vast majority of such individuals
benefit from disability or other benefits, which tend to be quite generous (making up on
average 70 percent of household income). These factors combined (no work experience, age,
and benefit availability) point to high (and growing) impediments for entering or re-entering
the labor market, even when disabilities are not too severe. These patterns are somewhat
troubling, given the rapid aging the Estonian society will undergo in the coming decades;
projections based on current census data show that in the 2001–2011 decade alone, the
share of Estonian permanent residents over the age of 65 rose from 15 to 18 percent.
According to the Center for International Futures (CIF) at the University of Denver, this
number will almost double by 2060 to about 33 percent. At the same time, the number of
working-age people will decline from 66 percent to 52 percent. The most recent census
(2011) also shows that over the last decade the country has lost 5.5 percent of its population

(from 1.37 million to 1.295 million) and, using CIF data once again, by 2060 only 0.86 million
people will likely live in the country, down from 1.3 million in 2011. The combination of
increasing numbers of disabled individuals with an aging and shrinking population will
likely increase the expenditure on disability benefits that the Government will have to
undertake in the coming decades. Figure 4.9 below shows that expenditure on disability
benefits as a share of GDP, while lower than the EU average, had already increased between
2008 and 2010, going from 1.4 percent to 1.9 percent.

Third, a number of negative developments can be observed within the unemployed category,
all of which pose significant and urgent challenges for policymakers. In particular:

    As already noted above, one of the most striking developments between 2007 and
     2011 is the dramatic increase in the size and share of the unemployed, especially
     long-term unemployed, in Estonia. Not only, as shown above, have the number of
     unemployed and their share of the out-of-work population increased dramatically in
     Estonia from 2007–2011 but, across all clusters of unemployed individuals, an
     extremely worrying phenomenon is the growing share of individuals in long-term
     unemployment, the absolute numbers of which have almost tripled over the period,
     according to EU-SILC data.49 Long-term unemployment not only imposes a significant
     financial burden on households, but affects the long-term health status of job-seekers,
     negatively affects Government finances, and results in a lower overall long-term level of
     skills among a country’s workforce, with permanent negative effects on productivity

49By 2013 the number of long-term unemployed had decreased significantly. According to Estonian
Labor Force Survey data, there were 48,600 long-term unemployed in 2011, but just over 26,100 in
2013.



110 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
    (Katz, 2012). Once more, addressing the plight of the long-term unemployed should be
    among the policy priorities for Estonian policymakers.
   A further concerning development is the significant increase in the size of the
    NEETs group, the size of which almost doubled over the last few years. About 80
    percent of the individuals in this cluster have no prior work experience, and 60 percent
    of them belong to the first two income quintiles; activating these clusters should
    therefore be another policy priority for Estonian policymakers, to avoid the further
    depreciation of the stock of human capital among these young individuals and to
    promote their long-term wellbeing.
   In line with the first point above, the global downturn is likely at least partly
    responsible for the rise of a group of young long-term unemployed, a cluster that
    did not exist in 2007 or in 2009 but represented a staggering 19 percent of the out-of-
    work population in 2011. With about two-thirds of them being men in their prime
    (hence many of them likely to be heads of households), and given the high risk of
    poverty within this group (as shown, 80 percent of these individuals fall in the first two
    income quintiles), facilitating the transition of this group into the labor market is key to
    the long-term wellbeing of these individuals and their families.
   The downturn is also probably responsible for at least part of the increase in the
    size of the group of well-educated, unemployed individuals in their prime. Despite
    the fact that this cluster tripled in size between 2007 and 2009, and reverted back to
    “only” 30 percent above its pre-crisis level by 2011, the existence of a large and
    increasing number of well-educated, mostly prime-aged, jobless men is now a structural
    feature of the Estonian labor market.

Out-of-Work Population: Group Profiles from Longitudinal Analysis

Finally, by looking at longitudinal EU-SILC data for the period 2008–2010, one can
better understand the in-cluster dynamics, as well as notice other movements in the
labor market. EU-SILC allows for the tracking of a number of out-of-work individuals
between 2008 and 2010. Of course, because of the difficulties in tracking people across
time, the sample size of the panel dataset is considerably smaller than the cross-section
surveys; the 2008–2010 longitudinal dataset includes in fact about 560 observations, as
opposed to 2,400 observations for 2011. However, the panel data confirms the existence of
some latent classes that emerged in the cross-sectional analysis. And even though the
smaller sample size forced us to lower the number of clusters identified, some clear patterns
emerged. Through longitudinal data five classes can be defined, some of which can also be
found in the cross-section datasets:

          Prime-aged educated unemployed (38 percent)
          Educated retirees (21 percent)
          Young inactive educated mothers with working partner(17 percent)
          Middle-aged low-educated and rural disabled (15 percent)
          Single NEETs without work experience (9)

Annex 3 shows the statistical description of the latent classes in full while Table 4.5 below
summarizes the key features of each group.

A further advantage of the panel analysis is to provide information on the movement of
individuals in and out of certain clusters and in and out of jobs between 2008 and 2010.
Table 4.6 below shows the flow of individuals into the different clusters as of 2010,
according to their labor market status in 2008. The most interesting column is the one
relative to those that were employed in 2010. According to the panel data, among those
categorized as employed in 2010, 81 percent were also employed in 2008; however, and
somewhat encouragingly, almost 30 percent of those unemployed in 2008 moved into

employment by 2010, while 55 percent of those classified as domestic workers or inactive in
2008 had become employed by 2010. However, 19 percent of those employed in 2008 had
fallen into one of the out-of-work categories by 2010.

Table 4.7, on the other hand, shows a considerable amount of movement out of employment
between 2008 and 2010. For instance, 80 percent of those in the prime-aged, educated
unemployed cluster were actually employed in 2008. Similarly, 22 percent of the 2010 NEETs
cluster were employed in 2008, and more than 30 percent of the young, inactive mothers
had also left the ranks of the gainfully employed between 2008 and 2010.

From Profiling to Activation

Activation and Inclusion Policies in Estonia

Expenditures on active labor market policies (ALMPs) are relatively low but have
been scaled up since 2008. Up until the crisis, employment services and activation policies
for the unemployed had not been a particular concern in the Estonia; in 2008, for instance,
ALMP expenditures accounted for 0.1 percent of GDP, half of which was covered through EU
funds (OECD, 2010). More than half of that amount was spent on employment services,
counseling, and job-search activities, and no more than 0.5 percent of the total workforce
benefited from labor market policies. Few of the unemployed received benefits, either
contributory or non-contributory. The effects of the financial crisis underlined the need for
labor market reforms, for greater resources to support the unemployed; accordingly, in
2009, the country underwent an extensive reform process that affected labor market
regulations, contractual agreements, labor compensation and wage policies, unemployment
insurance, social protection and insurance schemes, and so on.

In the post-2009 scenario, the main agency in charge of employment services and
unemployment benefits is the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF). Until 2009 the country
had a self-standing public employment service under the Ministry of Social Affairs; however,
with the advent of the crisis and the increasing need to tighten the link between
unemployment assistance, unemployment insurance, and employment services, the public
employment service was merged with the UIF. After the merge, the UIF, a public agency fully
financed by employers’ and employees’ contributions, became a “tripartite” organization in
charge of all active and passive labor market policies. The merged UIF, which remained
under the supervision of the Ministry of Social Affairs, maintained its 15 regional and 26
local labor offices, 80 percent of which provide information and job counseling and manage
jobseekers and employers’ cases through their front-line staff (OECD, 2010).

As a result of the crisis, the range of active and passive labor market policies and
employment services offered by the UIF is now wide. In particular, examples of services and
programs offered by UIF include (OECD, 2010):

   Supported Employment Programs/Measures. These include career counseling, job-search
    assistance, job-broking services, measures for disabled jobseekers, and public works in
    selected municipalities;
   Training Schemes in the form of benefits for both employers and employees, workplace
    trainings, and so on;
   Support Schemes for Job Creation, such as start-up incentives, support to employers in
    finding suitable workers;
   Passive measures such as unemployment benefits.

Estonia traditionally spends much less on labor market policies (LMPs) than other OECD
countries; this pattern still holds despite the fact that the crisis resulted in a notable increase
in such expenditures. As Figure 4.10 below shows, in 2011 Estonia spent little more than 0.6
percent of GDP on LMPs, two-thirds of which was devoted to unemployment benefits and
early retirement. The average OECD country, on the other hand, spent over 1.4 percent of

GDP in LMPs, almost two and a half times the Estonian figure. Looking at the evolution of
such expenditures between 2003 and 2011, it is immediately noticeable that the downturn
was associated with a massive increase in unemployment and early retirement benefits. In
the pre-crisis period, total LMP expenditure was extremely low; it ranged between 0.1 and
0.2 percent of national GDP, with unemployment and early benefits absorbing about three-
quarters of the expenditures (0.07–0.15 percent of GDP). By 2009, at the peak of the crisis,
the share of these benefits had increased more than tenfold, reaching 1.6 and 1.3 percent of
GDP, respectively. By 2012, unemployment and early retirement benefits as a share of GDP
were still three times as much as the pre-crisis level (Eurostat and OECD data). It should be
noted as a positive that Estonia did not respond to the crisis with a decrease in relative
activation spending, but rather increased such expenditures; the share of ALMP spending in
GDP quadrupled between 2007 and 2012 (from about 0.05 to 0.2 percent of GDP). Overall,
then, even though the range of labor market policies offered by the UIF is now quite wide and
comparable to the packages offered by the LMP systems of other OECD countries, the scale of
such programs is much more limited.

The large increase (and then decrease) in the share of total LMP costs that went toward
unemployment benefits was matched by a dramatic rise (and then fall) in the number of
beneficiaries. As Figure 4.11 shows, while the 2003–2011 period did witness an increase
(although from a very low basis) in the number of active labor market policies’ beneficiaries
from about 1,000 in 2003 to 6,000 in 2011, the downturn was clearly linked to a spike in the
number of those receiving unemployment or early retirement benefits, with almost 30,000
individuals joining the ranks of the beneficiaries between 2008 and 2009 alone.

As mentioned above, the level of ALMP spending has increased considerably as a result of
the global financial crisis, albeit from a very low base; furthermore, the composition and
source of such expenditures have changed. As depicted on Figure 4.12, spending on training,
which made up virtually all of ALMPs expenditures in 2008, increased threefold. On the

other hand, spending on employment incentives became a sizeable budget item in 2001, but
was almost negligible in 2008 (Eurostat, 2010). In addition to the new composition of LMP
spending, the crisis also led to a change in the financing of the inclusion measure: after 2009,
a major funding source has in fact now become the EU structural funds, which currently
support projects that provide vocational training, improve the quality of working life,
facilitate job creation, and so on.

Activation Priority, Activation Type and Benefit Receipt, by Group

When further considering the approach to labor market integration, an assessment of the
priorities and potential of the identified groups needs to be undertaken. Given the cautious
increase in nominal resources for activation programs, further prioritization of intervention
is all the more important. After a first step (“activation priority”) of prioritizing the
intervention along activation need and activation potential, a second step (“activation
type”) will attempt to classify the groups according to the kind of activation intervention
needed, depending on social or labor market barriers to be overcome. Lastly, as a third step,
information on the household income composition of the different groups will be used to
assess potential cross-dependencies of the benefit system with the labor market status and
activation approaches

Activation Priorities. The table below gives an overview of the identified out-of-work
classes and their respective activation need and activation potential. The total number of
persons estimated in these clusters was about 224,000 in 2011, representing 28 percent of
the working-age (16–64-year-old) population of Estonia in 2011.

In the table, “activation need” refers to a group’s level of need for inclusion in the labor
market in order to achieve income and reduce or end poverty. “Activation potential”
describes that group’s ability or motivation to be included in the labor market. A high
activation need could be driven by high poverty risk (as in the case of the prime-age low
income long-term unemployed) whereas a high activation potential could be driven by
previous work experience or a relatively good educational base (for example, the prime-aged
educated unemployed). Overall priority for action can also be supported by the size of the
group.

From this prioritization exercise, a set of five groups emerges with “high” or “medium”
priority for action. Middle-aged disabled with previous work experience are a large group with
a relatively high share of benefit receipts and prima-facie work limitations. At the same time,



                                                             Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 119
they have previous work experience and a relatively high educational status (14 percent
even have tertiary degrees). Prime-age low-income long-term unemployed have a high
activation need among other factors, owing to their high exposure to poverty. At the same
time, they report almost no work limitation due to physical disabilities and have a good
education status. Young, inactive, educated mothers with working partner show a medium
activation need, less so because of their poverty risk but more because of their labor market
contribution potential (52 percent have tertiary education!). Their activation potential is
high but their overall priority should be set to “medium” in light of their households’
relatively secure position. Prime-aged, educated unemployed and single NEETs without work
experience are both rated as “high priority” because of either good work experience and
maintenance of human capital or young age and avoidance of ”scarring” effects.

Educated retirees and young low-educated rural disabled are not prioritized for further action
owing respectively to their officially achieved retirement status and extreme distance (via
very low educational attainment and self-declared disability) from the labor market.

Activation type. As a second step, the relative severity of labor market or social obstacles to
be overcome for labor market integration will serve as an orientation for activation
approaches.

When mapping the respective barriers for labor market integration faced by the five
prioritized groups, we can see that while many of them have severe labor market distance
and attachment challenges, only the middle-aged educated disabled with previous work
experience emerge as a group that will face severe social barriers owing to the high share of



120 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
disability within the group. The young inactive educated mothers with working partner could
be described as facing a “social” barrier because of the relative importance of paid maternity
leave compared with the availability of public child care offerings in Estonia. On the other
hand, their excellent household welfare situation (only 19 percent in bottom income
quintile) could lead to the conclusion that their social situation might be in part self-chosen
or driven by “cultural norms,” if not that potential combined household income will not be
perceived as sufficient to cover eventual private child care costs. Nevertheless it should be
kept in mind that Estonia has higher female labor market participation than Europe as a
whole (71.5 percent versus 65.5 percent for EU-28 for 2012). The female participation is
even greater in the 25-to-64-year-old cohort at almost 80 percent, 10 points higher than the
region’s average.

Finally, the three groups of single NEETs without work experience, prime-age lo- income long-
term unemployed and prime-aged educated unemployed can be distinguished by their relative
distance from the labor market (in terms of qualification and work experience). However,
the prime-age low-income long-term unemployed face significantly higher poverty.

Household income composition. When analyzing the 2011 household income of the
prioritized groups, it is a striking feature that most households have a relatively high share
of labor income. This is related to the low level and degree of coverage of unemployment and
social assistance benefits in Estonia (EU, 2013). Among the prioritized groups, only the
middle-aged educated disabled with previous work experience (29 percent) have a low share
of labor income, a fact certainly corresponding to the 62 percent of household income
stemming from disability and old-age benefits. With 92 percent of this group’s individuals
reporting their labor market status as “disabled,” but only 43 percent strongly limited in
their capacity to work because of their physical or mental condition, there appears to be
some potential for labor market mobilization and benefit rationalization in this group.

Apart from this observation, the general level of benefit receipt in the prioritized groups is
small to non-existent. The single NEETs without work experience are the only group with a
noticeable amount (1 percent (!)) of household income stemming from social exclusion
benefits. In light of the fact that, with the exception of the young, educated mothers with
working partner, all of the groups are severely overrepresented in the two bottom-income
quintiles, this pattern of benefit receipts certainly falls short on any social inclusion target.

Given the overall picture of benefit receipt revealed by EU-SILC data, a key need for action
emerges around a potential review of disability benefit allocation among middle-aged
educated disabled with previous work experience and on the coverage and generosity of the
unemployment and social exclusion benefits in general.

Suggestions for Activation Measures and Further Analysis

This section sets out a set of potential activation measures for each of the priority groups.
Areas for further policy dialogue are also outlined. Any suggestion or policy discussion
around concrete measures will need to take into account that the Estonian authorities have
introduced a recent set of reforms and changes to existing programs in the field of
employment and labor market inclusion (EU 2013).

The suggestions below should be considered as a starting point for further policy dialogue
between the EC, the World Bank and Estonia, bearing in mind that the groups identified still
carry heterogeneity that may affect the type of support required. Accordingly, these
suggestions are also not meant to be an exhaustive set of possible activation measures.

It is important to keep in mind that the groups have been derived from EU-SILC data from
the year 2011. Since then, general economic development, policy actions by the Government
of Estonia and European Commission Country-specific recommendations” might reflect
some of these policy suggestions or render them obsolete. Among the policy changes that the
government of Estonia has initiated since 2011 that ought to improve the labor market
integration or activation of some of the groups is a major reform of the incapacity-for-work
scheme and the implementation of measures to prevent youth unemployment, support
youth who are NEET, and include a wage subsidy for the employer and reimbursement of
training costs for people aged 17 to 29.

Middle-aged educated disabled with previous work experience (21 percent, Priority:
Medium). This is the largest group among the identified and prioritized groups. Its almost
48,000 members make up about 5 percent of the total working-age population in Estonia.
Forty-three percent of this group report severe limitations in their capacity to work. While
this is significantly lower than the share of individuals reporting their activity status as
disabled (93 percent), any improved labor market integration of this group is likely going to
require a complex set of social, medical and therapeutic support actions.

At any rate, this significant group of out-of-work citizens needs to be followed more closely,
and any new applicants for disability benefits closely monitored and controlled. Limiting the
inflows into this group (via more stringent disability benefit criteria) will be easier than
forcing the activated exit from members of this group. Potential activation measures for the
inactive who remain in this group will largely depend on the ability of local governments to
provide and finance services for disabled (transport, social and medical care, and so on), but
also on the integration of national policies with local service standards and adequate
financing. In light of the potentially high integration cost for and potential discrimination
against disabled workers, local social services cannot be expected to finance these
approaches without support from central government. Potential activation measures
include:
      Review disability status but continue benefits (for now). While continuing to
         provide current benefits, the government could make the members of this group
         eligible for a review of their disability and work-ability status. When considered “fit
         to work” in this review, a set of support measures and continuing benefits




122 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
        (potentially with a phase-out period) ought to be provided to cushion the transition
        to labor market integration. According to Estonian officials, measures along these
        lines are currently under consideration and changes in the way the country
        supports and integrates disabled individuals will be introduced.
       Mobility support. Given the fact that the majority of this population lives in rural
        contexts, support for labor market access and mobility could be an important
        service. When providing transport or mobility solutions, local authorities could
        draw on social enterprises or cooperatives, providing additional opportunities for
        local employment.
       Standard PES job search assistance and placement support. Building on the
        strong previous work experience of this group and starting with the “non-disabled”
        members, integration into the standard (or emerging) activation regime of the
        Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF), the Public Employment Service
        (PES) in Estonia.
       Social economy support and sheltered employment as time-limited transition
        offerings. For members of this group who subjected to transition from “disabled” to
        “unemployed” labor market status, temporary placement in social economy
        enterprises or “sheltered” employment could provide a first step back into a fully
        competitive labor market. Special care needs to be taken that these offerings are
        time-limited and linked to clear activation regimes.

Prime-age low-income long-term unemployed (19 percent, Priority: High). This
middle-aged group shows strong work availability, is majority male and has a nearly 50/50
urban-rural split. It has the highest poverty risk among all the groups identified.
     Improve social inclusion benefit and link to activation. In light of the extremely
        high poverty faced by this group, a targeted expansion of coverage and generosity of
        an activating social inclusion benefit (conditional on job search) could improve the
        household welfare condition. This would require improved collaboration of the
        EUIF and municipal social welfare offices.
     Reconnect with previous employment experience. Building on previous
        employment experience, this group could be equipped with missing functional or
        technical skills, second-chance apprenticeship programs and higher secondary
        school certificates. Ideally, these programs would relate to industry experience
        already gained in previous employment spells.
     Combined professional training and public works. In order to combat any
        behavioral and attitudinal detachment from the labor market that may result after
        long periods of unemployment, it may be warranted to subject some of the members
        of this group to a (time-limited) public works requirement, combining this offering
        with training, job search and skills support.
     Mobility and training. Questions of geographic mobility are of great importance for
        this group of unemployed. Linking mobility to training offerings, enabling some of
        these jobseekers to participate in higher-quality training in central places can be an
        important addition to the menu of labor market policies locally. Encouragingly,
        training needs are already assessed individually by local PESs, and transportation
        costs related to training will be reimbursed up to EUR 26 per day.

Young inactive educated mothers with working partner (17 percent, Priority:
Medium). Given their excellent educational status, relatively low poverty, and the high



                                                        Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 123
income of their working partners, some of these women could be more or less voluntarily
inactive. In terms of their labor market status, they could be regarded as “market” type
customers for the EUIF, needing limited and self-driven forms of job search support and
reconnection with previous employment and education experience, as long as any service
needs (child care, elderly care in family, and so on) are taken care of.
     Child care and early childhood development. Extension of accessible child care
         offerings will play an important role in enabling earlier labor market integration for
         these women. Given their above-average household income, an income-graded cost
         for participation could pay for the necessary child care services. It is likely that such
         policies will be supported by European Social Funds during the 2014–2020 period.
     Reconnection with previous employment. With 93 percent of the women having
         worked before, linking women to their previous industry or profession after
         maternity leave or family time can build on existing ties and professional
         knowledge. These interventions should ideally be employer-driven and only
         marginally supported by public intervention (for example, voucher systems), and
         focus on women who have been detached from their industry or employer for many
         years and have difficulties reconnecting.50
     Group-specific job search support. Support from PES counselors in job search
         techniques, soft skills, self-presentation and update of certain functional skills may
         help members of this group reconnect with the labor market and attack the
         necessary challenges in a group-specific support network (for example, “young
         mothers job club,” and so on)

Prime-aged educated unemployed (13 percent, Priority: High). This group should be
among the highest priority customers of the Public Employment Service since they boast a
very good education level and relatively recent work experience. Building on these assets,
this group’s integration in the benefit and activation system of the Unemployment Insurance
Fund should be strengthened. Currently, this group receives very limited social assistance
benefits.
      Job search support through PES. Standard measures of job search support, regular
         updates on personal progress, and personal action plans need to be the central pillar
         of activation support. Nevertheless, these should be seen as a “second level” option,
         to be used after a self-driven job search fails. As evidenced in EU (2013), Estonia has
         already taken important steps in this direction with recent changes to
         unemployment and labor market programs.
      Placement in private enterprises. Job placement and training that occur within
         labor market activation programs need to be linked to employers’ needs for skills
         and workers. Given the good educational endowment of these unemployed,
         supporting employers with skills upgrades for their existing workforces, together
         with these unemployed, could facilitate their access to companies.
      Mobility and training. Questions of geographic mobility are of great importance for
         this group of unemployed. Linking mobility to training offerings, enabling some of
         these jobseekers to participate in higher-quality trainings in central places can be an
         important addition to the menu of labor market policies locally.

Single NEETs without work experience (9 percent, Priority: High). This group is mainly
challenged with getting its first foothold in the labor market and building on recent
educational experience.
     Internet and social network-based activation and information offerings.
        Promotion of online job portals, potentially linked with “game-ification” of job
        search offerings, mobile CV submission, application, and so on
     Group job search. Mobilizing young people to continue job searching and not
        retreat to their homes can be an important measure to keep NEETs “engaged.”
     Reconnect programs with educational history. Building on educational history,
        training and job search offerings could help to build the functional skills necessary
        for related industries.
     School-to-work transition, first work experience. Estonia has already taken
        initial steps to strengthen this critical area.
     Youth guarantee programs. Importantly, these programs are set to be introduced
        in 2015. The services, which will combine training and wage subsidies, aim to
        increase the number of active young people in the labor market.

In general, further policy dialogue with the Estonian authorities ought to focus as much on
the general level and setup of resources devoted to labor market integration and activation
of the inactive and out-of-work, as on the ongoing improvement of services on the national
and local level. Within this discussion, a dialogue around specific measures for specific
groups could be deepened. The following items appear especially important:
      Consistent local service delivery. According to EU (2013), Estonia is intending to
         take steps to ensure consistent service delivery levels across the country. Given the
         fact that the majority of the country’s out-of-work population is situated in rural
         areas and many members of these groups require social and other public services
         for improved labor market integration, the adequate financing and equipment of
         local services (for example support to disabled, child care, and so on) can be an
         important prerequisite and complement to any activation policy.
      Labor market (re-)entry policies. Several groups face barriers to labor market
         entry post-school or post-work interruption. Giving special attention to school-to-
         work transitions and supporting fast re-entry into the labor market after
         unemployment or maternity spells will address the activation needs of many
         prioritized groups (young mothers as well as NEETs.)

In summary, Estonia could benefit from accompanying the ongoing improvement of its labor
market services and social inclusion policies with an enhanced knowledge about the
composition and socio-economic situations of the different groups of out-of-work citizens.
This notably relates to a unified view across traditional labor market categories
(employed/unemployed) and social inclusion dimensions (poverty, living conditions, and
access to services) because the two are intrinsically linked, especially for the labor market’s
most marginalized participants.

                          of-Work Population in Greece
                                                                 2007−2011
Background

While most countries in the region have been able to recover after the global financial
crisis, Greece is still in a recession. Greece had a moderate growth rate of over 4.3 percent
from 2003 to 2007, above the 2.2 percent average among the EU-28 Member States during
the same period. Like most of Europe, in 2009 the country was hit by the crisis and the
economy contracted 3.1 percent. Nevertheless, unlike other European countries, whose
growth started recovering soon afterward, Greece’s economy continued its downturn,
contracting 4.9, 7.1, 6.4 and 3.9 percent during 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

As it enters its sixth year of recession in 2013, Greece has also witnessed a steady
deterioration of employment outcomes, particularly since 2010. From 2004 to 2008,
unemployment of 15-to-64-year-olds slowly decreased, reaching 7.8 percent. Following the
onset of the crisis, unemployment rose rapidly, increasing more than 16 percentage points to
27.5 percent in 2013. This is more than twice the average rate that EU-28 countries had in
2013. Labor force participation is also low by European standards. In 2013, 32 percent of
Greece’s working-age population was inactive, compared to a 28.1 percent average for the
EU-28 countries.

Conversely, unemployment rates rose steadily and disproportionately affected those
segments of the working-age population traditionally at higher labor market risk in
Greece.51 In 2013, a staggering 68.3 percent of young people 15 to 24 of the working age
population were unemployed, and among them, more than 60 percent were long-term
unemployed (12 months or more), compared to about a third in 2008. Perhaps more
tellingly, the share of youth not in education, employment or training (NEET rate) nearly
doubled, from 11.7 percent in 2008 to 20.6 percent in 2013. It is among the highest NEET
rates in the EU. Another telling example of the social consequences of the employment crisis
is that the share of children 0–17 who live in households with no employed member
increased from 3.6 percent in 2008 to 12.9 percent in 2012.

A look at unemployment rates disaggregated by gender shows that women were
particularly affected by the crisis. As Figure 5.1 shows, unemployment rates are generally
higher for women, independent of age. While men in the 25–64 age category entered the
crisis with unemployment rates close to 4.3 percent, the share of unemployed women in this
same age group was close to 10.1 percent. By 2013 these rates had jumped to 19.9 and 25.7
percent, respectively. Among young Greeks, women were also affected more than men, with

the rate of joblessness among 15–24-year-old-men reaching 53.6 percent in 2013, as
opposed to 64.2 percent of women of the same cohort.

In Greece, long-term unemployment as a share of total unemployment has usually been
higher than the average for the EU-28 countries. In 2013, according to Eurostat and as
shown in Figure 5.2, in the average EU-28 country 47.5 percent of the unemployed have
been looking for work for more than 12 months, up from 33 percent in 2009. The long-term
unemployment in Greece has been considerably higher than that during the last 10 years. In
2009, it declined to 41 percent—still 6 point higher than the average EU-28 country—but by
2013 67.5 percent of the unemployed were long-term.

Following the crisis, low-educated individuals were especially affected by the rise in
unemployment. Unemployment rates were already increasing for the group of less-
educated individuals. After the crisis hit in 2009 this trend was somewhat accentuated.
However, all educational groups saw an increase in unemployment rates during the period
from 2008 to 2013. For those with a tertiary education, unemployment more than tripled,
from 6.3 to 20.3 percent of the working-age population. Those with lower educational levels
witnessed a greater increase in their unemployment rate, making the gap between low- and
high-educated groups bigger during the period. The gap also reflects structural changes that
increased the demand for more skilled workers. The difference in unemployment rates for
low- and high-educated workers grew from 1.3 percentage points in 2008 to 9.8 percentage
points in 2013.

As a result of the crisis, employment rates also deteriorated. The employment rate of
individuals aged 15 to 64 years, which peaked in 2008 at 61.9 percent, reached their lowest
level in 2013 at 49.3 percent, notably with no major distinction across educational
categories.

Although Greeks with lower educational levels suffered the most as a result of the crisis,
their share of the active population has been decreasing over time. The percentage of people
that only have lower secondary education or less has fallen almost 10 points since 2003,
reaching 28.2 percent in 2013. Similarly, those with tertiary education have increased from
21 percent in 2003 to 30.5 percent 2013.

During the period from 2007 to 2011, the size of the out-of-work population
considered in this note increased, from 2.139 to 2.695 million individuals. The analysis

of the out-of-work population in this note focuses on the working-age population (16 to 64
years old). Specifically, only individuals aged 25 to 64 years who are not employed and
individuals aged 16 to 24 who were neither employed nor in education or training were
considered. 52 Only the working-age population (16–64-year-olds) is analyzed, as labor
activation options—the main policy focus of this note—are only viable for that segment of
the population. The group in need of opportunities has substantially increased since 2007, as
the profiles of working-age population by labor market status show (see Figure 5.3). Table
5.1 shows that the groups of unemployed (short and long term), and even of early retirees,
have increased, while the share of disabled individuals and other inactive has decreased.
Non-employment,53 defined here as neither at work nor in military service, rose from 33
percent in 2007 to 41 percent in 2011.

52 Individuals aged 16 to 24 who are out of work and enrolled in education are excluded from the
sample; they are considered to be investing in their final stages of human capital formation and
therefore are not a particular target group for activation policies. Individuals enrolled in school
between 25 and 64 are, however, included in the latent class analysis and will be grouped under “other
inactive.” It is important to note that the group of students older than 24 account for only 1 percent of
total population of working age.
53 Throughout this report, this population is also referred to as the out-of-work population.

Methodology: Latent Class Analysis

In Chapter 1 a general overview of the latent class analysis methodology was presented. This
section explains in detail the variables and covariates used to identify classes or groups of
out-of-work individuals that are as homogeneous as possible within each class according to a
set of observable characteristics, and as distant as possible between classes. The emerging
profiles can then be contrasted with the design and targeting of current activation policies,
in order to identify the potential gaps and to enhance their design features.54

Variable selection: The definition of latent classes relies on a number of indicator variables
to capture different “symptoms” of an overall latent condition (in this case, the typology of
joblessness). The challenge in such models is to identify a discrete number of variables that
can best explain the heterogeneity of individual outcomes. In this case, two sets of
categorical variables were selected: the first set to show the extent of labor market distance
and the other to capture some of the main factors that can affect employment on the supply
side, such as labor supply conditions (household-level incentives to work and physical
ability to work).

         Distance from labor market: short-term unemployment, long-term
          unemployment, (early) retirement, disability, and other inactivity (largely unpaid
          domestic work).55
         Labor supply conditions: whether the individual’s household has at least one
          working adult,56 and perceived limitations on activities due to health problems.57

In addition to indicators, the model includes active covariates, which are used to improve the
classification of individuals in each class. In this case the active covariates are the
demographic variables that are normally used to disaggregate labor market outcomes:

         Age-group category (four groups)
         Gender
         Human capital: the highest educational level achieved (three groups)
         Urban/rural location

Once the latent classes have been defined, inactive covariates that were not included in the
model can be used to characterize the individuals in each class and the households in which
they live. The inactive covariates chosen describe those characteristics that may provide
valuable information for the design of tailored policies that address barriers to employment,
including income level. They include:



54 For the latest developments on active inclusion in Greece, see EC (2013b).
55 This  variable is constructed using the self-reported current work status in the EU-SILC survey that
has four categories: at work, unemployed, retired and inactive. The unemployed are further classified
into short- and long-term based on how long they have been actively looking for a job. The inactive is
combined with another question to separate this group into students, disabled, military and other
inactive.
56 In order to construct this variable, individuals aged 25 or older are considered adults.
57 This is a binary variable that takes the value one if an individual answered “yes, strong limitations” to

whether they had been hampered in their usual activities because of health problems for at least the
last six months. The value is zero if the answer is “yes, limited” or “no, not limited.”

58 The equivalized household income takes into account an equivalence factor to weight the number of
household members used in the denominator when calculating household income per capita. The first
adult aged 18 or over has a weight of 1.0, children under 14 have a weight of 0.3, and other individuals
14 and older have a weight of 0.5. The sum of the weights of all household members is equal to the
equivalent household size.
59 Note that income reported in EU-SILC surveys is for the year preceding the survey year.
60 Total household gross income is defined as the sum of: (at the individual level) gross employee cash

or near-cash income; company car, gross cash benefits or losses from self-employment (including
royalties); unemployment benefits; old-age benefits; survivor benefits; sickness benefits; disability
benefits; education allowances; and (at the household level) income from rental of property or land;
family/children related allowances; social exclusion not elsewhere classified; housing allowances;
regular inter-household cash transfers received; interests, dividends, profit from capital investments in
unincorporated business; pensions from individual private plans; and income received by people
under 16. Total household net income, in turn, was calculated by subtracting from total household
gross income regular taxes on wealth, taxes on income and social insurance contributions, and regular
inter-household case transfers paid.
61 Social benefits are aggregated in eight branches using the European System of integrated Social

PROtection Statistics (ESSPROS) definitions. For more information, see Eurostat (2011).

Group labeling. The resulting groups are then labeled according to the greatest
proportional characteristics within groups that also aid in distinguishing among groups.
Granted, a large number of characteristics describe these groups, and only a few are taken
into account for the purpose of labeling. In part, some of these characteristics may exhibit a
large degree of heterogeneity and may thus not be relevant for defining a group.
Additionally, some characteristics may be more relevant for the purposes of policy design
than others. In short, though the labeling of groups can be considered more an art than a
science, when taken together with detailed descriptions of a group’s most prominent
characteristics, labeling can serve as an important starting point in the design and
prioritization of activation policies.

The analysis relies on cross-sectional as well as panel data from the European Union
Statistics of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) surveys for 2008–2011, which combine
individual-level information with household characteristics. The first part of the note
presents a cross-sectional analysis for the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. In particular,
the latent class analysis on 2008 data shows the main characteristics of the out-of-work
before the global economic crisis hit Greece, and thus highlight what could be considered
more structural issues of the country’s labor market. The 2011 latent class analysis will
contrast this initial assessment with more recent developments. The second part of the note
exploits longitudinal data between 2008 and 201063 to trace the prior labor market status of
individuals observed last in 2010 in various classes, and will shed light on the relative
persistence in the out-of-work status among different classes of individuals. The set of
variables chosen for the cross-section and the longitudinal analysis are slightly different, due
to minor differences in the set of variables recorded in each of the two types of datasets.




62 According to EU-SILC guidelines, dense areas have more than 500 inhabitants per square kilometer,

where the total population for the set is at least 50,000 inhabitants. Intermediate areas have more than
100 inhabitants per square kilometer, and either a total population for the set of at least 50,000
inhabitants or a location adjacent to a dense area. The remaining areas are categorized as sparsely
populated.
63 The EU-SILC longitudinal survey consists of a four-year rotating panel. In each year, approximately

three-quarters of individuals present in the previous year are retained. The samples used in the latent
class analysis include about 3,000 observations for each year in the cross-sectional analysis and 600
observations in the longitudinal analysis. The population is weighted with individual weights.

Out-of-Work Population: Group Profiles from Cross-Sectional Analysis

The latent class analysis supports the categorization of the out of work into seven major
groups, some of which have remained stable over time. Figure 5.4 shows the shares of each
of these seven classes in the year 2011 while Table 5.2 presents their most salient
characteristics.

The seven main groups emerging from the LCA analysis in 2011 can be characterized as
follows (see Annex 2: Latent class analysis profiles—Cross-sectional model for more detail,
including the full list of inactive covariates):

        Cluster 1: Stay-at-home mothers. This group, representing 23 percent of the out-
         of-work sample in 2011, consists largely of out-of-the-labor-force women (77
         percent) in their prime-age (35 to 54 years). Two-thirds of this group have children
         (almost one-third have children under 6 years of age), more than half have an upper
         secondary education, and only 56 percent claim to have worked before. Another
         robust characteristic of this group is a working partner who earns, on average, a
         medium level of annual income (EUR 17,000). This group has the lowest share of the
         “no working adult in the household” indicator (11 percent). However, as these
         women’s households tend to be relatively large (3.5 members on average), it is not
         surprising that in terms of welfare, more than 50 percent of the class members live
         in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. Overall, although some
         individuals in this group receive family/child benefits, this group can least rely on
         public transfers, owing to the fact that their partners are employed.

Note: Percentages in parentheses following the group names refer to the share of the total out-of-work
population. “Years of work experience” refers only to individuals who have worked before. “Dependent
children” include children under 18 and household members aged 18 to 24 who are economically inactive
and living with at least one parent. “Working adult” refers to adults aged 25 and over. For this report’s
purposes, we define the at-risk-of-poverty rate as the relative risk of being in the first quintile of the
income distribution. The reference period for income reported in EU-SILC surveys is the year preceding the
survey year.

        Cluster 2: Highly educated single NEETs. This group represented 18 percent of the
         out-of-work population in 2011. Members of this class are largely under the age of
         35 and resemble other unemployed youth who have been particularly hit by the
         economic crisis across the EU, as 40 percent of them are long-term unemployed and
         another 30 percent short-term unemployed. The protracted employment crisis is
         also evident through a relatively high (and rising) average age. In 2010 less than a
         third of this group was below 25 years old, while more than 60 percent was
         between 25 and 34 years of age. In 40 percent of these group’s households, there is
         no working adult. Moreover, this group is relatively highly educated; more than half
         have either higher education or a post-secondary degree. Another defining
         characteristic of the highly educated single NEETs is that they have never been
         married and live in large households without children (probably their household of
         origin). Overall this group has a moderate poverty risk; 27 percent of them are in
         the poorest income quintile.
        Cluster 3: Middle-aged unemployed heads of households. This group made up 18
         percent of the out-of-work in 2011. This group comprises individuals who are
         almost entirely middle-aged (35–59), majority male (61 percent), unemployed
         (more than half long-term, that is, unemployed for more than 12 months). Together
         with the highly educated single NEETs they constitute over 80 percent of the
         unemployed in the country.64 Unlike their younger counterparts, however, this
         group comprises individuals who have left their birth households, made the


64As shown in Table 5.1, there were 1.023 million unemployed individuals in our sample of the
working-age population in 2011. As many as 98 percent of the middle-aged unemployed heads of
households and 71 percent of the highly educated single NEETs are reported to be unemployed;
together, these two clusters are a concentration of 80 percent of the unemployed.

         transition to marriage and largely have children. They are also fairly heterogeneous
         in terms of educational attainment: 36 percent have not completed upper secondary
         and 25 percent have completed post-secondary or tertiary education. And while half
         of the NEETs never worked before, this group is composed almost entirely of job-
         losers, with 17 years of experience on average. Their joblessness and family status
         explain why they are by far the worst-off in the whole sample of the out-of-work in
         terms of welfare (44 percent belonged to the bottom income quintile in 2011). In
         this context, it is noteworthy that only one-fifth of them receive unemployment
         benefits and only a small fraction receive the child allowance. In 56 percent of these
         group’s households, there is no working adult, the second-highest share among the
         non-retiree groups.
        Cluster 4: Retirees’ inactive wives. Representing 17 percent of the out-of-work
         population of 2011, this group consists of low-educated, inactive women, mostly
         close to or at retirement age, who live in small households and are married to
         retired men. Just over half of this group reports having worked in the past, but only
         30 percent describe themselves as retired. Over all, this group has a moderate
         poverty risk; 27 percent of them live in the poorest quintile.
        Cluster 5: Low-educated retirees. The fifth-largest group can be considered the
         male counterpart of the previous one, sharing similar household characteristics.
         They have low educational attainment; more than half did not finish upper
         secondary school. Interestingly, a third of the members in this group are less than
         60 years old, but almost all of them (84 percent) receive either a permanent
         (pension, disability pension) or unemployment-related income replacement benefit.
         In fact, this group figures among those least likely to be in poverty or near poverty,
         with only 19 percent in the bottom quintile. Their retirement status and previous
         work experience make them likely to be the main owners of pension rights for their
         households. Thirteen percent of them claim to be unable to work due to illness or
         disability, a rather high share compared to most groups.
        Cluster 6: Highly educated early retirees. This group represented 7 percent of the
         out-of-work population in 2011. Its members are characterized by a relatively low
         age for people in retirement (29 percent between 45 and 54, and another 53 percent
         between 55 and 59), all of them self-defining as retired, and about 85 percent of
         them receiving either old-age or disability benefits. They are by far the most highly
         educated (69 percent have tertiary education), urbanized (60 percent live in the
         capital of Athens), and highest-income group, with 54 percent in the top income
         quintile and only 4 percent in the bottom.
        Cluster 7: Low-educated, mostly rural disabled. This group, representing from 4
         to 5 percent of the out-of-work population, reports its labor market status as
         disabled (44 percent) or retired (25 percent), with very low education levels. A
         majority (67 percent) also report strongly limited to work ability due to a health
         condition. In 65 percent of this group’s households, there is no working adult, the
         highest share among the non-retiree groups. Most of these individuals receive at
         least one social benefit: the most common are disability benefits (51 percent) and
         family/child benefits (26 percent). The members of this group are also
         characterized by the absence of a partner and live in households without a working
         adult. They are the group next at risk of falling into poverty after the unemployed
         heads of households, with 34 percent belonging to the poorest income quintile. A
         majority live in rural areas.

Although a small number of the identified classes of out-of-work have been quite
stable over the last few years, most of the identified classes experienced changes in
composition and also in the share they represent of the total out-of-work. Table 5.5
shows the evolution of the groups’ classifications from 2007 to 2011 as a share of total out-
of-work population, while Figure 5.5 shows the absolute numbers. From the graph, the first
important observation is that the size of the out-of-work population has increased from
2.142 million to 2.695 million individuals, almost a 27 percent increase. Some clusters have
changed across time; for example, clusters identified in 2011 that were present in previous
years underwent changes in relative size and also in composition. The fact that the
composition of the groups change over time is particularly important to keep in mind when
interpreting changes in group size. For instance, significant increases (decreases) in group
size are sometimes due to reassignments of individuals across groups, resulting in changes
in group composition. Thus, although some groups may retain similar names across years
due to their most salient characteristics, they may nonetheless vary in composition across
years. The evolution in terms of group size and group composition over the 2007–2011
period can be summarized as follows:

       The major difference across time is the division of early retirees/poor
        unemployed cluster into two parts in 2011. Up until 2009 this group represented
        almost 13 percent of the out-of-work population. In 2011, this group splits into a
        smaller group of highly educated early retirees and a new, relatively large group
        comprising middle-aged unemployed heads of households. This new group captures
        the increase in unemployment among prime-aged individuals following the crisis.
       The highly educated single NEETs cluster share of the total out-of-work
        population remained stable at around 18 percent during the 2007–2010
        period. Nevertheless, the group had absolute growth of 25 percent in the same
        period (the population in this group was around 394,000 in 2007 and grew to
        497,000 in 2011). The composition of the group also experienced some changes
        from 2007 to 2010. In 2011 this cluster had more males than in previous years,
        increasing from 46 to 59 percent. Also, the share of people with tertiary or post-
        secondary education increased to 57 percent in 2011, up from 33 percent in 2007.
       There has been a slight decrease in the absolute size of the group of stay-at-
        home mothers. It is notable that this group represented 30 percent of the out-of-
        work in 2007, but due to the growth in other groups as a direct result of the crisis,
        its relative size shrank to 23 percent after the crisis. Interestingly, the group also
        decreased in absolute size, possibly because of changes in incentives for labor
        supply due to the loss of income of the partner, along with a general trend toward
        higher female labor force participation. Indeed, while in 2007 88 percent declared
        themselves to be inactive, in 2010 only 76 percent did so. Conversely, the group of
        stay-at-home mothers that claimed to be unemployed grew 11 percent. This group
        also became slightly more educated. In 2010, 17 percent had only a primary
        education (compared to 29 percent in 2008), and 48 percent had upper secondary
        (compared to 39 percent).
       The retirees’ inactive wives share of the out-of-work population oscillated
        between 17 and 22 percent from 2007 to 2009. Although the share of this cluster
        in 2011 with respect to that of 2007 did not vary significantly (17 percent), in
        absolute numbers this group grew almost 29 percent, an additional 103,000 people.

         In terms of composition there were also considerable changes. First, the percentage
         of individuals that were classified as retired increased from 3 percent to 30 percent
         between 2007 and 2011. The share of inactive decreased from 96 to 69 percent
         during the same period. In addition, the members of this group became more likely
         to have worked before43 to 55 percentand the share of them that received old-
         age benefits increased from 4 to 21 percent.
        The low-educated retirees and low-educated, mostly rural disabled groups
         remained stable in terms of absolute size. Although the relative size of both
         groups fell over time, the absolute numbers varied very little. The share of the out-
         of-work population for low-educated retirees decreased from 16 to 13 percent while
         growing 14 percent in absolute numbers. In terms of composition, the share of
         individuals with secondary education increased 13 percent, and were more likely to
         be male—86 percent in 2011 compared to 72 percent in 2007. On the other hand,
         the low-educated mostly rural disabled group reduced its share from 6 to 4 percent,
         which in absolute numbers represented a 6 percent decrease. The share of
         individuals in the low-educated mostly rural disabled who were between 35 to 54
         years old increased from 63 to 72 percent, and 65 percent said there was no
         working adult in the household in 2011, compared with 46 percent in 2007. A larger
         share of this group have never married—the percentage increased from 44 to 61—
         and is more likely to be living in urban areas than before.

Structural Aspects and Emerging Trends in the Profiles of the Out of-Work

The clusters identified in the out-of-work population for the period from 2007 to
2011 reflect both structural and cyclical aspects of the labor market. This section
identifies some of the key structural aspects of the Greek labor market and uses cross-
sectional and longitudinal analysis of clusters of the out-of-work population to further
examine the effects of the crisis.

Even in time of protracted economic crisis, only just over one third of the out-of-work
population reports being actively searching for work. Out of the seven classes identified in
2011, the first (largest) class, together with the last four (smallest) classes, comprise
individuals with either low or no labor force participation, and with limited incentives to join
the labor force. Limited incentives to work are found especially among the four smallest
classes, all of which are made up of retired individuals and their wives or individuals on
disability. The first (largest) group is composed of stay-at-home mothers who could
potentially be pushed into the labor market in the case of loss of income from their partners,
as well as if barriers, such as lack of child care, were removed. The two middle-sized groups
of largely unemployed individuals (highly educated single NEETs and middle-aged
unemployed heads of households) are only just above a third of the total unemployed (36
percent).

The low activity rates of some latent classes are associated with structural aspects of
the labor market that preceded the crisis. The first issue relates to very limited female
labor force participation, highlighted by the fact that the top group of the out-of-work
population is made up of largely inactive women. In fact, the labor force participation rate




144 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
for women of working age in Greece is 7 percentage points below that of the European Union
average (see Figure 5.7). The stay-at-home mothers depend on their partner’s income, and
nearly half of them have never worked before despite being of prime working age. As noted
below, however, their absolute number fell after the crisis, consistent with the fact that the
female labor force participation rate has been rising in recent years.

The structure of social protection benefits, particularly pensions, is directly linked with the
very high levels of inactivity in the working-age population, especially among those aged 55
to 64. Low-educated retirees, highly educated early retirees, retirees’ inactive wives, and the
low-educated mostly rural disabled make up 42 percent of the out-of-work population.
Interestingly, their absolute number has been increasing since the crisis, probably as the low
labor demand drove down incentives for remaining in the labor force and increased
pressure to enter the pension system at an early age. As a relative number, these groups of
retired individuals shrank compared to earlier years because of the large inflows of job
losers in the out-of-work population. It is noteworthy that retirees and their wives are the
groups that are best protected from the risk of poverty in the out-of-work population. In fact,
the labor force participation rate for the population aged 55 to 64, at 42.5 percent in 2013, is
almost 12 percentage points lower than the average for the European Union (Figure 5.7). In
contrast, the low-educated mostly rural disabled are at the highest risk of poverty, but make
up only 5 percent of the out-of-work, versus 37 percent in the case of (early) retirees and
their inactive wives.

Unemployment has changed in nature and size as a result of the crisis, with middle-
aged job losers acquiring new importance. Almost all of the groups of out-of-work



                                                         Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 145
individuals remained largely stable over time, though the crisis saw a rise in unemployed,
middle-aged poor. The population comprised six similar groups in 2007 and 2009,
expanding to seven well-defined groups in 2011, due to the increase in the size and the
nature of joblessness. The crisis also reduced the affordability of inactivity among middle-
class inactive mothers, and saw a significant reduction in the share of stay-at-home mothers.

Middle-aged unemployed heads of households appear to be at highest risk of falling
into poverty. The significant share of inactive in this group that receive retirement benefits
at a relatively young age appear to be at less risk of poverty than those who are out of work
but staying in the labor market. In the middle lie stay-at-home mothers and highly educated
single NEETs, who, although not as protected from poverty as retirees and their wives, are at
less relative risk of poverty.

Household composition patterns appear to be endogenous products of the protracted
employment crisis. Across groups, with the exception of stay-at-home mothers and middle-
aged unemployed heads of households, households mainly comprise at least two adults and no
children, even in the case of highly educated single NEETs. Of these, about 32 percent still live
with their parents. This suggests that out-of-work individuals live with their families, which
play the role of a safety net. In the case of stay-at-home mothers, although the great majority
(67 percent) live in households with children, an even larger proportion (86 percent) have a
working partner. This is in contrast with middle-aged unemployed heads of households, for
whom living with their families largely implies having dependents (only one third have a
working spouse and a majority live in households with children) and thus a higher risk of
falling into poverty.

The most discernible change between 2007 and 2011 is the emergence of the middle-
aged unemployed heads of households and the large growth of highly educated single
NEETs (Figure 5.5). Models for 2007 and 2009 indicated the existence of six latent classes,
while in 2011 the most fitting model supported seven classes. The main difference resulted
from the clear growth in size of a new class of middle-aged unemployed heads of households,
who represent the main departure from existing structural issues in the labor market—
which especially penalized youth and women. The size of the highly educated single NEETs
group also increased substantially during the period.

Out-of-Work Population: Group Profiles from Longitudinal Analysis

The analysis of longitudinal data for the period 2008—2010 can shed further light on
the dynamics within clusters in the labor market. The latent class analysis on the out-of-
work in the 2010 longitudinal dataset (which comprises 600 observations, a subsample of
the total) yielded similar results in terms of latent classes, though in light of the reduced
sample size, some categories of out-of-work were combined into one class: early retirees
were put together with retirees, and the unemployed (non-single NEET) together with the
disabled. Given the qualitative similarity between the size and characteristics of these five
clusters compared to those found in the cross-sectional analysis, the findings from the panel
data are here used to understand further the dynamics of the previously described sample.
Overall the five classes include, in order of magnitude:

        Stay-at-home mothers (28 percent)
        Highly educated single NEETs (24percent)
        Retired and early retired men (18 percent)
        Retirees’ inactive wives (17 percent)
        Low-educated unemployed or disabled (13 percent)

Annex 3 shows the statistical description of the latent classes in full while Table 5.6 below
summarizes the main key characteristics of the five classes.

Note: Years of work experience refer only to those individuals who have worked before. Dependent
children include children under 18 and household members aged 18 to 24 who are economically inactive
and living with at least one parent. Working adult refers to adults aged 24 and over.


A further advantage of the panel analysis is to provide information on the flow of
individuals among clusters and in and out of employment. Table 5.7 shows the flow of
individuals into each cluster of the out-of-work population or into employment in 2010
according to their labor market status in 2008. Between 2008 and 2010, 88 percent of the
employed remained at work. About 6 percent moved into unemployment, either to the group
of the highly educated single NEETs or to the low-educated unemployed or disabled, while
another 7 percent moved into inactivity: 3 percent into retirement, 1 percent into the
retirees’ inactive wives group, and an additional 3 percent into the stay-at-home mothers
group. There is also an interesting flow into employment among those who were
unemployed or inactive in 2008. In 2010, 34 percent of those who were classified as
unemployed and 21 percent who were classified as inactive in 2008 were found to be
employed. The sample size of individuals who were inactive in 2010 and for whom we had
information in 2008 is about 600.

Job losses hit all identified groups to some extent, but they were more pronounced
among the low-educated unemployed or disabled and highly educated single NEETs.
Table 5.7 shows the labor market status in 2008 for each cluster and at-work population in
2010. Table 5.8 identifies the 2010 population groups that were most affected by job loss.
The fifth (and smallest) class of low-educated unemployed or disabled were those that were
hardest hit, as close to half of them changed status from employment to non-employment
during this period. Young people were the second hardest-hit group, as one-third of highly
educated single NEETs lost their jobs.

On the other hand, the lack of flow into employment was pronounced. Table 5.8 also shows
that of those employed in 2010, only 8 percent had been out of work in 2008. In addition,
from the previous table it is clear that only one-third of the unemployed and one-fifth of the
inactive moved into a job between 2008 and 2010. This suggests that the lack of job creation
and the structural rigidities of the labor market reinforced the divide between the employed
and the non-employed during this period.

Self-employment and the “informal economy.” Any discussion of the Greek economy and
its labor market will need to take into account the presence of high self-employment and a
variety of informal activities. For the purpose of the segmentation of the out-of-work and
inactive population, EU-SILC data should be indifferent to the formality or informality of
work performed or income received. In an OECD working paper on the subject, Andrews et
al. (2011) give an overview of different measures for informality in EU and OECD countries
and report the share of employees not covered by social security contributions in Greece to
be 37.3 percent in 2008 (with an OECD average of 32 percent). At the same time, the authors
question the reliability of the data in terms of the question design in the EU-SILC
questionnaire. In a 2007 Eurobarometer Study on “Undeclared Work,” Greece reported the
highest number (16 hours) of undeclared hours per week in the European OECD sample. The
high prevalence of non-agricultural self-employment in Greece (higher than 35 percent) and
the almost 40 percent of workers without an employment contract (ibid, pp. 17 and 18,
respectively) indicate the main driver of informality in Greece, self-employment.

From Profiling to Activation

Overall, the profiles of the out-of-work resulting from this analysis indicate that an
important share of this population has very low activation potential, especially in the current
dire labor market situation. Many of the groups that are not working now are inactive either
from choice or from a combination of choice and labor market conditions. This section will
start with (a) a short overview of the current state of activation and inclusion policies and
programs in Greece, then (b) gauge the activation need and potential of the different groups,
and conclude with (c) a focused set of suggestions for further analysis, policy approaches
and activation opportunities for the different groups. The suggested interventions are meant
only as a starting point in a discussion with country authorities on general activation policies
and their respective priorities. While the latent classes identified in this exercise can point to
a general direction in terms of effective tailored policies, it would be beneficial to conduct a
more detailed profiling exercise at the individual level. Latent class analysis allows for the
classification of a vast population into broad meaningful categories, but there is still
variation within groups, with resulting implications for the appropriate level of support
required for activation.

Activation and Inclusion Policies in Greece
The current state of social inclusion and activation policies in Greece can best be
described as fragmentary (EU 2013b). Without a general minimum income scheme for
social assistance and a very limited and uncoordinated set of active labor market policies,
the country is ill equipped to withstand the current social crisis by means of formal state
intervention (Matsaganis, 2012: 4). According to the OECD database on active labor market
policies (ALMPs), Greece spent 0.22 percent of GDP on ALMPs in 2010, vs. an OECD average
of 0.49 percent (excluding public employment services (PES) operation respectively). The
ALMPs offered by the Greek public employment service (Organismou Apascholisis Ergatikou
Dynamikou, or OAED) are in many cases funded from the European Social Fund (EU 2013b:
18) but can provide help for some unemployed (Table 5.9).

According the EC DG EMPL, since 2010, about 1.2 million persons have benefited from OAED
training and placement schemes at a total budget of EUR 3.87 billion. Evaluation of the
programs by OAED finds that they have resulted in the retention of approximately 340,000
jobs, vocational training for 625,000 persons and initial vocational training for 42,000 young
people. It should be noted that the majority of vocational training institutions in the country
are in fact run by the OAED organization. At the same time, the provider landscape for
training, placement and accompanying activation work is clearly underdeveloped.

Moreover, the Greek social protection model has at its core always relied on maintenance of
primary breadwinner employment, family-based solidarity patterns (Amitsis, 2012: 6) and a
strong role for social insurance benefits, while granting generous payments and treatments
to privileged insider groups (bankers, senior civil servants, certain professions, and so on).

Much like the entire country and its budgets, the current social protection system is under
severe financial stress, contributing to the fiscal contraction agreed upon with EU authorities




                                                          Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 151
(Amitsis, 2012: 5). At the same time, the crisis has forced changes in many social programs
in Greece, especially in the field of social insurance (pensions, health) and the related general
budget subsidies for these programs. Given these fiscal constraints, many of the
proposed activation and support measures must be designed in a very cost-conscious
way, giving initial preference to group interventions, self-help approaches and self-service
online services, rather than customized and individual case manager approaches.

Over the next two years, the Government of Greece has committed to the introduction of a
pilot program for a means-tested minimum income benefit (European Commission
2013c: 40). If successfully rolled out on a national scale to low-income individuals and
households, this benefit could provide effective poverty relief and be a backstop against the
deprivation currently experienced by some of the out-of-work groups identified in this
note.65 With a benefit of this type, Greece would close its gap with the European standard for
inclusion policies, providing generalized income support instead of insurance-based and
categorical payments.

Concurrently, the Government of Greece has announced an emergency public works
program, the details of which are still being negotiated with EU authorities. Owing to the fact
that this program will be limited in run time and volume, it will be considered only as a part
of the policy approaches to address specific activation needs of the inactive groups in this
survey, and not as a main line of policy response.



65The means-tested minimum income benefit will not necessarily be exclusively targeted toward the
out-of-work population; it will be targeted toward individuals and households living in extreme
poverty in general.

Activation Priority, Activation Type and Benefit Receipt by Group

When further considering the approach toward labor market integration, an assessment of
the priorities and potential of the identified groups needs to be undertaken. In the current
context in Greece, a prioritization of intervention is very important. After a first step
(“activation priority”) of prioritizing the intervention along activation need and activation
potential, a second step (“activation type”) will attempt to classify the groups according to
the kind of activation intervention needed, depending on social or labor market barriers to
be overcome. Lastly, as a third step, information on household income composition of the
different groups will be used to assess potential cross-dependencies of the benefit system
with groups’ labor market status and activation approaches

Activation priority. Table 5.10 below provides an overview of the seven primary groups of
out-of-work persons among the population of working age according to their activation need
and potential. The total number of individuals included is 2.695 million, representing 25
percent of the total population in Greece in 2011, and 46 percent of the population of
working age.

“Activation need” describes a group’s need for inclusion in the labor market to achieve
income and dampen or end poverty. “Activation potential” describes that group’s ability or
motivation to be included in the labor market again. A high activation potential could
indicate good qualifications and labor market experience (as in the case of the highly
educated early retirees) or previous work experience and high household-level incentives to
work (due to low employment) (as is the case of middle-aged unemployed heads of
households).

From this simple overview of need and potential, a clear set of prioritizations arises. The
groups highly educated single NEETs and middle-aged unemployed heads of households
emerge as the top priority target groups for potential activation measures. The latter
group is considered a particular priority due to its income situation and potential for
activation. While highly educated single NEETs largely rely on other household members as a
safety net, they are also considered a priority because their current unemployment status
and difficulty in acquiring work experience could have long-lasting societal consequences,

including negative effects on future employment outcomes and earnings for the economy as
a whole. Stay-at-home mothers represent the largest group among the out-of-work
population and are largely inactive, with the presence of a working member/partner
reducing their incentive to join the labor force. The presence of children also implies
caregiving responsibilities that may serve as a barrier to labor force participation. Because
activation is thus more difficult in an environment of labor-demand shortage, they are
considered second in line in terms of activation priorities.

Lastly, non-activation target groups in the current state (thus considered as priority C)
include retirees’ inactive wives, low-educated retirees, highly educated early retirees, and low-
educated, mostly rural disabled. As a whole, these groups will likely lack incentives to return
to work. Nonetheless, they have also grown in size over the last four years and the majority
of their members receive old age or disability benefits, resulting in fiscal pressures on the
pension system. Reducing the inflow of individuals into these groups is thus also a policy
priority for Greece.

When looking at these groups in greater detail, special consideration needs to be given to the
significant shares of early retirees in the groups of low-educated retirees and highly educated
early retirees. The highly educated early retirees pose an especially striking example, with 83
percent of them 45 to 59 years old. This effect is less pronounced for the low-educated
retirees, of whom 29 percent are in this age group. As discussed below, this pattern is a clear
cause for concern because significant numbers of potential workers have been allowed to
enter old-age benefit systems during their productive work years. While activating these
groups out of the retirement status will be difficult, special care needs to be taken to limit
further inflow into these groups.

Activation type. As a second step, the relative severity of labor market or social obstacles to
labor market integration will serve as an orientation for activation approaches of the
prioritized groups of stay-at-home mothers, highly educated single NEETs and middle-aged
unemployed heads of household.

By mapping the respective barriers for labor market integration faced by the three
prioritized groups, we can quickly discern the respective types of activation that could be
undertaken for them. The areas of activation are very broad and will need to be refined more
narrowly when considering individual or group-based intervention patterns for the different
groups. Whereas the middle-aged unemployed heads of households probably require more
“market-based” types of interventions because of their work experience, the highly educated
single NEETs will need more intensified labor market entry support, adding practical and
usable skills to their (often academic) education. Stay-at-home mothers require more social
support (for child care, care of other dependents, and so on) but can build on previous work
experience to gain labor market entry.

Household income composition. In the third step, planning and consideration of activation
approaches, an overview of the 2011 household income of the groups can be conducted. In
the first three groups (stay-at-home mothers, highly educated single NEETs and middle-aged
unemployed heads of households), labor income represents the majority of household income.
The situation reverses for the remaining four groups, with old-age and disability benefit
payments consistently contributing between 50 and 65 percent of household income.




                                                        Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 155
The striking feature of the receipt of benefits for groups four through seven is the high
prevalence of old-age benefits. In the group of the low-educated mostly rural disabled,
disability benefits come into play (representing 25 percent of total household income), but
for the retirees’ inactive wives, the low-educated retirees and the highly educated early
retirees, old-age benefits contribute to 51, 55 and 51 percent of household income
respectively. As briefly discussed before, this type of income will also fall to many of the
below-64 years of age members in these groups, and will in fact act as a disincentive to labor
market participation.

In the prioritized groups, old-age benefits play a significant role only for the households of
the highly educated single NEETs (representing close to one fourth of total household
income), implicitly suggesting the use of them as retirement income for older household
members (20 percent of this group live in households with at least one 64-plus aged
member). While this benefit income helps to stabilize household welfare, it can take away
from job search or work incentives for younger household members (the identified highly
educated single NEETs).

Lastly, it is striking that all other forms of benefits, that is, those not associated with old age
or disability, contribute an almost negligible proportion to the total household incomes of
the identified groups. This highlights the fact that social protection in Greece is largely
centered upon pensions, providing little protection in terms of unemployment insurance or
social assistance.
Suggestions for Activation Measures and Further Analysis

The following sections set out a short set of potential activation measures for each of the
priority groups. All of the suggestions below should be considered as a starting point for
further policy dialogue between EC DG EMPL, the World Bank and the Greek authorities,
bearing in mind that the groups identified still carry some heterogeneity that may affect the
level of support required. Accordingly, these suggestions are also not meant to be an
exhaustive set of possible activation measures.

It should also be kept in mind that the recommendations are based on clusters derived from
2011 EU-SILC data. Since then, policy actions by the government of Greece and the European
Commission’s country-specific recommendations” might have reflected some of these policy
suggestions or rendered them obsolete.

Highly educated single NEETs (18 percent, Priority: High). This group is characterized by
a relatively high education standard and lack of independence (most are still living at home).
The majority are unemployed, although a non-negligible 29 percent are inactive. Potential
activation measures for this group include the following:

       Assist in developing a qualification in a field related to the one studied, but promote
        technical or professional skills rather than further acquisition of academic
        qualifications.
       Support skill development through work experience for post-secondary or tertiary
        degree holders. Examples include internship and “second-chance” programs that
        enable youth to enhance and make use of analytical skills, while facilitating the
        transition between school and work.
       Support mobility within Greece and the EU (including foreign language training)
        that is aimed at placing highly qualified individuals.
       Enable participation in the intended public works program for the 45 percent of
        NEETs who only have an upper secondary education or below, or for the 40 percent
        who do not have at least one working adult in their household.

Middle-aged unemployed heads of households (18 percent, Priority: High). This group
represents probably the most traditional group of activation-policy clients, having formed
families and gained work experience, and having now lost their jobs in the crisis. Given the
lack of other income support, it is here that the threat to welfare is especially severe. As an
emergency backstop, this group will need to be made aware of its right to family benefits (by
entering a tax return and applying for the reformed family benefit). Their high poverty risk
also implies that members of this group might also participate in the planned public works
program, or apply for a yet-to-be-introduced minimum income benefit in 2015 or later.
When considering integration of this group with a new version of the public works program,
the public works engagements could be combined with short training seminars, job-search
clubs or seminar offerings for participants. Focusing these complimentary offerings on
participants with recent work experience will help to self-select “market-type” clients into
the offers. Potential activation measures for this group include the following:




                                                        Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 157
        OAED training measures (opening OAED-run vocational schools to adults and
         “second chance” candidates)
        “Job search club” group interventions for men from different professions
        Update of formal professional skills (certificates, new qualifications), including
         foreign language skills training aimed toward employment in the tourism industry
        Limited offer of self-employment training/startup support (making this highly
         selective of clients with a good chance for success)
        Mobility support within Greece and within the EU (including foreign language
         training)

Stay-at-home mothers (23 percent, Priority: Medium). This group presents a
heterogeneous picture and would most likely need further analysis through a more
qualitative approach. Activation should focus on the 50 percent of women in this group who
have previous work experience. The respective pathways of women who successfully
transitioned from inactivity to contingent breadwinner in response to partner job loss
during the crisis might yield clues as to activation strategies for other women in this cohort.
In general, potential activation measures could include:

        “Reconnection” programs to seek contact with previous employer, industry or
         colleagues and assess skill needs, availability, and so on for re-entry.
        “Family enterprise and self-employment” programs to explore self-employment or
         joint employment with other family members.
        “Job club for experienced women”: multi-session group activity for teaching job
         search skills, resume and job interview training, and so on.
        Provision of free or subsidized child care for mothers of young children, using a
         means-tested approach targeted toward low-income households and low-skilled
         women who engage in work or a job search.

Retirees’ inactive wives (17 percent, Priority: Low). This group is characterized by very
low activation needs and potential, due to their low education levels and close-to-retirement
age.

        Offer self-help portal on OAED website to assist in restarting their careers (but only
         opportunistically and without new resources).

Low-educated retirees (13 percent, Priority: Low). This group is also a low priority for
current activation-policy planning. Their retirement income is mostly sufficient to make any
public transfers beyond the pension payment nonessential.

Highly educated early retirees (7 percent, Priority: Low). Although their high educational
attainment and work experience drive up its activation potential, this group is also very
unlikely to have an interest in activation policies. Over 50 percent are in the richest
household income quintile and only 4 percent are in the bottom quintile.

Low-educated mostly rural disabled (5 percent, Priority: Low). While the welfare of this
group could certainly be enhanced by strengthening mobile and decentralized assistance
services to disabled citizens (67 percent report “severe limitations” on taking up

employment), the current focus on out-of-work groups does not mesh with the lack of
employment prospects for this group.

Retirees’ inactive wives (17 percent), low-educated retirees (13 percent), highly educated
early retirees (7 percent), and the low-educated mostly rural disabled (5 percent) are not
further considered for activation policies for the purposes of this study. Together, these
clusters together represent more than a third of the out-of-work and their absolute size has
been growing over time, with implications for fiscal expenditures. As mentioned above,
however, given their overall low need and potential for activation, these groups are not
considered a priority for activation during times of low labor demand and high
unemployment. Moreover, international experience shows that stemming the outflow of new
retirees and disability benefit recipients from work into inactivity may be more effective
than attempting to increase inflows into activity. 66 Stanching outflows is especially
important in times of high unemployment if long-term disability or early retirement have
become more attractive than work for the long-term unemployed. Policies can and should be
implemented to delay early retirement, including the promotion of skill maintenance and
lifelong learning, along with flexible work schedules and the ability to work from home.
Prevention of long-term disability benefit dependency should also be addressed through a
review of work capacity assessment, together with the early identification of people with
disabilities who can work and their integration into the workforce through financial
incentives for disabled workers and their employers. Greek authorities note that there is a
limited culture of workplace integration of disabled or (partly) incapacitated workers.
Setting out to change this would require a long-term and very difficult effort in the current
economic situation.

In summary, while each cluster of the out-of-work has particular characteristics that
need to be considered in the activation policy design, there are some overarching
policy options that could cater to several groups at once. All poor households or
individuals among the currently identified groups of out-of-work citizens are likely to
benefit from the Minimum Income Benefit program to be introduced in 2015 or later. The
program is being piloted in 2014, and will potentially be taken to a national scale in the
following years. LCA analysis has shown that the groups of out-of-work individuals most at
risk of falling into poverty are middle-aged unemployed heads of households (of which 56
percent don’t have another working adult in the household) and the low-educated mostly
rural disabled, whereas (early) retirees are in least need of social assistance.

In general, current and future policy discussions between the Government of Greece and
international partners could focus on a set of policy areas where potential activation
linkages can emerge. These include, but are not limited to:

           Emergency public works program. Responsible authorities ought to provide more
            details on the planned size, scope and target groups of the program. If possible, the
            targeting mechanism for enrollment in the program ought to focus on the group of
            middle-aged unemployed heads of households but should also be open to highly
            educated single NEETs and stay-at-home mothers. The inherent self-targeting

         mechanism (effort, stigma, crowding-out of informal employment) of a well-
         managed public works program will most likely help to focus program participation
         on the truly needy (bottom quintiles) among the identified inactive groups
        Reform of the public employment service (PES) and the unemployment
         insurance agency OAED. In 2011, Greece initiated a reform of its PES, supported by
         technical assistance from EU partner countries. Currently, OAED offers only limited
         activation support in form of active 1abor market programs and is focusing many of
         its resources on administering the unemployment insurance benefit, which is
         limited to one year (OECD 2013: 50). Work-streams 4 through 6 of the current
         OAED reform (“Active labor market measures design, adjusted to market needs”;
         “Service provision related to the needs of jobseekers”; and “Support of young
         apprentices”) can form a central piece of the activation response for the group of
         excluded and out-of-work identified in this note.
        Integration with employment demand generation and competitiveness
         policies. While active labor market policies, activation and job-matching support
         can help smooth frictions in the labor market, they will not lead to stable and
         sustainable employment. Demand for jobs comes from the economic activity of
         firms and the social sector. This integration with regional economic development
         policy is especially important and has been recognized by the authorities.

In summary, Greece could benefit from focusing activation policies on the target groups
identified, enhancing the opportunity for labor market inclusion and stabilizing welfare for
poor and inactive households.

                              of-Work Population in Hungary
                                                                              2007−2011
Background

Following the world financial crisis, Hungary’s economy underwent severe economic
contraction in 2009, and it has not fully recovered since then. Over the 2003–2008 period,
the Hungarian economy grew by an annual average of 2.9 percent, not too far from the 2.2
percent average among EU-28 Member States during this same period. And as in other
countries in the region, in 2009 the crisis hit hard and output contracted by 6.8 percent. By
the end of 2011 Hungary was one of the most financially vulnerable countries in Europe
outside the euro area (EEAG, 2012) and growth has not recovered yet, as GDP declined 1.7 in
2012 and grew 1.1 percent in 2013.

Unemployment started rising during the mid-2000s with a sharper increase in 2009,
following the fall in output. In 2003 and 2004, unemployment (for those between 15 and
64 years old) was slightly below 6 percent. From 2005 to 2008, it rose to an average of 7.5
percent. After the crisis hit the Hungarian economy in 2009, unemployment increased by 2.2
percentage points, reaching a high of 11.2 percent in 2010. It has remained steady at 11
percent till 2012, and fell to 10.3 percent in 2013. Unemployment in Hungary can be
considered moderate when compared to the average of 11 percent for the EU-28 countries
in 2013. And despite the fact that labor force participation is low by European standards—in
2013, the working age population in the EU-28 countries was on average 71.9 percentit
remained fairly constant during the crisis, at 61.6 percent in 2009. 67 By 2013, it had slightly
increased to 65.1 percent.

Young workers experienced a sharp rise in unemployment when compared to the
overall working-age population. In 2003 unemployment rates were 7.1 percentage points
higher for individuals aged 15 to 24 years old than for individuals aged 15 to 64. Youth were
clearly disproportionately affected by the increase in unemployment. In 2012, the gap in the
unemployment rates observed for these two groups reached 17.1 percentage points, when
youth unemployment reached 28.1 percent. In 2013 the gap fell to 16.9 as youth
unemployment fell slightly to 27.2 percent. The percentage of young individuals aged 15 to
24 that were not in employment, education, or training (the NEET rate) reached its lowest
level for the decade in 2007—11.3 percent. After a downward trend between 2003 and
2008, the NEET rate also increased, reaching 15.4 percent in 2013.

A look at unemployment rates disaggregated by age and gender shows that young men
were generally more affected by the crisis. As shown in Figure 6.1, the economic
downturn of 2009 also affected men the most, especially those in the 15-to-24-year-old


67   Prior to the crisis, the labor force participation rate in 2008 was 61.5 percent.

group, whose unemployment rate grew from 19 to 28 percent between 2008 and 2009,
representing an increase of 48 percent. In contrast, unemployment for women in this age
group only increased by 16 percent. Men aged 25 to 49 and 50 to 64 also experienced higher
proportional increases in unemployment than women in the same age group.

In Hungary, long-term unemployment as a share of total unemployment has usually
been higher than the average for the EU-15 countries. In 2010, it peaked at 49.3 percent
but has decreased again to the same level as in 2005, around 45 percent. Unfortunately, in
2013 the percentage of long-term unemployed increased once more, reaching 48.6 percent.
Even if there was no sharp increase in the share of long-term unemployment in the economy
during the decade (on average), there is still a concern due to the high share of individuals
that have been without a job for at least 12 months.

Following the crisis, low-educated individuals were especially affected by the rise in
unemployment. Unemployment rates were already increasing for the group of less-
educated individuals; after the crisis hit in 2009 this trend was rather accentuated. However,
all educational groups saw an increase in unemployment rates during the period from 2008
to 2013. For those with tertiary education, the unemployment rate increased 50 percent,
from 2.8 to 4.1. But the gap between the groups became bigger during the period, which
reflects structural changes that increased the demand for more skilled workers. The
difference in unemployment rates for low- and higher-educated workers grew from 16.1
percentage points in 2008 to 20.1 percentage points in 2013.

Overall employment levels remained relatively stable before and following the crisis,
slightly decreasing during the period for individuals in all educational levels.
Employment levels have decreased slightly for all educational levels, not only after the crisis
in 2009, but this trend had been in place since the mid-2000s. The educational composition
of the working-age population in Hungary, on the other hand, has changed during the last
decade. The share of the working-age population with less than an upper-secondary
education fell from 30.3 in 2003 to 22.6 percent in 2013, while the share with tertiary
education increased from 12.9 percent to 19.5 during the same period.

During the period from 2008 to 2011, the sample of the out-of-work population
considered in this note increased, from 2.25 to 2.28 million individuals. The analysis of
the out-of-work population in this note focuses on the working-age population (16–64 years
old). Specifically, only individuals aged 25 to 64 years who are not employed, and individuals
aged 16 to 24 who were neither employed nor in education nor training were considered. 68

Only the working-age population (16–64 year olds) is analyzed, as labor activation options—
the main policy focus of this note—are only viable for that segment of the population. As a
percentage of the population of working age under analysis, the out-of-work population rose
from 37 percent to 38.1 percent. The two groups of the out-of-work population that became
smaller during this period were the groups of disabled and other inactive, which decreased
in size by 32 and 23 percent, respectively. On the other hand, the groups of (short-term)
unemployed, long-term unemployed and (early) retired grew by 99, 58 and 14 percent,
respectively (see Table 6.1). Figure 6.3 shows the composition of the out-of-work population
in Hungary in 2008 and 2011.

therefore are not a particular target group for activation policies. In 2011, there were 741,817 youth
aged 16 to 24 who were out of work and enrolled in education, representing 62 percent of the total
population in this age category and 25 percent of the total out-of-work population of working age.
Individuals between 25 and 64 who are enrolled in school are included in the latent class analysis, and
will be grouped under “other inactive.” It is important to note that this group of students (older than
24) accounts for only 1 percent of total population of working age.

Box 6.1 Retirement-Income Systems in Hungary

The following provides details about some recent changes in the retirement system in
Hungary.

Old-age pensions

In Hungary, the retirement age was equalized at 62 for both men and women (from 60 and
55, respectively). The age for men reached 62 in 2000; for women, it occurred in the
beginning of 2009. After 2010, the statutory unisex retirement age is being increased
gradually, reaching 65 by 2022.

In addition, 20 years of service are required for both the earnings-related pension and the
minimum pension. Fifteen years of service are required to receive a partial pension.

The pension payment has been indexed, half to wages and half to prices, since 2001, but
further ad hoc increases were applied. As of 2010 indexation will be linked to GDP growth.

From 2006 to 2009, all pensioners received an additional month’s (13th-month) pension. In
January 1, 2009, the rules on eligibility to 13th month pension changed. As of 2010, the 13th
month pension was totally abolished.

Early retirement:

In 2008, early retirement was possible for men at age 60 and for women at age 57 without
actuarial reduction. When pension ages were equalized at 62 in 2009, early retirement
became available at 59 for women and 60 for men. According to newly adopted legislation,
the retirement age will gradually increase to 65 years. And, as of 2010, advanced pension
rules were also tightened along with the increase in standard retirement age.

Unemployment:

Older unemployed people can receive special pre-retirement benefits if they have received
unemployment insurance benefits for 140 days, will reach pensionable age within five years,
have exhausted their unemployment benefit entitlement within eight years of pensionable
age, and have contributed to the pension scheme for at least 20 years.

Box 6.2 Child Benefit Systems in Hungary

The following provides details about some recent changes occurring in other benefits such
as maternity leave.

Child care:

People can take the following benefits: pregnancy confinement, child care fee, child care
allowance and child-raising support.

The pregnancy confinement benefit is for women who are pregnant or giving birth, for 24
weeks (168 days). The benefit is 70 percent of the daily average gross earnings of the
previous year.

The child care fee may be claimed by one parent the day after the pregnancy confinement
benefit expires. The entitlement runs to the second birthday of the child (maximum 24
months). The benefit amount is 70 percent of the daily average gross earnings of the
previous year, up to a maximum of twice the minimum wage.

The child-care allowance is for a parent who cares for the child until the child’s third
birthday (maximum 36 months); or in the case of twin children, until the end of the year
they reach school age; or in the case of a permanently ill or seriously disabled child, until the
child is ten years of age (maximum 120 months). The monthly amount is equal to the
minimum old-age pension, irrespective of the number of children in the family; and in the
case of twins, the amount is twice the minimum old-age pension. After a child’s first
birthday, a grandparent may claim the benefit.

period between the third and eighth birthday of the youngest child (maximum 60 months).

Methodology: Latent Class Analysis

In Chapter 1 a general overview of the latent class analysis methodology was laid out. This
section explains in detail the variables and covariates used to identify classes or groups of
out-of-work individuals that are as homogeneous as possible within each class according to a
set of observable characteristics, and as distant as possible between classes. The emerging
profiles can then be contrasted with the design and targeting of current activation policies,
in order to identify the potential gaps and to enhance their design features.69

Variable selection: The definition of latent classes relies on a number of indicator variables
to capture different “symptoms” of an overall latent condition (in this case, the typology of
joblessness). The challenge in such models is to identify a discrete number of variables that
can best explain the heterogeneity of individual outcomes. In this case, two sets of
categorical variables were selected: the first set to show the extent of labor market distance
and the other to capture some of the main factors that can affect employment on the supply
side, such as labor supply conditions (household-level incentives to work and physical
ability to work).

      Distance from labor market: short-term unemployment, long-term
       unemployment, (early) retirement, disability, and other inactivity (largely unpaid
       domestic work).70
      Work experience: if individual has worked before and, in this case, whether he or
       she worked for two or more months in the last year.
      Labor supply conditions: whether the individual’s household has at least one
       working adult,71 and perceived limitations on activities due to health problems.72

In addition to indicators, the model includes active covariates, which are used to improve the
classification of individuals in each class. In this case the active covariates are the
demographic variables that are normally used to disaggregate labor market outcomes:

         Age-group category (four groups)
         Gender
         Human capital: the highest educational level achieved (three groups)
         Urban/rural location

Once the latent classes have been defined, inactive covariates that were not included in the
model can be used to characterize the individuals in each class and the households in which
they live. The inactive covariates chosen describe those characteristics that may provide



69 For the latest developments on active inclusion in Hungary, see EC (2013b).
70 This  variable is constructed using the self-reported current work status in the EU-SILC survey that
has four categories: at work, unemployed, retired and inactive. The unemployed are further classified
into short- and long-term based on how long they have been actively looking for a job. The inactive is
combined with another question to separate this group into students, disabled, military and other
inactive. In the case of Hungary, the retired category also includes disabled.
71 In order to construct this variable, individuals aged 25 or older are considered adults.
72 This is a binary variable that takes the value one if an individual answered “yes, strong limitations” to

whether they had been hampered in their usual activities because of health problems for at least the
last six months. The value is zero if the answer is “yes, limited” or “no, not limited.”

valuable information for the design of tailored policies that address barriers to employment,
including income level. They include:

        Household welfare conditions:
             • Income quintile (defined by equivalized disposable household income73, 74)
             • Labor, benefit, and other income as share of total gross household income75
             • Working status of the partner
             • Household ability to keep dwelling warm
             • Partner’s labor income
             • Quintile of partner’s labor income
             • Tenure status
             • Binary variables denoting whether individuals or their households are
                 beneficiaries of any of eight social protection benefits76
             • Share of benefits over the total household gross income
        Household demographics:
             • Household size
             • Household composition
             • Binary variable showing whether there are children under 6 in the
                 household
             • Binary variable denoting whether there are three or more under-16
                 children in the household
             • Children under 13 receiving child care in the household: all, some or no
                 children under 13 present
             • Older person (65 and over) in the household
             • Presence of individual’s parents in the household
        Other individual-level demographics:
             • More refined age groups (eight groups)
             • Marital status
        Individual human capital:
             • More refined highest educational level achieved (six groups)
             • Work experience in years

        Household location:

73 The equivalized household income takes into account an equivalence factor to weight the number of
household members used in the denominator when calculating household income per capita. The first
adult aged 18 or over has a weight of 1.0, children under 14 have a weight of 0.3, and other individuals
14 and older have a weight of 0.5. The sum of the weights of all household members is equal to the
equivalent household size.
74 Note that income reported in EU-SILC surveys is for the year preceding the survey year.
75 Total household gross income is defined as the sum of: (at the individual level) gross employee cash

or near-cash income; company car, gross cash benefits or losses from self-employment (including
royalties); unemployment benefits; old-age benefits; survivor benefits; sickness benefits; disability
benefits; education allowances; and (at the household level) income from rental of property or land;
family/children related allowances; social exclusion not elsewhere classified; housing allowances;
regular inter-household cash transfers received; interests, dividends, profit from capital investments in
unincorporated business; pensions from individual private plans; and income received by people
under 16. Total household net income, in turn, was calculated by subtracting from total household
gross income regular taxes on wealth, taxes on income and social insurance contributions, and regular
inter-household case transfers paid.
76 Social benefits are aggregated in eight branches using the European System of integrated Social

PROtection Statistics (ESSPROS) definitions. For more information, see Eurostat (2011).

Group labeling. The resulting groups are then labeled according to the greatest
proportional characteristics within groups that also aid in distinguishing among groups.
Granted, a large number of characteristics describe these groups, and only a few are taken
into account for the purpose of labeling. In part, some of these characteristics may exhibit a
large degree of heterogeneity and may thus not be relevant for defining a group.
Additionally, some characteristics may be more relevant for the purposes of policy design
than others. In short, though the labeling of groups can be considered more an art than a
science, when taken together with detailed descriptions of a group’s most prominent
characteristics, labeling can serve as an important starting point in the design and
prioritization of activation policies.

The analysis relies on cross-sectional as well as panel data from the European Union
Statistics of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) surveys for 2008–2011, which combine
individual-level information with household characteristics. The first part of the note
presents a cross-sectional analysis for the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. In particular,
the latent class analysis on 2008 data shows the main characteristics of the out-of-work
before the global economic crisis hit Hungary, and thus highlight what could be considered
more structural issues of the country’s labor market. The 2011 latent class analysis will
contrast this initial assessment with more recent developments. The second part of the note
exploits longitudinal data between 2008 and 201078 to trace the prior labor market status of
individuals observed last in 2010 in various classes, and will shed light on the relative
persistence in the out-of-work status among different classes of individuals. The set of
variables chosen for the cross-section and the longitudinal analysis are slightly different, due
to minor differences in the set of variables recorded in each of the two types of datasets.




77 According to EU-SILC guidelines, dense areas have more than 500 inhabitants per square kilometer,

where the total population for the set is at least 50,000 inhabitants. Intermediate areas have more than
100 inhabitants per square kilometer, and either a total population for the set of at least 50,000
inhabitants or a location adjacent to a dense area. The remaining areas are categorized as sparsely
populated.
78 The EU-SILC longitudinal survey consists of a four-year rotating panel. In each year, approximately

three-quarters of individuals present in the previous year are retained. The samples used in the latent
class analysis include about 6,000 observations for each year in the cross-sectional analysis and 1,150
observations in the longitudinal analysis. The population is weighted with individual weights.

Main Findings

Out-of-Work Population: Group Profiles from Cross-Section Analysis

The latent class analysis supports the classification of the out-of-work into ten major groups,
some of which have remained stable over time. The groups were named according to their
most salient characteristics. Figure 6.4 shows the shares of each of the ten classes identified
for the year 2011 while Table 6.2 presents their most salient characteristics.

Note: Percentages in parentheses following the group names refer to the share of the total out-of-work
population. “Years of work experience” refer only to those individuals who have worked before.
“Dependent children” include children under 18 and household members aged 18 to 24 who are
economically inactive and living with at least one parent. “Working adult” refers to adults aged 25 and
over. For this report’s purposes, we define the at-risk-of-poverty rate as the relative risk of being in the
first quintile of the income distribution. The reference period for income reported in EU-SILC surveys is the
year preceding the survey year.


The ten main groups emerging from the LCA analysis in 2011 can be characterized as follows
(see Annex 2 for more detail, including the full list of inactive covariates):

           Cluster 1: Disabled with previous work experience. This group, representing
            almost one fifth of our sample of out-of-work in 2011, reports its economic status as
            disabled and most of them (89 percent) receives disability benefits79, despite the
            fact that only 35 percent report strong physical limitations on their ability to work.
            A majority (63 percent) live in rural areas. It is likely that many in this group could
            be work-ready: most has worked before, with 25 years of work experience on
            average, and educational attainment is in the low to mid-range: 37 percent have not
            completed upper secondary, while 58 percent have complete upper secondary or
            post-secondary. The group is equal parts men and women and most (78 percent)
            are between 45 and 59 years of age. Just over half do not report at least one adult
            working in the household, and overall benefits amount to 64 percent of total gross
            household income.80 Their risk of poverty81 is high, with 36 percent living in the first
            income quintile.



79 It should be kept in mind that the EU-SILC activity status is self-reported; therefore the disabled

population count may not be accurate when compared with administrative data.
80 Disability benefits amount to 38 percent of total gross household income.
81 Risk of poverty is here understood as the relative probability of living in the poorest income quintile.

By definition, 20 percent of the population lives in this quintile; risk is thus gauged relative to a
benchmark of 20 percent.

   Cluster 2: Mostly male early retirees and retirees. This group represented 15
    percent of the out-of-work population in 2011. It comprises mostly men (62
    percent), and all of its members are retired, with 90 percent receiving old-age
    benefits. A slim majority (57 percent) are 60 to 64 years old, meaning that they are
    likely to have reached the retirement age of 62. The remaining 43 percent can be
    considered early retired, of which the majority are in the 55- to 59-age range.
    Because they are retired, this group’s members all have work experience, but only 9
    percent report having worked for two or more months during the last year. They are
    low to mid-skilled: almost one-third have not completed upper secondary school;
    the majority (59 percent) have completed upper or post-secondary education. Just
    over one-half do not report any working adults in the household. The benefit levels
    received by this group and their households appear to be generous: benefits
    represent 67 percent of total gross household income, and only 13 percent of
    households are in the poorest income quintile.
   Cluster 3: Urban retired women. Like cluster 2 (mostly male early retirees and
    retirees), this group of retirees represented 15 percent of the out-of-work sample in
    2011. In contrast to that group, however, nearly all the retirees in this group have
    reached retirement age, as 96 percent are 60 to 64 years old. They are also
    predominantly female (80 percent) and mostly live in urban areas (64 percent).
    Another characteristic that distinguishes them from cluster 2 is that 79 percent do
    not have any working adults in their households. As such, total benefits represent 83
    percent of gross household income, the highest share among all identified groups.
    Benefits also appear to be sufficiently generous, as only 12 percent of this group
    lives among the poorest quintile.
   Cluster 4: Prime-aged unemployed. This group made up 14 percent of the out-of-
    work in 2011. Its members are newly unemployed individuals who worked for two
    or more months during the last year, and who, on average, have 16 years of work
    experience. They are mostly men (60 percent) in their prime age and are
    concentrated in rural areas (59 percent). Over one-third have not completed upper
    secondary school, and 59 percent have completed upper or post-secondary studies,
    making this a low-to-mid skilled group. Half of this group live in households with
    dependent children. One-half also receive family/child benefits, and a small majority
    receive unemployment benefits. One-half of the group’s members (55 percent) do
    not have any working adults in the household, and over all, benefits make up just
    over a third of their total household income. The group has a very high risk of
    poverty, as 49 percent live in the poorest quintile.
   Cluster 5: Prime-aged inactive mothers with work experience. This group of
    prime-aged (25 to 54) women represented 13 percent of the out-of-work in 2011.
    Given that 91 percent live in households with dependent children (72 percent live in
    households with children under six), and that, for the most part, these inactive
    women have working partners, they are likely to be stay-at-home mothers.
    However, their work experience and relatively high educational attainment24
    percent of them have completed a tertiary degreemake the members of this group
    labor- market ready. Ninety-two percent receive family-child benefits, and, on
    average, total household benefits represent 40 percent of gross household income.
    Perhaps due to a relatively large average household size of 4.2 members, this group
    has a high risk of poverty, with 32 percent in the poorest income quintile.

        Cluster 6: Prime-aged long-term unemployed. This group represented 12 percent
         of the out-of-work in 2011 and resembles the larger group of prime-aged
         unemployed. Like its newly unemployed counterparts, the long-term unemployed
         members of this group comprise mostly men (57 percent) who for the most part are
         in their prime (25 to 54). This group, however, is somewhat skewed toward older
         individuals, and a non-negligible 18 percent are 54 to 59 years old. Furthermore, the
         group is less rural, with a 50/50 urban/rural split, and a slightly larger majority (59
         percent) of households are without any working adults. However, the educational
         attainment of this group is very similar, with 36 percent having not completed an
         upper secondary education and 59 percent having completed upper or post-
         secondary school. The members of this group are just as likely as the larger group to
         have dependent children in their households (50 percent), as well as to receive
         family/child benefits. Interestingly, they are only marginally less likely to receive
         unemployment benefits (49 percent), despite the fact that they have been
         unemployed for at least 12 months. Again, total household benefits make up a very
         similar percentage of total household income (57 percent). Nonetheless, despite
         having slightly smaller households (3.4 members, versus 3.5 for their newly
         unemployed counterparts) this group is more likely to be living in poverty. With 65
         percent in the poorest quintile, this group has the second highest risk of poverty
         among the ten identified groups.
        Cluster 7: Unemployed youth. Making up just 4 percent of the out-of-work in 2011,
         this group comprises both long-term and newly unemployed youth aged 16 to 24
         and resembles the unemployed youth who have been largely affected by the crisis in
         Europe. Owing to their young age, this group has very little work experience, with
         only 18 percent having worked before. They are for the most part mid-skilled, as 66
         percent have completed upper or post-secondary education. More than half are also
         in households that receive family/child benefits and one-fifth receive
         unemployment benefits. Despite the fact that these never-married individuals are
         still living in their birth households 78 percent of which have at least one working
         adultthey remain at a high risk for poverty: 44 percent live in the poorest income
         quintile. With benefits making up 33 percent of total household income, their
         benefit dependence is low in comparison to most other groups.
        Cluster 8: Low-educated rural inactive mothers without work experience. This
         group, amounting to about 4 percent of the out-of-work population in 2011, is
         composed of relatively young, inactive women (16 to 34 years old) living in rural
         areas. They are likely to be mothers, as 88 percent live in households with
         dependent children (62 percent with children under six). In contrast to the larger
         group of prime-aged inactive mothers with work experience, this group has lower
         prospects for labor market insertion, as they do not have previous work experience
         and have low educational attainment, with the great majority (78 percent) not
         finishing upper secondary school. Another distinguishing feature of this group is
         that the majority (62 percent) has never been married and just over half do not have
         a working adult in their households. Like their counterparts with work experience,
         the great majority receive family/child benefits. However, 29 percent also receive
         social exclusion benefits and 38 percent receive housing allowances, perhaps
         reflecting their lower socioeconomic status. Benefits make up more than half (57

    percent) of household income. Nonetheless, this group has the highest risk of
    poverty among the ten identified groups: 77 percent live in the poorest quintile.
   Cluster 9: Educated single students. This group only amounted to 2 percent of the
    out-of-work in 2011 and comprises students (81 percent) who are aged 25 to 29 (91
    percent). This group is the most educated of the ten, with close to one-third having
    completed tertiary education; an additional 68 percent have completed upper or
    secondary education. Despite being over 24 years of age, the members of this group
    have never worked before. Like the unemployed youth, they have also never married
    and for the most part are still living with their parents, in households that
    predominantly have at least one working adult. However, unlike their unemployed
    youth counterparts, they tend to live in urban areas, where educational
    opportunities are likely to be more abundant. Twenty-three percent of them receive
    an educational allowance, and benefits make up 22 percent of total gross income,
    the lowest share among all groups. With 23 percent in the poorest income group,
    this group has a moderate risk of poverty.
   Cluster 10: Low-educated disabled without work experience. Like the group of
    young students, this group represented only 2 percent of the out-of-work in 2011.
    Its members report their labor market status as disabled, but unlike the larger
    group of disabled (disabled with previous work experience), none have ever worked
    before and most (67 percent) report that their capacity to work is strongly limited.
    Nonetheless, the percentage that reports receiving disability benefits (74 percent) is
    lower than that of the disabled with previous work experience (89 percent). Just over
    half are women, and their ages span a larger range, with 80 percent between 20 and
    54 years of age. Likely due to their disability status, their educational attainment is
    low: 15 percent have never attended school, 22 percent have never finished primary
    school, and another 38 percent have never finished lower secondary. Another
    characteristic that distinguishes this group from their disabled counterparts with
    work experience is that they have never married and are still living with their
    parents. Just over half report having at least one working adult in their households,
    and benefit dependency is high: 71 percent of total gross household income is
    composed of benefits, second only to the group of urban retired women. This group
    is also at a high risk for poverty, as 46 percent of them live among the poorest
    quintile.

Although a small number of the identified classes of the out-of-work population have
been quite stable over the last few years, most of the identified classes experienced
changes in their composition and also in the share they represent among the out-of-
work. In Table 6.5, clusters are compared over time between 2008 and 2011 as a share of
the total out-of-work population, while Figure 6.5 shows the absolute numbers. From the
graph, the first important observation is that the size of the out-of-work population has just
slightly increased—by 1 percentbetween 2008 and 2011. However, some clusters have
changed across time; for example, clusters identified in 2011 that were present in previous
years underwent changes in relative size and also in composition. The fact that the
composition of the groups changes over time is particularly important to keep in mind when
interpreting changes in group size. For instance, significant increases (decreases) in group
size are sometimes due to reassignments of individuals across groups, resulting in changes
in group composition. Thus, although some groups may retain similar names across years
due to their most salient characteristics, they may nonetheless vary in their composition
across years. The evolution in terms of group size and group composition over the 2008–
2011 period can be summarized as follows:

           The composition of the group of disabled with previous work experience
            has been quite stable over time, but its relative and absolute size has
            decreased. The share of this cluster in the out-of-work population was 29
            percent in 2008. In 2011, it reached 19 percent (although it was still the largest
            cluster). This represented an approximate 33 percent decline in absolute
            numbers. More than 90 percent of the individuals in this cluster reported being
            disabled and around 35 percent of them claimed to have a strong limitation on
            work capacity due to their health. Indeed, 84 and 89 percent of them were
            receiving disability benefits in 2008 and 2011, respectively. Among the
            characteristics that have been quite stable, more than 80 percent are between
            35 and 59 years old, around 40 percent live in urban areas and a minimum of 60
            percent have at least an upper secondary education.
           The early retirees and retirees were a single group from 2008 to 2009. In
            2011, retirees were classified as either mostly male early retirees and
            retirees or urban retired women. Taken together, they represent an
            absolute size increase of 11 percent when compared to the original group
            in 2008. The cluster of early retirees and retirees changed in size and
            composition over time. In 2011, it was called mostly male early retirees and
            retirees because the female share fell from 62 percent in 2008 to only 38
            percent in 2011. This group also became less urban—the share of individuals
            living in urban areas fell from 59 to 46 percent over the period. It also became
            relatively younger—in 2008, 28 and 70 percent were 45 to 59 and 60 to 64
            years old, respectively; in 2011 these shares changed to 39 and 57 percent.
            Despite those differences in composition over time, around 90 percent of the
            individuals in this cluster are receiving old-age benefits and have on average
            more than 35 years of work experience.
           In its turn, the cluster of urban retired women—which appeared as a
            separate group beginning in 2009—became more urban, female and

    older. From being 18 percent of the out-of-work population in 2009, this
    cluster lost almost 50,000 individuals, reducing its share to 15 percent in 2011.
    Not only has its size changed, but individuals classified in this cluster became
    older—in 2011, 96 percent of them were between 60 and 64 years old, against
    76 percent in 2009the share of women increased from 68 to 80 percent
    during the same period, and they are more likely to be living in urban areas than
    before.
   One important change observed is the increase in unemployment among
    prime-aged individuals. Two clusters of prime-aged unemployed were
    identified in all the years, one of newly unemployed and the other representing
    those who have been unemployed for more than 12 months. Regardless of the
    year of analysis, the group of long-term unemployed comprises older
    individuals who are also more likely to be living in poverty. And from 2008 to
    2011, both of these clusters increased in size. The prime-aged unemployed faced
    an increase of 37 percent during this period, while the prime-aged long-term
    unemployed grew around 35 percent. However, not only did these clusters
    increase in size, but the composition of their members’ labor market status
    changed. Among the prime-aged unemployed, the share of individuals who
    reported being inactive fell from 31 to 3 percent, while the share of unemployed
    grew from 64 to 97 percent. Among the prime-aged long-term unemployed the
    share of inactive fell from 27 to 14 percent, while the share of long-term
    unemployed increased from 70 to 86 percent.
   Across time, different clusters of young individuals were found. It can be
    noticed that they have become relatively more likely to be unemployed
    and less likely to be inactive. Until 2009, 8 percent of the out-of-work
    population was represented by the low-educated inactive young women without
    work experience, but in the next years the composition of the clusters of younger
    individuals would become more defined and new clusters could be identified.
    Indeed, in 2010, this cluster of inactive young women itself represented a
    higher percentage of females, increasing from 69 to 81 percent of the total. In
    2011, this cluster was replaced by the low-educated rural inactive mothers
    without work experience. Women represented 90 percent of this group, whose
    members were more likely to be living in rural areas. Sixty-three percent had a
    partner (regardless of marital status). This group was also less likely to report
    living with parents in the same household, and was less educated (78 percent
    had completed up to lower secondary education). In 2010, the cluster of
    unemployed youth appeared, representing 3 percent of the out-of-work
    population. In 2011, more than 20,000 young individuals were added to this
    cluster, an increase of more than 30 percent. So, in the last year analyzed, three
    clusters of young individuals were identified: unemployed youth (4 percent),
    low-educated rural inactive mothers without work experience (4 percent) and
    educated single youth (2 percent). Even accounting for the presence of inactive
    youth in the cluster of unemployed and for the unemployed youth in the cluster
    of inactive, the percentage of young individuals that were classified as
    unemployed increased from 25 percent to 44 percent from 2008 to 2011. In
    addition, the absolute size of these youth clusters has become 22 percent larger
    during this same period.

             Finally, the prime-aged inactive mothers with work experience and the low-
              educated disabled without work experience clusters remained most stable
              during the period in analysis, both in size and composition. The cluster of
              inactive mothers with work experience represented around 13 percent of the
              out-of-work individuals between 2008 and 2011, which in absolute numbers
              accounted for a slight decrease of 7 percent in its size—a reduction of around
              23,000 people. Not only has its share been maintained, its composition also has
              not experienced considerable changes. For the group of disabled without work
              experience, which represented only 2 percent of the out-of-work population
              during these four years, characteristics have only changed slightly. This group
              reported an increase in the share of people with a strong limitation on ability to
              work, from 61 to 67 percent; its members became more likely to be living in
              urban areas—from 37 percent in 2008 to 47 percent in 2011and the share of
              women also rose, from 41 to 52 percent.

Structural Aspects and Emerging Trends in the Profiles of the Out-of -Work

The clusters identified in the out-of-work population for the period from 2008 to 2011
reflect both structural and cyclical aspects of the labor market. This section identifies some
of the key structural aspects of the Hungarian labor market and uses cross-sectional and
longitudinal analysis of clusters of the out-of-work population to further examine the effects
of the crisis.

The youth labor force participation rate in Hungary was the second lowest in Europe
in 2013. Since 2007, Hungary’s NEET rate has increased, reaching 15.4 percent in 2013. The
youth labor force participation rate, at only 27.2 percent in 2013, is the second lowest
among the countries in the region (Figure 6.6), and pales in comparison to the EU average of
42.2 percent. Two aspects might account for the low activity rate among the youth. In many
EU countries, youth have higher labor force participation rates partly because they are able
to combine their studies with part-time work. For example, as many as 75 percent and 40
percent of youth in the Netherlands and Slovenia, respectively, reported working part-time
(Dimitrov and Duell, 2013). However, in 2013, only about 10 percent of the youth in
Hungary (15 to 24 years old) reported working part-time (Eurostat). Also, the labor tax
wedge82 is one of the highest in the European Union (Figure 6.7). Lower take-home wages
reduce labor supply at the extensive margin, primarily for younger and older workers
(EEAG, 2012).

Low participation rates among the older working-age population in Hungary can be
explained by changes in both the demand for and supply of labor in the economy. The
transition to a market economy and privatization schemes that led to increased competition
among firms generated the restructuring and reallocation of resources in the economy.
There was a decline in employment, particularly in the agricultural and industrial sectors,
and a shift in the labor demand toward more skilled workers. From the supply side, a
relatively low retirement age83 and the possibility of retiring earlier than the legal age with
little or no penalty in terms of a lower pension, also contributes to explaining the low
participation rates observed among older workers (EEAG, 2012).

Retired and disabled individuals make up more than half of the out-of-work
population analyzed in this note. In the working-age sample used in this analysis, three
clusters of retirees or disabled individuals with previous work experience emerge,
representing almost half of the out-of-work population—or more than 50 percent if we
consider a small group of disabled without work experience. However, about half of them
are under the age of 60; in other words, they are under the legal retirement age. If we
consider the two main clusters found—and exclude the cluster of urban retired women—this
share reaches almost 70 percent. In the cluster of disabled with previous work experience,

83   The legal retirement age is 62 for both men and women.

which represents almost one fifth of the out-of-work sample analyzed, 88 percent are
between 35 and 59 years old, and 35 percent of them reported being strongly limited in
work capacity due to a health condition. The second cluster—mostly male early retirees and
retirees—represents 15 percent of the out-of-work population sample; 43 percent of the
individuals in this group are between ages 35 and 59.

Labor force participation rates for older people are among the lowest in Europe. In
2013, Hungary showed a labor force participation rate of only 63.5 percent among the group
of people aged 55 to 59 years old (Figure 6.8). In the case of individuals 55 to 64 years old,
rates are only 41.7 percent, much lower than the EU-28 average of 54.3 percent.
Nevertheless, this difference has been decreasing over time, since in 2008 activity rates were
only 33 and 48 percent in Hungary and the EU-28, respectively. Figure 6.9 shows that for
other European countries, expenditures on old-age pensions as a share of the GDP have been
increasing. As the working-age population shrinks and life expectancy rises, raising the
retirement age and increasing labor force participation among older individuals may
counteract a shrinking workforce and rising old-age benefit outlays.

Inactive women account for 17 percent of the out-of-work population, and 84 percent
of them are in their prime age. High inactivity rates are an issue in Hungary, and this is no
different for women of working age. Labor force participation rates for women between 15
and 64 years old have increased 3 points, from around 56 percent since before the crisis.
Data from Eurostat show that in Hungary the percentage of children with access to formal
child care is one of the lowest among European countries (Figure 6.10). Indeed, in
comparison to the average in the EU-28, in Hungary the percentage of women who report
being inactive because they are looking after children or incapacitated adults is 11 and 18
percentage points higher, for the groups of inactive women aged 15 to 39 and 25 to 49 years
old, respectively (Figure 6.11).

Out-of-Work Population: Group Profiles from Longitudinal Analysis

In order to better understand the dynamics within clusters and other labor market
movements, latent class analysis was also applied to longitudinal EU-SILC data for the period
2008–2010. The EU-SILC survey allows the tracking of individuals in both 2008 and 2010,
albeit with a smaller sample size than that available in the cross-section surveys. The latent
class analysis of the out-of-work population in 2010 yielded similar results in terms of
clusters, although due to the reduced sample size, the number of clusters was also smaller.
For a sample of around 1,150 observations, six classes were defined:

         Mostly rural retired and disabled with previous work experience (28 percent)
         Retirees (25 percent)
         Middle-aged unemployed (17 percent)
         Prime-aged inactive mothers with work experience (16 percent)
         Inactive young single women without work experience (8 percent)
         Unemployed rural single young men (6 percent)

Annex 3 shows the full statistical description of the latent classes, while Table 6.6 below
summarizes the key features of each cluster.

Note: Percentages in parentheses following the group names refer to the share of the total out-of-work
population. “Years of work experience” refers only to those individuals who have worked before.
“Dependent children” includes children under 18 and household members aged 18 to 24 who are
economically inactive and living with at least one parent. “Working adult” refers to adults aged 24 and
over.


A further advantage of the panel analysis is to provide information on the flow of individuals
among clusters and in and out of employment. Table 6.7 shows the flow of individuals into
each cluster of the out-of-work population or into employment in 2010 according to their
labor market status in 2008. Between 2008 and 2010, 85 percent of the employed remained

at work. Indeed, there is also an interesting flow into employment among those who were
unemployed or inactive in 2008. In 2010, 41 percent of those who were classified as
unemployed and 53 percent who were classified as inactive in 2008 were found to be
employed. In other words, more than half of the inactive individuals in 2008 were reported
as employed in 2010. An additional 15 percent of those inactive in 2008 moved to a cluster
of unemployed individuals in 2010, meaning that around 68 percent left inactivity.

On the other hand, Table 6.8 shows the labor market status in 2008 for each cluster and at-
work population in 2010. Three main results emerge from the dynamics presented. First, for
the cluster of middle-aged unemployed, 50 percent were employed in 2008, which makes
them the most affected by employment losses. Second, the group of prime-aged inactive
mothers with work experience was the second most likely to have been employed in 2008.
This may be reflecting incentives for women of child-bearing age to drop out of the labor
force. Finally, 71 percent of the individuals in the group of unemployed rural single young
men were inactive in 2008, a reflection of the fact that youth tend to be new to the labor
market and lack work experience (in contrast, only 21 percent of the middle-aged
unemployed were inactive in 2008).

From Profiling to Activation

Activation and Inclusion Policies in Hungary

Active labor market policies (ALMPs) are not a strategy per se in Hungary, but their elements
are integrated into national policy making and should be further enhanced. The Hungarian
employment level is low when compared to other European countries. The main challenge
has been to increase the labor market participation of specific disadvantaged groups, such as
low-skilled, older workers, young career starters, women with small children and the
disabled (EU, 2013). Therefore, several reforms have been introduced in order to make work
attractive to the inactive and promote employment.

In 2011, expenditures on labor market policies (LMPs) in Hungary corresponded to 70
percent of the total for the OECD countries, and unemployment and early retirement benefits
accounted for more than half of these expenditures. Figure 6.12 shows the spending on
different LMPs as a share of GDP in Hungary and compared to OECD countries (in 2011).
From 2008 and 2010, there was an increase of 112 percent in the amount spent on ALMPs as
a share of GDP. Unemployment and early retirement benefit values rose by 95 percent in the
same period. And, while ALMPs represented around one-third of the total LMPs in 2011,
unemployment and early retirement benefits accounted for 65 percent, an increase in
comparison with a share of 51 percent in 2008.

disability schemes and a widespread use of early retirement options, reforms affecting the
pension, disability and social benefit systems were introduced. The value of benefits is
decreasing while the criteria for accessing them has become stricter and more work-
oriented (EC, 2013). Furthermore, in order to activate those capable of work, some measures
listed in the Hungarian Work Plan include:

        Strengthen ALMPs, reinforcing services and supports available to job-seekers;
        Increase labor market flexibility through the promotion of flexible forms of
         employment and flexible workplaces, ease return of young parents and support
         companies in adjusting working hours for flexibility;
        Continue targeted tax allowance for employers who employ young career starters,
         and support their acquisition of work experience;
        Modernize the education and training system to improve the skills of the labor
         force;
        Strengthen the social economy and social cooperatives;
        Promote public works.

Public work became an important activation measure in 2009 with the launch of the
“Pathway to work” program. The idea was to assist those capable of work to find some
form of public employment, reducing the duration of unemployment and breaking long-term
benefit dependency, while making easier for them to find a job on the open labor market
through the improvement in their skills. Figure 6.13 shows the composition of spending on
ALMPs in Hungary and how direct job creation was almost two times more expensive than
employment incentives and training together. Indeed, among different labor market policy
measures available, the share of participants in training activities, for example, is one of the
lowest in Europe (Figure 6.14). Therefore, while the majority of financial resources is spent
on public work, there is less left for training, rehabilitation programs, or significant
contribution allowances, although these latter are proved to be efficient in promoting labor
market participation (EC, 2013). In the case of Hungary, the low effectiveness, high
selectivity of inclusion and sometimes discriminating practices by local authorities have
been outlined by OECD (2014) and Kierzenkowski (2012). The Government of Hungary has
signaled its response to these observations by better combining the public works program
with training offerings.

Activation Priority, Activation Type and Benefit Receipt, by Group

When further considering the approach toward labor market integration, an assessment of
the priorities and potentials of the identified groups needs to be undertaken. Given the
limited increase in nominal resources for activation programs, further prioritization of
intervention is all the more important. After a first step (“activation priority”) of
prioritizing the intervention along activation need and activation potential, a second step
(“activation type”) will attempt to classify the groups according to the kind of activation
intervention needed, depending on social or labor market barriers to be overcome. Lastly, as
a third step, information on household income composition of the different groups will be
used to assess potential cross-dependencies of the benefit system with the labor market
status and activation approaches.

Activation Priorities. The table below gives an overview of the identified out-of-work
classes and their respective activation need and activation potential. The total number of
persons estimated in these clusters was about 2.28 million in 2011, representing about 38
percent of the working-age (16–64) population of Hungary in 2011.

In the table, “activation need” refers to a group’s level of need for inclusion in the labor
market in order to achieve income and reduce or end poverty. “Activation potential”
describes that group’s ability or motivation to be included in the labor market. A high
activation need could be driven by high poverty risk (as in the case of the prime-aged long-
term unemployed), whereas a high activation potential could be driven by previous work
experience or a relatively good educational base (for example, the educated single students).
Overall priority for action can also be supported by the size of the group.

From this prioritization exercise, a set of seven groups emerges with a “high” or “medium”
priority for action. Disabled with previous work experience have a medium priority because
their potential reinsertion into the labor market will most probably have to be achieved via a
forced reassessment of their disability status. This can be a protracted process. Prime-aged
unemployed and prime-aged long-term unemployed are considered high priority for further
activation. Prime-aged inactive mothers with work experience and low-educated rural inactive
mothers without work experience are both ranked “medium” priority but should still be
included in the roster of prioritized groups. They present very different socio-economic
challenges. Unemployed youth and educated single students form prioritized groups because
of the potential scarring effects of labor market detachment for young people at an early age.
From the view of the Hungarian authorities, “educated single students” do not constitute a
prioritized group for further action in 2014 or later, because one of their main labor market
barriers (language completion requirement) was addressed through dedicated programs
after 2011.

Mostly male early retirees and retirees, urban retired women and low-educated disabled
without work experience are not prioritized for further action owing, respectively, to their
officially achieved retirement status and extreme distance (via very low educational
attainment and self-declared disability) from the labor market.

Activation type. As a second step, the relative severity of labor market or social obstacles to
be overcome for labor market integration will serve as an orientation for activation
approaches.

When mapping the respective barriers for labor market integration faced by the seven
prioritized groups, we can see that their challenges are quite evenly distributed across the
matrix. Unemployed youth and educated single students have similar social barriers but differ
in their potential labor market proximity, the students being much closer to a job start. The
two groups of the prime-aged long-term unemployed and the prime-aged unemployed face
similar social barriers. The same can be said for the two groups of the inactive mothers, with
the prime-aged inactive mothers with work experience being much closer to the labor market.
The large group of the disabled with previous work experience probably faces the strongest
social hurdles for labor market integration: overcoming their disability status and
reintegrating in mid-life.

Household income composition. When analyzing the 2011 household income of the
prioritized groups, one notices a relatively high share of benefit income among many groups.
For the three non-prioritized groups (mostly male early retirees and retirees, urban retired
women and low-educated disabled without work experience) this does not present a major
problem because their pattern of benefit receipt corresponds to their socio-demographic
situation. The prime-aged unemployed and prime-aged long-term unemployed each have
about 50 percent of income from unemployment benefits. Following recent policy changes to
reduce the unemployment benefit payment to only three months, this figure may be lower.

As already mentioned, the disabled with previous work experience ought to be examined
again as to their disability status. With only 35 percent reporting any limitation on daily
activities, yet 89 percent receiving disability benefits, there appears to be some potential for
labor market mobilization and benefit rationalization in this group.

Given the overall picture of benefit receipt revealed by EU-SILC data, the key need for action
emerges around a potential review of disability benefit allocation.

Suggestions for Activation Measures and Further Analysis

This section sets out a set of potential activation measures for each of the priority groups.
Areas for further policy dialogue are also outlined. Any suggestion or policy discussion
around concrete measures will need to take into account that the Hungarian authorities have
introduced a set of reforms since 2012, and changes to existing programs in the field of
employment and labor market inclusion (EU 2012 and OECD 2014).

The suggestions below should be considered as a starting point for further policy dialogue
between the EC, the World Bank and Hungary, bearing in mind that the groups identified still
may have heterogeneities that affect the type of support required. Accordingly, these
suggestions are not meant to be an exhaustive set of possible activation measures.

When discussing potential activation approaches for the identified groups, it is important to
keep in mind that the groups have been derived from EU-SILC data from the year 2011. Since
then, general economic development, policy actions by the government of Hungary and
European Commission “Country Specific Recommendations” might have reflected some of
the policy suggestions or rendered them obsolete.

More concretely, since 2011 the government of Hungary has taken a number of steps and
has initiated policy changes that ought to improve the labor market integration or activation
of some of the groups. Notably, these reforms were taken in the fields of (1) access to
disability insurance—with a change from disability pensions to rehabilitation benefits and
the revision of the health status of the recipients, emphasizing working capacity rather than
loss of skills; (2) early retirement—where rules of early retirement were tightened and the
retirement age will be raised from 62 to 65 years (Box 6.1); (3) linkage of social assistance
beneficiaries with activation services—eligibility rules for unemployment assistance became
stricter and recipients were obliged to participate in public works or other activation
programs for at least 30 days a year; and (4) reconciliation of work and family life, allowing
parents who receive child care benefits to pursue gainful activity without time limitation
(Box 6.2), and by the development of daycare services. When discussing the results of the
LCA segmentation analysis, the potential impact of these reforms on current (2013/2014)
inactivity figures will need to be discussed.

Disabled with previous work experience (19 percent, Priority: Medium). This is the
largest group among the identified and prioritized groups, with 432,000 members in 2011.
On the face of things, the group does have strong work experience in light of middle to low
educational achievement. The large majority of them live in rural areas and about 35 percent
of them report strong physical limitations on their ability to work, a much lower rate than
the 89 percent claiming a disability benefit.

At any rate, this significant group of out-of-work citizens needs to be followed more closely
and any new applicants for disability benefits closely monitored and controlled (as recent
policy changes by the Hungarian authorities suggest). Limiting the inflows into this group
(via more stringent disability benefit criteria) will be easier than forcing the activated exit of
members from this group. Nevertheless, this effort ought to be undertaken in light of the




                                                          Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 201
demographic profile of the group (many members are still in their forties). Potential
activation measures for the inactive who remain in this group will largely depend on the
ability of local governments to provide and finance services for the (formerly) disabled
(rehabilitation, transport, social and medical care, and so on), but also on the integration of
national policies with local service standards and adequate financing. In light of the
potentially high integration cost for and potential discrimination against disabled workers,
local social services cannot be expected to finance these approaches without support from
central government. Potential activation measures include:

        Review disability status but continue benefits (for now). Continuing to provide
         the current benefits, the members of this group could be made eligible for a review
         of their disability and work-ability status. When considered “fit to work” in this
         review, a set of support measures and continuing benefits (potentially with a phase-
         out period) ought to be provided to cushion the transition toward labor market
         integration. Since 2012, the incapacity benefit administration has been reformed; it
         is more focused on “work ability” checks and is supposed to tighten the access to the
         program.
        Integration into standard PES offerings. After reassessment of their labor market
         status, the members of the group ought to be made part of the normal client base of
         the public employment service (at medium priority), offering training and job
         placement experience.
        Participation in (reformed!) public works program. In light of the strong rural
         living pattern of the group, a participation in the (reformed! more training!) public
         works program could be an option to supplement potential social assistance income
         levels after withdrawal of the disability pension.
        PES does provide a mobility subsidy to job seekers who have found a job
         outside of their home city. However, this does not address the general lack of
         public transportation in the country nor its high cost.
        Enhanced and cheaper mobility in rural and peri-urban areas. Given the
         relative high cost of mobility using public transport in Hungary (OECD 2014), this
         group might find itself at a disadvantage owing to its rural living pattern. Any
         progress in that field of public transport could certainly help to improve regional
         mobility and labor matching.
        The “Rehabilitation card” issued for persons with health problems by the national
         tax authority, which provides support to employers for the employment of
         disabled/incapacitated workers. In February 2014 more than 23 thousand
         employees in almost 6,000 companies benefited from this program,

Prime-aged unemployed (14 percent, Priority: High). These newly unemployed have solid
work experience (16 years on average) and mainly live in rural areas. Many of them have
dependent children, reducing their geographic mobility. Their risk of poverty is high, with 49
percent living in the poorest quintile.

Prime-aged long-term unemployed (12 percent, Priority: High). This group resembles the
previous group but is slightly older and less rural. Potential activation measures for the two
groups include:




202 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
       Availability of public transportation and rental offers. Increasing the availability
        of public transportation can improve the quality of life and people’s chances of
        finding a job and staying employed—for example, taking advantage of opportunities
        in particular geographic areas. The Hungarian authorities noted that many rental
        offers and incomes are in fact part of the “grey” economy, so the real availability of
        rental offers in the market might be higher than perceived but might be unsuitable
        for any type of mobility support due to lack of documentation. Nevertheless the
        Government of Hungary introduced in 2012 a housing allocation for job seekers
        who cannot find jobs locally, to be used to rent accommodations for up to 18 months
        in the case of employment.
       Enhanced and cheaper mobility in rural and peri-urban areas. Given the
        relative high cost of mobility using public transport in Hungary (OECD 2014), this
        group might find itself at a disadvantage owing to its rural living pattern. Any
        progress in that field of public transport could certainly help to improve regional
        mobility and labor matching.
       Job-to-job matching by PES. The rather recent fall into unemployment by this
        group (prime-aged unemployed), underlines the necessity for the PES to take
        customers in charge early on, ideally when they are still employed in their previous
        job, and help with “job-to-job” transitions to avoid long spells of unemployment in
        the first place. This requires immediate notification on the part of the (future) job
        seeker and immediate action by the PES when it learns about the upcoming
        joblessness of a potential client.
       Reconnection with previous field of employment. Given the strong work
        experience of this group, building any future development on their acquired skills
        can strengthen their case with new employers.
       Linkage with regional economic development activities. For both groups, a
        linkage with regional economic development activities (investment, self-
        employment promotion, enhanced public works schemes, and so on) will be
        important, regardless of urban or rural living pattern.

Prime-aged inactive mothers with work experience (13 percent, Priority: Medium). This
group of women could certainly benefit from improved child care offerings and reconnection
programs with their fields of previous employment or study. Potential and current activation
measures include:

       Standard PES job search assistance. Given their good work experience and (on
        average) high educational attainment, job searches by this group could be expected
        to be conducted independently, with little supervision and support from the PES
        authorities.
       Linkage of PES job search assistance with child care offerings. Linking any
        activation attempt to provision of child care will be critical.
    
        Continue to expand child care facilities. 75 percent of children aged three to six
        were enrolled in formal child care in 2011, which was below the EU average of 83
        percent. During the joint country mission, the Hungarian authorities noted that child
        care offerings had been expanded since 2011. More challenging is child care for
        younger children, which according to Eurostat is provided to around 8 percent of
        children under three, compared to 30 percent of children in the EU in 2011. In

         2009–2010 an action plan was launched to increase the capacity of day care by
         3,200–3,500 new places before 2013.84,85
        Greater flexibility in parental leave and benefit policies. In January 2014,
         parents were allowed to return to work more quickly while still receive their benefit
         for the full two years. At the same time, low-income mothers were able to receive a
         “child care allowance” for three years. There are fears that this last might act as a
         work disincentive, a view not shared by the Hungarian authorities due to the very
         low level of the benefit, at about one-fourth of the minimum wage.
        The “Job Protection Act” introduced an employment subsidy for
         disadvantaged job seekers, including those returning from child care and those
         without qualifications, among others.

Unemployed youth (4 percent, Priority: High). This group urgently needs to be connected
to the labor market to avoid any “scarring” effect on their life chances. Very few of them have
initial work experience, but the group has medium-level educational attainment. Potential
activation measures include:

        Job placement and job-start programs. Placement through subsidized internships
         with accompanying professional and life-skills training could be a promising line of
         action, breaking the common barrier of required work experience for many entry-
         level positions.
        Job-search offerings by PES and via virtual platforms. Any PES offering for this
         group will have to take into account that the use of mobile technology (for localized
         job search, initiation of employer contact), and so on, will be taken for granted by
         many members of this group.
        The “Job Protection Act” introduced an employment subsidy for young people.
         The subsidy is time-limited and targeted to younger-than-25-year-olds to
         incentivize sustainable employment.

Low-educated rural inactive mothers without work experience (4 percent, Priority:
Medium). This group presents much greater integration challenges than the larger group of
inactive mothers. They are a group of much younger women who mainly live in rural areas.
They have almost no work experience and much lower educational attainment. Potential
activation measures include:

        (Reformed!) Public-works “window” for mothers. Opening a “mothers” window
         in a reformed public works program that includes child-care offerings and training
         opportunities might help some of these women get initial work experience and
         address their dire poverty situation. Most likely, this will call for reform of the local
         selection practices of the public works program by municipalities.
        Remedial education. In light of the extremely low educational attainment among
         this group, offerings of remedial secondary education could be quite well placed for

communities (modeled after a UK example) that provide additional social support for poor
children and their families.

        this group. Again, these offerings would probably have to be accompanied by child
        care offerings.


Educated single students (2 percent, Priority: Medium). This group has a high educational
standard but no work experience and will, in the coming years, leave school and enter either
unemployment or inactivity. Similar to the unemployed youth, they will need a quick start
and work attachment to avoid any “scarring.” Potentially, programs for the unemployed
youth and the educated single students could be offered along the same program lines (in the
same ESF OP or the like), with participants self-selecting into specific courses or programs
based on educational background or living area (rural/urban). Potential activation measures
include:

       Promotion of part-time work during studies. Allowing students to gain first-hand
        work experience during their studies might help with initial labor market insertion
        upon graduation.
       Standard job search support. Helping the members of this group with basic job
        search skills could already be helpful.
       Offer support to students in order to comply with language requirements
        needed to receive their university diplomas (already addressed). In order to
        get their university degree, students in Hungary must pass an intermediate level
        language exam in the foreign language of their choice. Offering more support for
        these language requirements could help provide many students with the necessary
        formal credentials for labor market entry. In March 2014, the government of
        Hungary launched the Diploma Rescue Program, which supports those who have
        completed their tertiary education and only require a certificate of foreign language
        to get their degree, by covering their language course cost and, for registered job
        seekers, the cost of the (first) language exam.


In summary, Hungary could benefit from accompanying the ongoing improvement of its
labor market services and social inclusion policies with enhanced knowledge about the
composition and socio-economic situation of the different groups of out-of-work citizens.

                                              Lithuania 2007−2011

Background

Lithuania approached the global financial crisis following a decade of high growth.
According to the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, between 1998 and 2008, the
country was one of the fastest growing economies in the world, displaying an average GDP
growth rate of about 7 percent per year. In the 2003–2008 period, the country grew
between 6 and 10 percent per year, in sharp contrast to the anemic growth rates observed
by the EU-28, or the euro area (which expanded between 0 and 3 percent per year).

Lithuania was hit hard by the downturn but appears to have recovered fairly rapidly,
at least as far as output growth is concerned. Even though the country entered the storm
later compared to many other countries (GDP growth in 2008 still settled at an acceptable 3
percent), the Lithuanian economy suffered a severe recession in 2009, when output
contracted by a staggering 14.8 percent. This was mostly due to the country’s strong
dependence on exports, which collapsed in the 2008–2009 period. While neighboring Latvia
fared somewhat worse, the dip witnessed by the Lithuanian economy was much more severe
than the one suffered by the average EU-28 country or Euro-area member, which witnessed
negative growth rates in the 5 percent region in 2009. However, like neighboring countries
with similar income levels (for example Estonia and Latvia), Lithuania recovered from the
shock faster than its European partners; GDP growth was back into positive territory by
mid-2009 and remained comfortably positive throughout 2010, before settling at about 6
percent in 2011. Growth rates returned to more modest levels by 2012 and 2013, at about
3–4 percent.

While GDP growth resumed quite rapidly, unemployment deteriorated sharply as a
result of the downturn and is struggling to revert to pre-crisis levels. The rate of
joblessness in Lithuania had declined steadily since the early 2000s, settling at little over 4
percent in 2007. However, as the effects of the global financial crisis unraveled, the country
suffered a large and extremely rapid increase in unemployment; by the end of 2008,
joblessness had risen to about 6 percent, climbing to 14 percent in 2009 and eventually
peaking at 18 percent in 2010. Such increases are considerably larger than those observed in
the EU-28 or the euro area as a whole, but comparable to what other countries in the region
of similar income levels witnessed. Unemployment began to slowly decrease in late 2010,
but the average rate in 2013 was still 12 percent, about 8 percentage points above the pre-
crisis levels.

Young Lithuanians were particularly affected by the global downturn. Like the overall
unemployment rate, the joblessness rate among Lithuanians between the age of 15 and 24




                                                        Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 207
had declined steadily in the pre-crisis period, reaching 8 percent in 2007. As the global
recession hit, youth unemployment skyrocketed to 29 percent in 2009 and then 35 percent
in 2010. Encouragingly, however, as unemployment started to fall in 2010, the rate of
joblessness among young Lithuanians followed suit; by 2012, unemployment in the 15–24
cohort had recovered somewhat to 26 percent—still more than 15 percentage points above
the 2007 pre-crisis level. However, youth unemployment declined somewhat to 22 percent,
and was slightly lower than the rate registered for the EU-28 as a whole (23 percent).

As far as joblessness goes, men were generally more affected than women. As Figure
7.1 below shows, at all age levels, Lithuania men suffered larger increases in their rate of
unemployment relative to women. Both men and women in the 25–64 age category entered
the crisis with unemployment rates close to 5 percent; however, by late 2010, women in this
age group displayed unemployment rates in the 12–15 percent range, as opposed to 15 to 20
percent among men of the same age. Among young Lithuanians, men were also affected
much more than women, with the rate of joblessness among 15-to-24-year-old men peaking
at 45 percent, as opposed to 35 percent among women of the same cohort.

One of the most worrying developments as a result of the crisis was the significant
increase in the share of long-term unemployed. In 2013, according to Eurostat and as
shown in Figure 7.2 in the average EU-28 country almost 48 percent of the unemployed have
been looking for work for more than 12 months, up from 35 percent in 2009. In Lithuania,
where the long-term unemployment rate had declined all the way to just over 20 percent in
2009, the figure reached 52 percent in 2011 and settled at 50 percent in 2012, a
development comparable to those observed in Latvia and Estonia, before declining to 43
percent in 2013.

A further troubling change in the Lithuanian labor market since 2007 is the rapid
increase in both the absolute number of out-of work individuals and in the share of



                                                              Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 209
the out-of-work population relative to total population and working-age population.
EU-SILC data reveals that the number of the out-of-work population between the age of 16
and 64 (excluding students) had been increasing steadily between 2007 and 2011, going
from slightly over 450,000 to just under 610,000. This is all the more alarming as it occurred
during a period in which both the total size of the population and the total number of
working-age individuals in Lithuania actually shrank (from about 3.375 to about 3.285
million and from 1.985 to 1.9 million, respectively). This resulted in the share of out-of-work
population relative to the total working-age population increasing from 23 percent to 32
percent.

The 2007–2011 period witnessed a sizeable increase in the number and relative
importance of unemployment (particularly long-term unemployment), at the
expenses of employment. Figure 7.4 and Figure 7.5 below show the composition of
working-age and of out-of-work Lithuanians in 2007 and 2011, respectively. Not only, as
Figure 7.3 above shows, did the size of out-of-work population increase between 2007 and
2011 relative to the working-age population, but long-term unemployment became
relatively more common among Lithuanians, while the share of those at work has been
losing ground. While the share of long-term unemployed relative to total working-age people
was about 2.5 percent in 2007, the figure had increased to over 8 percent in 2011; similarly,
long-term unemployed accounted for 11 percent of the out-of-work population in 2007, but
for 26 percent in 2011. The share of total unemployment (long-term and non) among
working-age individuals (excluding students 86) also more than doubled over the period,
increasing from 6 percent to 15 percent; jobless individuals accounted for 25 percent of the
out-of-work population in 2007, but for 46 percent in 2011.

The developments highlighted above, in particular the increase in the size and relative
weight of the out-of-work population and the unemployed, point to a deterioration in the
Lithuanian labor market over the last few years. A deeper analysis of the out-of-work
population is therefore urgently needed; understanding the composition of these groups is
in fact key to ensuring that the right policy measures are taken and that priorities are set in
an appropriate manner.




86 Individuals aged 16 to 24 who are out of work and enrolled in education are excluded from the
sample; they are considered to be investing in their final stages of human capital formation and
therefore also not a particular target group for activation policies. In 2011, this population amounted
to about 257,400 individuals, representing 59.5 percent of the total population aged 16 to 24 and 30
percent of the total out-of-work population of working age. Individuals enrolled in school between 25
and 64 are however included in the latent class analysis and will be grouped under “other inactive.” It
is important to note that the group of students (older than 24) account for less than 1 percent of total
population of working age.

Methodology: Latent Class Analysis

In Chapter 1 a general overview of the latent class analysis methodology was presented. This
section explains in detail the variables and covariates used to identify classes or groups of
out-of-work individuals that are as homogeneous as possible within each class according to a
set of observable characteristics, and as distant as possible between classes. The emerging
profiles can then be contrasted with the design and targeting of current activation policies,
in order to identify the potential gaps and to enhance their design features.

Variable selection: The definition of latent classes relies on a number of indicator variables
to capture different “symptoms” of an overall latent condition (in this case, the typology of
joblessness). The challenge in such models is to identify a discrete number of variables that
can best explain the heterogeneity of individual outcomes. In this case, two sets of
categorical variables were selected: the first set to show the extent of labor market distance
and the other to capture some of the main factors that can affect employment on the supply
side, such as labor supply conditions (household-level incentives to work and physical
ability to work).

        Distance from labor market: short-term unemployment, long-term
         unemployment, (early) retirement, disability, and other inactivity (largely unpaid
         domestic work).87
        Labor supply conditions: whether the individual’s household has at least one
         working adult,88 and perceived limitations on activities due to health problems.89

In addition to indicators, the model includes active covariates, which are used to improve the
classification of individuals in each class. In this case the active covariates are the
demographic variables that are normally used to disaggregate labor market outcomes:

        Age-group category (four groups)
        Gender
        Human capital: the highest educational level achieved
        Degree of urbanization: 90 densely populated, intermediate area, sparsely
         populated

Once the latent classes have been defined, inactive covariates that were not included in the
model can be used to characterize the individuals in each class and the households in which


87 This variable is constructed using the self-reported current work status in the EU-SILC survey that

has four categories: at work, unemployed, retired and inactive. The unemployed are further classified
into short- and long-term based on how long they have been actively looking for a job. The inactive is
combined with another question to separate this group into students, disabled, military and other
inactive.
88 In order to construct this variable, individuals aged 25 or older are considered adults.
89 This is a binary variable that takes the value one if an individual answered “yes, strong limitations” to

whether they had been hampered in their usual activities because of health problems for at least the
last six months. The value is zero if the answer is “yes, limited” or “no, not limited.”
90 According to EU-SILC guidelines, dense areas have more than 500 inhabitants per square kilometer,

where the total population for the set is at least 50,000 inhabitants. Intermediate areas have more than
100 inhabitants per square kilometer, and either a total population for the set of at least 50,000
inhabitants or a location adjacent to a dense area. The remaining areas are categorized as sparsely
populated.

they live. The inactive covariates chosen describe those characteristics that may provide
valuable information for the design of tailored policies that address barriers to employment,
including income level. They include:

        Household welfare conditions:
             • Income quintile (defined by equivalized disposable household income91, 92)
             • Labor, benefit, and other income as share of total gross household income93
             • Working status of the partner
             • Tenure status
             • Household ability to keep dwelling warm
             • Partner’s labor income
             • Quintile of partner’s labor income
             • Binary variables denoting whether individuals or their households are
                 beneficiaries of any of eight social protection benefits94
             • Share of each benefit over the household’s gross income
        Household demographics:
             • Household size
             • Household composition
             • Binary variable showing whether there are children under 6 in the
                 household
             • Binary variable denoting whether there are three or more under-16
                 children in the household
             • Children under 13 receiving child care in the household: all, some or no
                 children under 13 present
             • Older person (65 and over) in the household
        Other individual-level demographics:
             • More refined age groups (eight groups)
             • Marital status
        Individual human capital:
             • More refined highest educational level achieved (six groups)
             • Work experience in years
             • Binary variable for previous work experience


91 The equivalized household income takes into account an equivalence factor to weight the number of
household members used in the denominator when calculating household income per capita. The first
adult aged 18 or over has a weight of 1.0, children under 14 have a weight of 0.3, and other individuals
14 and older have a weight of 0.5. The sum of the weights of all household members is equal to the
equivalent household size.
92 Note that income reported in EU-SILC surveys is for the year preceding the survey year.
93 Total household gross income is defined as the sum of: (at the individual level) gross employee cash

or near-cash income; company car, gross cash benefits or losses from self-employment (including
royalties); unemployment benefits; old-age benefits; survivor benefits; sickness benefits; disability
benefits; education allowances; and (at the household level) income from rental of property or land;
family/children related allowances; social exclusion not elsewhere classified; housing allowances;
regular inter-household cash transfers received; interests, dividends, profit from capital investments in
unincorporated business; pensions from individual private plans; and income received by people
under 16. Total household net income, in turn, was calculated by subtracting from total household
gross income regular taxes on wealth, taxes on income and social insurance contributions, and regular
inter-household case transfers paid.
94 Social benefits are aggregated in eight branches using the European System of integrated Social

PROtection Statistics (ESSPROS) definitions. For more information, see Eurostat (2011).

        Household location:
            • Urban/rural status

The analysis relies on cross-sectional as well as panel data from the European Union
Statistics of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) surveys for 2008–2011, which combine
individual-level information with household characteristics. The first part of the note
presents a cross-sectional analysis for the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. In particular,
the latent class analysis on 2008 data shows the main characteristics of the out-of-work
before the global economic crisis hit Lithuania, and thus highlight what could be considered
more structural issues of the country’s labor market. The 2011 latent class analysis will
contrast this initial assessment with more recent developments. The second part of the note
exploits longitudinal data between 2008 and 201095 to trace the prior labor market status of
individuals observed last in 2010 in various classes, and will shed light on the relative
persistence in the out-of-work status among different classes of individuals. The set of
variables chosen for the cross-section and the longitudinal analysis are slightly different, due
to minor differences in the set of variables recorded in each of the two types of datasets.




95 The EU-SILC longitudinal survey consists of a four-year rotating panel. In each year, approximately
three-quarters of individuals present in the previous year are retained. The samples used in the latent
class analysis include about 3,000 observations for each year in the cross-sectional analysis and 600
observations in the longitudinal analysis. The population is weighted with individual weights.

Main Findings

Out-of-Work Population: Group Profiles
The latent class analysis supports the classification of the out-of-work into eight major
groups, some of which have remained stable over time. The groups were named according to
their most salient characteristics. Figure 7.6 shows the shares of each of the eight classes
identified for the year 2011 while Table 7.1 presents their most salient characteristics.

    Note: Percentages in parentheses following the group names refer to the share of the total out-of-work
    population. “Years of work experience” refers only to those individuals who have worked before.
    “Dependent children” includes children under 18 and household members aged 18 to 24 who are
    economically inactive and living with at least one parent. “Working adult” refers to adults aged 25 and
    over. For this report’s purposes, we define the at-risk-of-poverty rate as the relative risk of being in the
    first quintile of the income distribution. The reference period for income reported in EU-SILC surveys is the

    The eight main clusters emerging from the latent class analysis can be characterized as
    follows (see Annex 2 for more detail):

        Cluster 1: Middle-aged poor rural long-term unemployed. This group represents 28
         percent of the out-of-work population in 2011. The increase of the out-of-work
         population from 2007 to 2011 can be mainly ascribed to the increase in the size of this
         particular cluster of people. Individuals in this group are mostly between 25 and 59




    216 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
    years of age, and more than 60 percent are between 35 and 59. About 29 percent of
    them are unemployed while, most worryingly, the majority of them (71 percent) are
    long-term unemployed. 66 percent of the members of this group live in rural areas and
    they tend to be low-income, as almost 80 percent of them belong to the first two income
    quintiles. About 45 percent have upper secondary education, and almost 25 percent
    lower secondary. This group is composed of both men and women (58 and 42 percent,
    respectively), and almost 70 percent have completed secondary education.
   Cluster 2: Rural disabled adults with benefits. This group, accounting for 19 percent of
    out-of-work population, is almost completely (90 percent) made up of disabled people
    who receive benefits: 84 percent of them receive a disability benefit; 96 percent receive
    some sort of benefit. The benefits also appear quite generous, as they comprise over 70
    percent of total household income. However, surprisingly, only 42 percent of the
    individuals in this group claimed to have strong limitations on their daily activities due
    to health conditions. This cluster comprises few young individuals, as 99 percent are
    between 25 and 64 years old. Similarly to the first and third groups, the level of
    education attained is mainly secondary (71 percent), and most live in rural areas (76
    percent). The individuals in this cluster are in the middle of the income distribution, as
    70 percent of them have an income belonging to the second to fourth quintiles.
   Cluster 3: Married rural women with old age pensions. This third cluster, which
    makes up 18 percent of the out-of-work population, is composed almost exclusively of
    retired individuals, of whom almost 70 percent are women. More than 90 percent of
    those in this group are between 60 and 64 years old, and almost 55 percent belong to
    the first two quintiles of the income distribution. Most of them live in rural areas (65
    percent) and hold relatively high levels of education (71 percent of them have
    completed secondary or tertiary education). They are mostly married (61 percent) and
    about 40 percent of them live with a retired spouse. Most of them receive generous (75
    percent of total household income) benefits: 91 percent receive at least one assistance
    benefit, 77 percent receive some form of old-age payment, and 13 percent receive
    survivor benefits.
   Cluster 4: Young educated rural unemployed. This group, which emerged in 2011
    probably as a result of the crisis, includes 11 percent of the out-of-work population and
    comprises young individuals, as all are between 16 and 35, and 53 percent are between
    16 and 24. Most of the individuals in this cluster are unemployed (45 percent), while 22
    percent are long-term unemployed. However, this group tends to be quite evenly
    distributed among income quintiles. Almost two out of three live in rural areas and
    almost 90 percent of them live in a household with a working adult. Compared to the
    first three groups, individuals in this class have a relatively high level of education: 44
    percent have completed tertiary education and 44 percent have completed upper or
    post-secondary. When it comes to their marital status, almost 60 percent of them are
    single. While family and social exclusion benefits make up 13 percent of their household
    income, unemployment benefits only contribute 2 percent.
   Cluster 5: Middle-aged educated unemployed family men. This group, of which 66
    percent is unemployed, makes up 9 percent of the out-of-work population and includes a
    majority of men (61 percent). Twenty-two percent of those in this cluster are long-term
    unemployed and two-thirds live in rural areas. Almost all of them are between 35 and 59
    and, like Cluster 4, they are well educated: 64 percent have completed upper or post-
    secondary education and 30 percent tertiary. Their income status does not appear to be

    very informative, as this groups is relatively evenly distributed among quintiles. Also,
    most of them live in households composed of two adults and one or more children (60
    percent). Interestingly, 70 percent receive social assistance benefits and 45 percent
    receive child or family benefits.
   Cluster 6: Single poor rural unemployed women. This group accounts for 7 percent of
    out-of-work individuals and the majority are women (62 percent). Forty 40 percent are
    unemployed while 60 percent are engaged in domestic activities. They are of prime
    working age, as 90 percent are between 25 and 59 years old. Similarly to most of the
    other clusters, they mainly live in rural area (86 percent); however, more than a third
    hold only a primary education, and 70 percent are in the first income quintile. In fact, 80
    percent fall within the first two income quintiles. About 60 percent are either single,
    divorced or widowed, and around one-fifth have no prior work experience. Importantly,
    more than 70 percent receive at least one benefit, and 64 percent of the total income of
    the households in this group is derived from benefits.
   Cluster 7: Stay-at-home poor rural women. Members of this cluster, covering about 5
    percent of the out-of-work population, are all women, engaged in domestic activities and
    predominantly living in rural areas (83 percent). 80 percent are between 25 and 54
    years old, but 40 percent are between 25 and 34. Almost all women in this group have at
    least a secondary education (15 percent at the lower level, 59 percent at the upper-
    secondary level, and 19 percent at the post-secondary level). About 65 percent of them
    fall in the first two income quintiles. All of them live in households with a working adult,
    and more than 80 percent in households with at least one child. Like Cluster 1, though,
    the other important characteristic of this group is its low income level: in fact, 66
    percent of them have incomes in the two lowest quintiles of the income distribution.
    Eighty percent receive at least one benefit, and 70 percent benefit from child-support
    programs. The main difference between this cluster and the previous one lies in two
    variables: first, this cluster is made up exclusively of women, as opposed to Group 6,
    which is made mostly of women. Second, this cluster includes stay-at-home women,
    while the previous one includes unemployed individuals as well.
   Cluster 8: Disabled and low-educated urban young men. The last group emerged in
    2011. It represents 3 percent of the out-of-work population. It is composed of single
    men between 16 and 34 years old, most of whom are extremely disabled. Almost all are
    single and live with other family members. Unlike the other seven groups, the
    individuals in this cluster live mostly in urban areas (77 percent) and have very low
    levels of education (only one-third have completed at least lower secondary school), but
    seem to live in better-off households (as almost 60 percent of these households belong
    to the top two income quintiles). In addition, 96 percent of the disabled have never
    worked. As said previously, their main characteristic is that they are all disabled and, as
    opposed to Cluster 3, 94 percent of them claim to suffer from strong limitations on daily
    activity due to health conditions. Even though almost all individuals in this group receive
    at least one benefit, just 81 percent of individuals in this group receive a disability
    benefit, as opposed to 84 percent of individuals in group 2.

The composition of the classes has experienced considerable changes over the last few
years. Table 7.4 and Figure 7.7 show the evolutions of the classes from 2007 to 2011, as a share of
total out-of-work population and in absolute numbers. As mentioned before, one important
development between 2007 and 2011 was the noticeable increased in the size of the out-of-work
population, from less than 460,000 to just under 610,000 individuals. Furthermore, it is
interesting how some of the clusters identified by analyzing the 2011 data could also be (broadly
speaking) identified in the 2007 and 2009 data, although the relative sizes of such clusters might
have changed. In particular:

   The most striking and worrying change is the increase in the size of the middle-aged
    poor rural long-term unemployed group, the size of which more than tripled in absolute
    numbers over the period (going from just over 50,000 individuals to almost 175,000); this
    cluster represented 11 percent of the out-of-work population in 2007, but 28 percent in 2011.
    Interestingly, in 2011 this group was composed of men and women in almost equal shares,
    while by 2009, 86 percent were men.
   A further significant and negative development was the increase in the number of
    middle-aged educated unemployed family men. This group represented only 8 percent of
    the work population in 2008, but reached 28 percent in 2009, before returning to 9 percent in
    2011. In absolute terms, this group increased from over 36,000 in 2007 to 52,000 in 2011.
   The group of single poor rural unemployed women also witnessed significant changes
    over the period, increasing from fewer than 42,000 individuals in 2007 to 82,000 in 2009,
    but decreasing all the way back to 44,000 by 2011. Somewhat encouragingly, this group’s
    share of the out-of-work population was lower in 2011 than in 2007.

   The cluster of young educated unemployed emerged only in 2011, possibly as a result of
    the crisis. This group was not present in the data from previous years, but represented 11
    percent of the out-of-work population in 2011 (67,000 individuals).
   The group of rural disabled adults with benefits has been generally stable over the
    years in relative terms, but has increased in absolute terms. This group represented 21
    percent of the out-of-work population in 2007, 17 percent in 2009 and 19 percent in 2011.
    However, the total size of this group increased from 96,000 in 2007 to 114,000 in 2011.
   The well-established group of married rural women with old-age pensions did not move
    much in absolute terms. The absolute number of individuals in this group has in fact been
    stable over the period at about 110,000; however, its relative size has declined from 25
    percent in 2007 to 18 percent in 2011.

Structural Aspects and Emerging Trends in the Profiles of the Out-of-Work

The analysis of the EU-SILC data using latent class methodology, and of Eurostat numbers, reveal
the existence of a number of clusters or groups of out-of-work individuals that can be more or less
clearly defined and that differ from one another in important characteristics. Some of the features
that we have highlighted are more permanent in nature, while others can most likely be ascribed
to the global downturn and might therefore be more cyclical.

On the structural side, first and foremost, our analysis shows that young Lithuanians have
fared—and fare—particularly badly on the labor market. As per the graphs above, the
unemployment rate in the 15-to-24 year old cohort was 22 percent in 2013, after peaking at more
than 39 percent among males and 32 percent among females in 2010. Although youth
unemployment in Lithuania is worrisome, it is in line with the average unemployment rate in the
EU-28 among young people in 2013 (23 percent). At the same time, according to Eurostat data,
Lithuanian youth display much worse employment rates than their European counterparts.
Employment rates in Lithuania among those aged 15 to 25 peaked, in fact, at 27 percent in 2008,
before dropping to 18 percent in 2010 and recovering somewhat to 25 percent in 2013; Latvia
and Estonia, on the other hand, closed 2013 at 30 and 32 percent, respectively, after peaking at 37
percent in 2008. Similarly, employment rates in the average EU-28 or Euro Area country are
currently 7 percentage points higher than the Lithuanian ones. Finally, as Figure 7.8 shows, labor
force participation among youth aged 15 to 24 is also considerably lower in Lithuania relative to
the rest of the European Union; in 2013, youth labor force participation rates reached 30 percent
in Lithuania, one of the lowest rates in the European Union, and about 10 percentage points lower
than countries such as Latvia, Estonia, and the EU average.

Second, disabled individuals have been and will continue to be a sizeable portion of the
out-of-work population, and population aging will only increase the expenditures on
disability benefits. The cluster of rural disabled adults with benefits included almost 114,000
people in 2011, while a second cluster that emerged in the same year made of disabled and low-
educated urban young men accounted for another 15,000 individuals. In 2007, the cluster of rural
disabled adults with benefits accounted for slightly more than 96,000 people. EU-SILC data also
shows that those classified as disabled, while decreasing as a share of the out-of-work population
from 2007 to 2011 (from 25 to 20 percent), have actually increased in absolute term, from about
114,000 in 2007 to almost 124,000 in 2011 (a 6 percent increase in four years). Furthermore,
disabled Lithuanians tend to be relatively old (85 percent of them were more than 35 years old in
2011 according to EU-SILC data, and 65 percent more than 45). As many as 25 percent of them
have no previous work experience, and thereby face high (and growing) impediments to entering
or re-entering the labor market. Finally, the same data reveals that approximately 24 percent of
all out-of-work population, or about 147,000 individuals, receive disability benefits, up from
123,000 people in 2007 (a 20 percent increase over four years). These patterns are somewhat
concerning given the rapid aging that the Lithuanian society will undergo in the coming decades;
Eurostat data shows that the share of Lithuanian residents over the age of 65 is currently 16
percent of total population, but this number will double by 2060. At the same time, the number of
working age people will decline from 67 percent to 55 percent. The most recent census also
shows that over the last decade the country has lost 13 percent of its population and, using
Eurostat data once again, by 2060 only 2.76 million people will likely live in the country, down
from 3.29 million in 2011. The combination of increasing numbers of disabled individuals and the
aging of the population will likely increase the expenditures on disability benefits that the
Government will have to undertake in the coming decades. Figure 7.9 below shows that

expenditure on disability benefits as a share of GDP, while lower than the EU average, has already
increased between 2008 and 2010, going from 1.6 percent to 1.8 percent.

Third, a number of negative developments can be observed within the unemployed category, all of
which pose significant and urgent challenges for policymakers. In particular:

   As already noted above, one of the most striking developments between 2007 and
    2011 is the dramatic increase in the size of the middle-age poor rural long-term
    unemployed group, the size of which more than tripled in absolute numbers over the period.
    And while part of this increase can almost certainly be ascribed to the global downturn, the
    data confirms that the existence of a (depending on the business cycle) more or less sizable
    pool of low-income unemployed adults is a structural feature of the Lithuanian labor market,
    and one that needs to be dealt with urgently as these individuals and their families are
    probably at high risk of poverty.
   A further concerning development is the significant increase in the size of the middle-
    aged educated unemployed family men group; with about 94 percent of the individuals in
    this cluster having a secondary education or higher, this group of people probably has a
    relatively high skills endowment and should therefore be another priority when it comes to
    activation policies.
   The global downturn is likely at least partly responsible for the rise of a group of young
    educated rural unemployed, a cluster that did not exist in previous years but absorbed about
    11 percent of the out-of-work population in 2011. With about one-third of them having no
    prior work experience and with 90 percent having secondary education, facilitating the
    transition of this group into the labor market is key to the long-term wellbeing of these
    individuals.




                                                            Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 225
   The downturn is also probably responsible for at least part of the large increase in the
    share and number of long-term unemployed in Lithuania. Across all clusters of
    unemployed individuals, an extremely worrying phenomenon was the growing share of
    individuals in long-term unemployment over the 2007–2011 period. As shown in the first
    section, the absolute numbers of those that have been looking for a job for over 12 months
    has also more than doubled. Long-term unemployment not only imposes a significant
    financial burden on households, but affects the long-term health status of job-seekers,
    negatively affects Government finances, and results in a lower overall long-term level of skills
    among a country’s workforce, with permanent negative effects on productivity (Katz, 2012).
    Once more, addressing the plight of the long-term unemployed should be among the policy
    priorities for Lithuanian policymakers.

Out-of-Work Population: Group Profiles from Longitudinal Analysis

Finally, by looking at longitudinal EU-SILC data for the period 2008–2010, one can better
understand the in-cluster dynamics and notice other movements in the labor market. EU-SILC
allows the tracking of a certain number of out-of-work individuals between 2008 and 2010. Of
course, because of the difficulties in tracking people across time, the sample size of the panel
dataset is considerably smaller than the cross-section surveys; the 2008–2010 longitudinal
dataset includes, in fact, 705 observations, as opposed to the 2,300 observations for 2011.
However, the panel data confirms the existence of some latent classes that emerged in the cross-
sectional analysis. And even though the smaller sample size forces us to reduce the number of
clusters identified, some clear patterns emerge. Through longitudinal data five classes can be
defined, all of which can also be found in the cross-section datasets:

          Middle-age low income unemployed (34 percent)
          Disabled (21 percent)
          Married, rural women with pensions (18 percent)
          Stay-at-home or unemployed rural poor wives (16 percent)
          Young rural unemployed men (11 percent)

Annex 3 gives the full statistical description of the latent classes, while Table 7.5 below
summarizes the key features of each group.

Note: “Years of work experience” refers only to those individuals who have worked before. “Dependent children”
includes children under 18 and household members aged 18 to 24 who are economically inactive and living with
at least one parent. “Working adult” refers to adults aged 24 and over.


A further advantage of the panel analysis is to provide information on the movement of
individuals in and out of certain clusters and in and out of jobs between 2008 and 2010. Table 7.6
below presents the flow of individuals into the different clusters as of 2010 according to their
labor market status in 2008. The most interesting column is the one for those employed in 2008
because it generally points to a lot of movement out of employment and into one of the out-of-
work statuses. According to the panel data, among those categorized as middle-age unemployed
in 2010, 53 percent were employed in 2008; similarly, 45 percent of those falling into the young
rural unemployed men category were gainfully employed in 2008, and 39 percent of stay-at-home
or unemployed low income middle-aged mothers and wives in 2010 were working in 2008. On
the other hand, only 4 percent of those employed in 2010 were unemployed in 2008. Table 7.7
also shows a considerable amount of movement from being out-of-work to employment; 46
percent of those unemployed in 2008 were employed by 2010, while 53 percent of those engaged
in domestic activities in 2008 had transitioned to work by 2010. Puzzlingly, this data also shows
that 63 percent of those retired in 2008 had moved back into employment by 2010.

From Profiling to Activation

Activation and Inclusion Policies in Lithuania

Active labor market policies (ALMPs) are implemented by a variety of actors in Lithuania, but the
main institution in charge of ALMPs and public employment services (PES) is the Labor Exchange
(LLE). Established in 1991, the LLE operates under the Ministry of Social Welfare and labor and
was restructured in 2010 in response to the economic downturn. The LLE currently comprises
one central office and 10 territorial labor exchange offices (TLEs)—down from 46 previously—
that serve between three and seven municipalities each (and for a total of 60 municipalities). The
LLE maintains the overall responsibility for ALMPs and supervises the activities of the 10
territorial labor exchange offices, which in turn provide employment services and implement
labor policies for residents and employers at the district, municipality, and sub-district level (EC,
2013).

The range of active labor market policies and employment services is wide. The LLE, in
collaboration with local partners and other Ministries implements several ALMPs (Eurostat, 2010,
and ILO, 2011). In particular:

   Supported Employment Programs/Measures. These include subsidized employment programs,
    support for the acquisition of professional skills, public works programs for the unemployed
    or employees of firms in financial difficulties, job-rotation or job-sharing schemes, and client
    services (such as group counseling, vocational counseling, and so forth).
   Vocational Training Schemes in the form of benefits for both employers and employees,
    workplace trainings, institutional trainings, support for apprenticeships, and so on.
   Support Schemes for Job Creation, such as subsidies for job creation, support schemes for self-
    employment, start-up incentives, and local initiatives for employment (such as business
    development plans for firms and job-placement subsidies)
   Local Mobility and Commuting Support Schemes such as reimbursement of work-related
    relocation, accommodation, or transportation expenses.
   New Measures which have also been implemented in the recent past include employability
    barometers, employment programs for the unemployed aged 55 and over, first employment
    programs for youth, and skills upgrade programs for the long-term unemployed.

At the same time, several passive measures, such as unemployment or early retirement
benefits, are also available. These include full and partial unemployment benefits, redundancy
compensation, bankruptcy compensation, and conditional and unconditional early retirement
benefits. Importantly, in 2012, an innovative measure to prevent poverty traps and to give the
long-term unemployed an extra incentive to take up employment was introduced in the form of
an extra benefit payment for long-term unemployed individuals returning to work. This measure
extends six months of benefits to individuals that transition from long-term unemployment to
employment and do not earn more than double the monthly minimum wage (Eurostat, 2010, and
ILO, 2011).

Lithuania spends little on labor market policies (LMPs) relative to other OECD countries, although
the crisis resulted in a notable increase in such expenditures, mostly due to the spike in
unemployment and early retirement benefits. As Figure 7.10 below shows, in 2011 Lithuania



230 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
spent little more than half a percentage point of GDP on LMPs, almost half of which was devoted
to unemployment benefits and early retirement; the average OECD country, on the other hand,
spent over 1.4 percent of GDP on LMPs, almost three times the Lithuanian figure. Looking at the
evolution of such expenditure items between 2003 and 2011, it is immediately clear that the
downturn was associated with a massive increase in unemployment and early retirement
benefits. In the pre-crisis period, total LMP expenditure ranged between 0.3 and 0.4 percent of
national GDP, while unemployment and early retirement benefits absorbed about 0.1–0.12
percent of GDP; by 2009, at the peak of the crisis, the share of such spending had doubled and
then tripled, reaching 0.9 and 0.6 percent of GDP, respectively. In 2012, unemployment and early
retirement benefits as a share of GDP were still twice the pre-crisis level (Eurostat and OECD
data). It should be noted as positive that Lithuania did not respond to the crisis with a decrease in
relative activation spending, the share of ALMPs in GDP remained almost constant at about 0.2
percent GDP.

The large increase in the share of total LMP costs that went toward unemployment benefits was
matched by a dramatic rise in the number of beneficiaries. As Figure 7.11 shows, while the 2006–
2011 period did not witness an increase in the number of active labor market policies’
beneficiaries, the downturn was clearly linked to a spike in the number of those receiving
unemployment or early retirement benefits, with almost 50,000 individuals joining the ranks of
the beneficiaries between 2008 and 2009 alone.

More particularly, while the level of ALMP spending has remained relatively low and constant
with the crisis, the composition and the source of such expenditures have changed. As depicted on
Figure 7.12, spending on training fell quite sharply, whereas spending on direct job creation and
employment incentives increased (Eurostat, 2010). In addition to the new composition, the crisis
also led to a change in the financing source of inclusion measures: after 2009, the main funding
source became the EU structural funds, which currently support mainly social enterprises and
employment programs for people with disabilities and public works programs, as well as projects
that provide vocational training, create subsidized employment, and facilitate job rotation and
territorial mobility.

Activation Priority, Activation Type and Benefit Receipt by Group

In further considering labor market integration, an assessment of the priorities and potentials of
the identified groups needs to be undertaken. Given the cautious increase in nominal resources
for activation programs, further prioritization of intervention is all the more important. After a
first step (“activation priority”) of prioritizing the intervention along activation need and
activation potential, a second step (“activation type”) will attempt to classify the groups
according to the kind of activation intervention needed, depending on social or labor market
barriers to be overcome. Lastly, as a third step, information on household income composition
of the different groups will be used to assess potential cross-dependencies of the benefit system
with the labor market status and activation approaches.

Activation Priorities. The table below gives an overview of the identified inactive classes and
their respective activation need and activation potential. The total number of persons estimated
in these clusters was about 610,000 in 2011, representing 32 percent of the working-age (16–64)
population of Lithuania in 2011.

In the table, “activation need” refers to a group’s level of need for inclusion in the labor market in
order to achieve income and reduce or end poverty. “Activation potential” describes that group’s
ability or motivation to be included in the labor market. High activation need could be driven by
high poverty risk (as in the case of the middle-aged poor rural long-term unemployed), whereas
high activation potential could be driven by previous work experience or a relatively good
educational base (for example, the young educated rural unemployed). Overall priority for action
can also be driven by the size of a group.

From this overview, an initial set of priorities arises, with the middle-aged poor rural long-term
unemployed, young educated rural unemployed, middle-aged educated unemployed family men and
single poor rural unemployed women showing the highest priority for activation. Their high
priority stems from their relatively large cohort sizes, high or medium activation needs due to
high poverty risk, and activation potential due to labor market proximity, given their work history
and/or education level. Stay-at-home poor rural women follow close behind, but are classified as
slightly lower priority owing to their non-declared unemployment and the significant share that
have at least one working adult in the household. Rural disabled adults with benefits, married rural
women with old-age pensions, and disabled and low-educated urban young men are not prioritized
for activation measures or policies due to lower need and potential (many report strongly limited
capacity to work).

In light of the significant portion of disability benefits among the out-of-work population, a
potential focus of activation could be the group of rural disabled adults with benefits, of which 26
percent are below the age of 44 but for whom disability benefits make up 49 percent of this
group’s household income (for year 2011). While it might be difficult to activate some of the
members of this group because of their disability despite the fact that they are of prime working
age, special attention should be given to not increasing the number of younger disability
recipients beyond the minimum necessary, and to tightly controlling the inflow into this group.

Activation Type. As a second step, the relative severity of labor market or social obstacles to be
overcome for labor market integration will serve as an orientation for activation approaches.

When mapping the respective barriers for labor market integration faced by the five prioritized
groups, we can see that few of the groups face great social barriers. The two groups of rural
women have a different connections to the labor market (work experience, education), but both
could probably benefit from greater access to social and public services near their homes (for



234 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
example child care). Groups of middle-aged unemployed could be supported with standard skill-
and mobility-based measures, while the young educated rural unemployed could probably benefit
from mobility support.

Household income composition. When analyzing the 2011 household income of the groups, we
can see that three groups have a benefit-share of household income that could be an indication of
excessive reliance on benefits: 53 percent of the household income of the middle-aged poor rural
long-term unemployed, 72 percent of the household income of the rural disabled adults with
benefits and 64 percent of the household income of the single poor rural unemployed women are
benefit payments. Other high-benefit share groups (retirees or highly disabled) also have high
benefit shares, but this can be seen as a correct function of the social safety net because of
legitimate limitations for self-supporting work.

Middle-aged poor rural long-term unemployed adults receive 21 percent of their household income
from old-age and disability benefits, although only 1 percent of group members are over the age
of 60. This could be an indication that some members of this group are in early retirement. Single
poor rural unemployed women rely on benefits for 64 percent of their household income, most
probably social inclusion benefits for their welfare.

For the interesting phenomenon of the young educated rural unemployed, the hypothesis of
benefit dependency through intra-family transfers (for example, dependence on old-age pensions
or disability pensions of relatives) can most probably be rejected. Only 13 percent of the
household income of this group comes from old-age and disability benefits.

Given the overall picture of benefit receipt revealed by EU-SILC data, no actions are needed to
counter work disincentive. The pattern of benefits appears to be generally in line with the socio-
economic situation of the specific groups.

Suggestions for Activation Measures and Further Analysis

This section sets out a set of potential activation measures for each of the priority groups. Areas
for further policy dialogue are also outlined. The suggestions below should be considered as a
starting point for further policy dialogue between the EC, the World Bank and Lithuania, bearing
in mind that the groups identified still possess heterogeneity that may affect the type of support
required. Accordingly, these suggestions are not meant to be an exhaustive set of possible
activation measures.

It is important to keep in mind that the groups have been derived from EU-SILC data from the
year 2011. Since then, general economic development, policy actions by the government of
Lithuania and European Commission country specific recommendations might have reflected
some of these policy suggestions or rendered them obsolete.

Middle-aged poor rural long-term unemployed (28 percent, Priority: High). This is the largest
group among the out-of-work in Lithuania, with over 170,000 members. All are unemployed, over
70 percent of them for more than one year. This, together with the fact that 98 percent say they do
not have any limitation on capacity to work, confirms their high labor availability and activation
potential. Sixty percent of them fall in the lowest income quintile. Age wise, 89 percent of the
group is between 25 and 59. The distribution between men and women is roughly equal, at 58 to
42 percent. Primary and secondary education levels dominate in 94 percent of the group. Two-
thirds of its members reside in rural areas. Fifty-two percent of the group are single, but the
average household size stands at three, which indicates other relatives (17 percent have a 65-
plus-aged person) and children (47 percent) in the household. Only 14 percent of households
have children under six, indicating reduced caregiving responsibility for children. Potential
activation measures for this group include the following:

   Build activation on previous work experience and skills. Building on the work experience
    of 93 percent of this group, training and skill-building offerings should be based on previous
    experience in the labor market. At the same time, the average age and household composition
    of this cohort makes many of its members eligible for longer-term intervention such as
    training in foreign languages, or information communication technology (ICT), or “second
    chance” apprenticeship programs. For some of the more intensified training, the educational
    basis would probably have to be strengthened. stopped here
   Self-employment in and around regional cities. With the large share of this group living in
    a rural environment, potential activation measures can focus on self-employment,
    cooperatives and services or trades in urban and regional centers. Support for business
    creation, small loans or micro-credits could help members of this group engage in self-
    employed activity.
   Mobility. Enabling jobseekers and workers to permanently and temporarily move inside the
    country, could help members of this group. Availability and quality of public transport (not
    part of specific activation policy, but rather general public infrastructure tasks) and mobility
    grants for job-search or transition into jobs can be possible measures to support this group.
Young educated rural unemployed (11 percent, Priority: High). This group faces the lowest
labor market and social barriers, but is also a potential source for further emigration from the
country, a fact that has been getting important attention in the years since the start of the financial
and economic crisis. In 2011, the group represented about 67,000 members, of which two thirds



236 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
were declared as unemployed. None reported any work limitations, and all of its members are
younger than 34 with an almost equal relations between the sexes. An interesting feature of this
group is that 44 percent have a tertiary education or higher (making up the relatively low number
of unemployed young Lithuanians with a university degree). The majority of the group lives in
rural areas (63 percent), is not married (62 percent) and lives in a household of 4.2 average
members, hinting at a residence still at the parent’s house. The labor share of income in these
households is 62 percent and the benefits received appear plausible for the respective socio-
economic situation. Potential activation measures for this group include the following:

   “Top-up” courses for practical job skills. Many university graduates lack practical hands-on
    job skills for a workplace environment. With group intervention training schemes, young
    jobseekers could be offered supplemental soft and functional skill training on top of their
    domain knowledge degree.
   Job fairs. With formal training apparently not the key labor market barrier for this group, job
    matching and job information must take center stage. For graduates from rural areas and
    regional centers, accessibility to job fairs ought to be ensured through “job-buses” or other
    outreach and transportation initiatives.
   Job placement / internships. ALMP funds could be used to support the temporary
    placement of graduates with firms for internships or short-term engagements.
   Job linkage at university / college. To prevent joblessness after graduation and to ensure
    early attachment to companies and industries, universities and colleges need to link students
    early on to job skills, job search techniques and work experiences.
   Mobility support to large cities, near-abroad countries. With most of the unemployed in
    this group living in non-urban areas, mobility to potential locations of employment becomes
    all the more critical. At the same instance, temporary access to subsidized housing for young
    job starters or “foyer” type housing offerings in larger cities could facilitate the mobility of
    youths within Lithuania. Promoting labor migration to the near-abroad (while helping
    temporary migrants to retain their ties to home) can be another measure to prevent critical
    human capital depreciation at an important time of career formation.
Middle-aged educated unemployed family men (9 percent, Priority: High). Two thirds of this
group are registered as unemployed and despite a disability-share of 9 percent, only 1 percent
declares to have strong limitations to work. Almost all members of this exclusive 35 to 59 year-old
group live in a household with a working adult, hinting at a supplementary earner model through
the household’s wife (87 percent are married). A relatively high household income is achieved
through mainly labor income (77 percent). Households have relatively few children but 87
percent have a person over 65 years of age. Education level is medium with only 30 percent
holding tertiary education. As with all other groups, previous work experience is very high at 94
percent. Potential activation measures for this group include the following:

   Linkage to previous occupation / industry. With a working spouse and relatively low risk
    of poverty (43 percent in bottom two quintiles), this group can be supported in re-linking
    with the qualifications, occupations and industries that they once gained their work
    experience in. Re-skilling will probably need to update functional skills (languages,
    communication, writing, ICT).
   Job Clubs and group search. Building on the life experience of this group, job search clubs or
    entrepreneurial start-up groups could be offered to some of these groups’ members.

   Self-employment from home. With spouses of these men employed and providing for the
    family income, opportunities for self-employment from home or local employment ought to
    be supported. Medium-sized commuting and mobility support could also be provided to allow
    for job-uptake in nearby regional centers (or with weekly commute) in towns further away in
    case a good-paying job can be secured to cover travel and extra housing cost.
Single poor rural unemployed women (7 percent, Priority: High). Compared to the previous
prioritized groups, only a subset (40 percent) of this group is registered as unemployed but no
member appears to report strong limitations to taking up work. With none of the households
containing a working adult, this group of mainly rural (86 percent) individuals (62 / 38 percent
female / male) has the highest poverty exposure in the sample (81 percent fall in the bottom two
quintiles). Owing to the absence or unemployment of spouses, households in this group do not
gain income from complementary work uptake. The share of benefit income in total household
income is correspondingly very high (64 percent). Members have work experience but 85 only
hold primary or secondary education. Potential activation measures for this group include the
following:

   Income support coupled with work and training opportunities. Given the high (and
    legitimate) benefit share in this group any approach to activation would probably need to be
    based on the existing income support programs in Lithuania and link them with community
    work and training offerings. In order to improve the skill and training level of this group, care
    must be taken to not just operate simple community public works programs.
   Mobility support and training. When coupled with training and skill-building, the members
    of this group could also be helped to find employment in regional or larger cities. This would
    require additional skill training on job search, basic functional skills and (temporary) mobility
    support for transportation or housing.
   Community employment and self-organization. Given the recent emphasis on
    “subsidiarity” and local community decision in social service provision in Lithuania, forms of
    self-organization for community work and social entrepreneurship could be promoted with
    members of this group. Guidance on this would probably need to be provided by PES or
    municipality staff.
Stay-at-home poor rural women (5 percent, Priority: Medium). This small group among the
prioritized shows a similar profile to the previous group of women, with the difference, that none
of their members is declared as unemployed and all of the households have a working adult in
their ranks. The group is 100 percent women and shows a very similar profile to their
unemployed “sisters” in terms of rural/urban split, age and education distribution. The vast
majority (79 percent) is married, but poverty exposure is much lower (63 percent in bottom two
quintiles) with 75 percent of spouses working and gaining a decent income (4300 EUR). Share of
labor in household income is correspondingly high (68 percent) and the benefit income can be
legitimately attributed to the presence of children (53 percent have children below 6 years old) in
the household. Potential activation measures for this group include the following:

   Similar approaches as for the previous group but coupled with child care offerings and
    community care provision. In light of the significant child caregiving responsibility
    exercised by these households, any approach to further labor market activation must assist
    these women to combine (part time) work with child care.




238 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
In general, further policy dialogue with the Lithuanian authorities ought to focus on areas that
enable the government and its agencies, municipalities and other labor market actors to better
deploy their resources, increase coordination and improve the staffing and resource situation of
services. Some of these areas for future dialogue include:

   Focus on non-urban areas. Labor market exclusion in Lithuania is a predominantly rural
    phenomenon. Almost all of the groups identified in the Latent Class Analysis show a rural
    share of well over 65 percent, some of the groups prioritized for activation even shares of
    over 80 percent. Creation of jobs in secondary cities, transport links and (temporary) mobility
    support to regional or large centers within Lithuania or toward the neighboring countries
    must be among the potential answers to this situation
   Mobility is key. When considering mobilizing more of its citizens for the labor market,
    Lithuania ought to make mobility within the country (and to near-abroad countries) a key
    priority. Being able to connect to regional economic centers or to (temporarily) seek
    employment in a neighboring country can help to reintegrate unemployed but also to prevent
    skill loss and “scarring” among young jobseekers.
In summary, Lithuania could benefit from maintaining a labor market centric activation approach
toward its rural out-of-work population, especially in light of the demographic developments
taking place.

                                Work Population in Romania
                                                                             2008−2011
Background

After a period of high growth, Romania experienced a severe economic contraction in 2009 and
has not yet recovered to its previous level of economic growth. During the period from 2003 to
2008, the Romanian economy grew at very high rates—an average of 6.6 percent per year,
compared to 2.2 percent per year among EU-28 countries. However, as in the other countries in
the region, in 2009 the crisis hit hard and output contracted by 6.6 percent. Only in 2011 was GDP
growth back to a positive level, of 2.3 percent. In 2013 the economy grew 3.5 percent, only
surpassed in the region by Latvia (which grew 4.1 percent).

Unemployment rose following the crisis, but the increase was low in comparison to the
sharp fall in output. From 2003 to 2008, unemployment was, on average, 7.3 percent; in 2008 it
reached its lowest level at 6.1 percent. After the crisis hit the Romanian economy in 2009,
unemployment only marginally increased, reaching 7.6 percent in 2013. This pales in comparison
to the dramatic rise in unemployment following the crisis that many European countries
witnessed. Moreover, labor force participation, albeit low by European standards, remained fairly
constant following the crisis, between 63 and 65 percent.96

However, youth experienced a sharp rise in unemployment. Figure 8.1 shows that
unemployment rates were falling steadily, particularly among youth, prior to the crisis. The
percentage of young individuals aged 15 to 24 that were not in employment, education, or
training (the NEET rate) reached its lowest level of the decade in 2008—11.6 percent. However,
when the crisis hit Romania, youth felt most of the impact. Overall unemployment reached 7.7
percent in 2011, representing a 1.6 percentage point increase from pre-crisis levels. Youth
unemployment, on the other hand, peaked at 23.7 percent in 2011, almost 5 percentage points
above its pre-crisis level. After a downward trend between 2003 and 2008, the NEET rate also
increased, returning in 2012 to the same level it had been in 2005.




96Prior to the crisis, the labor force participation rate in 2008 was 62.9 percent. In 2013, it reached 64.6
percent.

A look at unemployment rates disaggregated by gender shows that women were generally
more affected by the crisis. As shown in Figure 8.2, unemployment rates are usually lower for
women. However, the economic downturn affected women most, especially those in the 50- to 64-
year old group, whose unemployment rate grew from 1.9 to 3.3 percent between 2008 and 2010,
representing an increase of over 70 percent. Unemployment rates for men in this age group, in




242 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
contrast, only increased by 18 percent. Women aged 15 to 24 and 25 to 49 also experienced
higher proportional increases in unemployment than men in the same age group.

Despite the relatively small change in overall unemployment rates observed during the
crisis, one of the most worrisome results was the change in the duration of unemployment,
with a significant increase in the share of long-term unemployed. Long-term unemployment
as a share of total unemployment hit a low of 31.6 percent in 2009; since then the share has risen
to 46.4 percent (as shown in Figure 8.3). The relatively small effect of the crisis on unemployment
figures thus appears to be hiding more negative conditions in the labor market.

Although overall employment levels remained relatively stable following the crisis,
individuals with tertiary education experienced declining employment rates, while their
supply increased. After peaking at 59 percent in 2008, employment rates remained relatively
unchanged, with their lowest post-crisis rate being 58.5 percent in 2011. In contrast, the
employment rate for individuals with tertiary education reached its lowest point for the 2003–
2013 in 2013, at 81.4 percent, down from 85.7 percent in 200897.

What is more, between 2008 and 2013, unemployment rates doubled for individuals with tertiary
education. Deteriorating labor market outcomes for the most educated might also reflect lower
experience, since youth is usually the more educated group. Nonetheless, although those with less
education were less affected during the crisis in terms of relative changes, it is worth noting that,
at least in terms of levels, labor market outcomes have generally favored those with higher
education. In the meantime, the Romanian labor force has become more educated, reflecting the
fact that youth entering the labor force (and replacing the workers who retire) are more educated.

97   In 2013 this rate was 82.4 percent.

However, as reported previously, youth have also been the most affected by the crisis, and their
higher levels of education have not resulted in improved labor market prospects overall.

During the period from 2008 to 2011, the sample of the out-of-work population considered in this
note decreased, from 4.2 to 4.1 million individuals. The analysis of the out-of-work population in
this note focuses on the working-age population (16–64 years old). Specifically, only individuals
aged 25 to 64 years who are not employed, and individuals aged 16 to 24 who were neither
employed nor in education nor training were considered.98 Only the working-age population (16–
to 64-year olds) is analyzed, as labor activation options—the main policy focus of this note—are
only viable for that segment of the population. As a percentage of the population of working age
under analysis, the out-of-work population fell from 32.3 percent to 31.2 percent. The three
groups of the out-of-work population that became smaller during this period were the groups of
disabled, short-term unemployed and other inactive, which decreased in size by 37, 21 and 8
percent, respectively. On the other hand, the number of long-term unemployed grew by 27
percent (see Table 8.1). Figure 8.4 shows the composition of the out-of-work population in
Romania in 2008 and 2011.

98Individuals aged 16 to 24 who are out of work and enrolled in education are considered to be investing in
their final stages of human capital formation and therefore not a particular target group for activation
policies. In 2011, this population amounted to about 1,517,000 individuals, representing 58.5 percent of the
total population aged 16 to 24 and 27 percent of the total out-of-work population of working age.

Methodology: Latent Class Analysis

In Chapter 1 a general overview of the latent class analysis methodology was presented. This
section explains in detail the variables and covariates used to identify classes or groups of out-of-
work individuals that are as homogeneous as possible within each class according to a set of
observable characteristics, and as distant as possible between classes. The emerging profiles can
then be contrasted with the design and targeting of current activation policies, in order to identify
the potential gaps and to enhance their design features.99

Variable selection: The definition of latent classes relies on a number of indicator variables to
capture different “symptoms” of an overall latent condition (in this case, the typology of
joblessness). The challenge in such models is to identify a discrete number of variables that can
best explain the heterogeneity of individual outcomes. In this case, two sets of categorical
variables were selected: the first set to show the extent of labor market distance and the other to
capture some of the main factors that can affect employment on the supply side, such as labor
supply conditions (household-level incentives to work and physical ability to work).

      Distance from labor market: short-term unemployment, long-term unemployment,
       (early) retirement, disability, and other inactivity (largely unpaid domestic work).100
      Work experience: if individual has worked before and, in this case, whether worked for
       two or more months in the last year;
      Labor supply conditions: whether the individual’s household has at least one working
       adult,101 and perceived limitations on activities due to health problems.102

In addition to indicators, the model includes active covariates, which are used to improve the
classification of individuals in each class. In this case the active covariates are the demographic
variables that are normally used to disaggregate labor market outcomes:

          Age-group category (four groups)
          Gender
          Human capital: the highest educational level achieved
          Urban/rural location

Once the latent classes have been defined, inactive covariates that were not included in the model
can be used to characterize the individuals in each class and the households in which they live.
The inactive covariates chosen describe those characteristics that may provide valuable
information for the design of tailored policies that address barriers to employment, including
income level. They include:

          Household welfare conditions:

99 For the latest developments on active inclusion in Romania, see EC (2013b).
100 This variable is constructed using the self-reported current work status in the EU-SILC survey that has
four categories: at work, unemployed, retired and inactive. The unemployed are further classified into short-
and long-term based on how long they have been actively looking for a job. The inactive is combined with
another question to separate this group into students, disabled, military and other inactive.
101 In order to construct this variable, individuals aged 25 or older are considered adults.
102 This is a binary variable that takes the value one if an individual answered “yes, strong limitations” to

whether they had been hampered in their usual activities because of health problems for at least the last six
months. The value is zero if the answer is “yes, limited” or “no, not limited.”

103 The equivalized household income takes into account an equivalence factor to weight the number of
household members used in the denominator when calculating household income per capita. The first adult
aged 18 or over has a weight of 1.0, children under 14 have a weight of 0.3, and other individuals 14 and
older have a weight of 0.5. The sum of the weights of all household members is equal to the equivalent
household size.
104 Note that income reported in EU-SILC surveys is for the year preceding the survey year.
105 Total household gross income is defined as the sum of: (at the individual level) gross employee cash or

near-cash income; company car, gross cash benefits or losses from self-employment (including royalties);
unemployment benefits; old-age benefits; survivor benefits; sickness benefits; disability benefits; education
allowances; and (at the household level) income from rental of property or land; family/children related
allowances; social exclusion not elsewhere classified; housing allowances; regular inter-household cash
transfers received; interests, dividends, profit from capital investments in unincorporated business;
pensions from individual private plans; and income received by people under 16. Total household net
income, in turn, was calculated by subtracting from total household gross income regular taxes on wealth,
taxes on income and social insurance contributions, and regular inter-household case transfers paid.
106 Social benefits are aggregated in eight branches using the European System of integrated Social

PROtection Statistics (ESSPROS) definitions. For more information, see Eurostat (2011).
107 According to EU-SILC guidelines, dense areas have more than 500 inhabitants per square kilometer,

where the total population for the set is at least 50,000 inhabitants. Intermediate areas have more than 100
inhabitants per square kilometer, and either a total population for the set of at least 50,000 inhabitants or a
location adjacent to a dense area. The remaining areas are categorized as sparsely populated.

Group labeling. The resulting groups are then labeled according to the greatest proportional
characteristics within groups that also aid in distinguishing among groups. Granted, a large
number of characteristics describe these groups, and only a few are taken into account for the
purpose of labeling. In part, some of these characteristics may exhibit a large degree of
heterogeneity and may thus not be relevant for defining a group. Additionally, some
characteristics may be more relevant for the purposes of policy design than others. In short,
though the labeling of groups can be considered more an art than a science, when taken together
with detailed descriptions of a group’s most prominent characteristics, labeling can serve as an
important starting point in the design and prioritization of activation policies.

The analysis relies on cross-sectional as well as panel data from the European Union Statistics of
Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) surveys for 2008–2011, which combine individual-level
information with household characteristics. The first part of the note presents a cross-sectional
analysis for the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. In particular, the latent class analysis on 2008
data shows the main characteristics of the out-of-work before the global economic crisis hit
Romania, and thus highlight what could be considered more structural issues of the country’s
labor market. The 2011 latent class analysis will contrast this initial assessment with more recent
developments. The second part of the note exploits longitudinal data between 2008 and 2010 108
to trace the prior labor market status of individuals observed last in 2010 in various classes, and
will shed light on the relative persistence in the out-of-work status among different classes of
individuals. The set of variables chosen for the cross-section and the longitudinal analysis are
slightly different, due to minor differences in the set of variables recorded in each of the two types
of datasets.




108 The EU-SILC longitudinal survey consists of a four-year rotating panel. In each year, approximately three-

quarters of individuals present in the previous year are retained. The samples used in the latent class
analysis include about 3,000 observations for each year in the cross-sectional analysis and 500 observations
in the longitudinal analysis. The population is weighted with individual weights.

Main Findings

Out-of-Work Population: Group Profiles from Cross-Sectional Analysis
The latent class analysis supports the classification of the out-of-work into eight major groups,
some of which have remained stable over time. The groups were named according to their most
salient characteristics. Figure 8.5 shows the share of each of the eight classes identified for the
year 2011 while Table 8.2 presents their most salient characteristics.

Note: Percentages in parentheses following the group names refer to the share of the total out-of-work
population.” Years of work experience” refer only to those individuals who have worked before. “Dependent
children” include children under 18 and household members aged 18 to 24 who are economically inactive and
living with at least one parent. “Working adult” refers to adults aged 25 and over. For this report’s purposes, we
define the at-risk-of-poverty rate as the relative risk of being in the first quintile of the income distribution. The
reference period for income reported in EU-SILC surveys is the year preceding the survey year.


The eight main clusters emerging from the LCA analysis in 2011 can be characterized as follows
(see Annex 2 for more detail, including the full list of inactive covariates):

              Cluster 1: Retirees. This group of retired individuals has represented between 21
               and 27 percent of the out-of-work throughout the years analyzed. It is largely made
               up of females (58 percent), and as of 2009, it generally includes individuals who have
               hit retirement age (60–64).109 They can be considered low- to mid-skilled, with 38
               percent having less than an upper secondary education and half having upper or
               post-secondary education. On average, they have 33 years of work experience. Even
               though 62 percent do not have at least one working adult in their household they are
               at very low risk of poverty,110 with only 8 percent living in the bottom income
               quintile. In part, this can be explained by the fact that they live in households without
               dependent children (17 percent also live alone) and almost all receive old-age
               benefits. On average, benefits make up 77 percent of their total gross household
               income.




109The retirement age in Romania is 59 for women and 64 for men.
110Risk of poverty is here understood as the relative probability of living in the poorest income quintile. By
definition, 20 percent of the population lives in this quintile; risk is thus gauged relative to a benchmark of
20 percent.




                                                                         Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 251
             Cluster 2: Early retirees. This class represents 24 percent of the out-of-work
              population in 2011, and its relative size has remained fairly stable over time.111 Its
              members are almost exclusively early retirees between the ages of 45 and 59.
              Although less than one-third report strong limitations on capacity to work, one-half
              receive disability benefits; forty-two percent also report receiving old-age benefits.
              Like their retired counterparts, they are mostly female (59 percent) and, on average,
              have a similar number of years of work experience (27 years). However, they are
              somewhat more educated than the retirees, with 73 percent having completed upper
              or post-secondary school. Although more than half (57 percent) have at least one
              working adult in the household, benefits still represent most of total household gross
              income (61 percent). Their relatively small households also explain why only 12
              percent live in the bottom income quintile, putting them at a very low risk of poverty.

             Cluster 3: Low-educated rural mothers without work experience. Representing 19
              percent of the out-of-work in 2011, this group makes up the larger of two groups of
              inactive women, the other being inactive middle-aged wives. What mainly sets this
              group’s members apart from those of the smaller group is their relative youth (84
              percent are between 20 and 44 years of age) and the fact that a great majority (83
              percent) have children, with a large percentage (43 percent) having children under 6
              years of age. They are largely concentrated in rural areas (77 percent), most have a
              working partner, and almost all (91 percent) have at least one working adult in their
              households. They are also more likely to have never worked before (78 percent), and
              a significant proportion of them (46 percent) have not completed upper secondary
              school. Finally, this group is characterized by very high benefit receipt: seventy-six
              percent receive family/child benefits. Nonetheless, on average benefits represent 28
              percent of their total household income, the lowest percentage among all identified
              groups. Low benefit generosity, as well as their large families (4.7 members on
              average) in part explain why 43 percent are in the poorest income quintile.

             Cluster 4: Inactive middle-aged wives. This smaller group of inactive women made
              up 15 percent of the out-of-work in 2011, and represented as little as 8 percent of
              our sample in 2010. They are middle-aged (77 percent are between 35 and 54)
              married women who for the most part have children (64 percent), although only 20
              percent have children under 6. Most (60 percent) have not worked before, but they
              have more years of work experience than their younger counterparts and are also
              better educated, with over half having completed upper or post-secondary education.
              They are more likely to be married than their younger counterparts but also less
              likely to have a working adult within the household. They, too, are concentrated in
              rural areas, though less so than their younger counterparts. In terms of welfare,
              although they live in smaller households (4.0 members on average) than the low-
              educated rural mothers without work experience, they have slightly lower labor
              incomes on average, and a lower percentage (56 percent) receives family/child
              benefits. Overall, they have a similar income profile as the younger inactive women,
              with as many as 39 percent in the bottom income quintile.



111 With the exception of 2009, when the early retirees were grouped together with a number of “other
inactive” individuals and grew to represent 32 percent of the out of work. This group is thus labeled as early
retirees and inactive in 2009.

   Cluster 5: Long-term unemployed educated single youth. Representing 7 percent
    of the out-of-work in 2010 and 2011, this group consists of mostly men (67 percent
    in 2011) between the ages of 20 and 29 and resembles the unemployed youth who
    have been particularly hit by the economic crisis across the EU. About 55 percent of
    them are long-term unemployed, and another third are out of the labor market.
    Some of them could be discouraged workers. In 2011, this group stood out as having
    the highest percentage of members with a tertiary education (24 percent). Their lack
    of work experience may thus explain their long-term unemployment status: almost
    90 percent have never worked before. Aside from being young, the members of this
    group are for the most part single and still living at home with their parents. Even
    though they live in households where there is at least one working adult and just
    over half receive family/child benefits and one-third receive social exclusion benefits
    at the household level, a very high percentage of this group is still at a risk for
    poverty: Forty-eight percent are in the poorest quintile. In part, this is explained by
    the fact that they live in large households with 4.8 members on average.

   Cluster 6: Working-age long-term unemployed. This group only emerged in 2010
    and represents 5 percent of the out-of-work. Its members are primarily men (72
    percent) in their prime age (25 to 54) who have largely been unemployed for over 12
    months (74 percent). The majority are married (66 percent) and a smaller majority
    (56 percent) live in households with dependent children. They are mid-skilled
    individuals (66 percent have completed upper secondary) and have previous work
    experience. Another characteristic of this group is its high dependence on benefits.
    Although just over half have a least one working adult in the household, benefits
    represent over half of their total household income (one-half of these receive
    family/child benefits, about a third receive social exclusion benefits, and one-fifth
    receive unemployment benefits). Despite high benefit receipt, a large percentage (46
    percent) are in the bottom income quintile. Finally, it is notable that this group is
    relatively more urban, with 50 percent living in urban areas.

   Cluster 7: Working-age newly unemployed. This group, representing 3 percent of
    the out-of-work in 2011, closely mirrors the group of working-age long-term
    unemployed. What primarily sets them apart is the fact that they worked for at least
    two months during the last year, meaning that they have just recently lost their jobs.
    They have a similar education profile to their long-term unemployed counterparts
    and are primarily in their prime age, although they are somewhat younger (72
    percent are in their prime age and 19 percent are under 25). Although they are
    somewhat less likely to be married, two-thirds live in households with dependent
    children. However, due to high labor income within their households, unlike their
    long-term unemployed counterparts they are at a relatively low risk for poverty, with
    only 18 percent in the bottom quintile. A majority receive family/child benefits (56
    percent) and one-fifth receive social exclusion benefits. Despite the fact that they are
    newly unemployed, only one-sixth receive unemployment benefits, in contrast to
    one-fifth of the long-term unemployed. Before 2010, the members of this group
    belonged to the working-age newly unemployed or inactive.

   Cluster 8: Low-educated and rural disabled. This group, representing from 3 to 5
    percent of the out-of-work population, reports its labor market status as disabled (71
    percent) or retired (18 percent), and has very low education levels. A majority (67

             percent) also report strong limitations on work due to a health condition. In terms of
             benefit receipt, the most commonly received by this group are disability benefits (67
             percent) and family/child benefits (46 percent). Benefit dependency is high, with
             benefits representing 54 percent of total household income. The members of this
             group are also characterized by the absence of a partner and live in households
             without a working adult. They are at high risk of falling in poverty, with 39 percent
             belonging to the poorest income quintile. The great majority live in rural areas.

The composition of the identified classes of out-of-work population has experienced
considerable changes over the last few years. In Figure 8.6 and Table 8.5, clusters are
compared over time between 2008 and 2011, both as a share of the total out-of-work
population and in absolute numbers. From the graph, the first important observation is that
the size of the out-of-work population has not increased—it has actually decreased by a bit
more than 100,000 individuals, or 2.5 percent. Furthermore, the same clusters are not
identified in all years, and some of the clusters identified in 2011 that were present in
previous years underwent changes in relative size and also in composition. The fact that the
composition of the groups changes over time is particularly important to keep in mind when
interpreting changes in group size. For instance, significant increases (decreases) in group
size are sometimes due to reassignments of individuals across groups, resulting in changes
in group composition. Thus, although some groups may retain similar names across years
due to their most salient characteristics, they may nonetheless vary in their composition
across years. The evolution in terms of group size and group composition over the 2008–
2011 period can be summarized as follows:

          One striking change is the increase in unemployment, especially in its nature,
           from short to long-term unemployment. The cluster of working-age long-term
           unemployed appears for the first time in 2010.112 Its size is comparable to the
           existing cluster of unemployed men. Thus, when considering the two clusters of
           prime-aged unemployed (short and long-term) together, the absolute number of
           unemployed in their prime age more than doubled in size between 2008 and 2010.
          Another important change during the crisis period was the increase in the size
           of the youth cluster. In 2009, a new group of out-of-work youth emerged (the
           group labeled as “educated unemployed or inactive youth”) alongside the already
           existing group of long-term unemployed single youth). The result was a 30 percent
           increase over 2008 in the absolute size of the out-of-work youth population
           identified in our analysis. This situation was reversed in the following two years,
           when once again only one youth cluster was identified; however, by 2011, the total
           number of out-of-work youth still remained about 4 percent higher than in 2008.
           Moreover, it is worth noting that the youth cluster identified in both 2010 and 2011
           represented relatively educated youth. Specifically, in 2008, 72 percent of the group
           of long-term unemployed single youth was composed of individuals with upper
           secondary or post-secondary education, and only 2 percent of them had attained
           tertiary education. In 2009, this group was split along two lines: a more educated
           cluster (educated) unemployed or inactive youth (36 percent of which had tertiary
           level education), and a group of long-term unemployed single youth. In 2010 they
           appear together in one cluster again, but represent a more educated group: 15
           percent have tertiary level education.
          The cluster of retirees became smaller, probably due to an improvement in its
           differentiation from the other clusters. Between 2008 and 2011, the group of
           retirees became 15 percent smaller. However, in 2008, 68 percent of the individuals
           in this cluster were 60 to 64 years old, while 32 percent of them were between 35
           and 59 years of age and had for the most part not reached retirement age.113 In


112   Before 2010, the only group identified as long-term unemployed consisted of youth.
113   As previously mentioned, the current retirement age in Romania is 59 for women and 64 for men.

         2011, this cluster became composed of individuals who were likely to have reached
         retirement age, with 94 percent aged 60 to 64.
        The cluster of early retirees has remained roughly comparable in absolute size
         to the retirees cluster itself; both represented around one million people. In
         2008, 19 percent of the individuals in this cluster declared strong health-related
         limitations on their capacity to work; in 2011 this share increased to 28 percent.
         The percentage receiving disability benefits also increased during the period, rising
         from 41 percent to 49 percent. Another significant change occurred after 2008,
         when the share of males in this group fell from 60 percent to about 40 percent. Of
         note also is the fact that in 2009, the group of retirees incorporated a large number
         of “other inactive” individuals also aged 45 to 54, constituting a separate group
         labeled as retirees and inactive.
        The size of the combined groups of retired individuals fell between 2008 and
         2011. Together, the early retirees and the retirees made up about 2.1 million people
         in 2008. By 2011, this number had fallen by 7 percent, to 1.9 million individuals.
         Although the largest fall in numbers appears to be among the retirees, it is important
         to recall that, in 2008, the group of retirees incorporated a significant share of early
         retirees.
        The two groups of retirees (retirees and early retirees) demonstrate the
         lowest share of household poverty (members of the cluster in the poorest
         income quintile) with 8 and 12 percent respectively. While the average old-age
         pension payment in Romania was below EUR 200 in 2013 (Government of Romania,
         2013), the relative small household sizes (2.77 and 3.36 respectively (the lowest
         among all the 8 groups)) and the regularity of the old-age payment contributed to
         the low poverty exposure experienced by this cluster compared to the other out-of-
         work clusters in this analysis. Partner labor income appears to play a minor role in
         the welfare condition of these households, as 90 percent of retirees and 72 percent
         of early retirees either have no partner or no working partner. This is reflected in the
         fact that the benefit share of household income among these two groups is the
         highest among all the 8 groups.
        Finally, the group of inactive middle-aged wives increased by 50 percent
         during the period, from 400,000 to 600,000 individuals in 2011. Not only has
         its size changed but also its characteristics. In 2008, 85 percent were living in
         households with at least one working adult, 99 percent had worked before, and
         benefits represented 23 percent of the total household income. In 2011, 78 percent
         of them were living in households with a working adult, 60 percent had never
         worked before and benefits represented one-third of their household income.
        On the other hand, there was a decrease in the size of the cluster of low-
         educated rural mothers without work experience, whose absolute number was
         reduced by 320,000 individuals—around 30 percent of its size in 2008. Some
         characteristics slightly changed, since 91 percent had a working adult present in the
         household in 2011 compared to 77 percent in 2008, and the share receiving
         family/child benefits increased from 67 percent to 76 percent. Moreover, in 2008,
         88 percent did not have prior work experienced, compared to 78 percent in 2011. It
         is apparent that across time, some reassignments took place between this group of
         stay-at-home women and the previously mentioned group, inactive middle-aged
         wives.

Structural Aspects and Emerging Trends in the Profiles of the Out-of-work

The clusters identified in the out-of-work population for the period from 2008 to 2011
reflect both structural and cyclical aspects of the labor market. This section identifies some
of the key structural aspects of the Romanian labor market and uses cross-sectional and
longitudinal analysis of clusters of the out-of-work population to further examine the effects
of the crisis.

Among youth, not only is unemployment high and employment low, youth labor force
participation rates in Romania are among the lowest in the EU. Since 2008, Romania’s
NEET rate has increased by 5.6 percentage points, reaching 17.2 percent in 2013. Youth
labor force participation rates, at only 30.8 percent in 2013, are well below the EU average of
42.2 percent (Figure 8.7). In part, low labor force participation and employment rates among
youth reflect a full-time work tradition in Romania. In many EU countries, youth have higher
labor force participation rates because they are able combine their studies with part-time
work. For example, as many as 75 and 40 percent of youth in the Netherlands and Slovenia,
respectively, report working part time (Dimitrov and Duell, 2013). In Romania, in 2013, only
about 18 percent of youth (15 to 24 years old) reported working part-time (Eurostat).

Retired individuals make up almost half of the out-of-work population analyzed in
this note, but about half of retirees have not reached retirement age. In the working-age
sample used in this analysis, two main clusters of retirees emerge, representing almost half
of the out-of-work population. This may in part reflect that a relatively high percentage of
population aged 15 to 64 has already reached retirement age. Retirement comes a very
young age in Romania, especially for women, who become eligible at 59 (the male retirement

age is 64). However, about half of those retired people are considered early retirees: among
this group of early retirees, 35 percent are 45 to 54 years old and 57 percent are 55 to 59
years old. In fact, labor force participation for people aged 55 to 59 are among the lowest in
the EU (see Figure 8.8). In the case of individuals 55 and 64 years old, rates are 10
percentage points lower than the EU-27 average of 54.5 percent. Such low labor force
participation rates are having an effect on old-age benefits. As shown in Figure 8.9, between
2008 and 2010, expenditures on old age benefits as a share of GDP increased by 1.5
percentage points (reaching 7.5 percent), which represents twice the growth for the EU-27
average in the same period. As the working-age population shrinks and life expectancy rises,
raising the retirement age and increasing labor force participation among older individuals
may prove vital to counteract a shrinking workforce and rising old-age benefit outlays.

Inactive women, many of whom are in their prime age, represent one-third of the out-
of-work. Inactivity among women is a structural issue in Romania, as labor force

participation rates for women of working age were around 55 percent even before the crisis.
In comparison to other European women, Romanian women of prime age (25 to 54) are 7
percentage points less likely to participate in the labor market; only in Italy and Malta are
labor force participation rates among women of prime age lower (Figure 8.10). Data from
Eurostat also show that among European countries, children in Romania are the least likely
to be enrolled in formal child care. However, factors other than lack of available child care
seem to be at play in the low labor force participation of Romanian women, as the
percentage of women who report being active due to personal and family responsibilities is
under 10 percent, compared to an average of over 15 percent within the European Union
(Eurostat, LFS 2012). Women have important potential for increasing the labor force,
especially as Romania, like other European countries, faces a shrinking population of
working-age individuals.

Finally, with respect to the unemployed two main patterns emerged: an absolute
increase in the number of individuals in unemployed groups, and the appearance of a
cluster of long-term unemployed. One of the most concerning developments between
2008 and 2011 is the increase in the number of unemployed individuals in the out-of-work
population. Consider that in 2008 only 57 percent of the 185,000 people in the working-age
newly unemployed or inactive group were unemployed (that is, around 100,000 people in
their prime age were unemployed). By 2011 this number had increased by almost three
times. Long-term unemployment not only imposes a significant financial burden on
households, but affects the long-term health status of job-seekers, negatively impacts
Government finances, and results in a lower overall long-term level of skills among a
country’s workforce, with permanent negative effects on productivity (Katz, 2010). Equally
worrisome, many individuals who have been unemployed for extended periods become
discouraged and drop out of the labor market altogether. In fact, a significant proportion of
the groups labeled as unemployed are inactive: around one-sixth of the groups in their prime
age and around one-third of the group of young men. It is possible that many of these
individuals are discouraged workers. Addressing the plight of the long-term unemployed
should be among the policy priorities for Romanian policymakers.

Another topic of immediate concern to policy makers in the Government of Romania is the
situation of the working poor. While this group is by design not the focus of this report on
the unemployed and out-of-work, some salient facts about them (working households that
are in the bottom 20 percent of income distribution, regardless of their inclusion in one of
the clusters of this report) can help to illustrate their labor market and social situation. From
the EU-SILC data, a picture emerges that shows a mainly middle-aged (83 percent between
25 and 59), majority male (64 percent), very low-educated (over 50 percent with only
primary or lower secondary education) and almost fully rural (92 percent) population. Their
household income is mainly derived from labor income (72 percent).




264 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
Out-of-Work Population: Group Profiles from Longitudinal Analysis

In order to better understand the dynamics within clusters and other labor market
movements, LCA analysis was also applied to longitudinal EU-SILC data for the period 2008–
2010. The EU-SILC survey allows the tracking of individuals in both 2008 and 2010, albeit
with a smaller sample size than that available in the cross-section surveys. The latent class
analysis of the out-of-work population in 2010 yielded similar results in terms of clusters,
although due to the reduced sample size, the number of clusters was also smaller. For a
sample of around 900 observations, six classes were defined:

       •   Low-educated rural inactive women without work experience (34 percent)
       •   Retirees (24 percent)
       •   Early retirees and inactive with previous work experience (23 percent)
       •   Low-educated and rural disabled or inactive (8 percent)
       •   Unemployed rural single youth (7 percent)
       •   Middle-aged low-educated unemployed (5 percent)

Annex 3 shows the full statistical description of the latent classes, while Table 8.6 below
summarizes the key features of each cluster.

A further advantage of the panel analysis is to provide information on the flow of individuals
among clusters and in and out of employment. Table 8.7 shows the flow of individuals into
each cluster of out-of-work population or into employment in 2010 according to their labor
market status in 2008. Between 2008 and 2010, 94 percent of the employed remained at
work. Indeed, there is also an interesting flow into employment among those who were
unemployed or inactive. In 2010, 42 percent of those who were classified as unemployed
and 32 percent who were classified as inactive in 2008 were found to be employed.

On the other hand, Table 8.8 shows the labor market status in 2008 for each cluster and at-
work population in 2010. Two main results emerge. First, for the cluster of unemployed rural
single youth, 46 percent were already unemployed in 2008, which might reflect difficulties in
entering the labor market for those starting professional careers. Second, the middle-aged
low-educated unemployed were the most affected by employment losses, with 34 percent of
them employed in 2008.

Box 9.1 Roma Population and Labor Market Exclusion in Romania

Labor market exclusion in Romania cannot be discussed without giving special
consideration to the situation of the country’s Roma population, a population that faces
significant structural barriers. Because EU-SILC data does not include a differentiating
indicator for Roma and non-Roma, the groups of out-of-work population identified in this
latent class analysis exercise cannot directly be linked to a Roma/non-Roma pattern. A
World Bank analysis forthcoming in the year 2014 titled Diagnostics and Policy Advice for
Supporting Roma Inclusion in Romania will provide a more focused analysis of the current
situation of Roma in Romania, including the employment dimension.

According to the most recent (2011) national census information, approximately 612,000
citizens declared themselves to be of Roma origin living in Romania (corresponding to 2.9
percent of the total population). This number reflects the lower bound of estimates, because
many Roma choose to not report their ethnicity in surveys. A 2010 estimate from the Council
of Europe put the number of Roma in Romania between 1.2 million and 2.5 million,
corresponding to 5.7 to 11.9 percent of the population. However, an increasing share of new
labor market entrants come from Roma families: depending on the estimates of the Roma
population;114 between 6 to 20 percent of labor market entrants in Romania today are Roma.
As the working-age population in Romania is projected to fall by 30 percent by 2050, this
share is expected to grow.

Members of the Roma minority are poor, vulnerable, and largely excluded from labor market
opportunities in Romania. According to the UNDP/European Commission/World Bank
regional Roma survey (2011), in 2011, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for Roma was 84 percent,
in contrast with 31 percent among non-Roma families living nearby, and with a national at-
risk-of-poverty rate of 22 percent. In the same year, the employment rate of the Roma stood
at only 42 and 19 percent, against 66 and 53 percent (respectively) for men and women
within the general population. Among the employed Roma, jobs are unstable and informality
is abundant: the regional Roma survey (2011) shows that only about 36 percent of Roma
employment115 is formal (based on a written contract or legal business documents) and
includes health and pension insurance. The survey also shows that unemployment rates are
also disproportionately high among Roma, standing at 28 and 43 percent for Roma men and
women respectively. The high rates of joblessness and unstable employment do not reflect
preferences: the vast majority of Roma express a desire for stable jobs, similar to the
responses by non-Roma neighbors, with 74 percent of Roma men and 76 percent of women
reporting a preference for “Secure employment but low paid” instead of “Having a higher
income but insecure and irregular.”



114 Estimates range from 535,140 (National Census in 2002) to [730,000–970,000], according to a
Romanian Government and World Bank 2005 survey called “The Roma Communities Social Map,” to
1,850,000, according to the EU Communication “An EU framework for National Roma Integration
Strategies up to 2020,” based on the data from of Council of Europe. Source: Strategy of the Government
of Romania for the Inclusion of the Romanian Citizens Belonging to Roma Minority; 2012–2020
115 The employed are defined as those who declared that they worked at least one hour last week (only

36 percent of the working-age population).




268 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
Unfavorable labor market outcomes among the Roma population can be in part explained by
a significant education and skills gap between Roma and non-Roma, which starts early in
life: in 2011, Roma enrollment in preschool education stood at 37 percent, compared to 63
percent for non-Roma children living nearby. Roma children’s opportunities for skills
development are further hindered by the high level of classroom-level segregation of Roma
pupils, with nearly a quarter of Roma children currently attending basic education in classes
where most of the children are Roma. Not surprisingly, only 10 percent of Roma adults
report having completed secondary education in 2011, compared to 58 percent of the non-
Roma living nearby. In addition to the skills gap, discrimination and other barriers also
hinder the employment of Roma: according to the Roma regional survey, among Roma who
looked for work in the past five years, 30 percent report that they experienced
discrimination because of their ethnicity, while only 11 percent of non-Roma living nearby
report the same.

The number of identified Roma who participated in Active Labor Market Policies
implemented by the Romanian Public Employment Service in 2013 stood at 72,000 (MLFSPE
communication to EC DG EMPL, May 7, 2014). About 4,200 persons were placed in
employment (60 percent in permanent and 40 percent in temporary contracts). Another 600
individuals were referred to training courses, counseling services or wage-subsidy schemes.
In 2013, two persons of Roma origin benefited from labor force mobility support, according
to MLFSPE.

Roma inclusion is not only a moral imperative, but also smart economics for Romania. With
an aging population, pension and health care costs are bound to increase in the near future.
Equal labor market opportunities could enable faster productivity growth, and could
contribute fiscal benefits through increased revenue from taxes and lower social assistance
spending. According to a World Bank estimate on the basis of 2008 data,116 assuming an
equal number of working-age Roma men and women, and that average wages in the
economy remain unchanged, equalizing labor market earnings in Romania for Roma could
result in potential economic benefits ranging between EUR 887 million and 2.9 billion
annually, and fiscal benefits ranging between EUR 202 million and 675 million annually.
Additionally, the social and economic inclusion of Roma is essential for Romania to meet its
EU2020 targets, as Roma are significantly poorer and more vulnerable than the non-Roma,
including their non-Roma neighbors.

From Profiling to Activation

Activation and Inclusion Policies in Romania

Activation and inclusion policies in Romania operate on a very low level of spending and are
mainly articulated around European programs. Policies for social inclusion include a whole
range of social assistance benefits that are often categorical in nature (EC, 2013) and are not
well targeted to the poorest sections of the population (only 17 percent of the social
assistance spending reached the poorest quintile of the population in 2009) (ibid). A
guaranteed minimum income (GMI) Program is better targeted but has relatively low
coverage of the poor (ibid). With the onset of the economic crisis and ensuing austerity
measures, benefit levels and budget allocations have been reduced a number of times.
Strategies for the coordination of social inclusion between policy areas are often formulated
in strategic documents for EU funds but are “not visible in the implementation” (ibid).

Labor market integration is (in theory) supported by activating design features of the
GMI. The design of the guaranteed minimum income program in Romania in theory supports
formal paid employment by anchoring the benefit well below a market wage rate and
offering a simple working benefit component. In reality, this work incentive is probably not
large enough to offset potential earnings from parallel informal employment (ibid).

Nominally, the National Employment Agency (NEA) is tasked with delivering public
employment services and activation policies. Functioning under the authority of the
Ministry of Labor, Family and Social Protection, the agency operates 41 county offices and
more than 150 local offices, as well as regional and national training centers. While a number
of priorities for training and activation have been articulated, the number of participants in
active labor market programs actually decreased after the start of the crisis (in line with
falling budget allocations, see Figure 8.11 and Figure 8.12 (ibid).

From the Annual Employment Action Plan of the NEA, a number of ALMPs can be derived;
but measurement of effectiveness appears limited (EC, 2013). With an overall beneficiary
base of 1.4 million in 2011, among the measures listed by the NEA are the following (all
placement data for 2011):

        Job fairs. About 360,000 job seekers are reported to have found employment after
         attending one of the job fairs. Job fairs are organized for specific categories of job
         seekers: young graduates, single professions, Roma, and so on.
        General counseling and job orientation. This form of service reportedly helped
         approximately 65,000 job seekers into employment.
        Training courses. These were offered for 35,000 participants, of whom 14,000 are
         reported to have been subsequently placed in employment.
        Job subsidies. Different job subsidies are reported to have brought 27,000
         participants into employment.
        Various other measures. These include mobility grants, incentives for graduate
         employment, and business start-up support; all were reported to have led to fewer
         than 5,000 employment placements.

Since spending on labor market policies is very low in Romania, passive policies make
up the bulk of spending. The economic crisis of 2008 precipitated a downward trajectory
in spending on ALMPs in Romania, which last stood at 0.029 percent of GDP, one of the
lowest figures in the EU. Passive payments for unemployment benefits responded to the
uptake in unemployment during the crisis starting in 2008. They have receded since, being
subject to cuts in benefit levels and tightening of eligibility requirements (Figure 8.13).

Activation Priority, Activation Type and Benefit Receipt by Group

When further considering the approach toward labor market integration, an assessment of
the priorities and potentials of the identified groups needs to be undertaken. Given the
precarious low level of resources for activation programs in Romania, further prioritization
of intervention is all the more important. This prioritization does not alleviate any of the
pressure to increase funding for a minimum set of intermediation and activation services in
the country.

After a first step (“activation priority”) of prioritizing the intervention along activation
need and activation potential, a second step (“activation type”) will attempt to classify the
groups according to the kind of activation intervention needed, depending on social or labor
market barriers to be overcome. Lastly, as a third step, information on household income
composition of the different groups will be used to assess potential cross-dependencies of
the benefit system with the labor market status and activation approaches.

Activation priorities. The table below gives an overview of the identified inactive classes
and their respective activation need and activation potential. The total number of persons
estimated in these clusters was about 4.1 million in 2011, representing 31.2 percent of the
working-age (16–64) population of Romania.

 In the table, activation need refers to a group’s level of need for inclusion in the labor
market in order to achieve income and reduce or end poverty. This parameter is mainly
driven by the poverty exposure of the household. Activation potential describes that group’s
ability or motivation to be included in the labor market. A high activation need could be
driven by high poverty risk (as in the case of the working-age long-term unemployed)
whereas a high activation potential could be driven by previous work experience or a
relatively good educational base (for example, the long-term unemployed single youth).
Overall priority for action can also be supported by the size of the group. In the end, this
matrix is a base for rationalizing a further policy discussion, and not an arithmetic exercise.

From this overview, a set of five priority groups arises: low-educated rural mothers without
work experience, inactive middle-aged wives, long-term unemployed educated single youth,
working-age long-term unemployed and working-age newly unemployed are classified as high
or medium priorities for activation. Their high priorities for activation stem mainly from
high activation needs, as expressed by strong exposure to poverty. At the same time, they
show (potential) labor market proximity by having acquired an education, not having
declared and inability to work or a particular disability, and by falling into the prime-age
bracket (compared to the large groups of retirees and the small group of disabled). Retirees,
early retirees and low-educated and rural disabled are not prioritized for activation measures
or policies due to their lower activation need (having reached official retirement age) and
potential (many report strong limitations on capacity to work).

When reviewing the receipt of disability benefits among the identified groups, a problematic
constellation can be identified for the early retirees. While only 1 percent of the group
declares disability as their labor market status and 28 percent of the group report “strong
limitations in physical ability,” 49 percent of the group’s members receive disability benefits.
A review of the disability/retirement status of this group could be an additional discussion
item when translating the findings from this analysis into possible policy action. While it
might be difficult to activate some of the members of this group out of their disabled and
prime working-age status (92 percent are between 35 and 59 years), special attention
should be paid to not increasing the number of younger disability recipients beyond the
absolute minimum necessary, and to tightly controlling inflow into this group.

Activation type. As a second step, the relative severity of labor market or social obstacles to
be overcome for labor market integration will serve as an orientation for activation
approaches.

When mapping the respective barriers for labor market integration faced by the five
prioritized groups, we can see that most of them are quite removed from the labor market by
virtue of their long inactivity, generally low qualifications or lack of work experience. The
two female groups face higher social barriers as to the availability of child care. Among the
other three groups (which are more male-dominated), the working-age newly unemployed
can (for now) be regarded as a more “market-ready” group. The two long-term unemployed
groups mainly face labor market and mobility barriers.

Household income composition. When analyzing the 2011 household income of the
prioritized groups, we can see that only a few groups show a benefit-share of household
income that could be an indication of excessive reliance on benefits: As already indicated, 49
percent of early retirees report receiving disability benefits while only 1 percent classify
themselves as disabled and only 28 percent report severe physical limitations on work
capacity. Other groups (working-age long-term unemployed or low-educated and rural
disabled) also have high benefit shares, but this can be seen as a correct function of the social
safety net because of legitimate limitations on self-supporting work. However, the fact that
the unemployed groups (long-term unemployed educated single youth, working-age long-term
unemployed and working-age newly unemployed) only receive an unemployment benefit in 8,




                                                                                                    Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 275
21 and 16 percent of cases, respectively, could be interpreted as a sign of a safety net or
insurance dysfunction.

Given the overall picture of benefit receipt revealed by EU-SILC data, the greatest need for
action emerges around a potential review of disability benefit allocation among early
retirees and on the adequacy of the unemployment benefit (especially for the “market ready”
newly unemployed groups.

Suggestions for Activation Measures and Further Analysis

This section sets out a set of potential activation measures for each of the priority groups.
Areas for further policy dialogue are also outlined. The suggestions below should be
considered as a starting point for further policy dialogue between EC DG EMPL, the
World Bank and the Romanian authorities, bearing in mind that the groups identified still
carry some heterogeneity that may affect the level and type of support required.
Accordingly, these suggestions are also not meant to be an exhaustive set of possible
activation measures.

It is important to keep in mind that the groups have been derived from the 2011 EU-SILC.
Since that time, general economic development, policy actions by the government of
Romania and European Commission country specific recommendations” might have already
reflected some of these policy suggestions or rendered them obsolete.

Low-educated rural mothers without work experience (19 percent, Priority: High).
Owing to the relatively young age of this group, it received an A priority. This is the largest
among the prioritized groups in Romania (776,000 members). It is almost exclusively female
(99 percent) and 77 percent rural. No member of this prime-aged group declared as
unemployed. Overall, there is little work experience in this group (78 percent of its members
have never worked). Eighty-six percent of the group has a primary or secondary education.

       Offer short ‘second chance’ schooling with a focus on professional skills. Given
        the fact that the secondary schooling of this group’s members did not translate into
        an immediate job start (most probably owing to family formation and child care
        responsibilities), and 75 percent of the group are between 16 and 34 years old,
        labor market activation could be based on linkage to simple, short, vocationally
        oriented school degrees. Ideally, these courses would be offered for about six
        months in local or regional schools or vocational schools. Child care offerings would
        need to be provided in parallel to the courses. For older women, potential “second
        chance” training, schooling or entrepreneurship offerings for this group will need to
        build on the “life experience” and skills already acquired by them.
       Improve child care offerings (partly through self-organization). Improved
        availability of child care and school after-care offerings would enable many of the
        women in this group to better participate in the labor market and to take part in
        professional training or entrepreneurship offerings. Some of the child care could be
        delivered via supported cooperatives from within the same group of women.
       Provide short-term work placement combined with training offerings. In
        proximity to urban or regional centers, potential beneficiaries from this group could
        be linked in short-term work placement programs.
Inactive middle-aged wives (15 percent, Priority: Medium). In terms of its makeup, this
group is similar to the previous group, the low-educated rural mothers without work
experience. The inactive middle-aged wives are also rural, are a bit older, have slightly more
work experience and a slightly higher share of secondary education (54 percent). Their rate
of marriage is also higher (85 percent) and they have slightly smaller households (4.0
members instead of 4.7). Households with children represent 64 percent of the cases, but the
share of children below six years of age is only half of the previous group (20 vs. 43 percent).

Owing to the great distance from the labor market of this group, any activation measure will
have to start with very basic professional skills and will need to include self-organization
and community approaches toward this group of women.

        ‘Second chance’ programs with focus on professional skills. For this group of
         middle-aged women, potential “second chance” training, schooling or
         entrepreneurship offerings will need to build on the “life experience” and skills
         already acquired instead of focusing on remedial school education.
        Community-based social work and entrepreneurship education. Given the
         structure of the local economy, self-employment, cooperative structures and
         entrepreneurship approaches need to be an important part of any labor market
         integration approach. Potential beneficiaries from this group could be assisted in
         forming cooperatives for local (social) services with support for professionalization.
        Social community self-organization and entrepreneurship. Potential
         employment opportunities for women from this group can also be generated
         through new and regionally-based forms of community self-organization and
         entrepreneurship. Groups of women could be assisted to form and operate
         cooperatives for local services (domestic, child care, elderly care, and so on).
        Short-term work placement combined with training offerings. In proximity to
         urban or regional centers, potential beneficiaries from this group could be linked to
         short-term work placement programs.
Long-term unemployed educated single youth (7 percent, Priority: High). This group is
mainly made up of men (66 percent) under the age of 35 who have very little work
experience (almost 90 percent have never worked). Despite a decent level of education (24
percent of the group has a tertiary degree), this group appears to have never taken root in
the labor market in the first place. The rural/urban split is only about 50/50 but at least the
urban portion of this group could be helped to better link to available employment in large
cities and regional centers. Despite mostly living with their parents, this group represents
the highest share of the lowest income quintile (48 percent). Potential activation measures
for this group include, but should not be limited to, the following:

        (Renewed) work placement in the field of study or specialization. Building on
         any initial experience or exposure to a specific professional (in technical education)
         or academic field, the members of this group could be linked to the labor market
         again via subsidized work placement with companies for a limited amount of time.
        Entrepreneurship support. Given the fact that some of this group’s members have
         relatively good formal and academic skills, the potential for self-employment and
         small firm creation should be supported.
        Community activism support for inactive youth. To prevent ‘scarring’ and
         further distancing from the labor market or any other form of activity, some
         members of this group could benefit from community-based and publicly supported
         volunteering or community types of work.
Working-age long-term unemployed (5 percent, Priority: High). This group is between
25 and 59 years old and 72 percent male. Again, the rural/urban split is exactly 50/50,
potentially supporting integration and attachment to employment for those in urban or
regional centers. Educational attainment is mainly upper secondary (61 percent), with some
11 percent having tertiary education. The members of this group have an average of 15



278 | Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion
years of work experience prior to their current unemployment. Potential activation
measures for this group include, but should not be limited to, the following:

       Build on work experience for training and work placement. Taking into account
        the years of work experience and potential industry or trade knowledge of the
        members of this group, training measures combined with temporary work
        placement in companies, nonprofits or social enterprises could help to strengthen
        labor market attachment.
       Support self-organization, entrepreneurship and cooperatives. As with some of
        the other groups, self-employment and entrepreneurship support can help some
        this group’s members to attain self-sufficient lives and improve their welfare.
       Strengthen social and functional skills. Building on any initial experience or
        exposure to a specific professional (in technical education) or academic field, the
        members of this group could be linked to the labor market via subsidized work
        placement with companies for a limited amount of time. In these placements, and
        the accompanying training, special emphasis should be placed on social and
        functional skills, foreign language, ICT skills, and so on.

Working-age newly unemployed (3 percent, Priority: Medium). This small group
registers the highest proportion of formally unemployed (75 percent), testimony to the
recent beginning of their unemployment spell and a potential indicator of immediate
interest in work. Men form the majority (68 percent) but women make up a good third of the
group. The group is majority rural and has mainly achieved a secondary education. With 15
years of work experience and recent attachment to formal employment, this group will
mainly need to be supported with mainstream job-search and self-mobilization assistance.
Potential activation measures for this group include, but should not be limited to, the
following:

       Job placement support via PES or private employment agencies. Given the fact
        that this group of job seekers is still quite close to the labor market because of the
        recent beginning of unemployment, initial support could be focused on skill
        certification, application support and job matching intermediation.

In general, further policy dialogue with the Romanian authorities ought to focus on the
general level and setup of resources devoted to labor market integration and activation of
the inactive and out-of-work. Within this discussion, a deeper conversation could be had
around specific measures for specific groups. The following three items appear especially
important:

       Integration with employment demand generation. While active labor market
        policies, activation and job-matching support can help to smooth friction in the
        labor market, they will not lead to stable and sustainable employment. Demand for
        jobs comes from the economic activity of firms and from the social sector.
        Integration with regional economic development policy is especially important.
       Bring “active” programs to scale. Reviewing the distribution between active and
        passive labor market spending as well as the overall spending level on productive
        inclusion will be a necessary prerequisite for any of the measures described in this
        note.

        Calibrate focus from “unemployment” to “inactivity.” While the headline
         unemployed stood at about 5 to 6 percent in Romania over the last few years, the
         identified inactive groups in this analysis represented over 30 percent of the
         working age population.
In summary, Romania could benefit from improving its knowledge of the composition and
socio-economic situations of different groups of out-of-work citizens, especially with a
unified view across traditional labor market categories (employed/unemployed) and social
inclusion dimensions (poverty, living conditions, access to services), because the two are
intrinsically linked, especially for the labor market’s most marginalized participants.

                                                 Brussels

A results workshop on the Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion (PoLME) study was held in
Brussels, Belgium, on May 26, 2014. The workshop’s title was “From comprehensive profiles
to tailored activation policies” and was jointly organized by the World Bank and the
European Commission, in order to present potential themes for discussion derived from the
study and receive inputs from national delegations and policy experts.

The list of participants included government counterparts from the participant countries of
Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania and Romania; policy experts and desk officers
from DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion; participants from other EC DG’s and
experts from the OECD, the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), and the Hungarian
Academy of Sciences.

In their opening remarks to the Workshop, Dr. Lieve Fransen (Director for Social Policy and
Europe 2020 at the European Commission’s DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion)
and Mamta Murthi (Country Director for Central Europe and the Baltic Countries at the
World Bank) provided a setting for the day’s discussion. In their remarks, they outlined the
cooperative approach between the Member States, the Commission and the World Bank in
achieving the results of the “Portraits” analysis. Dr. Fransen highlighted that the workshop,
participants would have the dual possibility to understand and challenge the applied
methodology but also to exchange insights on approaches in social and labor market policy
and national programming of European funds. Ms. Murthi framed the workshop’s policy
relevance by underlining the demographic challenges for most European countries and the
importance of integrated, competiveness, labor demand and labor supply policies.

Following the introduction, the World Bank PoLME Project Team presented two sessions
during the workshop. During the morning session, Ramya Sundaram discussed the
methodology as well as some of the results and limitations of the study. In the afternoon
session, Ulrich Hoerning presented the main findings of the cluster analysis and some policy
ideas for activation, based on the clusters’ needs, potentials and priorities for activation.

Speakers from the national delegations also contributed presentations. They partly
confirmed initial assessments from the joint country missions of the European Commission
and World Bank, validating country-specific findings and methodology, while identifying
greater needs for dialogue and analysis about potential policy responses and activation
approaches for different profiles. The main points from each country presentation and the
general plenary discussions are summarized as follows.

Greece
The Greek representative presented the country’s national strategies to tackle youth
unemployment. The focus of the presentation was on the group of highly educated youth
that is not in employment, education or training (NEETs).

As shown in Figure 9.1, there are different programs to support youth employment, lifelong
learning and entrepreneurship in Greece. It was shown that the majority of the beneficiaries
of the National Action Plan (NAP) receive guidance or job orientation, and another
considerable share benefit from support in the transition from education to work and from
vocational education to training.

For the period of 2014 to 2020, NAP target groups will include young people not in
employment, education or training; unemployed 30- to 64-year olds; long-term unemployed;
unemployed individuals with low educational qualifications; jobless households; working
mothers facing the risk of unemployment; and other vulnerable groups.

Lithuania
Officials from the Government of Lithuania presented the country’s experience with
measures for reducing youth unemployment. As shown in Figure 9.2, factors related to youth
unemployment are lack of work experience, lack of motivation, and displacement, while
some factors accounting for its reduction are skills matching, job creation and increase in
employability.

In Lithuania, youth unemployment has been decreasing, with youth participation in ALMPs
almost doubling in size, from 16.2 percent in 2011 to 31.3 percent in 2013. In 2012,
integrated solutions were implemented to reduce youth unemployment, such as vocational
guidance (career planning) services, labor market services and labor market monitoring,
analysis and evaluation. These initiatives involved different ministries: the Ministry of
Education and Science, the Ministry of Social Security and Labor, and the Ministry of

Economy. The success of these measures is reflected in the decreasing youth unemployment
rate, from 35.7 percent in 2010 to 21.9 percent in 2013, according to the country
presentation.

Estonia
The Estonian representative discussed a reform in Estonia’s incapacity for work scheme.
Because individuals with some level of incapacity are willing to work and employers are
ready to hire them, there was a discussion on how to provide a more individually oriented
approach and adapt the work environment for such people. Another change Estonia has
made is in the evaluation mechanism for applicants, which now focuses on a person’s work
ability and not their incapacity for work.

The graph shown in Figure 9.3 depicts the number of persons with permanent incapacity
and those in employment, disaggregated by the level of permanent incapacity. It was shown
that disabled people will get improved attention, with one managing authority—the
Unemployment Insurance Fund—being responsible for the evaluation of work capacity,
benefit payments, and the delivery of labor market services, rehabilitation and technical aid.

Romania
The Romanian delegation presented some details of the country’s social assistance system
reform. Two main points are highlighted in Figure 9.4: the Modernization Project and a new
benefit called “Minimum Insertion Income.”

The idea behind the modernization of the social assistance system is to strengthen
performance management, improve equity, improve administrative efficiency, and reduce
error and fraud. The new system, which will combine three benefits into only one, is
expected to start by January 2016.

Representatives of Romania also highlighted some activation incentives that have been
attached to existing benefits: requirements related to school attendance, which is now
compulsory for children in households receiving a family allowance (FA); an increase in the
guaranteed minimum income (GMI) by 15 percent if one member of the household is in the
labor market; and fiscal incentives for employers hiring elderly persons.

Hungary
The Hungarian representatives discussed the trends in their labor market indicators and
highlighted gaps between their performance and the performance of the EU-28 countries
(Figure 9.5).

Despite lagging labor market performance, they pointed out that active labor market
programs have been in the forefront since 2007. They presented the Social Renewal
Operative Program 1.1.2., whose objective is to improve the employability of a number of
disadvantaged groups with personalized, tailor-made, complex labor market programs: the
low-skilled, young and career-starters, those over 50 years of age, those returning from child
care, and those receiving social benefits.

Some of the main program elements are: wage subsidies, mobility support, training support,
training cost subsidies, child care during training, and services such as counselling,
orientation, information provision, mentoring, and entrepreneurship support. County labor
offices have developed own local program plans, matching the target groups’ needs and
reflecting local opportunities. Labor offices have developed individual, tailor-made
programme plans together with the participants, reflecting personal potentials and
challenges. The program has a decentralised financial allocation mechanism, reflecting local
labour markets employment situation.

For the second phase of the program, the expected result is the inclusion of a minimum of
110,000 participants, with a minimum of 16,500 Roma people; 32 percent of the participants
will be young people. In 2014 July, already 132,659 participants have been included, from
which 19,561 have been Roma.

Bulgaria
The Government of Bulgaria presented some measures that have been taken to increase
activity rates. They showed trends in their inactive population, which represented a major
challenge in the context of the economic crisis. In Bulgaria, the inactivity level was among the
highest in the European Union in 2010.

Policies have focused on training. There are two main programs: the national program
“Active Inactive Persons” (some details shown in Figure 9.6) and the grant scheme “Take
Your Life in Your Own Hands,” which focuses on increasing the activity and integration of
vulnerable, inactive and discouraged people into the labor market.

Salient points from the plenary discussions:
Methodological questions focused on the urban/rural divide described in many country
reports of the Portraits. Here participants were interested in the EU-SILC base data’s ability
to adequately measure the welfare of subsistence farming rural households. Other
comments focused on the prevalence of “passive” benefits in many countries, benefits that
do not carry an incentive for work uptake. Disincentives for (formal) work were further
reported to be aggravated in many countries by the wide use of informal work
arrangements. Another element of interest raised during the discussion was the
phenomenon of the “in-work-poor” (which is a challenge for many Member States but was
not captured by the current Portraits analysis because of a focus on the inactive and
unemployed). All of the Member States presentations elicited a series of questions and
comments from the participants. Discussions arose around the policy approaches to worker
incapacity insurance. Strategies of identifying and reclassifying working incapacity benefit
recipients were discussed. Also, the role of employers in labor market integration of hard-to-
place groups was regular point of interest. On the level of potential interventions, Member
State experts underlined the need to link any labor supply side support with general
economic development promotion policies and to focus entrepreneurship support to
individual recipients who would show a chance to succeed in a competitive market. Also it
was underlined the need to enhance the positive interaction between various policies for
successful labor market growth.

External Experts’ Points of View:
After the country presentations, academic experts commented on the findings, the
methodology, limitations and potential areas for further improvement. The first to speak
was Prof. Werner Eichhorst, Director of Labor Policy Europe, IZA, followed by Dr. Zsombor
Cseres-Gergely, from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Center for Regional and Economic
Studies, Institute of Economics. Among the salient points of comment were the following:

        Recognized the attractiveness of a holistic approach around social protection and
         labor policies;
        Underlined that heterogeneity still remains within the clusters, so deriving LCA
         profiles for policy planning does not substitute for individualized service provision
         to the citizen (in balance with fiscal affordability and administrative capacity);
        Stressed the importance of whole-economy/labor-demand side reforms to provide
         the economic dynamic to absorb the unemployed and inactive;
        Recommended application of a more extensive analytical approach to deriving
         policy recommendations from the descriptions of the profiling, underlining the need
         to address all levels of policy action: (i) whole- economy reforms, (ii) program-level
         ALMP type interventions, and (iii) benefits and services to individual citizens.

More specifically, Prof. Eichhorst commented that while the excluded out-of-work
population has expected characteristics such as low skills, lack of work experience, health
problems, age and gender, rural background and so on, there are some new and interesting
findings from the clusters, such as the urban/rural divide, the highly skilled unemployed in
Greece, the new population of prime-aged unemployed in Lithuania, the increase in the
number disabled and early retirees. Yet, the high heterogeneity within clusters indicates that
individual needs within each group may be quite different. Hence, he cautioned that there is
a risk of neglecting relevant target groups or subgroups when using LCA-type clustering to
identify activation potentials and priorities. In a social investment context, no individual
should be left behind, he said. Therefore activation policies should consider all policy action
levels, from overall structural policies, to medium-level ALMPs type interventions and tailor-
made policies derived from individual assessments.

Prof. Eichhorst also emphasized that the analysis is based on data from 2011, and that more
recent or ongoing changes may be relevant to setting policy. He concluded that structural
issues seem to be more relevant than cyclical ones and that more attention should be paid to
these general, structural policies and the policy recommendations derived from them. Many
of the policy suggestions derived from the Portraits profiles are focused only on the program
level, but structural policies have the potential to affect all the groups. Among the structural
policies he mentioned that should receive more emphasis: the importance of stimulating
labor demand and its flexibility; removing disincentives to work, particularly for second
earners and benefit recipients; and measures that tackle early retirement and urban
mobility, among others.

Dr. Zsombor Cseres-Gergely pointed out that LCA is more comprehensive than “ordinary”
analysis. Nevertheless, it is a very complex method, intuitive only at a very basic level, and
carries with it values and theory implicit in the choices of indicators, active and passive
variables and number of groups. Despite its limitations and complexity, Dr. Cseres-Gergely
recognized that the analysis is a pragmatic way of looking at individuals through the lenses
of both poverty/welfare status and labor market indicators. He concluded that there is an
important connection between these fields. He also remarked that the analysis could be
repeated locally, and might be initiated by building capacity for regular, high quality, in-
depth analysis.

In closing remarks, Andrew Mason (Manager for Social Protection in Europe & Central Asia
at the World Bank) and Dr. Lieve Fransen (Director at the European Commission’s
Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion) highlighted several points
that emerged from the discussion. Speaking on broader terms of the World Bank’s analytical
and policy dialogue work in countries in and beyond the European Union, Mr. Mason
strongly appreciated the feedback received from the Member State delegations and
academic experts. Fitting into the Bank’s work on efficient and equitable social safety nets
across the region, a further development of the Portraits approach would need to reflect an
improved analysis of individual life and benefit situations as well as a broader range of
possible policy recommendations.

In her final remarks, Dr. Fransen mentioned the general quality of the analytical tool and its
embedding into the dialogue between the Member States and EC, as well as the quality of the
discussion with Member States throughout the project, was appreciated. While there is still
the need to derive a more differentiated set of policy responses and not settle for simplistic
policy prescriptions for certain demographics, she remarked on the usefulness of the
Portraits methodology. Portraits-type analysis is a tool that could be used in the future for
“social investment” choices in Member States, and also has the potential to be used in
performance monitoring for ESF activities between the European Commission and Member
States, she said.

                        Annex 1: Methodological note on
                                    latent class analysis

Latent class analysis (LCA) enables a characterization of categorical latent (unobserved)
variables from an analysis of the structure of the relationships among several categorical
observed variables. LCA is thus "the classification of similar objects into groups, where the
number of groups, as well as their forms is unknown" (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990). The
method was originally conceived of as an analytic method for survey data. As an exploratory
technique, LCA can be used to reduce a set of categorically scored variables into a single
latent variable with a set of underlying types or “classes”. As a confirmatory method, the
latent class model can be used to test hypotheses regarding the researchers’ a priori
assertions about the structure of the relationship among the observed variables. In this note,
LCA was used as an exploratory technique to create the optimal number of groups of out-of-
work market individuals with the most similar characteristics.

The LCA model can be seen as a probabilistic or model-based variant of traditional non-
hierarchical cluster analysis procedures such as the K-means method. Contrary to traditional
ad-hoc clustering approaches, the LCA approach to clustering is model-based. The
fundamental assumption underlying LCA is that of local independence, which states that
observations (out-of-work individuals in our case) in the same latent class share a common
joint probability distribution among the observed variables. Since persons in the same latent
class (cluster) cannot be distinguished from each other based on their observed responses,
they are similar to each other (homogeneous) with respect to these observed variables.
Individuals are hence classified into the class for which they have the highest posterior
probability of belonging, given their observed characteristics.

LCA is thus most similar to the K-Means approach to cluster analysis in which cases that are
"close" to one of K centers are grouped together. In fact, LCA can be viewed as a probabilistic
variant of K-Means clustering where probabilities are used to define "closeness" to each
center. As such, LCA provides a way not only to formalize the K-Means approach in terms of
a statistical model, but also to extend the K-Means approach in several directions: flexible
distance to the center of the cluster, determination of the optimal number of clusters,
inclusion of categorical and continuous variables, and inclusion of exogenous variables. First,
while K-Means uses an ad-hoc distance measure for classification, the LCA approach allows
cases to be classified into clusters using model based posterior membership probabilities
estimated by maximum likelihood (ML) methods. Second, LCA provides various diagnostics
such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) statistic, which helps determine the
optimal number of clusters. Third, while K-Means clustering is limited to interval scale
quantitative variables for which Euclidean distance measures can be calculated, LCA can be
performed on variables of mixed metrics (continuous, categorical (nominal or ordinal), or
counts or any combination of these). Fourth, the LCA model can be easily extended to include
exogenous variables (covariates).

The LCA model with covariates can be written as:

                                 f(yi|zi) = Σk p(x=k|zi) f(yi|x=k)



Where yi is a vector of dependent (endogenous) indicators for individual i, zi is a vector of
independent (exogenous) covariates for individual i, x is a nominal latent variable (and k
denotes a class, k=1,2,...,K), and f(yi|x=k) denotes the joint distribution specified for yi given
latent class x=k.

For continuous yi, the multivariate normal distribution is used with class-specific means. In
addition, the within-class covariance matrices can be assumed to be equal or unequal across
classes, and the local independence assumption can be relaxed by applying various
structures to the within-class covariance matrices. For variables of other/mixed scale types,
local independence among the variables imposes restrictions on second-order as well as to
higher-order moments.

For this note, out-of-work individuals constitute the population of interest. The population
was then restricted to working-age population (individuals aged 16 to 64). As mentioned
earlier, age categories, gender, education, economic status, chronic illness and spouse
working status represent the observed covariates and were used to predict the inactivity
status. In addition to these indicator and active covariates, exogenous variables were
included in the model, such as income quintile of household, household composition,
urban/rural breakdown, region, economic activity of the spouse, work intensity of
households and social protection transfers.

For each year, the LCA model was run with one to ten classes, leading to ten different
estimations. To determine the optimal number of clusters into which the population of
interest should be divided, we used two criteria that maximize the cohesion within clusters
and the distance between clusters: the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion (AIC and
BIC).

Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion | 469
          Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion sheds new light on the life situations and labor market
          experiences of individuals and households during the financial, economic and employment
          crisis between 2008 and 2011. Identifying those individuals with limited or no labor market
          attachment is fundamental for a holistic approach to inclusive policymaking for the inactive
          and unemployed.


          In this joint project of the European Commission and the World Bank, profiles of the
          unemployed and inactive populations in six EU Member States—Bulgaria, Estonia,
          Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, and Romania—were developed through cluster analysis and
          interpretation of data from the European Income and Living Conditions Survey. The profiles
          that emerge move beyond simple demographics (male/female, young/old, rural/urban) and
          start to identify life situations and potential barriers to employment (lack of experience,
          lack of education, caregiving responsibilities, distance from services and jobs, income from
          transfers, and so on).


          Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion provides a basis for national and EU policy design
          and priority-setting for interventions that are suited to particular life situations among
          the inactive and unemployed. By shedding light on the social and economic risks faced
          by this population, as well as on the potential barriers they may encounter, this cross-
          cutting analysis moves the dialogue on labor-market integration from a labor-only view to a
          broader approach that encompasses social policy and public services. In this way, the book
          contributes important insights for the employment-oriented design of social policy.
