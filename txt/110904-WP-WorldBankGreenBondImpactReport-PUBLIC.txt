3    THE WORLD BANK GREEN BOND | IMPACT REPORT JUNE 2016
                 World Bank Country Partnership Framework
    The comparative advantage of the World Bank Group (WBG) is its ability to address complex problems on a global
    scale. This ability comes from the powerful combination of country depth and global breadth, public and private
    sector instruments and relationships, multisector knowledge, and the ability to mobilize and leverage finance.
    Before developing a new partnership strategy with a client country, the Bank completes a comprehensive
    diagnostic study (called a Systematic Country Diagnostic), which identifies the barriers to eliminating extreme
    poverty and boosting shared prosperity in the country. In collaboration with partners, experts from the World
    Bank’s Global Practices and Cross-Cutting Solution Areas work with country-based staff and its sister institutions,
    IFC and MIGA, to prioritize the Bank’s program of financial, analytical, advisory, and convening support for the
    country, based on its comparative advantage and the client’s priorities. This support comes together in the Country
    Partnership Framework.




    WBG staff also work on global challenges, including gender, jobs, climate change, fragility, forced displacement,
    and others. Cross-Cutting Solution teams drive coordination across the Bank Group, its regions, and technical
    practices. On climate change, for example, the Bank Group engages at the global level on carbon pricing and
    dialogue about climate; and it helps countries to assess policy and investment choices to meet their country-level
    commitments.
    The World Bank is accountable to its shareholders and the public through a set of feedback and accountability
    mechanisms, including the Corporate Scorecard, and regular opportunities to discuss progress on operations with
    its Board of Executive Directors. It continues to refine a set of indicators to track progress on client results and the
    effectiveness of its operations to demonstrate progress.

    All of the work at the World Bank is anchored in two goals: ending extreme poverty and promoting shared
    prosperity in a sustainable manner. Reaching these ambitious goals requires the World Bank to deliver the world’s
    best ideas, knowledge, and experience in development. Country-based teams are the chief interface with clients
    and are responsible for developing country and regional strategies. They foster selectivity in country programs,
    ensure that these programs account for the relevant country's individual context and political economy, and
    integrate public and private sector solutions.
    The country-based teams work with client countries to identify, assess and appraise individual projects and
    programs including conducting feasibility studies that assess the environmental, social and financial sustainability of
    the proposed projects.
    Every project is presented to the Board of Executive Directors, a resident Board with 25 chairs representing its
    member countries, for approval. Each project must be consist with the agreed Country Partnership Framework and
    demonstrate how it contributes to achieving the twin goals of the World Bank to reduce poverty and promote
    shared prosperity in a sustainable manner.
    Government agencies report the projects’ progress and the World Bank monitors the agreed milestones towards
    achieving the project’s objectives including a formal review at least twice a year. The World Bank also conducts a
    review of the lessons learned at the conclusion and each project is also subject to an independent evaluation.
    From the pool of approved projects, a subset of illustrative projects that meet the World Banks Green Bond
    eligibility criteria are selected for inclusion in the program. To demonstrate the breadth of the World Bank’s work
    helping countries address the climate challenge, projects are selected from different countries and sectors. There
    are currently 90 projects that have been included in the projects and disbursements have commenced in 84 of
    these projects.

    In December 2015, the World Bank Group adopted a Climate Change Action Plan to help developing countries turn
    the promises made at the historic Paris Climate Agreement into reality. The plan lays out a clear roadmap, with
    ambitious targets, for helping countries mitigate for and adapt to the impact of a changing climate.
    As per the plan, the Bank Group will incorporate climate change considerations across all of its work, and expand its
    commitments in six high-impact areas: renewable energy and energy efficiency, transportation, boosting the
    resilience of cities, climate-smart land use, strengthening the competitiveness of the green sector, and extending
    disaster preparedness.
    Among the specific goals to be met by the World Bank Group under the Action Plan by 2020 are:
    •    Adding 30 gigawatts to the world’s renewable energy capacity, a doubling of current World Bank
         contributions, and mobilizing $25 billion of commercial funding for clean energy.
    •    Investing $1 billion over five years to promote energy efficiency and resilient building in urban areas and
         quadruple funding over five years to make transport systems more resilient.
    •    Developing climate-smart agriculture investment plans for at least 40 countries, with 100 percent of
         agriculture lending to be climate-smart by 2020. Priority areas will include the use of climate resilient seeds,
         high-efficiency irrigation, livestock productivity, and risk management.
    •    Supporting sustainable forest management strategies in more than 50 countries.
    •    Bringing early warning systems for natural disasters to 100 million people in 15 countries, and extending social
         protection systems to 50 million people to help them adapt to a changing climate.
    •    Implementing large-scale national and trans-boundary programs to promote water efficiency across sectors,
         and improving water management.
    •    Scaling up country-level support and global advocacy work to reform fossil fuel subsidies and putting a price
         on carbon pollution.

Green Bond issuances
As of June 30, 2016, the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, IBRD) has issued 125 Green
Bonds in 18 currencies raising the equivalent of US$9.1 billion of funding supporting the transition to low-carbon and
climate resilient growth. 25 green bonds totaling US$ 2.9 billion had matured by Jun 30, 2016 of which US$1.6 billion has
been replaced with new green bonds. In addition, US$0.3 billion of green bonds have been repurchased or called and
these amounts have also been rolled-over. World Bank Green Bonds totaling US$5.7 billion were outstanding as of June
30, 2016. The total amount of matured green bonds that may be replaced with new green bonds in future is US$1.3 billion.

                     Renewable energy development amounts to 15% of projects eligible for support from the World Bank’s Green Bonds. The
                     energy sector contributes about 40% of global CO2 emissions. Despite improvements in some countries, the global CO2
                     emission factor for energy generation has hardly changed over the last 20 years, making the transition to a more sustainable

                     energy mix is critical for climate change mitigation.
                     Energy efficiency is the low cost option to reduce emissions and unnecessary expenditures. At the same time, a projected
                     2.4 billion people are expected to migrate to urban areas by midcentury and cities already account for two-thirds of global

                     energy demand thus contributing to 70% of GHG emissions. Harnessing the “hidden fuel” of energy efficiency offers many
                     opportunities to help cities achieve energy security, energy savings, improved municipal services, increased

                     efficiency improvements.
                     Transport contributes about 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC). With motorization on the rise, that share is
                                                                                                                               7

                     improvements that shift to low-emission modes also generate 'co-benefits' in terms of reducing congestion, local air

                     agriculture, and land, forest and ecosystem management aimed at mitigating and/or adapting to climate change.

Green Bond eligible projects
All World Bank bonds support sustainable development, focusing on poverty reduction and inclusive growth. They fit well
within all investor mandates, especially those investment strategies that incorporate Environmental, Social and Governance
factors into the decision-making process. The World Bank’s Green Bonds are a subset of its sustainable investment
opportunities focused specifically on climate change issues that directly impact developing countries and address the global
climate challenge.
Green Bond eligible projects promote the transition to low-carbon and carbon resilient growth in client countries targeting
climate change mitigation and adaptation. The World Bank’s eligibility criteria underwent an independent review by the
Center for International Climate and Environmental Research at the University of Oslo (CICERO).

      Examples of climate change mitigation projects:
       Solar and wind installations
       Funding for new technologies that permit significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions
       Rehabilitation of power plants and transmission facilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
       Greater efficiency in transportation, including fuel switching and mass transport
       Waste management (methane emission) and construction of energy-efficient buildings
       Carbon reduction through reforestation and avoided deforestation

      Examples of climate change adaptation projects:
       Protection against flooding (including reforestation and watershed management)
       Food security improvement and implementing stress-resilient agricultural systems (which slow down
         deforestation)
       Sustainable forest management and avoided deforestation.

Green Bond eligible projects are identified through a two-stage process.
1. All projects supported by the World Bank go through a rigorous review and approval process to ensure that they meet
   countries’ development priorities. The process includes: (i) early screening to identifying potential environmental or
   social impacts and designing policies and concrete actions to mitigate any such impacts; and (ii) approval by the Board of
   Executive Directors – a resident Board with 25 chairs representing member countries.
2. Environmental specialists then screen approved World Bank projects to identify those that meet the World Bank’s Green
   Bond eligibility criteria.

http://treasury.worldbank.org/cmd/pdf/ImplementationGuidelines.pdf.

9      THE WORLD BANK GREEN BOND | IMPACT REPORT JUNE 2016
It’s worth noting that the World Bank’s activities that help
client countries mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate
change are much broader than the subset of Green Bond
eligible projects discussed herein. Since the World Bank began
tracking commitments with climate change adaptation and
mitigation co-benefits at a portfolio level in FY11, over one
third of all World Bank commitments have included climate
change co-benefits. Of these about 30% (representing 10% of
total commitments over the period) have been included in the
World Bank’s Green Bond program.



Impact reporting
The World Bank is committed to transparent reporting of climate financing including reporting the impacts of the projects
included in its Green Bond program. Detailed information for all World Bank financed projects is available on the main World
Bank website http://www.worldbank.org/projects. In addition, project summaries and impact indicators for Green Bond
eligible projects are summarized on the investor website at:
http://treasury.worldbank.org/cmd/htm/MoreGreenProjects.html.
The following section lists the 84 Green Bond eligible projects supported by Green Bonds as of June 30, 2016. The projects
are organized by major sector. Selected results indicators, World Bank loan amount, share of loan amount to total project
costs, and the amount of Green Bond proceeds that have been allocated to support disbursements to each project are
disclosed. Annex 1 describes in more detail the reporting approach and should be read in conjunction with this report.
Interpreting reported results
The intention of impact reporting is to help develop a more detailed understanding of the climate and environmental impacts
that can be expected or projected to result from Green Bond eligible projects. Several key results indicators have been
selected and where possible quantified, but it is important to appreciate the inherent limitations of data reported therein.
The main considerations to adequately interpret results are:
    Scope of results: reporting is based on “ex-ante” estimates of climate and environmental impacts at the time of project
     appraisal and mostly for direct project effects, except as indicated where the results have been updated for actual results
     at the time of project completion.
    Uncertainty: an important consideration in estimating impact indicators and projecting impacts is that they are based on
     assumptions. While technical experts aim to make sound and conservative assumptions that are reasonable based on the
     information available at the time, the actual environmental impact of the projects generally diverge from initial
     projections. In general, behavioral changes or shifts in baseline conditions can cause deviations from projections.
    Comparability: Caution should be taken in comparing projects, sectors, or whole portfolios because baselines (and base
     years) and calculation methods may vary significantly. In addition, the cost structures between countries will also vary,
     so that developing cost-efficiency calculations (such as results per dollar invested) could, for example, place smaller
     countries with limited economies of scale at a disadvantage and will not take into consideration country-specific context.
    Omissions and qualitative results: because the selected projects aim to provide social and developmental benefits as
     well as climate environmental ones, they will have impacts across a much wider range of indicators than captured below.
     Therefore, exclusively focusing on the reported indicators will leave out other important development impacts. Where
     quantitative data is unavailable, qualitative indicators have been included to illustrate the type and direction of a few
     other beneficial impacts. To get a better understanding of the developmental impacts of projects and the broader
     country context, please view the full project documentation available on the World Bank website.

     Refer to annex 1 for more information about the basis for reporting.
     a
           Column indicates whether the project aims to mitigate climate change (“M”), help client countries adapt to the effects of climate change (“A”), or both.
     b
           Target results are expected impacts based on estimates developed at the time of project approval and materializing at the end of the project implementation period (5 years in most cases). The
           indicators shown are normally a subset of the development impacts contained in project documentation available in the World Bank project website (see http://www.worldbank.org/projects).
           Results reported are based on the total project cost, with the percent shown next to the loan amount corresponding to the proportion of the total project cost that is financed by World Bank loans.
           Actual impacts may be different from these estimates and do not represent the actual results in a specific year. Quantitative estimates are intended to be indicative of the scale of impacts and
           qualitative results aim to inform about the nature of changes that will be achieved as a result of projects included in the Green Bond program once they are completed and at full capacity.
     c
           Annual energy savings include reduced energy use for both power and heat, where applicable.
     d
           The committed amount is the Green Bond eligible portion of the World Bank loan net of cancellations reported in equivalent US$ millions. Loans denominated in other
           currencies are converted to US$ equivalents using the spot exchange rate on the report date (June 30, 2016).
     e
           The percentage shows the percentage of the total project cost that is financed by World Bank loans. When a project is co-financed, this share could be used to apportion
           total results to the World Bank.
     f
           The allocated amount is the amount of Green Bond proceeds allocated to support the financing of disbursements to the project reported in equivalent US$ millions. Loans
           denominated in other currencies are converted to US$ equivalents using the spot exchange rate on the report date (June 30, 2016).

23   THE WORLD BANK GREEN BOND | IMPACT REPORT JUNE 2016
                                                   Annex 1 – Reporting Approach

     Detailed information is available for every project on the World Bank website (http://www.worldbank.org/projects).
     The impact indicators summarized in this report focus on results considered by the World Bank’s investor relations
     team to be of interest to Green Bond investors, based on dialogue with investors. They were selected from among
     other development results expected from the eligible projects. The indicators are intended to illustrate the type
     and scale of expected results in a variety of sectors and country contexts. To better reflect individual country
     challenges, demands, and resources, the report focuses on presenting a diversity of countries, projects and sectors
     rather than cumulative impacts. Because of the limited comparability between projects, sectors and countries (see
     “Interpreting reported results” on page 6 and “No aggregation of GHG estimates” below), impact results are not
     aggregated, with the exception of renewable energy capacity added which is deemed to be broadly comparable.
     This impact report is split between the five main sectors represented in the World Bank’s Green Bond eligible
     projects. Where projects cover multiple sectors, the project is included in the main sector only, but target results
     will include all components of the project.
     1. Renewable energy and energy                    Many World Bank projects in this category include both a
        efficiency:                                    renewable energy and energy efficiency component, so combining
                                                       the sectors avoids redundancy. The reporting framework adopted
                                                       identifies four core indicators for energy efficiency and renewable
                                                       energy projects; where information covering the proposed core
                                                       indicators is publically available, this is included. 11 However, for
                                                       some projects quantitative estimates for these indicators are either
                                                       not available or not applicable. A few other indicators that are
                                                       considered relevant for Green Bond investors are also provided.
     2. Transport
     3. Water, wastewater and solid
        waste management                               Projects categorized in the remaining sectors are more
                                                       heterogeneous. The report provides project specific indictors
     4. Agriculture, land use and                      based on available information that provides an indication of the
        forestry                                       scale of results.
     5. Resilient infrastructure, built
        environment and other

     The following summarizes key assumptions and approaches used in preparing this report.
         Ex ante projections: Quantitative estimates for target results represent ex ante projections developed during
          project design mostly for direct project impacts once projects are at normal operating capacity. The target
          results include expected results for projects still in the preparation, construction and/or implementation phase.
          The impact report thus serves as an illustration of expected results made possible through Green Bond eligible
          projects, but it is not intended to and does not provide actual results achieved in a specific year or reporting
          period. Target results have been updated with actual results at project completion when the final project
          commitment is materially different to the original authorized amount. Where the amounts are based on actual
          results this is noted in the preceding tables.
         Length of time projects are on report: Impact reporting will be provided for projects for so long as they are part
          of the Green Bond program. This means that projects are added to the impact report once Green Bond
          proceeds have been allocated to support the financing of disbursements to the project, and removed once the
          client has repaid the respective loan. Projects may also be removed from future reports if the World Bank

     11
          This impact report has been prepared following an approached developed in collaboration with 11 other International Finance
          Institutions (IFIs) to encourage greater harmonization in impact reporting. Core indicators for other sectors have not been
          recommended as part of initial efforts to work towards a harmonized approach for impact reporting. See “Working Towards a
          Harmonized Framework for Impact Reporting,” December 2015.

24   THE WORLD BANK GREEN BOND | IMPACT REPORT JUNE 2016
          decides to remove a project from its Green Bond program.12 If a project is removed from the Green Bond
          program, any Green Bond proceeds previously allocated to support the financing of disbursements to that
          project will be credited back to the Special Account for Green Bond proceeds and allocated to support the
          financing of disbursements to other Green Bond eligible projects as part of the routine allocation process.
         Reporting for co-financed projects: The World Bank often co-finances projects with the client country and/or
          other lenders. The results for the individual project are based on the total project including all financiers. The
          World Bank’s share of the total financing is included for each project. Where results are aggregated (for
          example total renewable energy capacity installed), the pro-rated share based on the World Bank’s share of
          financing the total project cost is also included.
         Partial project eligibility: Some projects may have portions that are Green Bond eligible while others are not. In
          cases where a project is partially Green Bond eligible, the committed amount reported reflects only that portion
          that is Green Bond eligible. Allocations to support disbursements to such projects are made on a pro rata basis.
         No aggregation of GHG estimates: When reported in the World Bank Project Appraisal Reports and/or
          Implementation Status Reports, the GHG emission reductions for projects are reported in tons of CO2
          equivalent. The World Bank is undertaking an effort in conjunction with other International Finance Institutions
          to harmonize the approaches for GHG accounting.13 At the same time, it is working to develop internally
          consistent GHG accounting methodologies for investment projects across relevant sectors. Given these on-
          going developments in GHG accounting, the basis for estimating CO2 equivalent emission reductions may vary
          between World Bank projects. Therefore, the World Bank does not recommend aggregating the results of
          different projects in its portfolio.
         All reported results are from publically available sources: Reporting is based on publically available impacts for
          the projects disclosed in Project Appraisal Reports and Implementation Status Reports. In order to facilitate
          comparability of the reported results, the reporting units have been converted where such conversion is based
          on a standard conversion factor.




     12
          As part of the World Bank’s due diligence in monitoring projects included in its Green Bond program, it may elect to remove a
          project. Possible reasons for removing a project from a Green Bond program include, but are not limited to, cancellation of the
          project or significant implementation delays.
