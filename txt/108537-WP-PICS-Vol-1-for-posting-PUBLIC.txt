The Independent Evaluation Group is grateful to the numerous representatives
of the government and regional institutions, private sector entities,
nongovernmental organizations, and donor agencies who provided valuable
insights into the World Bank Group’s program in the Pacific Island countries
(PICs). The team is also thankful to the Bank Group management and country
team members, including both previous and current staff working on PICs, who
provided valuable time, information, and feedback to the evaluation team.

Overview
Highlights
The Pacific Island countries (PICs) face major development challenges. Their small size
makes the cost of delivering public services a large share of gross domestic product and
means that these costs often exceed the resources available to meet them from domestic
taxation. Small domestic markets keep the PICs dependent on exports for growth, yet
their remoteness and limited supply of skilled labor reduce their export
competitiveness. In addition, they are in areas prone to cyclones and tsunamis and are
vulnerable to sea level rise in some cases. However, most PICs have achieved middle-
income status, largely through consistent donor support and substantial out-migration
(both temporary and permanent) that resulted in a steady inflow of remittances.
The high cost of operating in these small, remote countries and limited resources from
the International Development Association (IDA) constrained the World Bank to
working at the regional level or through multi-country platforms until 2008, when the
governments of Australia and New Zealand decided to enter into funding partnerships
with the World Bank Group. These partnerships—combined with increases in IDA
allocations to small states, availability of IDA regional grant funding, and access to trust
funds for disaster risk management and climate change—gave the World Bank the
capacity to operate at scale in the PICs.
This evaluation assesses the Bank Group’s relevance and effectiveness in the PICs as
satisfactory. The World Bank made effective use of budgetary, IDA, and trust fund
resources to support significant transformational changes in the region, and had a key
role in persuading Australia and New Zealand to adopt temporary migration programs
that yielded major benefits to participating countries. In addition, the World Bank
persuaded a number of PICs governments to scale back their departments for
infrastructure maintenance and to outsource this maintenance to the private sector. It also
increased awareness of the need to build climate resilience into infrastructure design and
enabled major improvements in communications through enhanced connectivity.
Looking forward, the evaluation emphasizes collaboration between the World Bank and
the International Finance Corporation to more effectively support private sector
development; increasing the focus on education’s role in providing the skills needed for
developing tourism, agriculture, and fisheries; and providing better preparation for
temporary and permanent migrants.

1. Country Context and Evaluation Purpose
The cluster country program evaluation (CCPE) is an Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG) instrument that evaluates programs in a group of countries sharing a
common characteristic to derive lessons for World Bank Group support for all
countries in that category. The CCPE for Small States is the second of these
evaluations. IEG prepared full Country Program Evaluations for the Caribbean
Islands and the Pacific Island countries (PICs), with case studies for Mauritania, the
Seychelles, Cabo Verde, and Djibouti.

The PICs CCPE1 covers island groups that are small states (populations less than 1.5
million) and World Bank Group members, but it excludes Timor-Leste and the
Solomon Islands, which IEG recently evaluated (IEG 2011, 2013). The evaluation
includes these states: the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Palau, the
Marshall Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

There are a number of reasons for focusing on Tonga and Samoa. The two countries
have the most substantial World Bank Group programs, and natural disasters
severely affected both countries during the evaluation period, with profound fiscal
implications. Furthermore, the logistics of covering both countries on a three-week
mission are less challenging than those the other PICs, especially since the joint
World Bank–Asian Development Bank liaison offices are in the capital cities of
Nuku’alofa (Tonga) and Apia (Samoa). However, this does not mean Tonga and
Samoa represent the challenges facing all the PICs. Both countries have relatively
high levels of capacity and low levels of extreme poverty, and both received
substantial donor support. Most of the PICs share some common features, but the
particular combination of characteristics differs for each, and the differences often
drive development priorities. Therefore, the evaluation emphasized desk reviews of
World Bank Group programs in other countries, and discussions with World Bank
Group staff and donors of overall regional and country-specific development
programs and their impact.


PICs Development Challenges
The PICs share a number of features:

       Small size. Even within the definition of small states, most of the island
        groups have populations of less than 250,000—Tuvalu and Palau are the
        smallest at about 10,000 and 20,000, respectively. Fiji is the outlier with

CHAPTER 1
COUNTRY CONTEXT AND EVALUATION PURPOSE
        nearly 1 million people. The small size means there are limited economies of
        scale in providing public services, and domestic markets are too small to
        support manufacturing for local consumption.
       Dispersion. The PICs are scattered over an extremely large area of the Pacific
        Ocean and, in most cases, the major destinations (Sydney, Auckland, and
        Nadi in Fiji) lack daily air services. Even within island groups, there can be
        large distances between the island where the capital is located and the outer
        islands, making service provision costly and difficult.
       Vulnerability to natural disasters. The PICs are disaster hotspots. During
        the evaluation period, a number of countries experienced tsunamis or major
        cyclones—impacts on their gross domestic product range from 2 to 6 percent
        per year. The cost of making infrastructure and housing resilient to these
        events raises the cost of doing business in these countries. Furthermore, their
        long coastlines make them vulnerable to rising sea levels due to climate
        change, particularly the atoll islands such as Kiribati and Tuvalu.
       Vulnerability to global economic downturns. The PICs are highly dependent
        on the flow of remittances and tourism revenues. Both were severely affected
        by the global economic crisis.
       Limited private sector opportunity. All these challenges (notably small
        market size, susceptibility to natural disasters, remoteness from supply
        foreigners, weak administrative infrastructure and lack of access to finance)
        create a high cost-operating environment and reduce the opportunity for
        business growth.
       Middle-income status with some hardship, but little extreme poverty.2 This
        is due to a combination of high levels of remittances and external assistance
        per capita, and subsistence agriculture and fisheries on relatively abundant
        land and coastal fishing grounds.
       Good progress in some PICs on achieving the Millennium Development
        Goals related to health and education.3 However, noncommunicable
        diseases are a growing problem, and many countries have high levels of
        obesity and diabetes.
       Uneven progress on closing gender equality gaps. The PICs show
        considerable progress in health and education endowments. However, there
        is less progress regarding economic opportunity for women, who have no
        rights to land ownership in many countries and less access to finance than
        men. Low female representation in political bodies and high levels of
        domestic violence are important issues.
       Strong but thin administrative capacity. Senior officials compare well with
        those of much larger countries. At the same time, given the small size of the
        ministries and departments, there is generally little backup, which can lead

                                                 COUNTRY CONTEXT AND EVALUATION PURPOSE
        to delays when senior officials are away on official travel, move to new
        positions, or migrate.
       High rates of temporary and permanent migration. The PICs are increasingly
        dependent on remittances from a large number of the population that is
        abroad at any given time. A “brain drain” of qualified individuals, relatively
        easy permanent migration from the Marshall Islands and the Federated
        States of Micronesia to the United States, and a small but steady stream of
        permanent migrants to Australia and New Zealand account for high rates of
        permanent migration. Temporary migration to New Zealand (and Australia
        to a lesser extent) is for agricultural work in horticulture and viticulture.
       Large flows of assistance from the regional Organisation for Economic Co-
        operation and Development countries. Australia and New Zealand provide
        substantial support to the PICs, and the United States (in the Federated
        States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau), government of Japan,
        and the European Union are an important presence. Australia and New
        Zealand also provided large amounts of technical support and leveraged a
        significant increase in international agencies and international financial
        institution presence in these countries.
       Tension between modern secular democracy and traditional leaders and
        powerful religious groups. Most of the islands have traditional chiefs and
        nobles who are the source of rights to much of the land and are
        disproportionately represented in national parliaments. Christian churches
        of many denominations also have substantial weight. The mix of powerful
        traditional structures, a growing educated urban middle class, unemployed
        urban youth, and returning migrants is a volatile one that has contributed to
        fragility in a number of island states.

Although most of these characteristics can be discerned in each island, the degree to
which they are present adds up to significant differences between them. For
example, Kiribati is much less exposed to natural disasters, but as a low-lying atoll
island, it faces major challenges as sea levels rise. It has limited land and is mainly
reliant on fisheries, so most food is imported. Kiribati also has relatively low
capacity, particularly in technical fields. The country has only one qualified
structural engineer to support the major road-building project currently under way.
This contrasts sharply with Samoa, a volcanic island with a large subsistence
farming sector. Samoa is a major beneficiary of temporary migration programs and
has relatively good administrative and technical capacity. The frequency of natural
disasters is perhaps Samoa’s major development challenge.

CHAPTER 1
COUNTRY CONTEXT AND EVALUATION PURPOSE

Regional Institutions in the Pacific
Regional mechanisms play an increasingly important role in the PICs. The PICs
developed well-organized regional intergovernmental organizations, each with a
particular focus and funded by member contributions (mainly from Australia and
New Zealand). Notable among these are the Pacific Islands Forum and the
Secretariat of the South Pacific Community. In 2014, the Pacific Islands Forum’s
leaders endorsed a new framework for Pacific regionalism that emphasizes climate
change adaptation, sustainable fisheries management, trade and transport, logistics,
information communications and technology, and private sector engagement in
infrastructure provision. To avoid duplication and harmonize their activities, the
organizations established the Council of Regional Organizations of the Pacific, a key
function of which is to improve cooperation, coordination, and collaboration among
the intergovernmental regional organizations.4 By adopting a regional approach, the
PICs can take advantage of opportunities to pool and share expertise and resources,
thereby optimizing benefits to member countries and territories. Appendix A
(Volume II) describes the functions of the main regional organizations. Despite the
institutions’ substantial scale and broad coverage, the relationship between them
and the individual countries is complex—a perception exists that in some areas
these institutions compete with national agencies instead of complementing them.


Economic Developments
Growth in the PICs has been sluggish during the past decade. Average per capita
growth was between 0.5 and 2.0 percent per year—well below the growth rate of
most other developing countries (table 1.1). Because of their small domestic markets,
the PICs are dependent on tourism, fisheries, and labor exports for their growth.
Although there has been some expansion of these activities through the temporary
migration programs (chapter 3) and better management of fisheries resources, this
expansion was partially offset by stagnant agricultural output and limited
development of private small and medium enterprises.

Progress in improving social indicators in the PICs was mixed and uneven across
the different islands. Fiji, Palau, and Tonga progressed the most, while Kiribati,
Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands lagged (PIFS 2015). Considerable
progress was made in all the PICs in reducing child mortality, achieving universal
primary education, and gender parity at all education levels. However, challenges
remain in achieving inclusive, sustainable human development, reducing income
inequality, and reaching the broader goal of promoting gender equality and
empowering women.

COUNTRY CONTEXT AND EVALUATION PURPOSE


Evaluation Objective and Report Structure
This report covers World Bank Group support to the PICs during 2005–15. It seeks
to determine if the support was relevant to the countries’ development needs and
the World Bank Group’s institutional priorities, if the World Bank Group–supported
programs were effective in meeting the strategic objectives the World Bank Group
defined and agreed to with the countries, and if the support was provided efficiently
and sustainably.

Chapter 2 describes the evolution of the World Bank Group’s approach and the
objectives it defined through its strategy documents. Chapter 3 summarizes the
assessment of the World Bank Group strategy and program on three dimensions.
The first dimension is how the World Bank Group addressed the particular
challenges of working in the PICs. The second dimension considers how the World
Bank Group helped the PICs improve resilience (the evaluation’s first pillar) in three
subareas. These areas are: economic resilience (focusing on macro-fiscal
sustainability in the context of external shocks and volatility), environmental
resilience (how the World Bank Group helped to address risks to people, assets, and
economies from natural disasters and climate change), and social resilience
(covering the contribution to human resource development through support for
labor mobility, the education and health sectors, gender equality, and social
protection). The third dimension examines how the World Bank Group assisted PICs
in improving competitiveness (the evaluation’s second pillar). It looks first at World
Bank Group support for promoting a competitive business environment, second at
the financial sector; third at the World Bank Group’s support for infrastructure; and
finally at specific program areas considered to be key productive potentials, namely
fisheries, tourism, and agriculture. Chapter 4 presents the main findings and
recommendations. The appendixes provide a more detailed analysis of the relevance
and efficacy of the World Bank Group program that underlie the overall assessment
and lessons.

1The evaluation mission in September and October 2015 visited Sydney to talk with staff in
the World Bank’s Country Unit for the Pacific region. The office covers the nine island
groups plus Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste. The evaluation
team visited Suva for discussions with government of Fiji and the regional institutions
based there. The team engaged in extensive discussions with government, donors, and civil
society during visits to Tonga and Samoa, and held discussions with officials of the
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the government of Australia in Canberra, and
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the government of New Zealand in Wellington.
2   The outliers are Kiribati and Vanuatu, where extreme poverty is still significant.
3In Samoa and Tonga, for example, few gaps remain in access to both education and health
services, and most Millennium Development Goals were achieved in these areas, except for
some remote outer islands.
4 Organizations involved include Forum Fisheries Agency, Forum Secretariat, the Pacific
Islands Development Programme, the South Pacific Commission, the South Pacific Regional
Environment Programme, the South Pacific Geoscience Commission, the Tourism
Commission of the South Pacific, and the University of the South Pacific.

2. World Bank Group Approach and Strategy
The World Bank Group substantially expanded its engagement with the nine PICs
during the evaluation period, raising its lending, increasing its regional presence,
and increasing the volume of technical assistance and analytic work. Increased
availability of IDA funding for small states and the ability to tap into regional IDA
and crisis response funding enabled this expansion, which meant a considerable
increase in the scale of programs the World Bank Group could support. The PICs
became IDA-grant eligible, which was particularly important. The World Bank
Group could undertake this expanded program and make this funding available to
the Pacific Islands largely because of expanded resources for staff and operational
expenses in the Pacific region. Although an increase in World Bank Group budget
allocations financed some of the expansion, the most important factor was the
Pacific Facility, a trust fund established by the governments of Australia and New
Zealand, which provided fully fungible resources to the World Bank Group to
supplement its budget. This allowed the World Bank Group to devote large amounts
of staff and consultant resources to the PICs relative to comparator countries.1

The support of the governments of Australia and New Zealand for an expanded
World Bank Group presence in the region reflected their commitment to a strong,
prosperous, and stable Pacific. In the Australian view, the strategic importance of
the PICs outweighs their small population. Because of its central role in leveraging a
major expansion of the World Bank Group’s role, it is important to understand the
motivation for the Australian government’s “willingness to bankroll the World Bank
Group’s engagement,” in the words of one interlocutor. “The Bank’s comparative
advantage is policy dialogue. Bilateral donors are much more constrained in
providing policy advice than the World Bank, which is seen as objective and
credible, particularly in areas such as governance.” An evaluation of Australia’s
support for noncore funding of the international financial institutions suggested a
number of other factors (box 2.1). Also underlying these factors is the sensitivity of
the Australian and New Zealand governments to the perception of neocolonialism
inherent in their relationship with the PICs—the combination of high levels of aid,
migration, expatriates in executive positions in PIC governments, and so on. An
expanded role for the World Bank Group and Asian Development Bank (ADB) is
important to lessening this perception.

The impact of this special relationship with Australia and New Zealand on the
programs of the World Bank raised important questions for the evaluation. Besides
increasing the volume of World Bank Group support, did the trust fund lead the

World Bank Group to act in ways it would not have acted if, for example, the World
Bank’s own budget had funded the same level of resources? Did the source of the
funding and knowledge of the special interests and concerns Australia and New
Zealand had in the PICs affect the resources allocation in any way?


Box 2.1. Why Australia and New Zealand Funded the Costs of World Bank Group–ADB Support
for the PICs
“The first and strongest motivation was to leverage the multilateral development banks’
specialist skills and relationships with partner governments to increase Australia’s role in
shaping recipient government policies. The second major motivation was to improve the
World Bank’s effectiveness by helping them to overcome institutional constraints, largely in
their budgets for administrative costs and technical assistance, and in the rules that govern
their budget allocations. The third major motivation was to provide aid that was
harmonized with other donors, and thus reduce administrative costs and complexity for
recipients.”

The World Bank Group’s strategic approach to the PICs evolved during the period,
influenced by key analytic studies. The World Bank published Pacific Islands at Home
and Away: Expanding Job Opportunities for Pacific Islanders through Labor Mobility in
September 2006. The report asserts that the PIC economies could not generate the
levels of employment needed based on demographic trends, and presents evidence
that remittances have a vital role in social protection, especially for poorer
households and communities. Australia and New Zealand needed to open their
labor markets to temporary migration from these countries. The report was the
subject of considerable discussion in Australia and New Zealand, and the principal
author, Manjula Luthria, conducted a dialogue with authorities in both countries.
According to New Zealand government officials, this report was crucial for the
adoption of a temporary migration program for workers from the Polynesian
Islands, which is ongoing. The Recognized Seasonal Employer program, introduced
in 2007, brought up to 8,000 workers from the Pacific Islands each year to work in
New Zealand horticulture and viticulture on short-term contracts. The Australian
Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme provided for up to 2,500 seasonal work visas
over three years from 2009–10 to 2011–12. The World Bank worked closely with the
Australian and New Zealand governments on designing the programs, bringing
international experience of comparable temporary migration programs to the table.

The World Bank Group took the analysis further with the preparation of Pacific
Futures in early 2012. This broader analysis of the PICs’ economic situation
essentially maintained that the path to economic viability must include substantial

reliance on remittances from labor migration and sustained flows of assistance in the
long term. It argued that public sectors in these countries were likely to be a large
share of gross domestic product (GDP) given the countries’ small size and the
minimum critical mass required for conducting many public functions and
providing services. Although it recognized the potential for some economies of scale
through regional integration, these were unlikely to be sufficient to avoid the need
for additional resources. The analysis proposed expanding budget support from
donors to enable the public sector to carry out its role while avoiding some of the
transaction costs of investment lending, which were particularly burdensome given
the thinness of government capacity in these countries. Despite not being published,
the draft report was extremely influential. In the words of an Australian government
official, “Acknowledging that aid will always be needed and that labor mobility is
part of the package—this was a huge shift for Australia, and the World Bank takes a
lot of the credit for this” (box 2.2). Overall response to Pacific Futures was highly
positive, though questions arose over time. There is a sense that Pacific Futures
underplays the private sector’s potential role. Although its messages are particularly
relevant for Kiribati and Nauru (which have limited potential), it is less relevant to
Fiji, for example. Samoa and Tonga fall somewhere in the middle.


Box 2.2. Pacific Futures: The World Bank’s View of Development Challenges Facing the PICs
“Not all of this analysis is new: some academics have long argued that remittances and aid
were critical for island economies. Moreover, the Pacific island region is extremely diverse,
and the World Bank itself notes that its analysis applies much more to the smaller countries
in the region than the larger. Overall, however, there is no doubt that Pacific Futures not
only challenges conventional wisdom about the Pacific, but in some cases turns it on its
head.
“How Australia responds to these new ideas from the World Bank will be a lot more
important than what the World Bank itself does. We are after all the dominant power in the
region. Are we prepared to accept that aid will be a permanent feature of the Pacific?
(‘Overall, international assistance of various kinds is likely to remain an enduring feature of
Pacific Island economies for the foreseeable future.’) Will we open up our labor market to
the Pacific? (To remove ‘barriers to increased flows of short and, eventually, longer-term or
permanent migrant workers to large markets.’) And are we willing to share our institutions
with neighbors willing to adopt them? (‘In some cases, more effective regional integration
may arise from negotiating the expansion of larger country institutions to cover PIC
economies.’)”

The World Bank is working on a new strategic study, Pacific Possible, with
publication expected in 2016. This reflects an evolution of World Bank Group
thinking in the past two or three years, which places more emphasis on growth

potential through exploiting comparative advantages in fisheries, tourism, seabed
mining, and agricultural production for both the domestic market and neighboring
export markets. This is not an about-face—the report continues to recognize the
limits imposed by size and geography, but it argues for a more aggressive approach
to improving the business environment and exploiting the potential of foreign and
domestic private investment. Pacific Possible asserts that there is a way to be
transformational.

In the World Bank country director’s view, “The essence of Pacific Possible is to ask
what we can do to bend the growth curve upward.” This will require a concerted
effort in all four potential growth areas: tourism, fisheries, information and
communication technology, and labor. In his view, “Labor mobility remains
important. We need to see a move from temporary to permanent migration…[and]
provide labor market opportunities for the unskilled. For example, increasing
Australia’s temporary migration program to 40,000 people a year (proportional to
that of New Zealand) would generate remittances on the scale of the current
Australian aid program. The major constraints to increased growth are the costs of
natural disasters and of treating noncommunicable diseases. The cost of
noncommunicable diseases, for example, is 2–3 percent of GDP and is expected to
rise to 4–5 percent.”


Bank Regional Strategy for the PICs, 2006–09
An earlier evaluation of World Bank assistance to the Pacific during 1992–2002 that
set the stage for subsequent work, found that the World Bank did not satisfactorily
contribute to fueling economic growth in the region. The evaluation recommended
that the World Bank take five actions:

       Focus on improving expenditure management and removing bottlenecks to
        private activity in the region.
       Define focused and measurable country-specific objectives and interventions
        for countries where its engagement is expected to continue.
       Prioritize support for a select set of regional level initiatives.
       Deepen and broaden its relationship with other donors.
       Ensure that its strategy is fully funded and staffed (World Bank 2005a).

The World Bank’s Regional Strategy for 2006–09 built these recommendations into
its approach (World Bank 2005b). The strategy aimed to create “an environment
conducive to generating sustainable economic growth and employment.” It had two
major objectives. The first of these, “strengthening government capabilities in



                                                                                    11

WORLD BANK GROUP APPROACH AND STRATEGY
service delivery,” sought to improve the effectiveness of public expenditures (with
particular attention to the social sectors), improve the management of infrastructural
assets, and safeguard service delivery by improving resilience to natural hazards.
The second objective, “improving the incentives for private sector–led growth and
employment,” aimed to help create domestic jobs by reducing regulatory and
administrative barriers to business development and improving utility services and
costs; to increase sustainable revenues from fisheries, tourism, and other resource-
based sectors; and to improve access to regional labor markets.

The strategy recognized the lack of IDA funding and budget needed to support a
lending program to achieve the ambitious set of objectives. It therefore indicated
that the World Bank would focus its assistance on strategic economic and sector
work, donor coordination, targeted policy notes, and technical assistance to support
reforms. According to the strategy, “Selective lending activities will actively seek to
leverage donor resources to maximize their policy impact. The assistance will
balance demand-driven, country-specific initiatives with regional-level initiatives to
help create regional public goods.” The drafters believed the World Bank lacked the
resources to adopt a country-specific approach to lending, but that it could
undertake projects that were relevant for a number of countries and customize these
to the specific context of each country. The approach, later reflected in Pacific
Futures, was that these countries were not viable unless they could export labor and
had long-term, predictable aid flows, better fiscal management and governance, and
better behavior by international investors on natural resources including fisheries
(with the possible exception of Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste). According to
the country director at that time, “The World Bank was telling clients that
sustainability was out of the question, and that these countries were always likely to
need aid. The challenge for the World Bank was to help them live with this and
build regional synergies.”


The Move to a Country Program Strategy Approach as of FY11
The increased availability of IDA resources for small states and the availability of
substantially more budget and trust fund support overtook the regional strategy.
With the Pacific Islands Facility providing trust funding and the increase in the
minimum country allocation under IDA, World Bank management decided to
prepare individual country strategies to underpin a much-expanded engagement in
the region instead of preparing a new regional strategy. Between 2011 and 2015, the
World Bank prepared Country Assistance Strategy documents for Tonga, Kiribati,
Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the
Solomon Islands. The Tonga Country Assistance Strategy explained the rationale,


12
                                                                            CHAPTER 2
                                               WORLD BANK GROUP APPROACH AND STRATEGY
“As World Bank Group engagement intensifies, Pacific island clients are
increasingly demanding individual ‘custom-tailored’ strategies to reflect their
individual circumstances, and to incorporate the support that can be provided from
across the World Bank Group, including both IDA and IFC. Of course, given the
importance of greater regional integration if Pacific island countries are to increase
opportunities, such bespoke strategies will draw from key elements of a common
regional approach” (World Bank 2010).

A regional framework appended to the country document was the basis for each
country strategy. This was especially important because it set out two core themes
for World Bank support in the region. The first was Promoting Opportunities for
Greater Regional and Global Integration, inspired by World Development Report 2009:
Reshaping Economic Geography, which highlighted the importance of sea-locked
countries integrating more with the global economy. It stressed the need for greater
regional and subregional cooperation in areas such as fisheries, aviation, fuel
purchases, telecommunications regulation, and public sector audit institutions. The
second core theme was resilience against shocks. The definition of resilience was
broad—for example, covering the expansion of agricultural productivity, which was
seen as providing resilience against food price shocks. Notably, the World Bank did
not produce the regional framework jointly with IFC, and coverage of private sector
development in the regional framework is brief. The country strategy documents,
however, discuss in somewhat more detail the joint role of the World Bank and IFC,
together with ADB, in improving the enabling environment for new foreign and
local private investment, both foreign and local.

The World Bank Group prepared a Country Engagement Note for Fiji in 2015
because of its reengagement with the country. After the coup d’état in December
2006, the World Bank essentially ceased any new lending to Fiji while continuing to
support implementation of the ongoing program for renewable energy. The general
sentiment in Fiji is that the World Bank went too far and could have provided
additional technical assistance and maintained better contacts with government
officials. However, the World Bank did provide technical assistance to Fiji during
the period, most notably a study on its social protection system in FY12 that cost
$900,000. Although ADB also did not provide new funding for Fiji, it had a large
ongoing program, and the continuation of that program led to the perception that
ADB, unlike the World Bank, was being much more independent (of the Australian
position). Furthermore, ADB and agencies in Suva maintained their offices there.
The World Bank did not have an office in Suva at that time. The chill in relations
with Fiji had the unintended consequence of making the World Bank somewhat less
engaged with the regional agencies based in Suva than it might otherwise have



                                                                                     13

been. Once elections were scheduled, the World Bank moved quickly to resume
lending through cofinancing with $50 million from the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), a road project with ADB, and through
locating a country economist in Suva. The intention is to co-locate four to six staff in
the ADB office in Suva by the end of 2016. This reflects both the needs of a growing
Fiji program and the desire for closer association with the regional bodies based
there, along with easier logistics and lower travel costs.


The First Systematic Country Diagnostic for the PICs
The World Bank Group prepared the first Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD)2 for
the PIC-8 in 2015–16 (the SCD excluded Fiji from the group covered by the
evaluation, given that the World Bank had just issued a separate Country
Engagement Note for Fiji). Extensive consultations were conducted on the SCD,
including visits to the main island of the various groups and to the outer islands.
The most common feedback from the consultations was that extreme poverty is not
an issue. Comments from participants included: ”No one goes without food and
shelter.” “Do you see anyone naked here?” “Everyone can afford fees to send
children to school and donate money to the church”. Even in Kiribati,3 the extreme
poor are only 10 percent of the population. Regarding shared prosperity, the bottom
40 percent seem to be growing somewhat more slowly than the rest of the
population, but the data are unreliable. The poorer sections of the population tend to
be on the outer islands and in the peri-urban areas of the capital city. Migration and
remittances are an important factor—they are generally pro-poor and are a safety
net because they go up when natural disasters strike. However, remittances can be
pro-cyclical when there are shocks like the global economic crisis.

The SCD discussed three sectors that have the greatest potential to drive growth:
agriculture, tourism, and fisheries. Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for
women and most of the poor in the PIC-8. The SCD stated that the greatest potential
for agriculture lies in effectively exploiting the export and tourism sectors. Tourism
is an important driver of economic growth because of its significant potential for job
creation, and it tends to have a pro-poor focus and high distributional impact. The
SCD noted that despite the considerable potential for tourism, its development
would rely on an accommodating business environment, including the development
of new source markets, better marketing, improved air access, and better value for
money. Fisheries are the third potential growth driver in the region. The report
noted that although the employment impact of fisheries is limited, the PIC-8 could
obtain higher revenues from selling fishing licenses, which facilitates the provision
of public services to the poor.

                                              WORLD BANK GROUP APPROACH AND STRATEGY

The Balance of World Bank Lending for Budget Support, Sectors, and Countries
During the past 10 years, the World Bank program in the Pacific increased eightfold
in number of new commitments and nearly twentyfold in lending volume. The
average number of World Bank commitments to the nine Pacific Islands increased
sharply from about two new commitments per year during the FY06–08 period to
about 19 per year during FY13–15 period (including those supported through trust
funds). At the same time, the volume of commitments increased from an annual
average of $8 million during FY06–08 to $151 million per year during FY13–15. The
bulk of commitments occurred through investment lending, which accounted for 87
percent of total commitments during FY06–15. Three countries—Samoa, Tonga, and
Vanuatu—accounted for a little over half of the new commitments during the
evaluation period.

The World Bank’s role and presence in the region expanded equally with its
operational support program. According to an earlier country director interviewed
for the evaluation, “Fifteen to 20 years ago, the World Bank was asking itself
whether it had any role in the South Pacific. There was a very small unit in Sydney
and a headquarters-driven program, which consisted mainly of preparing
Country Economic Memorandums on each island. The program had little shape or
rationale.” That began to change after Timor-Leste’s independence in 1999, and by
the end of 2006, there were about 55 staff—half of which were local staff in Timor-
Leste, and 20 were based in Sydney. Discussions with the Australian authorities at
this time revealed a common interest in ramping up programs in the region. The
Australian government wanted to bring in the World Bank’s analytic skills and
wanted its involvement in catalytic projects in infrastructure. The World Bank
decided to create a larger and more dynamic work program supported by the Pacific
Facility, but also with substantial World Bank budget increases (10–15 percent). The
World Bank staff expanded to 90 by 2009, with 40 based in Sydney. The World Bank
also established joint offices with ADB in Samoa and Tonga.

Infrastructure was the major focus of World Bank lending in the PICs, focused
on energy, road transport, telecommunications, and aviation. The World Bank
strategically decided, for selectivity, not to take on urban infrastructure and
water projects. Although ADB is present in these areas, donors expressed
concern that the urban sector in particular has not received the focus it requires
given the influx from rural areas into peri-urban areas. Besides infrastructure,
the lending program put substantial weight on building buffers to withstand
shocks, doing so through policy agreements under Development Policy
Operations (DPOs). The work included an early warning system in Vanuatu, a
damage assessment in Tuvalu, and establishing the regional insurance program


                                                                                  15

Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative, which helps
provide liquidity in the immediate aftermath of a shock. The program put less
weight on health and education, reflecting the Australian and New Zealand aid
programs’ emphasis on these areas. Agriculture was not a significant feature of
the World Bank program until recently. Although World Bank strategies in the
PICs have little discussion of the IFC program, the government of Australia was
particularly interested in increased engagement by IFC in the region and
established a trust fund to support increased IFC involvement.

Development policy operations to provide budget support were a key element of the
World Bank’s approach. DPOs represent a significant share of the World Bank’s
lending in some PICs and are considered a good fit for several reasons. DPOs’ quick-
disbursement feature allows rapid response after natural disasters; they helped
build consensus for key areas of policy reform; they require lower transactions costs
than investment lending; and they provided a convening instrument for donors.

The World Bank continued to use multi-country platforms where they are a good fit
with the program. World Bank projects in aviation (Tonga, Kiribati, Tuvalu,
Vanuatu and Samoa) and fisheries (the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall
Islands, and the Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu) are the most prominent examples.
The World Bank Group also provided selective support across countries in niches
where it has capacity that other donors may lack, such as measuring education
achievement and expanding women’s access to banking.

Expansion of the World Bank’s engagement in the past five years is evident in table
2.1. The largest engagements were in Samoa and Tonga, and coverage of Tuvalu was
considerable relative to its small size. Programs in Kiribati and Vanuatu are
somewhat smaller, reflecting their lack of capacity and, in Vanuatu, political
instability. Fiji is an outlier, reflecting the political developments during the period.
The programs in the North Pacific were much smaller due to the grant assistance
available from the United States and the consequent reluctance of these countries to
borrow. Both the Federal States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands were
classified as IBRD countries until 2011. They were reclassified as IDA only
borrowers under the exception for small island economies in 2011 for the Marshall
Islands and in 2013 for the Federated States of Micronesia.

The World Bank also had a large program of analytic work and technical assistance
over the period. The World Bank undertook about 80 analytic and advisory activities
in the PICs totaling $28 million. Most striking is the extent to which the World Bank
moved away from core diagnostic studies in the PICs. Nearly 40 of these studies
were regional, ranging from the major studies such as Home and Away and Pacific
Futures, to small technical assistance activities to support regional institutions.
Many of these 40 are classified as regional because they are multi-country studies,
even though they do not relate directly to broader regional issues. The sectoral
breakdown of World Bank analytic and advisory activities shows no particular
concentration in any one sector, and even areas such as agriculture and the social
sectors, where the World Bank had limited lending, have substantial coverage in the
analytic and advisory activities program. Regarding the country breakdown, there
were no analytic and advisory activities in the Federated States of Micronesia, the
Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu other than those undertaken under the regional rubric.
There were more analytic and advisory activities in Vanuatu and Fiji than in other
countries—perhaps reflecting the World Bank’s intent to continue providing
support in political environments that made lending difficult.

The cost per dollar lent of World Bank operations in the PICs is far above the World
Bank average. As might be expected given the small population of the PICs (and
therefore the much smaller size of the average operation), transactions costs per
dollar lent are significantly higher. During FY05–15, a proxy for average lending cost
per dollar of new commitments in the PICs was 16.4 times the East Asia and Pacific
Region’s average and 15.8 times the World Bank average.4 This compares to a ratio
of about 10 times the World Bank average for the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean
States (OECS). Similarly, in the same period a proxy for average supervision cost per

extremely crude, but they illustrate the orders of magnitude involved.6

protecting incomes, assets and services for the poor.
3Among the PICs, the poor are concentrated in the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati,
and Vanuatu, and most of them live in outer islands.
4 The evaluation team used World Bank administrative budget data (which distinguishes
new lending—that is, project preparation—and supervision costs), data on the flow of new
World Bank lending commitments, and the stock of active World Bank net lending
commitments (that is, the size of operations under supervision) during the period FY05–15.
To proxy preparation costs per dollar lent, the evaluation team calculated the ratio of new
lending costs in a given fiscal year to new lending commitments in the next fiscal year, and
used]the average for the entire period.
5To proxy supervision costs relative to project size, the evaluation team calculated the ratio
of supervision costs in a given fiscal year to the stock of active net lending commitments at
the end of the fiscal year, and again used the average for the entire period.
6Although the measures used are extremely crude proxies for what the team seeks to
capture, two factors dampen potential bias and error: the averaging over a 10-year period,
and the use of a (unit-free) measure that compares one country group with another.

3. Assessment of World Bank Group Strategy
and Program
How the World Bank Group Addressed the Constraints of Supporting the Pacific
Island Countries
Donors supporting small states face a particular constraint because their systems
and approaches evolved to serve the needs of larger borrowers. These therefore
reflect procedures and safeguards that require considerable counterpart capacity.
The World Bank Group had to address six major issues to operate effectively in the
Pacific Island Countries (PICs):

        International financial institutions have small lending envelopes and limited
         budgets in absolute terms for small states, even if large in per capita terms.
        Country capacity is often weak, and they tend to be thin in the field, even
         where there are competent senior officials.
        World Bank systems in financial management, legal opinions, monitoring,
         reporting, audit requirements, and particularly procurement are at the same
         scale for small states as for much larger ones.
        The small size of ministries and limited capacity puts a much greater
         premium on effective donor coordination in small states than in larger ones.
        There is a need for a careful balance between regional- and country-level
         support and operations, particularly in the PICs.
        The balance between representation at the regional and country levels is a
         difficult one for the World Bank, given that the basic Bank model of a
         regional country director supported by country managers in all borrowing
         countries, is not feasible for very small states.

The game-changer in the PICs has been the support provided by Australia and New
Zealand through the Pacific Islands Facility for the World Bank and the Pacific
Partnership for IFC. This support was necessary for the expansion of World Bank
Group programs in the PICs, but it also requires the World Bank Group to meet
donor objectives, both explicit and implicit. The Pacific Partnership has a clear
results framework agreed to with the Australian and New Zealand governments
and IFC. The Pacific Islands Facility does not have an explicit results framework, but
the broad objectives of Australia and New Zealand are understood and reflected in
the World Bank’s approach. Although the evaluation’s focus is on whether the
World Bank Group is meeting its own objectives in the PICs (as reflected in its
strategies), it is also important to ask whether the World Bank Group is meeting


19
CHAPTER 3
ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
Australia and New Zealand’s objectives—if not, funding is at risk, raising issues for
the program’s sustainability as currently conceived.

WORKING UNDER SMALL LENDING ENVELOPES AND LIMITED BUDGETS
Effectiveness largely relates to the scale of operations and the need to undertake a
critical mass of activity in small countries. Modifications to the IDA allocation
formula made a substantial difference in the World Bank’s ability to operate in small
states. The Country Management Unit (CMU) took full advantage of regional IDA
allocations and trust funds, which allows the World Bank to operate with the
coverage and depth it needs in its chosen areas of expertise in a number of the
islands. A frequent complaint is that the IDA allocation formula does not account for
vulnerability, which should factor into both the overall allocation and the balance
between IDA credits and grants (currently 50–50). Bilateral donors and the European
Union (EU) also expressed concern over the inconsistency between the World Bank’s
policy advice to these countries not to take on debt and the debt burden incurred
through IDA credits.

Projects in the PICs are costly to administer. Costs per dollar lent in the PICs are a
multiple of the World Bank average. This is not just a function of the small size of
loans. World Bank engagement in some islands and sectors is relatively new, and a
great deal of handholding is required. Bank staff provide an unusually large amount
of direct implementation support. In addition, many task teams hire consultants to
provide implementation support, which must continue well beyond quarterly or six-
monthly missions. Travel is often difficult. Some islands, such as Kiribati, require a
week of travel for a one- or two-day presence, and flight cancellations are frequent.
The impact of the Pacific Facility and Pacific Partnership in enabling the World Bank
Group to scale up its activities cannot be overstated. The additional resources
provided a margin that enables the World Bank Group to respond to countries’ and
donor’s demand for expanded activities.

ADDRESSING THIN COUNTRY CAPACITY
Capacity is a major issue for small states. The short-term issues are ensuring that the
capacity needed to carry out core development programs is available, and ensuring
that donor demands do not overstress or preempt the limited capacity. The long-
term issue is determining which capacities to build and retain.

Capacity varies widely across the PICs. Kiribati, for example, has no qualified
accountants and only one civil engineer. Samoa, by contrast, has a substantial
amount of capacity. In places that lack capacity, trying to build local capacity is not
necessarily the answer. A great deal of donor support goes to capacity
supplementation instead of capacity building. According to a World Bank staff

                                   ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
member, “In the road sector in Kiribati and Tuvalu, where there is one road, there is
no point in building capacity. Capacity in those contexts is about managing
outsourcing.”

Heavy dependence on consultants raises cost and quality control issues. Remoteness
is a strong disincentive for many individual consultants, and the small contracts are
unattractive to consulting firms. There is a perception that consultants who come to
small states, particularly to the PICs, are often ‘from the bottom of the barrel’. One
donor representative commented, “Countries get second-rate quality at a premium
price.” This perception’s validity is questionable. Australia and New Zealand have
many well-qualified consultants with considerable experience in different PICs.
They know the region well and are closer to it than, for example, a European
consultant working in Africa. For every anecdote about a consultant’s poor
performance, others speak of their high commitment. The premium in the PICs is
less on technical skills and more on trying to understand the context and adapting
approaches to deal with realities in the field. A problem is that PICs governments
have less capacity to manage consultants, so a great deal of this burden falls on the
donors who fund consultants. This additional supervision burden should factor into
the cost equation. Government representatives said that in some cases, the World
Bank had not done enough to set clear expectations for consultants at the outset.
One official said, “Sometimes the consultants are content to sit back and rely on the
local staff to do the work instead of being proactive. Some consultants are more of a
cost than a benefit. The World Bank needs to do better quality control of
consultants.”

Small administrations mean that it is difficult to get timely critical decisions.
Ministries have limited senior backup, so for adequate checks and balances,
countries generally require contract approval by two or three different agencies.
Officials in thin administrations often travel for regional and donor meetings, and
their absence contributes to processing delays. This makes World Bank approvals
time-consuming because the final approvals must wait for absent key officials to
return, which puts a premium on country presence. For example, liaison officers in
Tonga and Samoa can anticipate potential delays and expedite necessary actions,
follow up effectively because of their good connections in national bureaucracies.

WORKING UNDER WORLD BANK SYSTEMS
Project management in the PICs relies heavily on the use of Program Management
Units (PMUs). Although it has undoubtedly contributed to better project processing,
it raises a number of issues. In many cases, PMU staff salaries are well above regular
ministry levels, and the career path may not lead back into the government but to
migration instead. A number of officials voiced concern at the high cost of World


                                                                                      21
CHAPTER 3
ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
Bank–supported PMUs, given the heavy reliance on international consultants that
can amount to as much as 30 percent of the project’s cost.

The World Bank’s standard operating procedures still caused significant delays in
project implementation, even with the large expenditure on PMUs. A number of
midlevel staff noted the World Bank’s tendency to provide pages of comments on
almost every project document and not focus on key issues. Of particular concern is
the tendency of a new task team leader to want to put a personal stamp on the
project by changing some aspects that were agreed to with the previous task team
leader. Differences between donor procedures are another source of complexity.
According to one official, “We are still trying to get used to all the World Bank rules.
I wish ADB and World Bank procedures were harmonized. Because of this we need
to allocate an excessive amount of funds for staffing up the PMUs.” However, it is
worth noting the high praise among the officials interviewed for how quickly the
World Bank responds to issues the government raises or problems that arise. Said
one official, “It takes us two or three weeks to get a decision, but the other way
around they (the Bank) respond in an instant.”

World Bank procurement is a major challenge for the PICs with their very limited
numbers of procurement staff, despite considerable efforts to simplify the rules and
provide support. The recent simplification, which raised the ceiling for shopping to
$500,000, helped considerably in this area.1 The CMU held seminars in the region to
get contractors familiar with World Bank requirements, and many projects have
international procurement advisers. However, the problem remains despite these
efforts as line ministries face chronic human resources limitations. Indeed, line
ministries in the PICs that do not provide direct services typically have about 30
staff, many of whom do not have the technical skills even to manage outsourced
contracts. One official noted, “The World Bank’s procurement processes are a
nightmare. The procurement needs are the same for a small project as a big project.
Perhaps the World Bank should just do all these small technical assistance-type
projects as Bank-executed.” A number of officials in Tonga and Samoa raised the
question of why the World Bank could not use national systems (which are based on
Australian and New Zealand models). Even if national systems were used, it would
still be necessary to monitor whether they are being correctly implemented. In
countries this small, it is almost impossible to have procurement as a career stream,
and the tiny public procurement agencies have great difficulty staffing up.

The World Bank used several implementation models in its projects, including
recruitment of implementation support specialists, regional implementation units
and outsourcing to private sector consulting firms. The CMU has piloted the
“Implementation Support Specialist” initiative to provide responsive, hands-on

                                    ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
assistance to small states, fragile clients, as well as high-risk or problem projects. The
recruitment of staff to work with the weakest countries has been successful and is
now being replicated in Papua New Guinea, the North Pacific, and the energy sector
Pacific wide. The World Bank’s model for aviation in which a regional advisory
implementation unit has helped handle procurement, is also promising. However,
the World Bank needs to do a better job of explaining the benefits of this model and
getting country buy-in. Another approach used in Samoa that has potential for
replication outsourced the PMU to a private consulting firm. The Samoan
government contracted with Isikuki Punivalu and Associates (IPA) Engineering and
Management Consultants, a private company founded by a former government
official, to manage a number of infrastructure and environmental projects. The
company has eight professional staff and handles accounting, technical advice, and
procurement, and serves as a secretariat to the project’s steering committee. Views
are mixed on the success of this approach and procurement is still challenging.

Taking a systemic view on how to handle weak contracting capacity would be
helpful. The lack of a domestic market (except for Fiji) constrains contracting
capacity. Contractors do not work steadily and will not buy equipment until they
have a contract. Donors should periodically examine the entire project portfolio to
see if contracting might be coordinated to provide greater continuity for potential
contractors. Analytic work on the private contracting industry in the PICs would
help explore how to strengthen it.

Similarly, a systemic approach to handling traditional land tenure systems in project
design and implementation could help speed implementation and reduce costs.
Land issues caused delays and increased costs in a number of projects. In Tonga’s
post-cyclone reconstruction project, where the World Bank financed housing, those
who occupied the houses did not have clear title to their land, meaning it was
uncertain if they could continue to occupy the reconstructed houses. In the Samoa
agriculture project, the lack of title makes it difficult for banks to lend for land
improvements and farm buildings. Leasehold arrangements generally resolved
these issues but invariably with lengthy delays. Hence, the complexities
surrounding land regime require a very thorough understanding of the political
economy of land issues for a particular context. The Bank would need to do upfront
analytic work on understanding these issues at the country level, and considering
these issues much more explicitly during project preparation. For example, one
approach for the Bank, suggested by the Pacific team, could be instead of offering a
wholesale land reform advice (i.e., moving toward clear title approach), to improve
the capability of existing institutions/stakeholders that manage land dealings to
produce fairer and more durable outcomes—the landholders, investors, and
government—by bolstering the checks and balances of associated administrative

processes, supporting innovation in local level dispute resolution, and by
strengthening the provision of independent advisory service to all parties in the
transaction. A fragility filter as part of infrastructure/private sector development
project could help by guaranteeing that investments are taking those complexities
into account and have mechanisms to ensure that they are not exacerbating further
tensions.

PROMOTING ENHANCED DONOR COORDINATION
There are eight major donors in the PICs: Australia, China, the EU, Japan, New
Zealand, Asian Development Bank (ADB), United Nations Development
Programme, and the World Bank Group. Other United Nations (UN) agencies, the
International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) are also important players in selected areas. This is a large number of
actors and donor missions relative to the size of these countries. Meeting donor
requirements and representing countries at donor-organized meetings imposes large
burdens on overstretched senior government officials.

The donor community uses the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility (PRIF) to
coordinate their efforts in infrastructure. In the PICs, effective aid coordination is
particularly important in support of infrastructure. Governments tend to worsen the
coordination problem by presenting the same wish list to each donor. A former
World Bank staff member leads the PRIF, established in 2008 and funded mainly by
Australia and New Zealand. The PRIF’s objectives are to allow donors to coordinate
effectively in the sector, conduct research and analysis on infrastructure needs and
priorities, and provide technical assistance to governments in the infrastructure
sector. Five working groups—transport, energy, water, urban, and information and
communication technology (ICT)—meet quarterly to exchange ideas, keep all
members informed about projects, and assess the technical assistance needs of
individual countries. An important part of the PRIF’s work was to prepare reports
that benchmark the performance of the PICs, such as a recent report on Pacific
power utilities. The PRIF has proved useful for identifying infrastructure needs after
natural disasters and planning how best to meet those needs. It also worked with
countries to develop strategic infrastructure plans. The World Bank is a PRIF
member, but it does not provide funding. One World Bank staff member said, “The
PRIF has been a real plus—providing for a more strategic approach among the
donor community to support for the energy sector.” The countries are somewhat
more skeptical. They particularly note that China’s absence is a disadvantage
because it finances and constructs so much infrastructure.

The World Bank and ADB also made special efforts to coordinate their engagements
in infrastructure in the PICs, such as designating a lead institution in some sectors in

particular countries. In the energy sector, for example, the World Bank takes the lead
in Tonga and Vanuatu, while ADB leads in Samoa. When the two institutions
cofinanced projects, they worked to try to harmonize procedures. For the Fiji road
project, the World Bank provided $50 million of cofinancing to ADB’s $100 million
in support of the project. Bank management agreed to use ADB’s procedures for the
project, including its procurement procedures. This is the first time that the Bank has
done this and it has proven a major advantage for the implementing agency, which
has not worked with the World Bank since well before the 2006 coup. ADB will be
using the World Bank’s procurement systems in the Samoa cable project. For the
Tonga cable project, the World Bank and ADB agreed on harmonizing the
procurement approach, but there were teething problems. Neither institution had, at
that time, policies that were conducive for co-financing an investment of this type.
Consequently, the company was burdened with eight different versions of the
documents and 668 pages, according to the company’s chief executive. Moving
forward, there would seem to be substantial benefits for small states from the
adoption of harmonized procedures by the multilateral development banks.

The Development Policy Operation (DPO) instrument significantly contributed to
more effective donor coordination. The experience with budget support in Tonga
shows the importance of effective donor coordination in the small country context
and the potential role of the DPO in this regard. ADB started with budget support in
2009 as the impact of the global crisis on remittances became clear. The World Bank
decided to link its budget support to the energy sector program. Australia and the
EU also came in with budget support. All these different programs had separate sets
of policy conditions—for example, 30 conditions from ADB, and two pages each of
conditions from Australia and New Zealand. After this round of budget support, in
2010 the Bank started a new round of budget support for the 2011 and 2012 DPOs,
which focused on a small number of actions—about 10–12 in a joint matrix.
Australia and New Zealand provided their budget support against this matrix. The
multi-donor dialogue continued in subsequent years, with the ADB also providing
support against the new joint matrices for the 2013 and 2014 DPOs.

The World Bank contributed effectively to aid coordination. Donor coordination in
the policy dialogue on macro, fiscal, and governance issues has been an area of good
practice. The DPOs have been particularly effective in this regard. Said one donor,
“The push for budget support has been driven by the World Bank and has been a
big success. It was very fragmented before. The World Bank has worked very closely
with Australia, New Zealand, ADB, and the EU.” Collaborative work on digital
communications is another good practice example, in the Australian authorities’
view. The Australian project on policy engagement and subsidy in Vanuatu led to

opening the market; the World Bank helped by bringing in the experience of
Barbados, and IFC brought in the clients. Conversely, in the Enhanced Road Access
Project in Samoa, a Bank decision was taken that the project was not able to absorb
funding from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)
because the implementing agency was not performing well. The World Bank team
failed to communicate this to the Australian authorities in a timely fashion. Donor
government officials emphasized the need for visiting missions to meet with their
local representatives to ensure effective communications.

All donors and PICs believe it is important for China to enter the donor coordination
framework. China is a particularly important player in the region (except in Kiribati,
the Marshall Islands, Palau, and Tuvalu, which recognize Taiwan, China). Samoa
and Tonga received substantial funding from China. The fact that the Ministry of
External Affairs in China is not responsible for the assistance provided by the
Chinese Exim Bank (which falls under the Ministry of Commerce) complicates the
dialogue.2 However, it is generally recognized that “China is a difficult partner to
manage,” as one donor stated. Continuing efforts are needed to bring China into the
aid coordination frameworks in the PICs (by inviting Chinese authorities to send
observers to meetings, for example) and to persuade governments that offers of
assistance from Chinese companies require the same kind of vetting and due
diligence that is applied to other assistance.

WORKING AT THE REGIONAL, MULTI-COUNTRY, OR NATIONAL LEVEL
It seems, in principle, that there would be great scope in the PICs for capturing
economies of scale through regional or multi-country approaches, but this has
proven difficult to achieve. Careful thought has been given by donors to the areas in
which regional institutions can add value in the PICs, and studies have been
published on this topic. The value added of a regional approach in areas as diverse
as aviation, fisheries, and auditing is widely recognized and accepted. The
University of the South Pacific is also regarded as a successful regional institution. In
the private sector, the Bank South Pacific (BSP) is a successful multi-country
enterprise. Despite this, in some sectors donor officials saw the regional institutions
as an additional and unnecessary layer, and observed that the quality of staffing in
these institutions is highly uneven. The PICs see the regional institutions as
competing with their own; they have limited ownership of these institutions, most of
which depend on donor support.

The World Bank tried to take advantage of economies of scale through multi-
country platforms. The most important examples are in fisheries and aviation. The
World Bank adopted a regional approach in the aviation project, in which it
supported the creation of a regional advisory implementing service the “Technical

                                      ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
and Fiduciary Services Unit” (TFSU) based in Tonga. This body has been working
effectively and is viewed by the Bank as a cost efficient way to address capacity
constraints, but there has been pushback from the government of Kiribati and also
dissatisfaction expressed by some officials in Samoa, who see the unit as an
additional bureaucratic layer.

The World Bank has not been consistent in its approach to involving regional
institutions. Some projects recognized the importance of bringing regional
institutions into the dialogue, the program design, and areas in which their capacity
is inadequate (including special training in the project design). The fisheries project
is a good practice model in this regard. The aviation project provides technical
assistance to the Pacific Aviation Safety Organization for preparation of a business
plan, implementation of restructuring measures, strengthening capacity for
management policy, safety, and security oversight. However, in projects not
explicitly adopting a regional or multi-country platform, it appears that the World
Bank is not systematically addressing regional involvement. Regional authorities
noted lack of support from the World Bank for training their staff. Medical
personnel training would seem to be an area with high potential for a regional
approach, such as licensing across national borders. In education, regional work
could include standard setting, assessment systems, teacher training, and vocational
education.

Strengthening regional institutions to support development programs more
effectively is seen as a World Bank comparative advantage. Australian authorities,
for whom regional approaches are difficult, consider the World Bank’s work with
regional institutions among its useful contributions. The authorities noted,
“Although the outcomes have been modest, the World Bank lends credibility to the
dialogue.” The chill in the World Bank’s relationship with Fiji from 2006 to 2014
reduced interaction between the World Bank and the regional agencies, and the
evaluation team found that some of the regional agencies distrusted the World Bank.
It was noted, however, that World Bank engagement had increased during the past
two years, perhaps reflecting the revival of the Fiji program. The larger World Bank
presence in Suva, where most of the agencies are based, has potential for a more
collegial and productive relationship between the World Bank and regional
institutions.

ENSURING THE WORLD BANK’S PRESENCE IN THE FIELD IN THE PACIFIC REGION
The lack of World Bank presence in the field is the most frequently expressed
concern of donors and country authorities. Given the capacity issues in the PICs,
Bank missions to support implementation are frequent, at least quarterly in most



                                                                                       27

ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
cases. However, there have been complaints from senior officials about the amount
of time they spend meeting with World Bank and other donor missions. One cause
of their concern is the continuity of Bank task team leaders. Officials suggested that
the Bank plan the transition of task team leaders more carefully with overlap and
handover missions, and consider replacing brief, periodic missions with extended
stays by task team leaders during key points in the project cycle or implementation.
(These concerns resonate with the findings of a recent IEG evaluation on learning in
World Bank operations.) The complaint about a lack of presence in the field seems to
relate more to the need for a deepening of political economy and contextual
understanding of the PICs, and the need for a clearer strategic approach to their
development priorities at the country level to balance the excellent job the World
Bank is doing through its regional analytic studies. Some suggested that moving the
CMU to Suva would help improve the World Bank’s presence (box 3.1).

The World Bank opened its regional office in Sydney in 2000.3 The difficulties and
frequency of travel to the PICs, the distance of the Sydney office from other Bank
offices, and the awkward time difference between Washington, D.C. and Sydney are
major operational problems for the Bank. These may worsen under the Bank’s new
structure because staff members are mapped to a global practice instead of the East
Asia and Pacific Region or the CMU in Sydney. It is difficult to get experienced staff
to locate in the PICs because of the distances and their small populations. Costly,
poor-quality Internet connectivity is another problem for the World Bank. However,
this is likely to improve through ongoing Bank support in this area.


Box 3.1. Should the World Bank Consider Relocating its Country Management Unit to Suva?
Asian Development Bank’s regional office is in Suva, as is the IMF regional
representative. Some interlocutors suggested that the World Bank should consider
moving its Country Management Unit to Suva. This option should be on the table, but in
the evaluation team’s view, it is premature. Although it would reduce costs, it would
make recruitment much more difficult. There is symbolic value in such a shift, but it is
unlikely to increase the depth of World Bank engagement in the PICs. Rebalancing
staffing between Sydney and Suva is appropriate, and with resumption of lending to Fiji,
the World Bank plans to locate four to six technical staff in Suva by the end of 2016. A
macroeconomist is based there now. Some World Bank managers noted that the new
global practice structure adds to the complexity of staffing in the PICs because technical
staff—even if located in Suva—may have incompatible work programs or programs that
require them to travel to other countries or regions. For example, a major reengagement
with Fiji on the Reform of Public Services is managed by the Governance Global Practice,
but the macroeconomist based in Fiji is mapped to the Macroeconomics and Fiscal
Management Global Practice. Therefore, no one is in the field to help communicate with
counterparts and move the public services program forward.

Joint liaison offices established with ADB in 2009 underpin growing World Bank
Group engagement in Tonga and Samoa. The offices (each staffed by a local
professional) were instrumental in improving dialogue with the government and
encouraging better cooperation with ADB and with other partners present in
Nuku’alofa and Apia. The World Bank provides funding for the Samoa office staff,
and ADB funds the Tonga office. In the evaluation mission’s view, the joint local
liaison offices have been highly effective. Joint liaison offices are also in Kiribati and
Vanuatu, but the liaison officer position in Kiribati has been unfilled for two years.4
The joint liaison offices also strengthen coordination with ADB. The question was
raised in Tonga whether the volume of work now warranted splitting the office and
having separate liaison officers for the World Bank and ADB, perhaps using a
shared facility. This would also help with providing backup capacity.

MEETING TRUST FUND OBJECTIVES SET BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND
The governments of Australia and New Zealand established two trust funds to
support World Bank Group operations in the Pacific region. The initial phase of the
Pacific Facility (about $50 million) was established in 2005 and closed in December
2014. A follow up phase has been agreed. It provides noncore funding (funding not
associated with specific program objectives) to the World Bank. The funding can be
used in ways that are fully fungible with the World Bank’s own budget and
represents an augmentation of the World Bank budget for the region of about 40 to
50 percent. The Pacific Partnership (about $19 million) was established in 2006 and
closed in 2013 with subsequent follow-up. It provides funding to IFC to support a
results framework related to the achievement of support for private sector
development in the region.

The Pacific Facility’s purpose was to leverage a greater role for the World Bank (and
ADB through a similar trust fund) in the Pacific region. Although World Bank
activity expanded substantially, it is uncertain to what extent this is attributable to
the trust fund. The availability of larger IDA allocations for small states (to which
Australia and New Zealand contributed through their roles as IDA Deputies) was a
major part of the expansion. World Bank activities would have expanded to use the
increased allocation. However, the availability of the additional budget enabled by
the Pacific Facility most likely facilitated the CMU’s success in mobilizing additional
trust funds to support work on environment, education, crisis response, and
regional programs. Arguably, the most important impact of the additional funding
was on the quality of work and the World Bank’s ability to engage in policy
dialogue, provide on-demand technical support, contribute to more effective donor
coordination, and support regional institutions.

CHAPTER 3
ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
An independent evaluation of Pacific Facility III covering 2005 to 2012 rated
relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency fully satisfactory (DFAT 2012). The
evaluation found that the facility delivered value for money, and the World Bank
“played an increasing and highly appreciated role in macroeconomic policy,
economic dialogue, and donor coordination around budget support operations, and
has expanded its Analytic and Advisory Activities.” Furthermore, the evaluation
found that the World Bank managed its operation well and establishing new offices
had enhanced its performance. It noted that coordination with regional agencies,
such as Secretariat for the Pacific Community and the Pacific Forum, and reporting
to the donors was less than fully satisfactory and that there were “still areas where
more effective support could be provided in a context of thin implementation
capacity.” The evaluation recommended continuation of the trust fund and
suggested that the World Bank emphasize implementation of the current portfolio
over preparing new operations. It proposed a stronger donor voice in determining
which analytic and advisory activities are undertaken. The evaluation rated the
World Bank’s support for gender equality through the trust fund as moderately
unsatisfactory. Discussions in Canberra and Wellington validated the independent
evaluation’s findings, emphasizing the positive findings, but also noting the World
Bank’s lackluster support for gender equality.

It is too early to evaluate the Pacific Partnership between Australia and New
Zealand and IFC, but initial indications are positive. The partnership identifies a set
of quantitative targets to be achieved by 2017. These seem ambitious, and the Pacific
Partnership may need to consider modifying them. Still, the achievements so far
seem to have met donor expectations. The independent evaluation notes that the
expanded World Bank role in many areas that are critical for private sector
development and the synergies between the two trust funds supported IFC’s efforts,
and vice versa.

The symbiotic relationship between Australia and New Zealand and the World
Bank Group in the Pacific Islands is evident. Each challenges the other to do more
and to do it better.5 The World Bank speaking up on the need for expanded
migration and for long-term donor support may have come as a surprise, but it was
welcomed as a significant contribution to the internal dialogue in Australia and New
Zealand on migration and aid policies. Similarly, the two trust funds had a favorable
impact on the level and quality of World Bank Group programs in the Pacific region.
Whether this is a model that can or should be replicated elsewhere is a more difficult
discussion. The risk for the World Bank Group is that these kinds of approaches
undermine the integrity of the basic internal budget allocation process. Although the
evaluation team recognizes this risk, it is difficult for any allocation system to
adequately factor in the minimum critical mass required for effective operation in a

country as small as Tuvalu. Comparing the World Bank Group’s program before the
trust funds with the present program shows that the World Bank can now operate at
the scale required to define and achieve results in the field in these countries.


Assessing World Bank Group Assistance in Building Resilience in the PICs
STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC RESILIENCE
The PICs have large structural fiscal deficits. Public expenditures for PICs represent
a multiple of their own revenues because they cannot capture the economies of scale
in administration and service provision, despite a revenue effort comparable to that
of other lower-middle-income countries. The heavy burden of financing public
services in small states is even larger where services must be delivered to isolated
island communities. Therefore, the PICs depend on aid flows to meet their current
account deficits and finance virtually all their capital expenditures. Almost all donor
support for the PICs is on concessional terms, but even highly concessional debt
imposes a burden on repayment capacity when used for projects that have no direct
financial returns, such as government buildings, hospitals, and roads. Therefore,
sustainable debt management is a crucial part of the resilience challenge they face.
However, the experience of the past decade suggests that resilience needs to go
beyond capacity to service debt. The global crisis and earlier spikes in food and fuel
prices required temporary relief for the less well off. Those events and frequent
natural disasters suggest a need for governments to be able to act counter-cyclically
to accumulate reserves or borrowing capacity during normal years that can be used
during crises and disasters. Figure 3.1 shows the impact of external shocks on the
fiscal deficit for Samoa.

CHAPTER 3
ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
Consequently, support for enhanced public financial management was an important
part of the World Bank’s program in the PICs. The role the World Bank could have
in promoting effective public financial management was an important motivation
for setting up the Pacific Facility. The strategy documents and World Bank programs
show four objectives or focal areas of World Bank engagement with public financial
management: raising revenues, improving public expenditure efficiency,
encouraging sustainable fiscal management, and strengthening public financial
management systems for enhanced transparency and accountability. Appendix G
provides detailed evaluative evidence on the World Bank contributions under each
of these objectives in the PICs. Appendixes B and D present detailed reviews of
World Bank programs in Tonga and Samoa.

The evaluation assesses the World Bank Group’s overall work on economic
resilience in the PICs as moderately satisfactory. The World Bank effectively used
the DPO instrument to help harmonize donor efforts and deepen the policy dialogue
on macro-fiscal issues with the PIC governments. Outsourcing various
infrastructure and social services significantly contributed to both streamlining the
government and its functions and to promoting private sector activity. The World
Bank also helped deepen the understanding and analysis of debt sustainability
issues in the PICs. Furthermore, the World Bank helped create awareness of the
potential for expanded fisheries revenues, and the twin health and fiscal benefits of
increased tobacco and sugar taxation. However, the PICs still have some way to go
in recognizing the importance of building a more resilient approach to fiscal
management.

BUILDING ENVIRONMENTAL RESILIENCE
Pacific Island countries are among the most vulnerable in the world to natural
disasters. Most face high exposure to cyclones, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, and
other hazards, and have limited capacity to manage the resulting risks.6 Damage
from natural hazards is a significant drag on development, with a large portion of
economic output consumed by reconstruction and rehabilitation costs. It also takes a
significant human toll through deaths, injuries, displacement, and social impacts.
The damage was substantial in recent years and was a major driver of
macroeconomic performance.7 Climate change will worsen existing risks in the
medium term, though coastal development, poor planning, and other factors also
drive increased disaster exposure. Climate change may also have severe long-term
impacts through sea level rise, coastal inundation, and salinization of groundwater,
particularly for low-lying atoll countries such as Kiribati and Tuvalu, which may
face existential threats.

                                   ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
The World Bank’s strategy during the past decade was anchored by two pieces of
analytic work: Not If But When: Adapting to Natural Hazards in the Pacific Islands
Region: A Policy Note (2006), and Acting Today for Tomorrow: A Policy and Practice Note
for Climate and Disaster Resilient Development in the Pacific Islands Region (2012). The
2006 study argued for a shift from disaster response toward proactive risk reduction
and climate proofing, noting as constraints a range of perverse incentives in donor
and client countries, poor country institutional arrangements, and overemphasis on
physical investments rather than behavioral change and knowledge work. The 2012
study noted that fragmented project-based disaster risk management (DRM) and
climate change adaptation initiatives have not reduced underlying vulnerability in a
lasting way. It noted weak coordination between and within donor and country
institutions and the need for improved access to climate and disaster data, and
argued for mainstreaming disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation in
development planning. The 2012 study also reiterated the need to house DRM
coordination in high-level institutional bodies.

The World Bank used a range of instruments to engage in DRM. The World Bank
has a history of engagement in disaster response reconstruction and in risk
reduction in Samoa and Tonga, primarily through investment lending operations,
but also through Development Policy Lending in Samoa.8 These operations
supported a mix of post-disaster reconstruction (aiming to build structures that will
be more resilient), specific risk reduction investments, and capacity building for
disaster preparedness and response capacity. The World Bank had a long running
program on climate change adaptation in Kiribati—one of its first explicit climate
change adaptation efforts. Otherwise, engagements on DRM were more recent. The
World Bank had a key role in developing the ongoing Pacific Catastrophe Risk
Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI), which supported a large amount of
technical preparatory work and initiated a catastrophe insurance pilot in Samoa,
Tonga, Vanuatu, the Marshall Islands and the Cook Islands. Furthermore, the World
Bank established the Pacific Resilience Program, a new multi-country platform for
engaging on disaster resilience, with investment lending operations in Samoa and
Tonga, disaster risk financing components for Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands,
and regional components through the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat and
Secretariat for the Pacific Community. The World Bank hopes to extend this
platform to other countries in the future. Because much of the portfolio is still active,
it has not been evaluated. Appendix G provides detailed evaluative evidence on the
World Bank contributions to DRM and climate change adaptation. A more in-depth
review of the programs in Tonga and Samoa is in appendixes B and D.

The World Bank’s support for the PCRAFI was its most innovative contribution to
DRM. A series of investments to support development of databases for hazard and


                                                                                       33
CHAPTER 3
ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
vulnerability information assisted in the development of country risk profiles,
informed investment design decisions by donors, and allowed for the creation of
insurance products. However, as of September 2015 the future of the PCRAFI is
unclear. Donors have paid for premiums so far, and it is not clear that countries
would value the coverage enough to pay their own premiums. Furthermore, the
small market size may not be sufficient to make the PCRAFI sustainable as a
standalone facility. Recent events occurring after this evaluation’s timeframe have
not been assessed. 9

The recently approved Pacific Resilience Program establishes a regional platform for
the World Bank’s DRM engagement in the Pacific. The program focuses primarily
on early warning systems and preparedness, along with risk reduction activities and
the payment of PCRAFI premiums. The program has operations in four countries
and regional activities implemented through regional institutions, with financing
from the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience and Special Climate Change Fund.
The Pacific Resilience Program intends to help consolidate resilience initiatives
across the Pacific, but increased attention to DRM by other donors while positive has
made this a more difficult task.

The World Bank’s climate change interventions throughout the Pacific have largely
focused on current rather than future climate risks. This is an understandable focus
since countries face substantial deficits in adapting to current climate risks. Yet small
island countries, especially low-lying atolls, face strategic questions from future
climate change more than almost anywhere else in the world, and they need to
consider anticipatory adaptation to long-term threats. For example, the World Bank
could be encouraging internal debate about long-term migration options and the
wisdom of development in places that may become untenable.10 World Bank
country program strategies can have a disconnect between the acknowledgment of
threat and the scale and type of interventions supported. The World Bank’s strategy
in Tuvalu notes the existential threat from climate change, but provides support for
only water tanks and rainwater harvesting. The Kiribati strategy states that the core
of the strategy will help with climate change adaptation, but the recent major
interventions focus on fixing the road and improving water supply efficiency. The
World Bank could also do better in addressing donor fragmentation in the climate
change space and the stresses it places on country capacity by helping governments
navigate the multitude of climate finance sources, while acting at a regional and
global level to encourage consolidation of funds and greater donor coordination and
harmonization for activities related to climate change. The World Bank is often seen
as acting apart from regional institutions except when it needs them for
implementation.11 These institutions have important political functions that the
World Bank could use to assist in the design of major operations.

                                   ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
The evaluation rates the World Bank’s overall efforts to support environmental
resilience as moderately satisfactory. Selecting DRM and climate change adaptation
as core areas of engagement makes sense given the potential for disasters to derail
other development efforts and the serious threats posed by climate change.
Engaging with finance ministries instead of weaker line ministries helped raise the
profile of DRM and began to affect broader government planning. Supporting a
large portfolio in the region enabled the World Bank to build a critical mass of
sectoral experts in the country office. Developing a multi-country platform through
the Pacific Resilience Program may help to build economies of scale in project
preparation and supervision, and facilitate cross-country learning and support. It is
difficult to assess the overall impact of the program, much of which is still active and
has not been evaluated. Furthermore, monitoring and evaluation systems have often
been weak, focusing on production of outputs instead of assessing impact on
disaster vulnerability. Experts and stakeholders hold a generally positive view of the
World Bank’s interventions in DRM. Government officials say that financing was
crucial and technical expertise was of high quality.

STRENGTHENING SOCIAL RESILIENCE
This section examines five dimensions of social resilience in the PICs: labor mobility,
health, education, gender equality, and social protection. Social resilience features
modestly in the country strategy documents for the PICs. The Tonga Country
Assistance Strategy has two outcomes related to education, and the Samoa, Kiribati,
and Tuvalu Country Partnership Strategies have an outcome on increased
temporary migration. There are no outcomes on health, gender equality, or social
protection in the results frameworks. The World Bank had some coverage in all
these areas. Labor mobility was a major thrust of the World Bank’s work and policy
dialogue with governments. Though significant in the period’s earlier years, the
health program was scaled back later, partly because of less demand from
governments. The World Bank saw itself as a niche player in education for much of
the period. Support for gender equality is through mainstreaming it in the World
Bank’s investment operations, and there was analytic work on social protection.
Appendix G provides analysis of World Bank support under these five topics. A
more in-depth review of the programs in Tonga and Samoa in appendixes B and D
assesses the relevance and impact of these interventions.

The World Bank’s most important contribution to social resilience was its
involvement in the migration issue since 2008. The Bank provided Australia and
New Zealand with knowledge about temporary migration programs worldwide.
This was instrumental in giving the authorities confidence to proceed with the
Recognized Seasonal Employee program. The World Bank provided advice on

preparing workers for migration—including development of an orientation course
for workers—and supported monitoring and evaluation of the program. Overall, the
benefits were substantial, and a significant share of remittances went for children’s
education. Still, the migrants work in activities that do little to build their capacity
for skilled employment or to set up enterprises when they return. In recognition of
this, both Australia and New Zealand have set up add-on skills training that allows
workers to receive formal qualifications.

World Bank engagement in the health sector focused mainly on efficient delivery of
services, with some attention to budgeting and financing in the sector. The World
Bank’s role was to identify gaps, particularly in health financing and public financial
management, and provide analytic work on those issues. Management of the sector
improved, but progress is slow and erratic. World Bank support for strengthening
tertiary care in Tonga continued to improve service delivery. In Samoa, the World
Bank helped split planning, management, and operational functions of the sector to
enhance service delivery. The World Bank used DPOs to support improvement to
the Tuvalu Medical Treatment Scheme, a tertiary level care program, and the
savings contributed to an increase in budget allocations to primary and secondary
health care. The main area of continuing concern on health issues for the PICs is
noncommunicable diseases. World Bank analytic work in this area contributed to
helping government understand the impact of noncommunicable diseases. The
World Bank is working with the World Health Organization, Australia, and New
Zealand to support a way forward on the issue.

World Bank support in the education sector focused mainly on primary education.
The World Bank helped introduce grant mechanisms early in the period that
allowed for funding decisions at the level of each school. Through the Education for
All Fast Track Initiative and in conjunction with the Australian Agency for
International Development (AusAID) and New Zealand, the World Bank also
supported reading ability assessments in the early grades of primary education. IEG
found the $5 million Tonga Education Support Project was highly relevant, but
unrealistically broad in its objectives. It rated the achievement of outcomes
unsatisfactory. Presently the World Bank, with support from Australia, is providing
assistance through the Pacific Early Age Readiness and Learning project (PEARL)
funded by the Global Partnership for Education and the Australia Aid Program, a
program that is being implemented in Tonga and Samoa. The project works at the
policy and intervention fronts to improve efficiency by improving the
students’ readiness and preparedness early in life, when impact is greater.

Donors said the World Bank could and should have done more to support education
policy reform in the PICs. They expressed some concern about the state of education

                                                                             CHAPTER 3
                                  ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
in the region. Improving the quality of education access to the rural/outer islands
remain a challenge for most PICs. Education follows a post-colonial model and is
oriented toward public sector jobs and urban areas. More needs to be done to
engage in dialogue with PIC governments about the future of education. In the
donors’ view, the World Bank needs to provide strategic leadership in this area. The
Bank could build on the analytic work done (notably on teaching, learning, school
readiness including in remote areas) through the Rural Education and Development
project and PEARL interventions to look at the long-term prospects of education and
provide guidance in this area. It would be worth exploring Bank-IFC engagement to
provide the skills needed12 for the development of tourism, agriculture, fisheries as
well as providing better preparation for temporary and permanent migrants.

The World Bank did not provide any direct lending for social protection in the PICs,
but it supported technical assistance in Fiji, undertook some important analytic
work and provided support for good policies through its DPOs. The Fiji Social
Protection Technical Assistance improved the targeting and efficiency of the
country’s social protection programs. The 2010 DPO in Samoa supported a
government decision to cushion vulnerable households from the impacts of the food
and fuel crisis, the global economic crisis, and the 2009 tsunami. This was done
through accelerating progress on plans to improve access to education by
implementing a waiver of primary school fees at all public, special, and missionary
schools (World Bank 2010). In Tonga, a World Bank study provided the impetus for
adopting a lifeline tariff for electricity to support low-income households (Adelman
et al. 2015).

World Bank engagement on gender in the PICs is perceived as limited. Although
gender gaps in women’s access to health and education were closed in the region,
women do not have land ownership rights in a number of countries, which limits
their economic opportunities. Women are also underrepresented in parliaments and
civil services, and domestic violence is still the most pervasive and serious gender
issue in the region. Although the World Bank produced sound analytic work (a
Tonga Gender Investment Climate Reform Assessment in 2010, among others), the
work was not always translated into operational work. One notable exception is a
recent $400,000 grant for improving services for victims of domestic violence in
Kiribati. In its infrastructure projects, the World Bank tried to ensure that gender
issues are considered in the design. In Tonga, for example, the electricity authority,
under a Bank-supported project, is employing women as linemen in the outer
islands. The head of maintenance is a woman in two of the three outer islands. IFC
investments on the business environment for women are seen as a particularly
valuable contribution of the World Bank Group.

CHAPTER 3
ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
There is a disconnect between the World Bank’s efforts to support gender equity and
the perception of donors. The evidence of World Bank supported projects in the PICs,
reviewed or visited by the Evaluation team, is that gender has been effectively
mainstreamed in the program. The problem is that while the default mode for the
Bank is ensuring that its projects and programs factor gender into their design, this
rarely helps to address issues such as domestic violence. The evaluation team’s
hypothesis is that the Australian authorities’ frustration comes from the World
Bank’s failure to propose concrete programs and approaches to address the
remaining gender gaps in the PICs. Going forward, in line with the Bank’s new
strategic approach to gender mainstreaming, the Bank needs to define results in this
area and gear programs to their achievement.

The social agenda was not a major focus of the World Bank’s work in the PICs. The
World Bank intervened selectively using a mix of DPOs, trust funds, and analytic
work in areas where countries specifically requested help, or where funds were
available through Bank-executed global programs (such as Education For All). Some
staff and donors view this as a reflection of selectivity and characterize the World
Bank as a niche player in health, education, and social protection. Others argue that
the World Bank could and should have done more, and that the small World Bank
program reflects the lack of grant funding (because PIC governments are reluctant to
borrow for the social sectors) and a relatively weak World Bank strategy and
program in this area, which did not garner government or donor support. Based on
its discussions and the evidence, the evaluation team takes the former view. Lack of
strategic focus in a sector does not prevent the World Bank from engaging
periodically when there are resources available from a global program, or when
asked to do so by governments or donors.

The evaluation rates the World Bank’s contribution to social resilience as
satisfactory. The World Bank’s significant contribution to labor migration and its
attendant benefits merits a highly satisfactory rating. Its support for gender is fully
consistent with the World Bank’s gender strategy during the period and is a
relatively good practice example. Donor criticism reflects the need for updating the
Bank-wide approach, which publication of a new gender strategy in December 2015
accomplished. The basic approach of selective interventions in health and education
was appropriate, but the quality of these interventions, such as in the Tonga
education project, was not adequate. Selectivity at the strategic level does not release
the World Bank from the obligation of meeting the narrower objectives of its specific
interventions. The need for the World Bank to raise its game in health and education
is particularly important, since it is likely to increase its involvement in these areas
in the future. This reflects the increased emphasis the World Bank is placing on

noncommunicable diseases, and the need for a strategic approach to education
policy in the PICs.


Assessing World Bank Group Assistance in Enhancing Competitiveness and
Private Sector Development in the PICs
World Bank Group support addressed several aspects of the private sector agenda
the PICs are pursuing. The World Bank Group’s most important contributions to
private sector development resulted from its involvement with infrastructure
(transport, energy, and ICT). Selective support also sought to enhance the enabling
environment (notably through DPOs). The World Bank Group was opportunistic in
the financial sector and focused on piloting different approaches, notably to provide
underserved people with access to basic financial services through the Pacific
Microfinance Initiative. These approaches include targeted support to women’s
groups in Tonga and Samoa, supporting BSP to foster mobile banking for easier
access to transfers (notably in rural areas), and to launch a small and medium
enterprise (SME) risk share facility. The World Bank Group also designed programs
in some PICs to help develop their most promising areas for private sector
development, which are fisheries, tourism, and agribusiness. Appendix G provides
detailed evaluative evidence on the World Bank Group contributions under each of
these objectives in the PICs. Appendixes B and D present detailed reviews of World
Bank Group programs in Tonga and Samoa.

PROMOTING A BUSINESS-FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT
The private sector’s importance in the PICs was a controversial topic, both in the
islands and in the donor community. The PICs had little tradition of private sector
activity, and in some cases, private enterprises were seized at independence (such as
New Zealand–owned commercial agriculture in Samoa). The domestic market’s
small size and the distance from international markets limit opportunities for
profitable private investment. The uncertain business environment tended to attract
foreign businesspeople who wanted to exploit market distortions and had little
interest in bringing investment into the countries. The study on ‘Pacific Futures’
asserted that there should be a level playing field, but saw little likelihood of private
investment except in tourism.

A consensus seems to be emerging that “bending the growth curve upward” will
require SMEs to become more prominent in the PICs. A number of countries have
evolved to the point where there is sufficient entrepreneurial capacity to take on an
expanded role, and remittances can provide the seed capital needed. However, the
private sector faces a difficult environment, and the constraints must be addressed.


                                                                                       39
CHAPTER 3
ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
A number of regional institutions, led by ADB, are working in this area. The recent
Systematic Country Diagnostic gives considerable prominence to private sector
development and discusses in some detail the PICs’ performance on the Doing
Business Indicators and the nature of the constraints.

IFC and ADB worked with governments to improve the enabling environment and
lower the cost of doing business while the World Bank focused on the regulatory
environment. ADB and IFC succeeded in Tonga to the extent that the country is now
highly rated on the ease of doing business. The World Bank supported independent
regulators in energy, telecommunications, and water. Land ownership issues are
critical for business development and a particularly difficult problem in PICs, where
local chiefs control land not owned by the state. Disputes about land delayed one
IFC project by one-and-a-half years. Leasehold arrangements are in place in some
cases, but they tend to be short and therefore do not encourage improvements or
investment.13 The World Bank conducted some analytic work in Vanuatu and the
Solomon Islands aimed at finding practical ways to use leasehold arrangements to
provide the surety needed for investment.

STRENGTHENING THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Access to finance is still limited in the PICs. In 2013, only 28 percent of the
population in Tonga had access to financial services, 19 percent in Samoa, and 39
percent in Fiji. Microenterprises and SMEs in the PICs identify access to finance and
access to markets as key constraints. Financial institutions identify lack of collateral
and information asymmetry as key limitations they face in expanding lending to
SMEs. Getting credit is still difficult, publicly available credit information is limited,
and insolvency resolution can be costly and time-consuming. Challenges of
customary land ownership (which accounts for about 80 percent of all land in
Samoa, for example) and an inability to transfer ownership also impede access to
finance.

The Pacific Microfinance Initiative developed by IFC and AusAID aimed at
promoting innovative ventures and broadening access to basic financial services for
underserved people in the Pacific region. The Pacific Microfinance Initiative used
performance-based grants through financial institutions to entrepreneurs, but the
initial experience provided mixed results with little take-up and difficulty building a
pipeline of viable projects. One successful initiative, the South Pacific Business
Development Foundation, was a program to support women’s groups in Samoa and
Tonga. The Pacific Microfinance Initiative also supported a mobile banking initiative
that helped reduce the cost of transferring money, as part of a broader effort by the
World Bank Group to reduce the costs associated with remittances.

                                    ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
IFC was instrumental in supporting banking development and building banks’
capacity to lend. The support contributed to a major expansion of BSP that enabled it
to compete effectively with the ANZ Bank in the region, focus on small business,
reach unbanked people, and increase the rates of banking among women. The
World Bank Group launched an SME risk share facility with BSP in Papua New
Guinea in 2011. IDA supported the program as a guarantor and provided technical
assistance to help SMEs prepare business and marketing plans. Another World Bank
intervention supporting commercial bank funding comes from a Global
Environment Facility–funded program in Fiji supporting renewable energy. The
program, which provides guarantees to help banks overcome some of the risks of
lending to small enterprises, resulted in an increase in lending and numerous
village-based projects that will help achieve the goal of 100 percent electricity access
by 2020. Similar approaches in other islands were less successful.

The financial sector has not been part of the World Bank’s core strategy in the PICs.
World Bank efforts were selective and opportunistic. Efforts thus far focused on
piloting different approaches. Both the BSP risk sharing facility in Papua New
Guinea and the Fiji renewable energy program show that the World Bank can
intervene effectively in the sector by providing guarantees to help commercial banks
overcome some of the perceived risks of lending to small enterprises. These
programs could provide models for a strategic approach to financial development
going forward. The World Bank is committed to promoting greater access to
banking, so the focus on the financial sector in the PICs is likely to increase. A
stronger focus, coupled with the need for increased support to SMEs, will require a
more strategic approach going forward.

IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES
The infrastructure investment required in the PICs is enormous. Infrastructure
development in the Pacific Islands increased significantly in recent years, but
accessing sufficient and appropriate financing is still challenging, and maintenance
financing is also an issue. A recent PRIF study estimated that an average of 6 percent
of gross domestic product ($1,266 million per year) is required to maintain existing
infrastructure (PRIF 2013). Most PICs do not sufficiently plan for the maintenance of
completed infrastructure projects, resulting in fast deterioration and the need for
rehabilitation—the PRIF calls this the build-neglect-rebuild paradigm. Provision of
infrastructure services is also difficult because of the PICs’ vulnerability to natural
disasters and the high costs of linking small and dispersed communities to major
population centers, especially when the costs of doing so are often not recoverable
from these communities.




                                                                                     41
CHAPTER 3
ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
The infrastructure sectors in the PICs have a major donor presence coordinated by
PRIF since 2008. The multi-donor partnership is a financing mechanism that blends
PRIF grants, multilateral loans, and private sector equity and loans. It also offers
advisory services and technical assistance (paragraph 3.16).

The World Bank Group infrastructure focus in the PICs concentrated on areas where
it could add value (transport, energy, and ICT) and opted to exclude water and
urban development. The PICs’ infrastructure needs require large amounts of
financing, and the World Bank and ADB have been major players. The World Bank
is also valued for its technical expertise and its ability to promote reforms in
infrastructure policies, which are challenging and difficult for bilateral donors to
influence. In this regard, the World Bank promoted policies that ministries often
viewed as counter to their short-term interests, such as downsizing and focusing
attention on policy and regulation instead of on carrying out investments directly. In
general, the World Bank has tried to get governments to focus more on results and
on the broad impact for the investments it supports on issues such as road safety,
gender equality, and market access.

Support for public-private partnerships (PPPs) was an important aspect of World
Bank Group support. IFC focused its infrastructure support on PPPs, and the World
Bank supported PPPs through a condition in its Samoa DPO that required approval
of a PPP policy framework. IFC worked with the Samoan government to identify
potential PPP transactions. Efforts are still at an early stage, and except for the
telecommunications sector, results have been limited so far.

Aviation Transport

The aviation sector, which is essential to tourism and migrant labor, became an
important part of the World Bank program in the PICs. The World Bank provided
technical assistance for sector strategies and master planning and conducted a needs
assessment and designed an aviation program to help countries finance
infrastructure related to runway rehabilitation, terminals, and firefighting
equipment. Countries had to comply with some of the measures enacted by the
regional aviation regulatory agency (the Pacific Aviation Safety Organization). The
World Bank program also supports risk mitigation with the development of an
Insurance Asset Reserve Fund and a design for remedial actions after a natural
disaster. The program started in Tonga (where the World Bank was engaged since
2000 to help corporatize the airports,) and gradually spread to Kiribati, Samoa,
Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, which allowed the World Bank to access the regional IDA
allocation.

                                   ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
A particularly important part of the World Bank’s aviation support is the use of a
single Technical Fiduciary Services Unit (TFSU) for all five countries. The TFSU,
based in Tonga, is an implementing advisory unit. By combining procurement
packages for different countries in some cases, the project implementation unit could
contract on more favorable terms than it would have if countries operated
individually. Despite this success, the program shows the difficulties of adopting a
multi-country approach. Although it is working well for Tuvalu, authorities in
Kiribati would prefer the World Bank to work entirely through their own agencies.
Some officials in Samoa also expressed concern about what they saw as an
additional layer of bureaucracy in implementing the project.

Road Transport

The PRIF characterized the traditional approach to roads in the PICs as build-
neglect-rebuild, a situation the World Bank tried to address through a new approach
to road maintenance in the region. The approach is a key part of World Bank
transport support in Samoa and Tonga, and it relies on outsourcing. The public
works department in Samoa downsized, and outsourcing is now the default
mechanism for road maintenance. The same approach is now being attempted in
Tonga, but there is ongoing tension over the approach with the Ministry of Public
Works. In Kiribati, the World Bank is supporting a project to set up microenterprises
to handle road maintenance, but progress has been slow because of the
entrepreneurs’ limited business and management skills.

Two major roads projects encountered difficulties: the Samoa West Coast Road
Project and Kiribati Road Rehabilitation Project. Available funding under the West
Coast Road Project in Samoa was insufficient for full rehabilitation of the main West
Coast Road, so the project needs a Government decision about priority sections to
rehabilitate. The Kiribati project aims to rehabilitate the country’s main lifeline at a
cost of $50.6 million, of which the World Bank approved just $35 million. The
difference is due to cost inflation for materials, failure to account for the project’s
remoteness, and plans for a higher standard of road than was originally planned.14
Progress on the project, rated unsatisfactory for much of the implementation period,
recently improved, but maintenance of the road is still a concern.

Information and Communication Technology

Basic phone service access and affordability improved substantially in the past
decade, particularly through creation and growth of mobile service. However,
broadband Internet access is lagging and prices remain high. Most PICs liberalized
their telecommunications markets, and made policy and regulatory reforms, which
cleared the way for private companies to enter the market with lower-cost mobile


                                                                                      43
CHAPTER 3

services. Consequently, the number of mobile cellular subscriptions per 100
increased from 20.2 in 2006 to 74.4 in 2014. Broadband Internet access grew more
slowly. Depending on the country circumstances, the slower growth can be due to
high international bandwidth costs and low bandwidth capacity in countries that
depend on satellite services, high international bandwidth costs associated with
regulatory issues, high user device costs, or insufficient awareness (particularly
among remote populations).

Telecommunications may be the area in which synergies between the World Bank
and IFC made the largest contribution to development. The World Bank focused on
the enabling environment, providing advice on liberalizing markets and support for
new legislation. It also provided support for cable infrastructure after the markets
were liberalized. IFC invested $170 million to promote new entrants to the Pacific
telecommunications market and more than $500 million in the sector in Fiji, Papua
New Guinea, Samoa, and Vanuatu. The World Bank is now working with Kiribati,
one of the least connected countries in the world, to liberalize its market and
introduce competition (through its first DPO). It is also supporting a
telecommunication and ICT project that aims to strengthen the legal, regulatory, and
institutional environment.

Energy

The World Bank is addressing major issues in the energy sector in the PICs—access,
affordability and reliability—by helping to develop strategies and engineering
master plans, making investments, and through institutional development and
capacity building. The World Bank supported preparation of a comprehensive
energy road map in Tonga that establishes targets, defines the necessary regulatory
frameworks, identifies the role and prospects of renewable energy, and reviews the
petroleum supply chain. The road map was important to establishing the potential
of renewables and the cost advantages of solar and wind power. Tonga set a target
to have 50 percent of its energy come from renewable sources by 2020. Vanuatu
requested a similar road map, which was prepared in 2011–12 and built on earlier
World Bank work on energy regulation. The Vanuatu Rural Electrification Project is
looking into connecting systems for micro and mini-grids to increase access. The
World Bank had limited engagement on energy in Samoa, where ADB helped the
government create a road map. In Fiji, the World Bank has an active project for
sustainable energy that has been highly successful. The loans resulted in numerous
village-based projects in solar power production. The World Bank’s engagements in
the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau related mainly to
petroleum supply. The Federated States of Micronesia has a $14 million project in
the energy sector to do a comprehensive master plan with a focus to more efficiently

manage the sector, bring down costs and move to renewables. The Bank has had no
engagement in the Marshall Islands, apart from a scoping mission to look at an
energy DPO a few years back.

The evaluation rates the World Bank Group’s infrastructure support in the PICs as
satisfactory. Even without support for urban and water (which was specifically
excluded from its support), the World Bank has a substantial footprint in
infrastructure in the PICs—transport and ICT together account for more than half of
the World Bank’s total commitments in the PICs in FY06–15. The World Bank made
a significant financial contribution and a major contribution to connectivity. It
helped expand capacity, build resilience into an increasing proportion of the
infrastructure of the PICs, and contributed to moving the relevant institutions in the
PICs from a colonial force account mentality to a more modern approach based on
contracting and outsourcing to the private sector.

SUPPORTING SECTOR LINKS AND VALUE CHAINS FOR PRIVATE BUSINESS: SUPPORT FOR FISHERIES, TOURISM,
AND AGRICULTURE

Fisheries, tourism, and agribusiness are the most promising areas for private sector
development in the PICs. The situation differs from one country to another. The atoll
islands are dependent on fisheries and have limited potential in other areas. By
contrast, Fiji already has substantial tourism and agribusiness, with potential for
further expansion. Both fisheries and tourism have large regional dimensions and
should be approached through coordinated efforts. Agricultural development15 is
particularly challenging because of how it interacts with traditional land tenure
arrangements (especially in Fiji) and the lack of well-developed value chains linking
domestic farm production to local or export markets.

The World Bank Group’s work on fisheries consisted of analytic work and regional
fisheries management, and IFC support for the development of the fish-processing
sector. The World Bank used IDA and Global Environment Facility funding to
produce an analysis of the PICs fisheries economies (2009) and an engagement
strategy (2012). It provided nearly $40 million in late 2014 for the Pacific Islands
Regional Oceanscape Program, which will enhance management of fisheries
resources. The 2013 Kiribati DPO included approval and implementation of a
national fisheries policy.

All of the significant World Bank Group activity in tourism was by IFC, which
provided support for PPPs and for promoting regional tourism. An IFC-facilitated
PPP for the Otintaai Hotel on Tarawa, Kiribati mobilized $2.25 million for
rehabilitation. IFC also supported training and promoted dialogue on priorities for
tourism development. In FY09, it undertook a diagnostic of the impediments to

tourism development in five countries. IFC launched the Pacific Regional Tourism
Initiative in 2012, focusing on Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu. The project aimed to
mobilize $15 million in new infrastructure investments and $30 million to support
up to 4,000 new tourist arrivals over three years in the target countries, but has yet to
meet its ambitious goals.

Agricultural development is a growing interest in the PICs, and the World Bank
supported projects in Samoa. The Bank has financed the Agriculture and Fisheries
Cyclone Recovery Project in Samoa, from 2013 to 2016, which has sought to restore
the production capacity of farmers and fishers affected by Cyclone Evan, and to
mainstream disaster resilience/risk management into the Ministry of Agriculture
work. The World Bank is now supporting the Samoa Agricultural Competitiveness
Enhancement Project (SACEP), designed to improve productivity, quality, and take
greater advantage of market opportunities. The focus is on supporting increased
livestock and fruit and vegetable production by semi commercial farmers. The key is
to develop links with companies that currently import raw and processed foods to
increase the use of domestic suppliers. If this is accomplished, the project will
provide an important model for future development.

World Bank Group support for these three key commercial sectors (fisheries,
tourism, and agribusiness) presents a mixed picture. The World Bank and IFC
collaborated well in the fisheries and tourism sectors, but somewhat less so in the
agriculture sector to date, though it is too soon to assess the outcomes. Perhaps this
reflects weaknesses in the projects’ designs and in efforts to promote agricultural
value chains. This area clearly needs a more coordinated effort. The evidence from
the evaluation team’s visit to project sites in Samoa suggests that the project will be
particularly difficult to implement. The marketing arrangements are weak, and
farmers lack a commercial orientation.

Overall, the evaluation concluded that the World Bank Group has not yet adopted a
strategic approach to its support for private sector development. The World Bank
and IFC have been opportunistic in these areas so far—progress has more often been
a byproduct of supporting other objectives than a direct effort to promote private
sector development. Going forward World Bank programs supporting education,
health, and infrastructure should be viewed in the context of the need for
developing small enterprises and attracting foreign direct investment. Although
World Bank and IFC programs are broadly in sync, they are far from achieving the
levels of systematic coordination needed to achieve synergies in enhancing the
investment climate, getting more benefit from remittances in promoting financial
sector development and enhancing investment in micro, small, and medium

 Damage from a tsunami in 2009 cost roughly 22 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)
in Samoa, and in Tonga roughly 2 percent of GDP. Damage and loss from Cyclone Evan in
2012 cost an additional 28 percent of GDP in Samoa and 2.6 percent in Fiji. Cyclone Ian’s
damages in 2014 cost about 11 percent of GDP in Tonga, and Cyclone Pam in 2015 caused
damage and loss of at least 64 percent of GDP for Vanuatu. World Bank country risk profiles
produced in 2011 calculate annual average estimated losses from natural disasters as a
percentage of GDP, ranging from 0.8 percent for Tuvalu to 6.6 percent for Vanuatu.

 The World Bank engaged in disaster risk management in Samoa in 2004, 2007, 2011, 2013,
2014, and 2015, and in Tonga in 2002, 2011, 2014, and 2015.
9According to Bank staff, following the COP 21 in Paris in 2015, donors have committed
more than US$35m to establish a multi-donor trust fund that will support premium
payments for the PCRAFI. This significantly increases the medium term sustainability of the
program.
 Staff indicated that this is a dialogue that will be accelerated through the Pacific Possible
10

ASA and continued through the Pacific Labor Mobility Programmatic AAA.
11For example, the Bank has little engagement with SPREP, the main regional
environmental agency, and has engaged with SPC largely on a limited basis where it
possesses specific technical skills. The Bank is not heavily engaged with regional climate
change discussions among donors, which are centered in Suva.
12Education in the Pacific does not only become relevant when it’s linked to skills and the
labor force. A significant portion of the skill deficit comes from poor cognitive and non-
cognitive skills that were not developed in the early years, from poor quality of education
and inefficient system management – that translates into poor learning outcomes, repetition,
drop outs--, and from weak coordination and connections between the education system
and the labor market.
13Even in the case where land leases can be issued for long period of time (75 years in
Vanuatu, or even longer in Papau New Guinea), there are significant problems with the way
those leasing deals are transacted and inequities associated with them have been a major
source of grievance for landholding groups. Poor lease administration processes often
privilege a small number of 'men' acting as custom owners/middle men and fail to deliver
long term benefits for the larger landholding group which has legitimate interest in the land.
Customary landholding groups are often disadvantaged in the deal making process as they
are poorly informed about the land leasing process, entitlements, etc., and are unable to
negotiate optimal outcomes. Investors are also poorly informed about the land leasing
processes and often rely on middle men in their engagement with landholder groups,
further reinforcing inequitable outcomes and fueling local disputation. There is often a lack
of checks and balances on how leases are regulated, how compensations are determined,
and poor enforcement of lease provisions.
The small size of the Pacific Islands and populations also complicates the nature of those
deals as individuals often wear multiple hats with Ministers and Government officials often
having a conflict of interest over a piece of land subject to investment acting simultaneously
as land owners, government facilitators, and middle men.
The other complicating aspect of land issues in the Pacific is that land disputes are never
brought to finality – even if there has been a court case decision, there is not always an
acceptance at the local level and disputes re-emerge over time and manifest in multiple
forms: (i) within the land owning group over land rights; (ii) within neighboring
landholders over land interests or benefits from the development; (iii) between landholders
and government - over compensation or the exercise of regulatory authority; or (iv) between
landholders and outside investors - over the terms of lease agreements and unfulfilled
promises.

has no in-country road industry or programs that would have help to provide a more
accurate costing.
15 Lack of financing and access to markets are important difficulties to agriculture
expansion. Beyond these constraints, the problem of agricultural development in the region
is structural in nature, linked mainly to high concentration of the population in rural areas;
to the lack of appropriate technologies and extension support; to low literacy rates; to
cultural norms; and to the perception of agriculture more as a default livelihood rather than
a farm enterprise with growth and profitability objectives.

4. Learning and Recommendations
Conclusions
The core of the World Bank’s strategic engagement with the PICs during the period
was to support the institutional changes needed for shared and more rapid growth.
World Bank documents do not articulate this clearly, but this is what evolved in
practice. The focus was less on achieving a specific quantitative target in a four-year
period and more on helping to build the institutions needed for sustainable long-
term growth. Therefore, the objective in transport and health was to reduce
overstretched ministries’ burden of managing road maintenance and health services;
in agriculture, to promote the shift from subsistence to commercial farming; in
energy and telecommunications, to reduce government monopolies and create space
for public-private partnerships; and to build a margin for resilience to natural
disasters into new infrastructure investment. It will be important for the World
Bank’s new Country Program Framework to articulate the centrality of these
institutional objectives.

The evaluation did not use the standard approach to rating the program in the PICs.
IEG generally rates country programs against the results frameworks of the
strategies covering the period. This is not a mechanical process, especially since the
coverage of strategy documents is generally much shorter than the evaluation
period. Therefore, IEG accounted for the evolution of the World Bank’s strategic
approach and gave weight to the outcomes reflecting longer-term strategic trends.
Unlike the OECS countries (IEG 2016), for example, no regional strategy covers the
whole period for the PICs, and there was a major discontinuity in the partnerships
with Australia and New Zealand midway through the period. The evaluation,
therefore, attempted to triangulate among three sources of information:

        first, desk studies of the region and the pattern of outcomes in areas
         reflecting World Bank support
        second, interviews with the donor community, particularly officials of the
         Australian and New Zealand governments, who are familiar with the World
         Bank’s programs and have made their own assessments of the outcomes
        third, an in-depth assessment of outcomes relative to the Country Assistance
         Strategy (FY11–14) in Tonga and Country Partnership Strategy (FY12–16) in
         Samoa and their related results frameworks, including interviews with
         government and civil society, and visits to project sites to talk with
         beneficiaries (appendixes B and D).

                                                          LEARNING AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The evaluation rates the relevance of the World Bank’s program in the PICs as
satisfactory. In the context of the PICs, relevance is not just about whether the World
Bank did the right things in the sense of supporting activities that were of high
priority for growth, shared prosperity, and poverty reduction. The World Bank
would have had a hard time missing the key development targets, given the limited
range of options in the PICs and the relatively large scale of its program. In this
context, the more important question is whether the World Bank’s program reflected
its comparative advantages in raising difficult policy issues, undertaking key
analytic studies, supporting regional approaches, and promoting effective donor
coordination. The evaluation concurs with the evaluations carried out for the
governments of Australia and New Zealand, and the statements by both
government and donor interlocutors of the high degree of relevance of the World
Bank program based on the criterion of comparative advantage.

The selectivity of the World Bank program enhanced its strategic focus and
contributed to its relevance and effectiveness. The decision to limit World Bank
social sector involvement to areas in which governments requested it or where
global trust funds were available and to leave support for the water sector and
urban development to other donors enabled increased depth of World Bank
involvement in other key sectors. The difficulty that World Bank management faces
in being selective is evident—in each of the areas in which the World Bank was less
active, donors with programs in those areas complained to the evaluation team
about the World Bank’s failure to engage.

The evaluation rates the effectiveness of the World Bank’s contribution to
development of the PICs as satisfactory. This rating reflects a number of approaches.
The starting point was a review of the outcomes included in the results frameworks
for Tonga (FY10–14) and Samoa (covering part of the FY12–16 Country Partnership
Strategy). The analyses suggested a rating of satisfactory for the Tonga program,
and a moderately satisfactory rating for the Samoa program for the period covered
by the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). However, for the full evaluation period,
the rating for Samoa was raised to satisfactory, reflecting important outcomes
through World Bank interventions in health, transport, postal services, and
telecommunications in the years before FY12. Desk studies of evaluation materials
produced or commissioned by the World Bank and by the Australian and New
Zealand governments also contributed to a rating of satisfactory. Perhaps most
important, the in-depth interviews with donors and with government officials
during the evaluation mission indicated a set of transformational institutional
outcomes that were not fully reflected in the various strategy documents. The
interviews suggested a high degree of attribution of these outcomes to the World
Bank program. These outcomes include:


                                                                                    51
CHAPTER 4
LEARNING AND RECOMMENDATIONS
        The temporary migration programs of New Zealand and Australia reduced
         poverty and indirectly helped provide resources needed to fund public
         services and support recovery from natural disasters.
        Introducing competition into the provision of mobile telecommunications
         and supporting underwater cables to promote better quality and faster
         access was a major contribution to connectivity.
        Awareness was increased among governments and donors of the need to
         build environmental resilience into investments in infrastructure.
        Persuading some governments to outsource road maintenance contracts to
         the private sector instead of carrying them out through force account helped
         promote more efficient use of public resources, better road management
         quality, and perhaps most important, development of the private sector.

Missteps occurred at the project level. The analysis of the Tonga and Samoa
operations suggested two areas that contributed to problems. The first is occasional
shortcomings in implementation arrangements in places where capacity is
inadequate to support the relatively ambitious World Bank program (whether
through the need for more presence in the field, better quality control of consultants,
or better coordination with successor task team leaders). The second is the World
Bank’s uncertainty about how to address the land issue in the PICs and the tendency
to deal with this as a new problem every time it comes up instead of trying to
anticipate the issue and discuss systemic approaches with other donors and
governments.

It is important to reiterate the role the Pacific Facility and the Pacific Partnership had
in supporting the level and quality of World Bank Group support for the PICs. The
combination of generous budget allocations and increased IDA availability created
the necessary conditions for an effective World Bank presence in the region. They
are not sufficient conditions, though, and the quality and commitment of World
Bank management and staff during the review were obviously crucial to the
achievements. This is an important lesson for the World Bank to take to heart when
comparing programs in the small states of the Pacific with some of the other small
states reviewed in this cluster evaluation. Although there are downsides to the
World Bank accepting such partnerships—they can skew allocations and lead to the
World Bank modifying its policy positions in deference to the donor—the evaluation
found no evidence of any such consequences of these partnerships.

                                                              LEARNING AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Lessons
The World Bank Group has potential to add value to the PICs in a number of ways.
Although the following list may apply to most World Bank clients, the framing of
these issues and their emphasis differs by country category, and the differences can
be significant for small states. The World Bank can:

       Raise difficult policy issues that other donors may feel constrained to
        address.
       Bring a comprehensive package of global knowledge and technical skills to
        the table.
       Provide additional financing for high-priority development programs.
       Strengthen the regional dimension.
       Provide leadership for donor efforts to achieve coordination that is more
        effective.
       Support private sector development through the synergies of the World
        Bank working on country policies and IFC’s ability to work directly with
        private entrepreneurs (a special potential).

RAISING DIFFICULT POLICY ISSUES WITH GOVERNMENTS

The sense among interlocutors is that the World Bank met their expectations
regarding engagement in the policy dialogue with governments. Several praised the
World Bank’s willingness to deliver the messages, to “play the bad cop.” This does
not seem to come at the expense of close, supportive relationships with
governments. One Minister of Finance said, “The World Bank has been flexible
when changes were needed on project design, and the policy reforms supported by
the budget support operations have been helpful. There is a much more genuine
policy dialogue now. The World Bank is taking more care to explain to us why
certain changes are needed and what their impact would be, and is more responsive
to our explanations of the political economy factors associated with change.”

BRINGING GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNICAL SKILLS TO THE TABLE

Both donors and governments specifically cited the quality and importance of the
World Bank’s analytic work. From the donor perspective, the World Bank’s capacity
to identify and manage key technical skills is of particular importance. In the
governments’ view, the World Bank’s role in providing just-in-time advice is
particularly appreciated. According to one donor official, “The World Bank’s
analytic work is excellent and plays a very important role. For example, there was a
bill in the house to set up a trust fund. The Minister e-mailed the World Bank, which
provided a brief recommending against the setting up of extra-budgetary funds.”


                                                                                       53
CHAPTER 4
LEARNING AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The one concern expressed in this area related to the uneven quality of consultants
recruited by the World Bank and the need for the World Bank to clearly define
expectations and exercise quality control.

PROVIDING ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR HIGH-PRIORITY PROGRAMS

There is much appreciation for the additional funding the World Bank provided.
Both donors and governments mentioned the considerable added value of the
World Bank’s ability to access climate change funds to support programs in the
PICs, especially because the programs needed for resilience against natural disasters
are essentially the same as those needed to adapt to climate change. Therefore, these
programs serve both a long-term objective and short- and medium-term priority
concerns for governments in the region. The main concern is that IDA credits,
though highly concessional, add to the countries’ debt burden. At the same time,
there is recognition that IDA grant resources are scarce, and that without IDA
credits, the overall contribution the World Bank can make will be limited. “A
number of projects would simply not have been done without the World Bank’s
involvement,” said one senior official.

STRENGTHENING THE REGIONAL DIMENSION

The World Bank receives mixed grades for its role in the regional dimension. It was
effective in promoting multi-country approaches in fisheries, aviation, and, to some
extent, telecommunications, and tourism through IFC’s support. However, the
World Bank had a limited role in strengthening regional institutions. This may
partly have been an unintended consequence of the disengagement with Fiji after
the coup, given that many of the regional institutions are in Suva. The main
dilemma, however, is the awkward relationship between the regional institutions
and the countries. The regional institutions are viewed as competing for resources
with the countries and adding little value. The World Bank needs to take a more
systemic view of the regional institutions’ role and how it will work with them.
Regional integration is an issue for all donors, and the World Bank is well-placed to
be an honest broker. The World Bank could do more to promote the capacity
building of these institutions and to use them as the basis for enhanced peer learning
among the PICs (and more broadly with other small states). Presently this tends to
be opportunistic, and it is for the task team leader to decide whether regional
involvement will add value to a particular project.

PROVIDING LEADERSHIP TO THE DONOR COMMUNITY TO ENHANCE DONOR COORDINATION
Most interlocutors commented favorably on the World Bank’s leadership in the
context of the Development Policy Operations and in the sectors in which the


54
                                                                             CHAPTER 4
                                                          LEARNING AND RECOMMENDATIONS
government or other donors asked it to take the lead. Perhaps even more important
was evidence of the World Bank’s willingness to step back and identify niches
where it could add value by complementing the efforts of other donors. In the
energy sector, for example, one government official stated, “The World Bank focuses
on software (regulation, capacity, and so on) while other donors support hardware.
Sometimes the World Bank’s role is huge, but not seen. I’m glad the World Bank
likes it that way.” The PICs are also the front lines of World Bank–Asian
Development Bank (ADB) coordination—best practice in the Fiji Road Transport
project and in the joint liaison offices, but still work in progress with regard to
procurement in other cofinanced projects. The resumption of work in Fiji followed a
joint World Bank-ADB mission to develop an initial strategy. The co-located offices
in Tonga and Samoa have worked extremely well without any evident tensions.

PROMOTING PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

The donor community perceives IFC’s engagement in the PICs as a success story.
IFC was more aggressive on transactions and put together a surprisingly large and
robust portfolio since the trust fund was established. It helped trigger the
telecommunications revolution. IFC has positioned itself to start taking risks in small
upstream equity investments. ADB is the lead agency in dialogue with governments
on the enabling environment, but IFC’s contribution was important, too. IFC was
particularly good at using its networking capacity to link potential projects in the
PICs to foreign investors.

However, there is still an important agenda to address in supporting private sector
development. If the World Bank wants to help bend the growth curve upward in
these countries, it needs a more concerted effort to promote the private sector and
particularly micro, small, and medium enterprises. The analysis in Pacific Possible is
an important starting point for a much more focused World Bank effort. The World
Bank Group will need to work together and join forces with ADB to identify and
address the various constraints and to provide support for private sector
development. The PIC operations in some areas represent good practice in
exploiting the synergies that can be derived from the World Bank and IFC working
together to promote sectoral programs, yet in other areas such as agribusiness, a
better-coordinated approach between the World Bank and IFC is still needed. The
small size of the PICs means that the boundaries between the public and private
sectors are unusually porous, and support for private sector development invariably
requires close coordination with the government. The premium on a well-
coordinated approach by the World Bank and IFC is therefore even higher than that
in larger countries.



                                                                                    55
CHAPTER 4
LEARNING AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Interlocutors identified two areas as missed opportunities: gender equality and
education policy. There was a sense that the World Bank had not been effective in
helping countries address gender issues. The World Bank has been trying to ensure
that women are properly consulted, and that infrastructure projects, for example, are
sensitive to their needs. It also factored the need for adequate representation for
women into projects with defined beneficiaries. However, in the view of some
interlocutors, the World Bank did not define clear objectives in its support for
gender equality or work with countries and other donors to identify ways to achieve
them. This is more a reflection of the World Bank’s overall strategic approach to
gender than a specific shortcoming of its programs in the PICs. The other area in
which donors felt the World Bank could do more was education policies. In the view
of some interlocutors, the World Bank is in a good position to promote dialogue in
the PICs on the role and content of education—for example, should it be less urban-
oriented, and what role should preparation for migration have? Education has not
been a major focus of World Bank support,1 but this would seem to be relevant for
the program going forward.


Recommendations
Several recommendations emerge from the findings of this report, confined to
actions within the purview of the World Bank Group country team. Lessons related
to the modalities for delivering World Bank Group support to small states will be set
out in the overview report for the Cluster Country Program Evaluation.

Recommendation 1: Systemic issues, such as land acquisition, education policy,
domestic violence, and the role of local government, need careful study from the
perspective of how to best deal with them in various project contexts. The World
Bank, together with other donors, should initiate cross-global practice efforts to
review these topics.

Recommendation 2: The World Bank Group needs to ensure that the ramping up its
program in Fiji does not draw resources and staffing away from Kiribati and
Vanuatu which have more poverty than the other PICs, and will continue to require
sustained support taking into account their absorptive capacities.

Recommendation 3: The World Bank should take a lead in evaluating the costs and
benefits of increased regional integration in the Pacific, the current and potential role
of regional institutions, and the implications for their staff capacity development.

Recommendation 4: The private sector in small states is less able to benefit from
economies of scale and the PICs face additional binding constraints given their

                                                                        LEARNING AND RECOMMENDATIONS
remoteness such as high cost of imported inputs and high transaction costs in trade.
In these circumstances, just levelling the playing field may not be sufficient to
promote private sector development. A joint Bank-IFC approach is needed to
support private sector development in general, and specifically micro, small, and
medium enterprises (particularly in Tonga and Samoa), starting with analytic work
to identify potentials. Support for private sector development in all the PICs needs
to be a prominent feature of the World Bank Group strategy going forward.

Recommendation 5: World Bank staff location is of considerable interest to PIC
governments and the donor community. Management’s decision to shift some
positions from Sydney to the Suva office over time seems appropriate for both
efficiency and effectiveness objectives. Furthermore, liaison offices with ADB are
working well, and the World Bank should consider establishing them in other
islands.
