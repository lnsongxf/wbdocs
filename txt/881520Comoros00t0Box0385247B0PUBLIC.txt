        perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Comoros regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Comoros;

            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge

       Use data to help inform Comoros country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In June 2013, 150 stakeholders of the World Bank in Comoros were invited to provide their
opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the President, Prime Minister, office of a
minister; office of a parliamentarian; a ministry, ministerial department, or implementation
agency; consultants/ contractors working on World Bank-supported projects/programs; project
management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local government officials or
staff; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; the financial sector/private
banks; NGOs; community-based organizations; the media; independent government institutions;
trade unions; academia/research institutes/think tanks; judiciary branches, and other
organizations. A total of 126 stakeholders participated in the survey (84% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier and returned them accordingly. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Comoros; their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the
World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities; working with
the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Comoros; and the Bank’s communication and
information sharing in Comoros.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Comoros: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Comoros is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities in the country, and which areas would contribute most to reducing
   poverty and generating economic growth in Comoros.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Comoros, Bank staff preparedness to help
   Comoros solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were asked to indicate the Bank’s greatest values, the most effective
   instruments in helping reduce poverty in Comoros, with which stakeholder groups the Bank
   should collaborate more, to what extent the Bank should influence the global development
   agenda, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.

C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results and build existing country systems, the
   extent to which the Bank meets Comoros’s needs for knowledge services and financia l
   instruments, and the Bank’s level of effectiveness across forty one development areas, such
   as public sector governance/reform, energy, poverty reduction and law and justice.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge work and activities, to rate the effectiveness and quality of the
   Bank’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes
   to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Comoros’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Comoros: Respondents were asked to indicate what
   the Bank should do to make itself of greater value, and which development areas Comoros
   would benefit most from the Bank playing a leading role among international partners and
   from other donors in Comoros.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank,
   that the Bank’s websites are easy to navigate and useful, and that the Bank is responsive to
   information requests. Respondents were also asked to indicate what connection they
   primarily use when visiting a Bank website and whether they primarily use the Bank’s
   country website or the Bank’s main website.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Comoros, and their geographic location.

       There were two instances in which there were significant stakeholder group differences
        across forty one areas of development. Respondents from the office of a parliamentarian

        from local governments and the office of President/Prime Minister/Minister gave
        significantly lower effectiveness ratings.
       Respondents from the media and the office of a parliamentarian gave the highest ratings

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Comoros, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the forty-one specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development result s increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Comoros. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at economic governance;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at climate change;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at revenue/resource sharing between the Union and the
              islands;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at social protection; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at education.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Comoros, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at security/stabilization/reconstruction;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at transport;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at statistics, economic monitoring/evaluation and
              planning;
