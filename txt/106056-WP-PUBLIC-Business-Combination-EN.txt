   The study is divided into 9 chapters. Chapter 1 covers the most important issues of
    Polish commercial and tax law that may influence application of the accounting
    regulations pertaining to business combinations.
   Issues and costs connected with the application of Polish Act on accounting are
    described in Chapter 2.
   Chapters 3, 4 and 5 pertain to accounting regulations for business combinations in other
    legal systems. Provisions of international law and US standards are analyzed in detail.
    A comparison is also made between international regulations and British and German
    regulations.
   Chapter 6 presents and analysis of specific accounting methods: pooling of interests,
    acquisition method and predecessor accounting.
   Author of the study believes that fresh start accounting method applies to
    reorganization rather than business combinations. Therefore, application of this
    method was described in a separate chapter 7.
   Provisions covered in chapters 3 - 7 apply to business combinations between for-profit
    entities, regardless of whether they are public sector enterprises or not. Chapter 8
    covers regulations for business combinations between not for profit entities, including
    public finance entities.
   The last chapter discusses changes to existing provisions of the Act on accounting in
    scope of business combination proposed by the author, including justification for such.
   Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013
    on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related
    reports of certain types of undertakings, aims to standardize accounting rules, which
    should ensure greater comparability. The aim of the directive is also to reduce the costs
    connected with application of accounting rules. Member states are obligated to
    implement provisions of the directive by 20th July 2015. Besides ensuring comparability
    of financial statements, the directive is intended to reduce burdens related to
    application of accounting regulations by small entities. Provisions of the directive do not
    introduce significant changes in scope of principles for business combinations described
    in chapters 1-7. Therefore, potential impact of its implementation shall be discussed in
    the chapter devoted to recommendations.
   Throughout the text of the study, when discussing regulations applied in other systems,
    terms “enterprise”, “entity” and “company” are used interchangeably. For the purpose
    of this study, aforementioned terms signify entities for which application of discussed
    regulations is mandatory.

This study has been prepared as per Act on accounting as of 4 September 2014, International
Financial Reporting Standard 3 "Business Combinations" as published on 10 January 2008 with

other standards and regulations such as were in force as of 31 December 2013.




                                                                                         2
     1. NATURE AND SCOPE OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN
                    POLISH LEGISLATION


Introduction

1.1 Running a business involves continuous growth. Such growth can be organic, stemming
from resources created internally in the enterprise. However, in many cases an external
development strategy is adopted, based on acquisition of other entities. Such an acquisition
may involve creation of a capital group, within which each of the companies maintains its
separate legal personality. However, if a capital group is not the optimal form for the given
business activity, acquisition of another entity may take form of a business combination. In
such case, assets and liabilities of the acquiree are directly incorporated into the books of the
acquirer.

1.2 The overriding principle of accounting regulation is primacy of economic substance over
legal format. Pursuant to this principle, economic transactions must be recorded in the
accounting records in accordance with their economic nature1. In order to determine properly
the economic nature of a business combination, an analysis must be performed of economic
impacts of such a combination. Economic consequences for merging entities are described in
the provisions of commercial law.



Analysis of economic law

1.3 Companies include general partnerships, professional partnerships, limited partnerships
and limited joint-stock partnerships, limited liability companies and joint stock companies2.

1.4 There are two types of companies involved in a business combination. The first is the
company transferring assets. The second is the company that acquires the assets.

1.5 Business combination can take place according to two scenarios:
a)    the assets and liabilities of one company can be acquired by another company ,
b)    combination is effected by creating a new entity, which takes over assets and liabilities
      of merging companies.




1
  Par. 4.2 of the Act on accounting of 29 September 1994 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2013, item 330),
hereinafter referred to as “Act on accounting”
2
  Par. 4 of the Act – Code of Commercial Companies of 15 September 2000 (consolodated text: Journal of Laws
of 2013, item 1030), hereinafter referred to as “CCC”


                                                                                                              3
1.6 Business combination may also follow various configurations. This means that the merger
can take place between:
a)    a corporation and another corporation - as a result of such combination the assets and
      liabilities of the acquiree are transferred to the acquirer or merging companies transfer
      their assets to the newly formed corporation,
b)    a partnership and a corporation - as a result of such merger partnership's assets and
      liabilities are transferred to the corporation or the merging companies transfer their
      assets to the newly formed corporation,
c)    a partnership and the other a partnership - as a result of such merger partnership assets
      transferred to the newly founded corporation3.

1.7 The business combination is realized on the basis of shareholders' resolution approving
the merger and its technical implementation on managerial level is based on the merger plan.
The merger plan is drawn up by the boards of both merging companies.

1.8. If the combination takes place between corporations the merger plan should include the
valuation of the assets and liabilities of the acquiree. The measurement is to determine the
share to net assets exchange ratio and therefore is not performed by accounting methods.
The purpose of this valuation is to obtain information about the actual value of the assets of
the acquiree4.

1.9 The merger decision taken by the shareholders is validated by the Registry Court.
Registration of the merger in the National Court Register is effected based on documents
properly submitted by the boards of the merging companies5. Court refuses registration only
if the documents relating to the merger are not free from errors.

1.10 On the combination date the acquiree is removed from the register of business entities.
If assets and liabilities of the merging companies are transferred to the new company then
both merging companies are subject to removal from the register.

1.11 Following the merger, the acquirer continues operations of the acquiree and by virtue of
the law becomes its successor in terms of all the rights and obligations. Succession by virtue
of the law means that creditors' consent is not required. Following the merger the acquirer
becomes the employer for the employees of the acquiree and a party to labor relationship.

1.12 Business combination may include companies which are members of the same capital
group or companies that are not members of a capital group.

  par. 499 of CCC

  par. 493 of CCC


                                                                                             4
1.13 Usually, merger of companies involves payment of a consideration in form of interests
of the acquirer transferred to owners of the acquiree. The interests holders of the acquiree
become interest holders of the acquirer.

1.14 Provisions of commercial law do not define reverse acquisition. As a result of the reverse
acquisition a legal subsidiary obtains control of the legal acquirer. Since in exchange for the
assets and liabilities legal parent transfers its interests to owners of legal subsidiary, the
definition of the business combination is met.

1.15 According to commercial law, companies in process of liquidation, which have
commenced division of their assets, as well as companies undergoing bankruptcy proceedings
are not eligible for combinations.

1.16 Succession under commercial law is continued under the tax law.



Provisions of the tax law

1.17 Tax law is autonomous with respect to both commercial law and Act on accounting . This
means that in order to properly identify the tax consequences for the merging companies,
provisions of the tax law must be analyzed.

1.18 Under the merger, the acquirer purchases the assets of the acquiree. Under the tax law,
merger of commercial companies by way of acquisition results in tax succession6.

1.19 Under the succession provisions, tax rights and obligations of the acquiree are
transferred to acquirer.
     The acquirer is entitled to continue the amortization of acquired fixed assets. In such
      case, fixed assets for income tax purposes are measured at initial value as stated in the
      acquiree's fixed assets register. The acquirer is obligated to take into account the
      depreciation write-offs made by the acquiree and to continue using same depreciation
      method as previously used by the acquiree.
     The acquirer retains the right to deduct from its taxable profit such costs of the acquiree
      as were not included in the calculation of the acquiree’s tax obliga tions.
     Payment on acquired receivables, made to acquirer's bank accounts, stemming from
      acquiree’s earned and taxed revenues, does not give rise to taxable income of the
      acquirer.
     Interest on loans taken by the acquiree becomes the acquiree’s tax cost or t ax income,
      on condition that payment thereof is effected after the combination date.

                                                                                                           5
1.20 The list provided in paragraph 1.19 is only an example.

1.21 The principle of succession tax is limited. The acquirer may not utilize tax losses of the
acquiree.

1.22 Tax succession comes into effect upon registration of the combination in the relevant
registry court.

1.23 As a result of the merger, the acquiree transfers assets and liabilities to the acquirer.
Such transfer is not the same as sale, which would give rise to taxable income. As a result of
the combination, the acquiree ceases to exist.



Polish GAAP

1.24 Regulations that govern business combinations are described in Act on accounting.

1.25 Accounting Standards Committee has not issued standard on business combinations yet.

1.26 Polish accounting rules concerning business combinations have been prepared based on
International Accounting Standard 22 "Business combinations", which is no longer in force.
Two methods for accounting for business combinations are envisaged therein. The main
method is the acquisition method. However, in case of combination of entities under common
control pooling of interests method may be applied7.

1.27 Application of provisions concerning business combinations has been restricted in the
legislation to commercial law companies only.

1.28 As per provisions of the law, the effective date of the combination is the date of the court
registration.

1.29 Should the acquisition method be applied goodwill or negative goodwill may arise.

1.30 Goodwill is to be amortized to profit and loss statement over 5 years. However in justified
cases this period may be extended to 20 years. Negative goodwill is to be amortized to profit
and loss statement systematically.

1.31 As a principle, business combination involves a requirement of closing the accounting
books.
        The acquiree should close its accounting books as of the day of court registration.
        If business combination is effected by forming a new company, accounting books should
         be closed as of the day preceding the day of court registration.

However if the pooling of interests method is applied, and if the combination does not result
in creation of a new entity, closing of accounting books is not required.

1.32 The above described regulations apply to acquisition of an organized part of an
enterprise as well.




                                                                                           7

 2. ISSUES AND COSTS CONNECTED WITH APPLICATION OF
              POLISH ACT ON ACCOUNTING


Definition of entities under common control

2.1 The regulations do not define entities under common control. Many business
combinations are effected within the framework of the same capital group. This means, that
merging companies have the same owner. It is unclear, therefore, at which point of existence
of the capital group the business combination should be accounted for using the acquisition
method, and at which point the companies may choose between pooling of interest and
acquisition method.


                                         Example 1
 In March 2013, company A acquired 100% of shares in company B, at the price of PLN
 100,000. On 31 December 2014, management boards of the companies decided to merge,
 with Company A taking over all assets and liabilities of company B. How should the
 combination be accounted for?

 Since on 31 December 2014 the companies were under common control, the combination
 can be accounted for using either pooling of interests or acquisition method.




                                         Example 2
 In March 2013 company A acquired 100% of shares in company B, at the price of PLN
 100,000. On the 31 May 2013, management boards of the companies decided to merge,
 with company A taking over all assets and liabilities of company B. How should the
 business combination be accounted for?

 As of 31 May 2013 both companies were under common control. Therefore, based on
 linguistic interpretation of the provisions of Act on accounting, it is possible to apply
 pooling of interests method to account for the combination.



 2.2 Two examples analyzed above may be interpreted in a different way. Since business
combination between companies that are not under common control may be accounted for
by acquisition method only, it should be deemed that two transactions occurring in a short
period of time – acquisition of shares and decision on merger – should be treated as a single
transaction of combination of businesses which are not under common control.



                                                                                             9
2.3 Since time, which should lapse between the moment of acquisition of shares of the
acquiree and the moment of combination, is not defined, it is possible to utilize pooling of
interests method even if the merging entities are not under common control.



Range of entities to which business combination provisions apply

2.4 Scope of regulations pertaining to business combination is limited to commercial law
companies only. Those include general partnerships, professional partnerships, limited
partnerships and limited joint-stock partnerships, limited liability companies and joint stock
companies.

2.5 Provisions of the Act on accounting apply to a much wider range of entities. Entities
obligated to apply provisions of the Act on accounting, besides commercial law companies,
include e.g. sole proprietors, entities operating pursuant to Banking Law, other legal persons,
as well as entities without legal personality8.


                                                  Example 3
    Two sole proprietors, Mr. Jan Kowalski and Mr. Piotr Nowak have to apply Act on
    accounting due to size of their businesses. On 1 May 20XX the two businesses were
    combined and a new company, a civil law partnership, was created, with assets of both
    sole proprietorships contributed in kind9. Under the Act on accounting, how should
    contribution of assets to a joint enterprise in form of civil law partnership be accounted
    for?

    Provisions that govern business combinations are to be applied for commercial companies
    only, so there may be some doubts as to how a combination of this type should be
    accounted for. It seems that the restriction on range of entities stems directly from the
    provisions of commercial law. However, doubts may arise as to application of the Act on
    accounting to account for commercial transactions, whose economic nature is close to
    that of a business combination. In this example, the economic nature of the transaction
    is similar to a combination of two commercial companies. Therefore, provisions of the Act
    on accounting pertaining to commercial companies should be applied here.

 par. 2 of the Act on accounting.

 A civil law partnership is not a company, it is formed pursuant to civil law. The most important difference
between a company and civil law partnership is that civil law partnership has no legal personality.


                                                                                                               10
Determining the effective date of business combination

2.6 An entity controls another entity if it can determine financial and operating policy thereof
in order to achieve economic benefits from its operation10. The effective date of business
combination is the date on which it is entered into the National Court Register by a registry
court11. However the registration is only an administrative operation. If the submitted
documents are complete and error free, the court cannot refuse registration. It means that
the date of taking control of the acquiree is usually different than the date of registration.


                                             Example 4
     On 15 December 2013, company A took control of company B. As a result of the
     combination all assets and liabilities of company B were taken over by company A. The
     court is going to register the combination on 20 January 2014. How to account for such
     a business combination?

     Since the date of the combination is the date of court registration, even if company A
     controls company B on 31 December 2013; this means, that the business combination will
     only be reported in financial statement for 2014. Financial statements of company A for
     2013, financial data shall represent only the unit data of company A. Company A should
     describe the entire transaction in Explanatory Notes to the financial statement.



                                             Example 5
     On 1 March 2013, company B decided to make a contribution in kind, transferring an
     organized part of its enterprise to company A. Business combination was registered on 20
     April 2013. Merger plan was prepared as of 1 March 2013. In the period between 1 March
     2013 and 20 April 2013, company B has sold some of the assets included in the organized
     part of the enterprise, subject to contribution. Business combination is accounted for by
     acquisition method. How should it be accounted for in company A’s books?

     Assuming, that combination date is the date on which it was registered, it is necessary to
     re-measure net assets to be transferred as of the combination date. As of the day the
     assets were sold, company B should de-recognize sold assets from company books and
     recognize cash inflow. Those assets will not be accounted for within the framework of
     business combination.

     Difference between cash inflow from sales and carrying value of sold assets constitutes
     profit or loss from sale of non-financial fixed assets. Making the combination date

     par. 44a of the Act on accounting.


                                                                                              11
  dependent on date of registration rather than the date of taking control over acquired
  net assets may result in discrepancies between the merger plan and accounting books.
  For the purposes of this study, legal possibility of selling assets included in contribution in
  kind by the contributing party has not been analyzed.



2.7 It should be noted, however, that in case of some transactions it is difficult to determine
the date of assuming control. Since registration of business combination is constitutive in
nature, assuming control does not occur later than on the day of registration. In such a case
using a specific, easy to define date makes the regulations significantly simpler.



Measuring assets and liabilities at fair value

     Method used to account for the combination and its impact on net financial result in
                            periods following the combination
2.8 Measuring assets and liabilities at fair value is costly and in many cases time consuming.
On the other side it allows to present true costs of the business combination in financial
statement. If pooling of interests method is used, which does not require presenting acquired
assets and liabilities at fair value, the real costs of business combination is not represented in
profit and loss. As a result, financial statements for periods following business combination
accounted for by pooling of interests present higher net result than the ones based on
acquisition method.



Pooling of interests

2.9 Applying pooling of interests methods, in particular for combination of smaller entities, is
reasonable from the perspective of the capital group and users of financial statements.



Costs of applying current regulations of Act on accounting

2.10 Pooling of interests results in incurring costs related to:
a)     recording of assets and liabilities taken over by an acquirer.

2.11 The costs of applying acquisition method are as follows:
a)     closing of accounting books of both acquirer and acquiree,
b)     recording of assets and liabilities taken over by an acquirer,



                                                                                                12
c)   preparing of consolidated financial statement as at combination date,
d)   measuring resources and liabilities of the acquiree at fair value.

Complexity level of preparing the combined financial statement by acquisition method is
much higher than in case of pooling of interests.

          3. BUSINESS COMBINATION UNDER INTERNATIONAL
                      ACCOUNTING STANDARDS


Introduction

3.1 Until 2004, business combinations were regulated by provisions of International
Accounting Standard 22 "Business combinations". In 2004 International Financial Reporting
Standard 3 "Business combination" replaced IAS 22. In 2008 IFRS 3 was amended. IFRS 3 is
mandatory for all financial statements prepared for financial year starting after 30 June
200912.

3.2 The provisions of IFRS 3 are to a large extent consistent with US regulations on business
combinations.



Objective and scope of the standard

3.3 IFRS 3 sets forth accounting regulations for business combinations between entities. The
standard is intended to improve the relevance, reliability and comparability of information
about business combinations presented in financial statements. Provisions of IFRS 3 should
be applied to all business combinations except for:
a)       joint ventures,
b)       acquisition of individual assets or groups of assets that do not meet the definition of
         a business,
c)       combinations of entities under common control13.

3.4 It means, that IFRS 3 applies to business combinations entailing acquisition of interests in
another company, while maintaining its separate legal personality, as well as acquisition of
assets of the acquiree.

3.5 A business is defined in the standard as an integrated set of activities and assets that is
capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form
of dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits directly to investors or other owners,
members or participants.

     Par. 2 of IFRS 3


                                                                                             15
3.6 Current version of IFRS 3 regulates business combinations of mutual entities. A mutual
entity is an entity, other than an investor-owned entity, that provides dividends, lower costs
or other economic benefits directly to its owners, members or participants.

3.7 IFRS 3 states, that all business combinations covered by the standard should be accounted
for using the acquisition method14.

3.8 Joint ventures are controlled jointly and identification of the acquirer is not possible.

3.9 IFRS 3 applies to business combinations. Business is defined as inputs and processes
applied thereto, such as have the ability to create outputs. Thus, when assessing whether
provisions of IFRS 3 apply to a specific transaction, it is essential to assess, whether the
transaction involves taking control over economic resources and processes, which used in
conjunction ensure creation of, or have the ability to create, outputs. Outputs provide
a return in the form of dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits directly to investors
or other owners, members or participants15.

3.10 Acquisition of processes is not always necessary for the transaction to be a business
combination. In some circumstances, acquisition of resources without processes meets the
definition of the business combination. It occurs, when the acquirer already has those
processes in its enterprise.

3.11 Usually business combination involves acquisition of liabilities. However, lack of liabilities
does not preclude application of IFRS 3. The important thing is that the definition of a business
is met.

3.12 Definition of a business in IFRS 3 and definition of an organized part of an enterprise are
similar. However the business is a broader term16. It means that in some cases, the business
may not meet the definition of an organized part of the enterprise. Polish tax rules prescribe
a specific way of accounting for contributions in kind in form of organized part of the
enterprise. This may be of particular importance for entities that apply IFRS 3 and at the same
time calculate tax liability under Polish tax law.



Business in a development phase

3.13 IFRS 3 states, that form of the business may be influenced by the industry in which
merging entities operate, structure of the business and phase of its development. Entities in

14
   Par. 4 of IFRS 3
15
   Par. B7 of IFRS 3
16
   An organized part of an enterprise is a set of tangible (machines and equipment, tools, produtcion materials
in progress, works in progress, other) and intangible (software, know-how, patent and other) assets, that can be
used to achieve certain economic targets. In literature it is emphasized that organized part of an enterprise
should be able to operate separately from the enterprise itself.


                                                                                                            16
development phase, such as do not generate outputs yet, may be recognized as businesses.
However, in order to account for business combination pursuant to IFRS 3, proof must be
provided that the acquiree:
a)       has commenced its planned core tasks,
b)       has employees, intellectual property as well as other inputs and processes that can be
         applied to such inputs,
c)       implements the plan of generating outputs, and
d)       will be able to gain access to customers, who would buy the products.

In case of entities in phase of development, it is not necessary for all elements listed in catalog
of conditions to be present in order for the transaction to be deemed a business combination.



Goodwill

3.14 IFRS 3 defines the goodwill as assets representing future economic benefits arising from
assets acquired in a business combination that cannot be individually identified and
separately recognized in financial statement. It arises if the sum of:
a)       fair value of the purchase consideration
b)       fair value of a non-controlling interests and
c)       fair value of interests which the acquirer held in the business before the acquisition
is greater than fair value of the net assets acquired (measured in accordance with IFRS 3) 17.

3.15 Identification of goodwill is important for evaluation of economic substance of the
transaction and thus application of the proper standard. If within the framework of
acquisition of a set of assets and processes goodwill is identified, transaction is deemed
acquisition of a business, and business combinations rules apply. As a principle, such
transactions should be accounted for using IFRS 3.

3.16 Goodwill may arise in individual financial statement of the acquirer or in consolidated
financial statement depending on the legal form on the transaction. If after the combination
both acquiree and acquirer operate as separate legal entities, a capital group is created.

3.17 In such circumstances, controlling entity as a principle is obligated to measure goodwill
and to prepare a consolidated financial statement.

3.18 However, if under the combination transaction the acquirer takes over assets and
liabilities of a business, goodwill is recognized in acquirer's unit financial statement (combined
financial statement).


17
     par. 32 of IFRS 3.


                                                                                                  17
3.19 If the acquirer acquires less than 100% of the interests in the acquiree, goodwill may be
calculated in two ways which yield different results. Goodwill may be measured using:
a)        fair value method or
b)        proportionate share in identifiable net assets method.

3.20 Since those methods adopt different approach to valuation of non-controlling interests,
it is important to define non-controlling interests.

3.21 Non-controlling interests are defined as equity in a subsidiary which is not attributable
directly or indirectly, to a parent18.

3.22 Proportionate share in identifiable net assets method may be applied only in case of
initial recognition of non-controlling interests, which constitute a share in ownership and
entitle their holders to a pro-rata share of net assets of a subsidiary in case of its liquidation19.

3.23 If the non-controlling interests are measured at the fair value, it includes goodwill that
belongs to non-controlling owners. Goodwill is the residual value; therefore, if NCI are
measured at fair value, goodwill takes into consideration all the interests. If, however, non-
controlling interests are measured at proportionate share of acquiree's identifiable net
assets, goodwill has no relation to non-controlling interests.


                                                 Example 6
     Company A acquires 80% of shares in company B for PLN 4,000,000. Fair value of non-
     controlling interests amounts to PLN 560,000. Fair value of assets and liabilities of
     company B as of acquisition date, measured in accordance with IFRS 3, amounts to PLN
     2,000,000. How much is the goodwill and how to record this transaction in acquirer's
     books?

     a)    Goodwill is calculated as the proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the
           acquiree's identifiable net assets.

3.24 According to IFRS 3 goodwill is not depreciated. At the end of each year the acquirer
carries out an impairment test. If the goodwill is impaired, it is usually reflected in operating
costs. Unlike other assets, impairment costs on goodwill cannot be reversed in the future
even if the conditions for impairment cease to exist. Since the goodwill does not create cash
flows by itself, for the purpose of impairment testing it is allocated to assets that generate
cash flows20.

3.25 IFRS 3 allows negative goodwill to be created on business combination. It arises when
the aggregate of:
a)        fair value of the purchase consideration
b)        fair value of non-controlling interests and
c)        interests held by the acquirer in the acquiree before the business combination
is lower than fair value of net assets acquired, measured in accordance with IFRS 3.

3.26 If negative goodwill arises, under IFRS 3 the acquirer is obligated to verify reassess
whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired. If that is the case, negative

goodwill is included in profit and loss as an one off item21.



Identification of business combination

3.27 Business combination is a transaction or other event in which an acquirer takes control
over a business or businesses. The transactions known as mergers of equals or true mergers
are also business combinations, to which IFRS 3 should be applied.

3.28 True mergers or mergers of equals are transactions, in which both combining entities are
of similar size. International Standard Accounting Board decided that such transactions are
also business combinations, to which acquisition method should be applied. As a result,
acquirer should be identified also in cases of mergers of equals.

3.29 Structure of business combinations may vary. For example:
a)     one or more businesses become subsidiaries of an acquirer or the net assets of one or
       more businesses are legally merged into the acquirer;
b)     one combining entity transfers its net assets, or its owners transfer their equity
       interests, to another combining entity or its owners;
c)     all of the combining entities transfer their net assets, or the owners of those entities
       transfer their equity interests, to a newly formed entity (sometimes referred to as a roll-
       up or put-together transaction); or
d)     a group of former owners of one of the combining entities obtains control of the
       combined entity22.

3.30 Acquisition of controlling interest in an entity is the simplest way of achieving business
combination. However, assuming control over another entity is not always effected by way
of acquisition.

3.31 An example of such situation is a business combination based on a contract between the
acquirer and acquiree. The acquirer does not transfer purchase consideration in exchange for
control of acquiree and acquirer does not possess equity interests in acquiree as of
combination date or earlier. An example of such transaction is a stapling arrangement or
forming a dual listed corporation23.

3.32 Business combination may be achieved through exchange of assets. One party of the
transaction takes control of the business and the other party takes control of an asset or group
of assets that do not meet the definition of a business.

3.33 Business combination may be achieved through series of subsequent transactions. For
example, acquiree’s operations may have been divided into sections and each section is
acquired by the acquirer at different times. In such a case, even if none of the individual
transactions constitute purchase of a business, from the economic perspective a business
combination has occurred.



Acquisition method

3.34 Each transaction defined in IFRS 3 as business combination should be accounted for using
acquisition method. It requires identification of the acquirer and of the combination date.

3.35 An acquirer is the entity that obtains control of the acquiree. The acquiree may be
a business or businesses. The acquirer controls of the business or businesses if it has the
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from
its activities. It is to be assumed that the entity controls the business if it acquired more than
fifty percent of its voting rights24.

3.36 However in some circumstances the entity that has majority of the voting rights does not
control the business. It may be the case when the entity signs away its voting rights for
example in a joint venture transaction.

3.37 On the other side acquiring of less than fifty percent of the voting rights may result in
obtaining of the control. It may be the case if:
a)       shareholders agree on the common voting,
b)       the shareholder that possesses less than 50% of the voting rights controls financial and
         operating policy of the company based on the agreement or company deed,
c)       shareholder that possesses less than 50% of the voting rights may appoint or dismiss
         majority of the members of the entity’s management board.

3.38 The definition of the control is based on the possibilities to gain profits and the term
profit should be understood broadly. The profits may flow to the investor in the form of:
a)       future or current profits,
b)       preventing the competitor from the takeover of the business,
c)       preventing the key customers from leaving the company,
d)       reducing of costs.

3.39 If it is not possible to identify the acquirer based on above stated analysis, the acquirer
is deemed the entity that:

                                                                                               21
a)       transfers purchase consideration in form of assets or assuming liabilities,
b)       if the combination is achieved through exchange of equity interests the acquirer is the
         entity that issues interests (except for reverse acquisitions); all circumstances of such
         transaction should be analyzed, in particular whether:
               the acquirer is the combining entity which retains or receives the largest portion
                of the voting rights however all facts and circumstances concerning voting
                arrangements such as options, warrants or convertible securities should be
                analyzed,
               if it is not possible to identify an entity with significant voting interest, acquirer is
                usually the combining entity whose single owner or organized group of owners
                holds the largest minority voting interest in the combined entity.
               the acquirer is the combining entity whose owners have the ability to elect or
                appoint or to remove a majority of the governing body of the combined entity,
               the acquirer is the combining entity whose management dominates the
                management of the combined entity,
               the acquirer is the combining entity that pays a premium over the pre -
                combination fair value of the equity interests of the other combining entity or
                entities,
c)       the acquirer is the combining entity whose relative size, measured as value of assets,
         revenues or profits, is significantly greater than that of other combining entity or
         entities25,
d)       if the business combination involves more than two entities, the acquirer may be the
         entity that initiated the combination, while taking into consideration relative size of all
         combining entities,
e)       if a new entity is formed as a result of the combination, this new entity may be the
         acquirer. In such a case the new entity transfers assets or incurs liabilities. However if
         a new entity issues equity to effect a business combination then one of the combining
         entities that existed before the combination should be identified as acquirer.

                                                Example 7
     Shareholders of the company A and company B are going to merge. As a result of the
     combination a new company C is formed. 75% of equity interests issued by company C
     were taken up by company A and the remaining part 25% were taken up by company B.
     The percentage of the shares taken up by each company reflected the relative size of the
     companies. In the agreement the companies appointed company C as the acquirer. Which
     company is the acquirer according to IFRS 3?



25
     par. B15 of IFRS 3


                                                                                                      22
     According to commercial law, company C is the acquirer. However according to IFRS 3,
     the acquirer is the much bigger company A, which controls majority interest in company
     C (assuming there are no contractual covenants determining control).



                                           Example 8
     The combination of company A and B was effected by creation of a new company C. As
     a result of the merger, assets and liabilities of companies A and B were transferred to
     company C. According to commercial law, company C is the acquirer. However, according
     to IFRS 3 company A is the acquirer (company A has control of the entity in same way as
     described in Example 1). How should the combined financial statement be prepared?

     As a result of the combination company A and B were deleted from the register. It means
     that the combination should be disclosed in financial statement of company C. Since
     according to Act on accounting company A is the acquirer, financial statements of
     companies A and C should be combined using rules applicable to reorganization. This
     means, that financial statement of company C would present financial data of company A
     after the merger. Subsequently, financial statement of company B should be added by
     applying the acquisition method described in IFRS 3.




Date of business combination

3.40 Business combination should be accounted for as of the acquisition date. Acquisition
date is the date on which the acquirer takes control of the acquiree 26. Usually this date is
specified in the agreement as date on which the acquirer transfers purchase consideration
and takes over assets and liabilities. In some circumstances, assuming control may occur
before or after the legal acquisition date. It is not always easy to define acquisition date. In
many cases, all facts and circumstances concerning the transaction need to be analyzed.


                                           Example 9
     Company A acquires 100% shares of company B. The parties agreed that one off
     consideration will be paid to previous owners of the company B via bank transfer on 20
     April 2013. On that date the company obtains the right to appoint members of company
     B's management board. What is the acquisition date?




26
     appendix A to IFRS 3


                                                                                             23
Since on 20 April Company A may control the financial and operating policy of Company
B, control is assumed on 20 April 2013. This date should be applied as acquisition date for
accounting purposes.



                                        Example 10
Company A acquires 100% of shares in company B. The parties agreed that one off
consideration will be paid to previous owners of the company B via bank transfer on 20
April 2013. This date is defined by the agreement as acquisition date. However, as per the
agreement, company A obtains the right to appoint the management board of company
B on 1 May 2013. What is the combination date?

Combination date is 1 May 2013, as on this day Company A takes control of financial and
operating policy of Company B (it is assumed, that that before May 1, despite the former
management being in place, A has no possibility of controlling the company’s policies).
Consideration transfer date does not influence the acquisition date (unless it is specifically
regulated in the agreement). Acquisition date defined in the agreement is not binding for
accounting purposes. According to IFRS 3, the most important date is the date on which
the acquirer obtains control and it may differ from the consideration transfer date.



                                        Example 11
As a result of business combination, company A took over assets of company B. Purchase
consideration was paid on 20 April 2013. All documents were signed and sent to
registration court on the same day. The court has registered the combination on 15 May
2013. What is the acquisition date?

In this example, the acquirer is obligated to register the combination in court. Registration
is just a formality and the court cannot refuse the registration if the documents are free
from errors. Registration does not influence the decision of the shareholders. As a result,
acquisition date is 20 April 2013 rather than the registration date.



                                        Example 12
Company A acquires 100% of shares in company B. The purchase consideration is paid on
escrow account. Upon approval by Competition and Consumer Protection Office the
money will be transferred from escrow account to the previous owners of company B
automatically. Approval was issued by Competition and Consumers Protection Office on




                                                                                             24
 17 January 2013. The agreements state that the acquisition date is the day on which the
 purchase consideration was paid into the escrow account, i.e. 15 October 2012.

 In this example, approval of a third party is required for the combination to take effect.
 Competition and Consumers Protection Office’s approval is a necessary condition for the
 combination, so the acquisition date is the date of approval, 17 January 2014.

 A similar analysis should be conducted if the combination depends on e.g. the result of
 ongoing court proceedings.




Date of acquisition for the business combinations without
consideration

3.41 In some business combinations acquisition date is not connected with the purchase of
shares but with different transaction or event. In such cases the acquisition date is the date
of obtaining control through such transactions or events.


                                         Example 13
 Company A takes over company B. There are four shareholders of company B: company
 A, individual 1, individual 2, individual 3. Company A possesses 10% of shares in B. Other
 shareholders have 30% of voting rights each. Company A purchases shares from the
 individual shareholders in order to redeem them. As a result of redemption, company A
 obtains 65% of voting rights in company B.

 Table below presents the structure of shareholders of company B before and after
 redemption of shares

                                     Before redemption of          After redemption of
                                             shares                       shares
                                   Number of        % of        Number of        % of
                                      shares     ownership        shares      ownership
  Company A                        1,000,000 10%                1,000,000 65%
  Individual shareholder 1         3,000,000 30%                179,427      12%
  Individual shareholder 2         3,000,000 30%                179,427      12%
  Individual shareholder 3         3,000,000 30%                179,427      12%
  Total                            10,000,000 100%              1,538,281 100%

 What is the combination date of companies A and B?




                                                                                           25
     Combination date is the date of sale of rights stemming from owned shares. Shareholders
     lose the rights stemming from shares upon sale of those shares. Therefore, the day shares
     are sold is the day company A assumes control over company B. From that moment it
     holds the majority of rights stemming from shares.




Measurement and recording of identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests.

3.42 According to IFRS 3 the acquirer is obliged to measure goodwill, and separately from
goodwill identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interests.
There are some exceptions from this principle, namely:
a)       contingent liabilities,
b)       tax settlements,
c)       employee remuneration,
d)       indemnification assets.

3.43 Not all the acquired assets and liabilities can be separated from goodwill and recognized
as independent items. In order to be separable, they need to meet the definitions of assets
and liabilities described in the Conceptual Framework for International Accounting Standards.
For example even if the company has ascertained the probability of future economic benefits
from acquiree's employees or the contracts at the negotiation phase they cannot be
recognized separately from goodwill. Within the framework of business combination, the
acquirer takes over, and intends to realize value of, many resources. However, not all of them
meet the definitions described in Conceptual Framework for IASs.

3.44 When the acquired resource should be recognized separately in the financial statement
of the acquirer? It should be recognized separately as an asset if:
a)       it can be separated or divided from the entity and sold or transferred, licensed, rented
         or exchanged, etc., regardless of whether the entity intends to do so or,
b)       it arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are
         transferable or separable from the entity or from other rights and obligations27.

3.45 There are also other important conditions that need to be met for the separable
recognition of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Only the assets and liabilities that
were acquired or assumed in the business combination may be recognized separately. They
should exist at combination date. Those arisen after the acquisition date, for example future


27
     par. 12 of IFRS 3.


                                                                                              26
liabilities connected with reorganization of the acquiree are not recognized at the date of
business combination. Similarly profits arising from the business combination that will be
gained in the future are no recognized separately28.

3.46 Sometimes the acquirer may enter into arrangements with acquiree that are separate
from business combination. Such payments for assets and liabilities in such transactions as do
not constitute the purchase consideration are not accounted for as part of the business
combination and should be accounted for separately, in accordance with relevant standard29.


                                          Example 14
     Company A acquires company B. Company A has paid for legal and financial due diligence.
     How should company A account for such payments?

     Advisory costs directly connected with business combination do not constitute purchase
     consideration and should be accounted for separately as other comprehensive income,
     as of the date they were incurred.



3.47 All identifiable assets and liabilities should recognized separately. It means that there
may be such assets or liabilities which require separate recognition in the books of the
acquirer, even though the acquiree may have not recognized them despite the fact that as of
the day of acquisition they met the definition of assets/liabilities. Such a situation may occur
due to mistakes or if the item did not meet the definition of assets and liabilities. For example
the acquiree assumed the inflows of economic benefits resulting from the assets were not
probable. The reverse may also occur. Some assets and liabilities that were recognized by the
acquiree would not be recognized by the acquirer. For example goodwill resulting from
previous acquisitions of the acquiree is not recognized in the books of the acquirer. The
acquirer recognizes only one goodwill that results from the business combination.



Measurement and fair value

3.48 Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled,
between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction30.

3.49 The acquirer should measure all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at on
the date of acquisition, with exception of:
a)      employee remunerations,

   Appendix A to IFRS 3


                                                                                              27
b)       income tax,
c)       indemnification assets,
d)       reacquired rights,
e)       share-based payments awards,
f)       assets held for sale.

3.50 Fair value should be measured by the acquirer based on the amount a market participant
would pay in order to obtain the asset31. If the asset is depreciated for tax accounting, tax cost
benefit should be included in fair value. This rule should be applied for both tangible and
intangible assets.

3.51 Tax allowable costs should also increase fair value of the asset if the fair value is
measured using valuation techniques for example discounted cash flow methods.

3.52 If the fair value is measured by comparison to the same or similar asset for which an
active market exists tax benefits are already included in the value. There is no need to make
additional adjustment.

3.53 If the tax benefit should increase the value of the asset then the tax rules of the country
in which the asset is used should be applied; it is possible to include tax depreciation in tax
calculation as a cost.

3.54 Fair value is measured based on the assumption that are made by market participants.
It means that it is not influenced by the way the company is using the asset. If the company
uses the asset in a way which does not realize its fair value, or does not intend to use it at all,
it does not influence the fair value of the asset32. However, the way in which the acquirer is
using the asset will have an impact on economic life of the asset and level of permanent
impairment write-offs after acquisition date.


                                           Example 15
     Companies A and B are manufacturing metal products. Company A acquires company B.
     Acquired assets include a production line, with fair value of PLN 5,000,000. Company A
     owns a similar production line. Company B's production will be gradually moved to
     company A's production line. After two years, Company B’s production line will be closed.
     How should Company A measure the acquired production line?

     Company A should measure the production line at fair value. Closing of the production
     line may be a premise for an impairment write-off.

                                                                                                28
3.55 Measurement at fair value means, that the acquirer does not recognize impairment
separately from the asset.


                                            Example 16
     Company A acquires company B. In B's books there are receivables amounting to PLN
     100,000, and impairment write-off for PLN 40,000. Carrying value of the receivable after
     impairment is equal to its fair value. How should the acquirer account for the receivables?

     Company A should recognize the receivable at fair value, i.e. PLN 60,000. Separate
     recognition of gross book value of PLN 100,000 and impairment write-off would be
     incorrect.




Intangible assets and liabilities arising on acquired contracts

3.56 Acquisition of certain contracts within the framework of business combinations may
result in creation of intangible assets or liabilities, depending on whether the terms of such
contracts are favorable or unfavorable compared to the market33. Such a situation may arise
when the acquiree is the lessee under operating lease. The contract should be compared to
the market conditions in order to assess whether an asset or a liability arises. If the contract
is favorable compared to market, an intangible asset arises. In the reverse situation, if
conditions are unfavorable compared to market, a liability arises.


                                            Example 17
     Company A, within the framework of business combination, took over an operating lease
     contract for office space. Contract has been concluded for a period of 5 years and business
     combination took place in the 3rd year of the lease agreement. The acquirer may extend
     the contract period for next 5 years. Annual rent amounts to EUR 1,200,000 (indexed by
     CPI each year) and if the contract is extended, annual cost shall be EUR 1,500,000. At
     combination date, similar office space may be rented for EUR 2,500,000. It is forecasted
     that in short term (the next 5 years) office costs will remain at the current level and in
     future the costs should increase.

     The acquired contract is favorable. Both in basic and extended period company A may
     lease the space below the market price. This means, that in the books of combined
     companies an asset from lease contract should be recognized. Value of this asset shall


33
     par. B42 IFRS 3


                                                                                               29
     equal the difference between market value of rent on the lease and rent payments
     resulting from the acquired lease contract.



                                           Example 18
     Company A acquired company B together with a lease agreement which is unfavorable
     compared to the market. How should company A account for the unfavorable contract?

     It should be analyzed why company A accepted business combination in spite of
     unfavorable contract. Probably the purchase consideration was on a level that made the
     transaction profitable. Company A should recognize the liability from unfavorable
     contract in the combined financial statement. The liability should be amortized to profit
     and loss statement over the period of the lease agreement.




Assets on operating lease if the acquiree is a lessee

3.57 The fair value of the acquiree's assets leased under financial lease should include the
effect of the contract being favorable or unfavorable compared to the market. No separate
asset or liability is recognized. In the period following the business combination the non-
market element of the agreement is accounted for as a separate component of the asset and
depreciated over the period in which the agreement will be renegotiate to market conditions.



Contracts between acquirer and acquiree entered into before
business combination

3.58 The parties may trade with each other before the business combination is affected. If
the liabilities resulting from the agreement are higher than forecasted benefits the contract
is onerous. However the unprofitable activity of the acquiree is not always an onerous
contract. The contract should be recognized as liability measured at fair value if the contract
is classified as onerous at combination date. If so the acquirer should be aware of all key
assumptions such as: market price, necessary costs of meeting obligations under the
contract34.

     par. B52 of IFRS 3.


                                                                                             30
                                            Example 19
     Company A, a sales entity, acquired 100% of shares in company B, a manufacturing entity.
     Before the acquisition company B was one of many suppliers of company A. Under
     a contract signed before the combination, company B is obligated to deliver products at
     a specified price. However at the time of signing the contract, company B made an error
     in calculating the sales price and products are delivered to Company A at a loss. Unit cost
     of goods sold is higher than the selling price. Therefore, Company B incurs a loss when
     selling the products.

     Business combination does not change the terms of the contract. Contract for
     components delivery should be recognized as an onerous contract acquired by company
     A within the framework of business combination. Since as of acquisition date the above-
     market contract is terminated, Company A should record the cost of onerous contract.




Intangible assets acquired in the business combination

3.59 An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance35.

3.60 An asset should be separately recognized if it is capable of being separated or divided
from the acquiree and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or
together with a related contract even if the acquirer does not intend to do so 36. The asset
does not have to be capable of being sold separately.


                                            Example 20
     Company A acquires company B. Assets acquired, as per accounting records, include
     contracts with customers. Should company A recognize customer contracts as an asset
     separate from goodwill?

     Acquired customer list should be measured at fair value and separately recognized in the
     financial statement of the combined entities. In order for an asset to be recognized
     separately, it must be tradable. Customer lists are often licensed. Therefore, unless the
     combination agreement prohibits trading (sales, leasing) of such customer list, it should
     be recognized separately.

                                                                                               31
3.61 IFRS 3 does not describe in detail how the fair value of intangibles should be measured.
Same rules apply as in case of measurement of fair value of tangible assets. It is important to
measure fair value from the perspective of market participant and not the company.


                                             Example 21
     Company A acquired company B. As part of the business combination company A acquired
     license agreement for trade mark. The contract for the trade mark allows company B to
     extend the period of the agreement. The acquirer is not going to use the option.

     The option to extend should be included in fair value of the license although the acquirer
     does not intend to use it. For a market participant the option to extend could be
     important.




Reacquired rights

3.62 Before the acquisition date, the parties may trade with each other. It may happen that
the acquirer acquires right that it had previously granted to the acquiree 37. For example
before the acquisition date, the acquirer had granted the acquiree the license to use the
software. At the date of business combination the acquirer reacquires these rights.

3.63 Reacquired rights are intangibles which should be recognized separately from the
goodwill. The fair value of the rights should be measured separately so that the profit or loss
on the acquisition can be calculated. In order to measure and recognize reacquired rights
properly, the acquirer should analyze:
a)       the structure of the transaction and its recognition before the acquisition,
b)       if the transaction was an one-off sell agreement, whether any deferred revenues arose,
         how the payment was transferred (in advance, in arrears, monthly), was the transaction
         effected at arm's length conditions, was the transaction in favor of one of the parties,
c)       was it a capital or operating transaction.

3.64 Reacquired rights are not measured at fair value.

3.65 The value of the reacquired rights is measured based on the remaining period of the
agreement with the assumption it will not be extended.

3.66 Contracts giving rise to royalties or other fees, after the combination should be
compared to market. If terms of the contract are favorable or unfavorable compared to
current market prices, profit or loss on reacquired rights is recorded. The value of the profit


37
     par. B35 IFRS 3


                                                                                              32
or loss should not influence the fair value of the intangible assets stemming from reacquired
rights.


                                        Example 22
 Company A acquires 100% of shares in company B. Purchase consideration is PLN
 100,000,000. Before the acquisition, company A had granted to company B exclusive
 license for software use, for a period of 8 years. Two years have passed between granting
 the license and business combination. Payment is made in arrears, after each 12-month
 period of license use. Termination of the contract by either party involves a penalty fee in
 the amount equal to license payments for the entire 8-year period, i.e. PLN 800,000.
 Today, Company A could grant a similar 6 years license for PLN 900,000. How should
 company A account for the reacquired license?

 The license should be accounted for at market value for remaining period, i.e. PLN
 900,000. Profit or loss from recognition of the contract is the lower of
 a)    unfavorable value resulting from the difference between price for the granted
       license and its market value PLN 300,000 (PLN 900,000 - (PLN 800,000/8) x 6 years)
 b)    the amount of penalty fee for termination of the contract PLN 800,000

 Loss on reacquired contract amounts to PLN 300,000. Due to reacquired rights, the
 amount paid for business combination is not the purchase consideration. The purchase
 consideration amounts to PLN 99,700,000. The remaining PLN 300,000 is the loss on the
 reacquired rights. As of combination date, terms of the contract are unfavorable for the
 acquirer, therefore a resulting loss needs to be recognized.



3.67 Purchase of reacquired rights may be connected with the purchase of other intangible
assets. Such assets need to be recognized separately from reacquired rights and from
goodwill.

3.68 Value of reacquired rights should be measured based on the future discounted cash
flows (assuming the contract is not renewed). Measurement is not based on fair value,
because acquiring rights from a third party is not the same as reacquiring one’s own rights.
Fair value measurement involves extension of rights. In case of reacquired rights, it would
mean extension of an agreement with oneself. Therefore, in measuring the value of
reacquired rights, it should be assumed that the period of economic life of the rights is the
period remaining until expiration of the agreement granting such rights.




                                                                                            33
Fixed assets

3.69 The fixed assets acquired in business combination should be measured at fair value.

3.70 The amount of depreciation included in financial statement of the acquiree is not
transferred to the acquirer.

3.71 Fair value of properties is measured based on the market prices.

3.72 Plant and equipment are measured based on market prices. If the market prices are not
available they should be measured by replacement cost or revenue method38.

3.73 If the acquiree has received a government grant to purchase an asset, assets financed by
the grant should be measured at fair value, which is not related to the amount of the grant.
Terms and conditions of the grant should be analyzed separately in order to determine,
whether a separate liability should be recognized.


                                                 Example 23
     Company B has received a government grant for purchase of a fixed asset. Terms and
     conditions of the grant require the company to operate for at least 4 years from the
     purchase of the asset. Business combination between company A and B took place 2 years
     after the purchase of the asset. Company A was the acquirer. As a result of the business
     combination, company B ceased to exist and was deleted from the register of companies.

     In the combined financial statement company A should recognize the liability resulting
     from returning the grant.



3.74 The acquirer may purchase assets with long economic use period, which, if used in
operations, result in obligation to recultivate. If such an obligation exists, the company should
recognize the resulting liability.



Income tax

3.75 Income tax is recognized in accordance with International Accounting Standard 12
Income tax (IAS 12). Income tax assets and liabilities that would be recognized in accordance
with IFRS 3 should be recognized in accordance with IAS 12. Different rules might apply only
in case of valuation of items. One of such differences may pertain to discounting - income tax
assets and liabilities are not subject to discounting.


38
     International Accounting Standard 16 "Property, plant and equipment"


                                                                                              34
3.76 The acquirer recognizes in its accounting books tax effect resulting from temporary
differences that existed at combination date or arise as a result of business combination.

3.77 Deferred tax is calculated for all temporary differences i.e. differences between balance
sheet value and tax value of the assets and liabilities. The measurement of the deferred tax is
performed from the perspective of the company that may utilize the assets or liability, usually
the acquirer39.

3.78 It is possible that the acquiree does not recognize deferred tax asset stemming from tax
loss, due to the fact it would not be able to utilize the loss in the future. However, as a result
of business combination, the acquirer might be entitled to utilize the loss and thus might be
entitled to recognize the asset on acquired tax loss.


                                                  Example 24
     Company A acquires 100% of shares in company B. Company B has an unrecognized tax
     loss. As of the day preceding the combination date, Company B did not recognize
     a deferred tax asset stemming from tax loss, since it was not capable of achieving
     revenues sufficient to utilize this loss. Company A, as a result of undertaken
     reorganization, intends to utilize the tax loss of its subsidiary. How should deferred tax
     assets on tax loss be recognized in the combined financial statement?

     As of the business combination date, it is possible to utilize the tax loss. Therefore,
     Company A should recognize deferred tax asset from tax loss in the combined financial
     statement.



3.79 The acquirer may believe, that as a result of business combination it would might be able
to realize its own favorable temporary differences or tax loss. Or reversely, as a result of
business combination it might become impossible. In such case, the adjustment to deferred
tax does not influence the goodwill and should be accounted for in profit and loss.

3.80 IAS 12 does not allow recognition of temporary differences arising on goodwill. If
acquired goodwill cannot be recognized as cost of obtaining revenue (write-offs, cost at sale),
tax value is nil. In such a situation, temporary differences arise, such as do not constitute
a basis for calculation of deferred tax40.

Assets held for sale

3.81 Assets held for sale are measured at fair value less the selling costs. It is an exception
from the fair value measurement. Assets might be classified as held for sale if they are sold
within 3 months from business combination (IFRS 5 par. 11). A business acquired for the
purpose of resale should be recognized as discontinued activity (IFRS 5, par. 32c)41.



Employee benefits

3.82 Employee benefits are another exemption from fair value measurement. Assets and
liabilities arising on employee benefits are measured in accordance with International
Accounting Standard 19 "Employee benefits". In some circumstances, IAS 19 does not require
measurement of employee benefits at fair value42.



Financial Instruments

3.83 Financial instruments that are part of identifiable net assets of the acquiree are
measured at fair value as of combination date.

3.84 If the acquiree measured its financial instruments at fair value before the acquisition
then the acquirer continues the valuation in the combined financial statement. However if
the instruments are measured at amortized cost, the acquirer may be required to measure
them at fair value.

3.85 Usually the fair value of receivables and short term liabilities is not significantly different
from the carrying value. Fair value measurement only applies to cases, in which acquirer
assumes that expected inflows or outflows would not equal the carrying value.


                                                 Example 25
     Company A acquired company B. During the measurement period, a key customer of the
     acquiree has commenced liquidation process. Company B has had not recorded an
     impairment write-off before the acquisition. Should company A record impairment write-
     off in combined books?

     The acquirer should not record an impairment write-off in combined books. The
     receivables should be measured at fair value. Such measurement is usually based on


41
   par. 11, par. 32c International Financial Reporting Standard 5 "Non-current assets held for sale and
discontinued operations".
42
   par. 26 of IFRS 3.


                                                                                                          36
     discounted cash flows. Fair value measurement will also reflect the client’s ongoing
     liquidation process.




Contingent liabilities

3.86 International Accounting Standard 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent
Assets describes two types of contingent liabilities. The first one is the possible obligation
arising on past events whose existence will be confirmed by future event or events that are
not within the control of the entity. The second one is the present obligation, which is not
recognized because it is not probable that the outflow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation or the outflow cannot be measured reliably. The contingent liability is recorded
in business combination if it meets the definition of the liability and can be measured
reliably43.

3.87 The first group of liabilities is not recognized in combined financial statement.

3.88 The second type of liabilities is recognized regardless of whether the outflow is probable
or not but only if it can be measured reliably. However, departure from recording the liability
due to impossibility of valuation can only be applied in exceptional cases. Since the acquirer
decides to pay the purchase consideration, it should be assumed that it is capable of
measuring all material liabilities of the acquiree. Otherwise the transaction risk would be very
high.


                                           Example 26
     Company A acquires company B. Both companies provide health services. Company B has
     been sued for malpractice resulting in patient’s death. Company B has not created
     a provision in its books. Lawyers of company B believe, that probability of winning the
     case is high. Due to company’s reputation and risk of losing the case, management of
     Company A decided to settle out of court. How should the acquirer account for the
     contingent liability?

     As of acquisition date, in the combined statement Company A should recognize a liability
     in the amount of expected settlement.




43
     par. 23 of IFRS 3.


                                                                                             37
Contingent assets

3.89 IFRS 3 does not provide detailed guidance on accounting for contingent assets.
Contingent asset arises when the company is not sure whether the asset exists on the
acquisition date or not, since its existence will be confirmed or disproved by a future event
that is not within the control of the company. Since contingent assets do not meet the
definition of the asset included in the conceptual framework for IASs/IFRSs they are not
recognized in business combinations, even if their existence is virtually certain.



Indemnification assets

3.90 The seller in a business combination may contractually indemnify the acquirer for the
outcome of a contingency or uncertainties related to all or part of a specific asset or liability.
Usually the sellers guarantee the payback of the outflows due to liabilities that the acquirer
was not aware of and that arose as a result of the sellers' activities. Then, the acquirer
recognizes respective indemnification assets44.

3.91 Indemnification assets are recognized by the acquirer at the same time and pursuant to
the same principles as the indemnified item. They are measured by the same method as the
indemnified item. If the indemnified asset is measured at fair value then the indemnification
asset should also be measured at fair value. Economic nature of such an asset is very similar
to that of a receivable. It means that that the asset should be tested for recovery, same as
commercial receivables. As a result, it may be necessary to create an impairment provision in
the acquirer’s books.


                                             Example 27
     Company A is going to acquire company B. Company B is in court dispute with tax office.
     In similar cases the court of first instance judged in favor of the tax office. Jurisprudence
     of second instance courts varies. As a result the court of first instance has referred the
     case to be recognized by an extended panel of judges. The “ruling of seven judges” is to
     be issued within 6 months from the business combination. In case of the unfavorable
     judgment, liability of Company B shall amount to PLN 1,200,000 (including interest). The
     parties intend to include a clause in the agreement, stating, that shareholders of company
     B are obligated to cover any additional tax liabilities. How should such an event be
     accounted for in the combined books?

     In the combined financial statement, company A should recognize a liability resulting from
     the court case, in the amount of PLN 1,200,000. At the same time, it should recognize an


44
     par. 27 IFRS 3.


                                                                                                 38
     asset from shareholders of company B covering this liability (we assume, that receiving
     this amount is virtually certain). If probability of realization of this asset decreases, an
     impairment write-off should be made, in relevant amount. Indemnification assets reduce
     acquisition price, and, as a result, goodwill.




Reorganization liabilities

3.92 Liabilities stemming from reorganization or liquidation of the acquiree should be
recognized at combination date if the acquirer is obligated to incur costs connected with these
activities, as per IAS 37.



Deferred revenues

3.93 The acquirer recognizes liabilities resulting from deferred revenues. The value of such
liability equals to the liability acquired within the framework of business combination. The
liability resulting from deferred revenue should be measured at fair value and may differ from
carrying value recognized in financial statements of the acquiree.



Classification of identifiable assets and liabilities

3.94 At the acquisition date, the acquirer shall classify or designate the identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed as necessary to apply other IFRSs subsequently. The acquirer
shall make those classifications or designations on the basis of the contractual terms,
economic conditions, its operating or accounting policies and other pertinent conditions as
they exist at the acquisition date45.

3.95 There are two exceptions from this rule. They pertain to recognition of lease and
insurance contracts. Those are classified based on terms and conditions of respective
agreements and other circumstances existing at date of signing the agreements. They are not
re-measured at combination date unless terms and conditions of the agreement are changed.




45
     par. 15 IFRS 3.


                                                                                                39
Bargain purchase

3.96 In a bargain purchase the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the total of
a purchase consideration, the value of the non-controlling interests and the value of shares
the acquirer possessed in the acquiree before the acquisition46.

3.97 Bargain purchase may happen if the seller is forced to sell the business or if he is not
aware of the true value of the business.

3.98 Bargain purchase results in a profit which should be accounted for by the acquirer in
profit and loss statement. However before the profit is recognized the acquirer should re-
measure the acquired assets and liabilities in accordance with IFRS 3. This is predominantly
to verify:
a)        completeness of the identifiable assets and liabilities ,
b)        measurement of separately identifiable assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests,
          value of acquiree’s shares owned by acquirer before the combination, purchase
          consideration.

3.99 The entire profit resulting from business combination belongs to the acquirer and should
not be allocated to non-controlling interests. Usually it should be an element of operating
profit. Such presentation should be applied when the costs of the business combination
incurred by the acquirer are recognized as operating costs.


                                              Example 28
     Company A acquired 95% of shares in company B for PLN 2,000,000, payable by wire
     transfer at the date of signing the agreement. Fair value of non-controlling interests is PLN
     240,000. The value of acquired net assets measured in accordance with IFRS 3 is PLN
     2,300,000. How should goodwill be calculated and recognized by the acquirer?

     a)     accounting entries and the value of the goodwill if non-controlling interests are
            measured at the fair value.

             Fair value of the purchase consideration                  PLN       2,000,000
             Fair value of non-controlling interests                   PLN         240,000
             Total                                                     PLN       2,240,000
             Fair value of net assets                                  PLN     (2,300,000)
             Negative goodwill (profit from combination)               PLN          60,000

            Accounting entries should be as follows:

             Dr Net assets                                             PLN      2,300,000

Purchase consideration

3.100 Purchase consideration is the total of assets transferred measured at fair value as of
combination date, liabilities towards previous owners of the acquiree, assumed by the
acquirer and equity instruments issued by the acquirer to previous owners of the acquiree
(except for awards paid in form of shares). Purchase consideration may take various forms; it
can be cash, shares in a subsidiary or other47.

3.101 Sometimes acquiree (or its previous owners) and the acquirer only exchange equity
interest. In such case, a problem may arise as to how such equity interests should be
measured. For example, such a situation may occur if the acquirer is not a publicly traded
company. Then the fair value of the acquiree might be more reliable. In such case, the
acquirer calculates goodwill based on fair value of acquiree shares as of acquisition date
rather than on fair value of transferred equity interests as of the same date.

3.102 Sometimes unconditional purchase consideration is payable not on the date of
acquisition but at a future date. Such deferred acquisition price may be expressed in cash,


47
     par. B20 IFRS 3.


                                                                                           41
equity interests or in other forms. An important characteristic of deferred purchase
consideration is that its amount is known. IFRS 3 requires for full purchase consideration to
be included in the business combination accounting.

3.103 Purchase consideration should be measured at fair value. It means that if the
consideration is paid in cash the fair value is calculated based on discounting techniques. The
bonuses and discounts that might be achieved in the future should be included in the
calculation.


                                         Example 29
 Company A acquires 100% of shares in company B for PLN 100,000,000. PLN 10,000,000
 was paid via bank transfer on the date of signing the agreement. The remaining part is to
 be paid in 4 years as a lump sum.

 Economic nature of the purchase consideration is such, that Company A has received from
 previous owners of Company B a loan in the amount of PLN 90,000,000. This liability
 should be recognized in books of Company B at fair value, i.e. at present value of future
 cash flows. Net present value amounts to PLN 74,043,222.73 [PLN 90,000,000 x
 1/(1+5%)^4] , with assumed discount rate of 5%. As a result, purchase consideration to be
 paid by Company A amounts to PLN 84,043,222.73, although a different amount is stated
 in the agreement. 5% discount rate reflects the interest rate for a four year investment
 loan which acquirer could get. The difference between purchase consideration and
 amount actually paid should be recognized in profit and loss statement as a financial cost
 over the repayment period.



3.104 If deferred consideration is payable in form of equity interests, recognition should be
based on International Accounting Standard 32 "Financial instruments: presentation" (IAS
32). If the deferred consideration meets the definition of equity instrument it should be
recognized directly in the equity. Interests will be classified as equity instruments if the
number of equity interests is constant and the acquirer bears the risk of changes in the value
of the interests. It should be disclosed as separate line in equity as interests to be issued in
acquirer’s equity.

3.105 It is often the case that the consideration is constant and the number of equity interests
at the settlement date depends on market price of the shares at that date. Then the equity
interests to be issued should be classified as financial liabilities and not as equity.

3.106 It may be the case that before the acquisition employees of the acquiree are entitled
to share payments awards. The acquirer may swap the awards payable in acquiree shares for
the awards payable in acquirer’s shares. Share payment awards in acquirer shares should be
measured in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard 2 "Share payments"


                                                                                             42
instead of fair value. Non-vested replacement awards attributable to pre-combination service
are be included in purchase consideration. However non-vested replacement awards
attributable to post-combination service should not be included in purchase consideration.

3.107 Purchase consideration may be made in a form of non-monetary assets or liabilities, or
a joint venture. Difference between fair value and carrying value of such assets or liabilities is
usually recognized as profit or loss in the acquirer’s financial statements as of combination
date, if the assets and liabilities constitute purchase consideration. If as a result of the
transaction the acquirer does not lose control of those assets and liabilities, they are not
measured at fair value and no profit on revaluation arises.

3.108 Contingent consideration is the obligation of the acquirer to transfer additional assets
or equity interests to previous owners of the acquiree as purchase consideration if the future
event or events occur48. Contingent consideration is often applied if the acquiree and acquirer
cannot agree on the true value of the business.

3.109 In analyzing a business combination agreement including a contingent consideration,
payments related to purchase consideration should be separated from indemnification
payments.

 3.110 Contingent consideration should be measured at fair value. The fair value is calculated
based on probability of certain events occurring. As a result contingent consideration is
included in business combination only if it is assumed the event would occur. If the acquirer
has the right for reimbursement of previously paid amounts, such right should be recognized
as an asset in its financial statement.

3.111 Payment of the contingent consideration is measured at the fair value. It means that
the adopted way of settlement does not influence goodwill. Accounting for contingent
consideration after the business combination may vary and depends on how the
consideration was classified at the acquisition date.

3.112 Measurement of the contingent consideration may prove to be a difficult task. However
this cannot serve as justification to depart from measuring it at fair value.


                                             Example 30
     Company A is big pharmaceutical entity. It acquires a smaller company B that operates in
     the biotechnology segment in order to gain the access to its research and development
     projects. Company A agrees to pay a consideration of PLN 20,000,000 to owners of
     Company B in cash. Additional PLN 5,000,000 will be paid if the office for drug certification

     par. 39 of IFRS 3.


                                                                                                 43
approves one of the projects within a period of 10 years. How should company A account
for the contingent consideration?

The company should disclose contingent payment as a financial liability measured at fair
value as of combination date. Fair value should take into consideration probability of
certification being issued.



                                        Example 31
Company A acquires company B. As part of the purchase consideration, company A agrees
to issue ordinary shares for owners of Company B, to the value of PLN 3,500,000, on
condition that company B achieves a profit of at least PLN 2,000,000 in financial year
following the acquisition. How should company A account for contingent consideration?

Company A has committed to issue an equity instrument. Value of the shares is constant
and amounts to PLN 3,500,000. Contingent consideration should be recognized as equity
measured at the fair value at combination date. Fair value should take into consideration
share price as of combination date and probability of payment becoming due. Additionally
fair value should be adjusted for all factors that influence the price of the shares, such as
are not connected with contingency consideration, such as e.g. payment of dividends in
contingency period.



                                        Example 32
Company A and B provide health services. Company A acquires 100% of shares in company
B. Company B was sued by a group of patients for malpractice. Value of the claim amounts
to PLN 500,000. Purchase consideration consists of two elements: PLN 1,500,000
unconditional payment and PLN 2,000,000 paid if conditions specified in the agreement
are met. At combination date, PLN 1,500,000 was transferred to the previous owners of
B and remaining PLN 2,000,000 part was paid to escrow account. If the conditions are
met, the amount will be transferred to previous owners of B automatically. Company A
predicts the conditions will be met. At the same time the sellers have paid the value of
the potential claim, PLN 500,000, into escrow to indemnify the acquirer. In case of
a unfavorable judgment of the court the amount will be transferred to acquirer's bank
account. How the PLN 500,000 related to lost court case should be accounted for?

The PLN 500,000 is not related to refund of the purchase consideration; it is an
indemnification asset realized as a result of the court case. Therefore, Company A should
recognize a liability from the court case and a matching indemnification asset.




                                                                                            44
3.113 Accounting for contingent consideration on the balance sheet date depends on how
the consideration had been recognized at combination date. The contingent consideration
that was classified as part of equity is not subject to revaluation. The consideration classified
as asset or liability should be accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 and IAS 37.

3.114 Monetary contingent consideration that the acquirer is supposed to transfer or has the
right to refund should be accounted for in accordance with IAS 39. Contingent consideration
payable in cash or other financial assets is a financial liability that should be measured on each
balance sheet date at fair value. IFRS 3 governs that financial assets and liabilities should be
measured at fair value. Any changes in fair value should be recognized in profit and loss
statement49.

3.115 Neither IFRS 3 nor IAS 39 provides any guidance on how to present the gain or loss on
revaluation of contingent consideration in the profit and loss statement.

3.116 Fair value may change due to many reasons. For example, such change may stem from
unwinding the discount in order to reflect time value of money. Since the standards do not
govern how to classify such changes, different rules can be applied.

3.117 Fair value adjustments should be recorded in line with the effects that caused the
adjustments. If the adjustment results from change in future profits on which its payment
depends, the effect should be included in operating activity. In such a situation, in the
combined statement, additional benefits stemming from better operating income of acquired
business will be offset by the cost of higher payment. However, if fair value adjustment is
connected with unwinding of discount then it should be recognized as part of financial
activity.

3.118 The right to refund of contingent consideration in form of cash or other financial assets
is an asset and should be accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 as an asset available for
sale. Fair value adjustment of financial assets available for sale should be recognized directly
in equity unless the change results from impairment test. In such case, the adjustment is
recognized directly in profit and loss statement.



Contingent consideration connected with obligation to provide
labor

3.119 In same cases the payment of the purchase consideration is conditional upon employee
services provided after the acquisition. Such payments should be accounted for as cost of
labor after the acquisition. If as a result of termination of the employment contract the



49
     par. 58 of IFRS 3.


                                                                                               45
contingent consideration is not due, contingent consideration constitutes remuneration for
post-combination service.


                                            Example 33
     Company A acquires company B. The owners of company B are also members of the
     management board. The owners are supposed to receive additional consideration if the
     EBITDA achieves agreed level. If shareholders of Company B are not employees of
     Company A, contingent consideration will not be due.

     Additional payment is connected with rendering services after the acquisition. It should
     be seen as a reward for achieving targets assumed for the given period. Additional
     payment should be accounted for as a cost of the period in which the targets are achieved.
     It is not a contingent consideration.




Measurement of non-controlling interests

3.120 Fair value of the non-controlling interests should be measured at combination date. Its
value should be based on prices that come from an active market. If they are not available,
fair value should be assessed by other valuation techniques. The standard indicates that the
value of a single non-controlling interest may differ from the value of single controlling
interest. The difference is the premium for the control or discount for lack of control. The
premium results from the ability to influence financial and operating policy of the acquiree
and benefits stemming from ability to decide about distribution of profits and appoint
management board members.



Business combination without transfer of the consideration

3.121 The acquirer may obtain the control on the business without payment of the
consideration. Such a transaction meets the definition of a business combination, because it
results in acquirer taking control of the business50.

3.122 Acquisition method should be applied for such combinations. If the business
combination is carried out only on the basis of contract, equity interests in the acquiree held
by parties other than the acquirer are recognized in acquirer’s statements prepared after the
combination as non-controlling interests. In some cases, all of the equity belongs to other




50
     par. 43 of IFRS 3.


                                                                                              46
parties; in such cases, all those interests are assigned to non-controlling shareholders equity
in financial statements of the acquirer.



Determining the elements of a business combination

3.123 Accounting for business combinations includes only purchase consideration, assets
acquired and liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests, which the parties exchange in
connection with taking control of a business. Transactions between the parties, which are not
associated with transfer of control over the business are accounted for separately, in
accordance with applicable IFRS. Examples of such separate transactions include:
a)       transaction that in effect settles a pre-existing relationship between the acquirer and
         acquiree,
b)       transaction related to remuneration due to employees or former owners of the acquiree
         for their future services,
c)       transaction of reimbursement of business combination costs paid by acquiree or its
         former owners.

3.124 In determining what constitutes a business combination following items need to be
analyzed:
a)       the reasons for the transaction;, if the transaction is carried out mainly in favor of the
         acquirer or the combined entity rather than for the benefit of the acquiree or its
         previous owners it is unlikely to be an element of a business combination,
b)       the originator of the transaction.



Settlement of prior relationship between the parties

3.125 The acquirer and the acquiree may have entered into transactions with each other
before the acquisition. The business combination constitutes an ultimate settlement of all
such transactions. If the purchase consideration includes amounts that settle such
transactions, they should not be accounted for as part of the business combination51. Parties
to the transaction may enter into contracts for delivery of goods or services.

3.126 Not all prior relationships between the parties are contractual. They may have
a different nature, such as when one party is suing the other. In such a case the settlement of
such transactions in the business combination results in a gain or loss in acquirer’s financial
statement, measured at fair value.


51
     par. 51 of IFRS 3


                                                                                                47
The measurement period

3.127 Accounting for business combination may be complex and lengthy. It may happen that
it will not be completed by the end of the reporting period in which the acquisition took
place. In such a situation, the acquirer shall present in its financial statements estimated
values of those assets and liabilities for which measurement has not been completed. The
estimated amounts may be adjusted before the measurement period expires (on the
retroactive basis)52.

3.128 The measurement period ends on the date on which the acquirer receives all the
information regarding the circumstances that existed at the acquisition date or learns that he
cannot get any additional information. However, this period cannot be longer than one year
from the date of acquisition.


                                            Example 34
     Company A acquired Company B on 1 October 2014 and made the initial accounting for
     the acquisition at the end of December 2014. A company recognized the value of the
     acquired assets in the estimated value of PLN 3,000,000 PLN and estimated goodwill
     amounting to PLN 10,000,000. The assets have a useful economic life of 5 years since the
     date of the acquisition. The process of valuation of the acquired factory was completed in
     June 2015, with the final valuation of assets at PLN 3,800,000. How should company A
     account for the change in the valuation?

     Company A should make adjustments retrospectively. This means that it should adjust the
     value of fixed assets at the acquisition date in conjunction with the goodwill. Since value
     of fixed assets has changed, depreciation entries made until the day of completing
     valuation have to be adjusted. As a result, assuming that there was no impairment of
     goodwill, it will be reduced by PLN 800,000, down to the amount of PLN 9,200,000.
     Increase in depreciation cost will depend on adopted depreciation rates.




Business combination in stages

3.129 In some situations, the acquirer takes control of business in which it held shares
previously. This is called a business combination in stages53. Such combination, similar to all
other acquisitions described in IFRS 3, should be accounted for using the acquisition
method. At combination date shares held before the acquisition are measured at fair

     par. 45 of IFRS 3.
53
     par. 41 of IFRS 3


                                                                                               48
value. The revaluation surplus is a gain or loss which must be recognized in acquirer's profit
and loss statement.


                                              Example 35
     Company A has 30% stake in B, which is an associated company. In financial statements,
     these shares are recognized at PLN 200,000. Company A acquires remaining 70% of the
     shares in B for the amount of PLN 1,500,000. On the day of acquisition, the fair value of
     shares held before the acquisition amounted to PLN 320,000. The value of the identifiable
     net assets of Company B at the acquisition date amounted to PLN 1,100,000. How should
     company A account for the fair value adjustment?

     The combination should be accounted for by acquisition method, therefore Company A is
     obligated to calculate goodwill.

             Fair value of the purchase consideration               PLN       1,500,000
             Fair value of shares held before the acquisition       PLN         320,000

     Gain on revaluation on acquisition date amounted to PLN 120,000 (PLN 320,000 - PLN
     200,000)

     The entries in the accounting books of Company A should be as follows:

             Dr Net assets                                          PLN       1,100,000

Combination of entities under common control

3.130 If the acquirer or a business are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both
before and after the acquisition then the transaction is called a business combination under
common control. IFRS 3 does not govern business combinations under common control54.




54
     par. B1 of IFRS 3.


                                                                                             49
                                         Example 36
 Company A, being a subsidiary of the Company C is also the parent company for company
 B. Company A and Company B are going to merge.

 This combination meets the definition of a business combination under common control
 and should not be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3.



3.131 The current version of IFRS 3 does not contain guidance on the accounting for business
combinations under common control. Accounting for this type of combinations has also not
been properly addressed in any other accounting standard. This means that provisions of
International Accounting Standard 8 "Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates
and errors" should be applied. The provisions of this standard obligate the acquirer to account
for such a business combination in accordance with economic substance of the transaction.

3.132 Combination of entities under common control is undoubtedly the business
combination. Therefore, since all business combinations are accounted for using the
acquisition method, this means that the acquisition method may be applied for such
combination as well. However, the acquisition method does not always reflect the economic
substance of the transaction. For example, application of the acquisition method may be
questioned in a situation where a significant time period has elapsed between acquisition of
shares and merger.

3.133 An alternative way to account for business combinations may be the predecessor
accounting method. This method was developed as a result of practical accounting for
business combinations and does not require measurement of acquired assets and liabilities
at fair value. The acquirer uses the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the acquiree
recognized in the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent company. This
means that the acquirer in the combined financial statements recognizes the goodwill derived
from the consolidated financial statements.

3.134 It may happen, that the consolidated financial statements are not drawn at any
level. Then, the acquirer should account for the combination using the carrying amounts
recognized in the statement of the acquiree.

3.135 While applying the predecessor accounting method, the acquirer does not calculate the
goodwill. Since the ultimate controlling party of the acquired assets is not changed, the
goodwill in the combined financial statement may be derived from the consolidated financial
statement. The use of predecessor accounting method may result in difference between the
net assets imported from the consolidated financial statements and the value of investments
in the acquiree. This difference should be recognized as a separate item of acquiree’s equity.




                                                                                            50
Reverse acquisitions

3.136 An acquirer in a business combination is identified based on the control criterion. In
most cases the acquirer is the entity which issues shares as a result of business
combination. Sometimes, however, this may not the true and the entity that issued equity
instruments that from a legal point of view, is the acquirer for accounting purposes is the
acquiree55. Reverse acquisition may apply when a private entity wants to become public but
does not want to go through the IPO process or register shares in the public market.


                                            Example 37
     Company A sells FMCG goods. Company B, which is listed on the stock exchange in
     Warsaw, entered into an agreement with A. Under this agreement, in December 2013
     company B issued shares, which were acquired in exchange for a contribution in kind to
     A in the form of 97% of its own shares. In December 2013, existing members of the
     supervisory board and management board of B have resigned. In their place members of
     the board A were appointed.

     In this example, from a legal point of view, the acquirer is the company B because it issues
     the equity interests and non-public Company A is the acquiree. However, for accounting
     purposes in accordance with IFRS 3, the primary criterion for determining the acquirer is
     control. Thus, if the company B meets the definition of a business, company A obtains
     control and is the acquirer, while company B is the acquiree.



3.137 In the case of reverse acquisitions, the entity, which for accounting purposes is the
acquirer, does not transfer purchase consideration. Beneficiaries are the shareholders of the
company, which according to commercial law is the acquirer.


                                            Example 38
     Company B listed on the stock exchange in Warsaw, entered into a business combination
     with Company A. The day before the acquisition share capital of Company A was
     composed of 100,000 shares. Fair value of the single share determined by discounting
     techniques amounts to PLN 20,000. Share capital of company B consists of 20,000 shares
     and the market price of one share is PLN 8.50. As a result of the combination agreement,
     Company B issued 40,000 shares in exchange for 100,000 shares of Company A. After the
     transaction, shareholders of Company A own 67% (40,000/60,000) shares of the




55
     par. B19 IFRS 3.


                                                                                                51
     combined company and the shareholders of B own 33% (20,000/60,000). What is the
     purchase consideration?

     Purchase consideration is the fair value of consideration transferred. Despite the fact that
     in accordance with accounting law company A is the acquirer, purchase consideration
     should be measured by the market value of B's shares, as it is more reliable. Company A
     acquired 40,000 shares of B with a value of PLN 8.50 each. This means that the price of
     the acquisition is PLN 340,000.




Consolidated financial statements in the reverse acquisition

3.138 The consolidated financial statements represent a continuation of the financial
statements of the legal subsidiary. This means that:
a)      the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary (from a legal point of view) recognized and
        measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts should be combined with:
b)      the assets and liabilities of the legal parent that are recognized and measured according
        to IFRS 3,
c)      retained earnings and other equity items should reflect the capital structure of the
        entity, which before the combination was the legal subsidiary.

3.139 Share capital is determined as the sum of the shares on the day preceding the business
combination of the entity that is the legal subsidiary, which for accounting purposes is the
acquirer, and the fair value of the entity, which based on IFRS 3 provisions is the
subsidiary. The capital structure should reflect the equity structure of the legal parent.



Non-controlling interests in reverse acquisitions

3.140 It could be that some owners of the legal subsidiary do not exchange their shares for
shares of the legal parent. These shareholders have the right to participate in the net result
and net assets of the legal parent. They have no right to profit or loss and net assets of the
combined company. They are treated as non-controlling shareholders in combined financial
statement.


                                            Example 39
     Company A is going to merge with company B. Prior to the merger, the share capital of
     Company B consisted of 1,000 shares. Share capital of A consisted of 800 shares, which




                                                                                                52
belonged to four shareholders. As part of the merger, B issued 4 new shares in exchange
for each share of Company A. Company A shareholders exchanged in this way 750,000
shares. How to account for this type of transaction under IFRS 3?

In this case we are dealing with a reverse acquisition. Following the transaction, the
shareholders of A will have 75% shares in the company B. Unless there are additional
agreements in place, regulating the matter of control otherwise, shareholders of
Company A control financial and operating policies of company B. As a result of the
transaction, non-controlling interests have arisen, since 50 interests in company A were
not exchanged for shares of company A.




                                                                                       53

             4. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS UNDER US GAAP

4.1 Accounting Standard Codification 805 "Business Combinations" (hereinafter referred to
as ASC 805) governs accounting for business combinations.

4.2 The content of the revised IFRS 3 is to a large extent consistent with the contents of ASC
805



Structure of the standard

4.3 Standard is divided into six main chapters:
     ASC 805-10 Overall,
     ASC 805-20 Identifiable assets and liabilities and any non-controlling interests,
     ASC 805-30 Goodwill or gain from bargain purchase including consideration transferred,
     ASC 805-40 Reverse acquisition,
     ASC 805-50 Related issues,
     ASC 805-740 Income tax56.



Purpose and scope of the standard

4.4 The provisions of the standard are applicable to business combinations or acquisitions
made by non-profit entities57. ASC 805 does not govern:
a)    joint ventures,
b)    the acquisition of single assets or groups of assets that do not meet the definition of
      a business or non-profit entity,
c)    business combinations under common control58.

4.5 On the basis of ASC 805 combination is a transaction or other economic events, in which
the acquirer obtains control of a specific business or businesses. Usually the subjects of the
transaction are net assets or shares in the business59.

4.6 The business has been defined as an integrated set of processes and assets, which
managed in an appropriate manner have the ability to provide returns to investors,

57
   ASC 805-15-3.

   ASC 805-10-20.


                                                                                           55
shareholders, participants or other owners. The returns may be in the form of payment of
dividends, reduce costs or otherwise. It is easy to determine whether the transaction is
a business combinations or only to the acquisition of individual assets. Standard provides
guidance on how to determine the business in practice.

4.7 A business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability
to create outputs. The three elements of a business are defined as follows:
a)       inputs or any economic resource which when applied to the process or processes has
         the ability to produce outputs,
b)       processes i.e. any system, standard, protocol, convention or rule which applied to the
         inputs may create products,
c)       the products or the results of the used inputs and processes that have the ability to
         provide returns to investors, shareholders, participants or other owners in the form of
         dividends, reduce costs or otherwise60.

4.8 Although businesses usually have outputs, outputs are not required for an integrated set
to qualify as a business. For example, such a situation could occur if the business is in the
development phase. Then deciding whether the acquired assets are business or not it should
be considered whether the group of assets:
a)       has begun planned major planned activities,
b)       has the employees, intangible assets and other inputs and processes that can be applied
         to those inputs,
c)       carries out the plan of producing outputs
d)       is able to find customers for these outputs.

4.9 The standard presents premises, based on which companies can decide whether a given
transaction is a business combination. However, they are not unequivocal. The standard
indicates that the definition of a business can be met even if the business does not have
liabilities.


                                            Example 40
     Company A and B operate on the market for value added mobile phone services. Company
     A’s operations include call center services. Company B intends to purchase from company
     A equipment such as workstations (phones, desks, chairs), and the telephone exchange.
     After the transaction, call center employees of company A will become employees of
     company B. Until the business combination takes place, remuneration of those employees
     will be paid by their former employer.



60
     ASC 805-10-55-4


                                                                                             56
     In this example, Company B takes over inputs and processes that jointly are able to create
     outputs in form call center service. Therefore the transaction is a business combination
     and as per ASC 805 should be accounted for as such.



                                             Example 41
     Company A sells goods. Company B is a logistic entity. So far, the transport of goods from
     warehouses to stores was provided by company C. Company A has decided to give up the
     services of C and start its own logistics. For this purpose company A acquired from
     Company B ten trucks, which were put up for sale due to the difficult financial situation
     of the company. The companies are not connected.

     In this example, company A buys from the other company a group of assets that constitute
     inputs. No processes are acquired. These types of transactions are excluded from the
     scope of ASC 805.



4.10 If the purchase price of a group of assets exceeds their fair value at the date of the
transaction, the transaction is a business combination. Lack of the surplus does not mean that
there was no business combination. Group of assets may also be a business when the
purchase price is lower than the fair value.

4.11 In a business combination the acquirer can gain control of the business by:
a)       the transfer of cash or other assets (including the business),
b)       incurring of liabilities,
c)       the issuance of equity instruments,
d)       through a combination of a-c
e)       without purchase consideration61.

4.12 Business combination does not always require acquisition of net assets or shares in the
joint venture. A business combination may also occur when:
a)       shares are repurchased for the purpose of redemption, from all investors except for one,
         who thus becomes the parent,
b)       control of a business is taken over due to weakening of the position of minority
         shareholders,




61
     ASC 805-10-55-2.


                                                                                              57
c)       two companies enter into a transaction in order to combine their businesses, and as
         a result one company takes control over the combined business62.

4.13 The combination involving entities that are approximately of the same size and together
control the joint venture is also a business combination, which should be accounted for in
accordance with ASC 805. Members of the Financial Accounting Standard Board justified the
inclusion of this type of transaction in the range of business combination accounted for using
the acquisition method stated, that the combination of relatively equal entities is in practice
very rare. In the vast majority of cases it is possible to identify the acquirer. The development
of separate rules for transactions occurring very rarely is impractical and could be considered
as an alternative to the acquisition method.

4.14 The exchange of assets between the companies (excluding cash) should be accounted
for using the acquisition method, if it results in acquisition of a business. In some situations,
it is preferable to carry out a business combination by more than one transaction. Such
connected transactions leading to acquisition of a business should also be accounted for as
a business combination.



Determination of the acquirer

4.15 In the business combination accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, there is always
an acquirer. According to the standard, the acquirer is the entity who takes control of the
business. An entity that owns more than 50% in the business is acquiring entity, unless the
business is a variable interest entity. In such a situation, the entity which includes a variable
interest entity in its consolidation is deemed the controlling interest. In case of variable
interest entities the acquirer is not always clear.

 4.16 The standard indicates, that it is possible to determine an acquirer for each business
combination. This is usually the entity that transfers purchase consideration. However, the
standard does not provide a clear definition of the acquirer.

4.17 In some cases, there may be difficulties associated with the determination of the
acquirer. Then it is necessary to:
a)       analyze the size of parties - the acquirer is the entity which is clearly bigger than the
         other entities involved in the transaction; basis of the comparison may be total assets,
         revenues, net income,
b)       identify the initiator of the business combination; in the case where more than two units
         are involved, besides the size of the parties the initiator of the transaction should be
         identified,


62
     ASC 805-10-25-11.


                                                                                               58
c)      indicate one of the companies transferring their assets as the acquirer, if the
        combination is effected by creation of new entity,
d)      determine the company that makes the transfer of benefits as the acquirer when the
        acquirer does not issue its own shares,
e)      indicate the company that issues its own shares as the acquirer when purchase
        consideration consists of shares,
f)      indicate a party that has the right to appoint the management of the combined entities;
        usually the acquirer is the entity that appoints the key members of management of the
        combined entities63,64.

4.18 Additional difficulties in determining the acquirer may arise when a new entity is created
as a result of business combination. In some situations, the new entity should be considered
the acquiring entity. It is assumed that if the new company is created only to the issue equity
interests it may not be considered the acquirer65.


                                               Example 42
     Company A and Company B are related parties. Company C intends to withdraw from
     a certain market segment and sell the relevant part of its business. Company A and
     Company B are interested in in developing their activity in the segment, from which the
     Company C wants to withdraw. Company A and company B have formed a new company
     D with initial capital of PLN 1,000,000. Company C sells to Company D the part of the
     company constituting a business, for cash. Which of the companies is the acquirer?

     In such a situation, the company D should be considered to be the acquirer.




Date of acquisition

4.19 Day of acquisition is the date on which the acquirer takes control of a specific business. It
is worth noting that this definition is met by entities in development stage as well as organized
groups of assets that do not meet the definition of an organized part of the enterprise in the
understanding of Polish commercial law. Definition of a business is of particular importance
here, because accounting for business combinations is different from the acquisition of
assets. So a business will include assets and processes which jointly are capable of creating
outputs.

4.20 The acquirer usually exercises control, if it possesses a majority of voting
rights66. However, this is not always the case. American standards introduce the concept of
variable interest entities67. Equity holders of such entity, who possess the majority of voting
rights, do not exercise actual control over the business. Such a situation may occur for
example when external financing significantly exceeds the equity of the business. In such
a situation, operation of the business is financed not by the owners but by external parties,
who thus can control the business.

4.21 The combination date is the date on which the acquirer assumes control over the
acquired business. As a rule, control is obtained when the assets and liabilities are transferred
legally to the acquirer. However, the date of the entry in the court register is not always the
date of assuming control. Control may be assumed both before and after court registration. In
such a situation, date of assuming control should be determined based on economic
substance of the transaction, taking into account all the circumstances of the combination 68.



Identification of assets and liabilities in a business combination

4.22 The acquirer shall recognize in its accounting books all identifiable assets and
liabilities separately from goodwill69.

4.23 In a situation where there are non-controlling interests in the acquiree, the acquirer
should recognize them in its financial statement.

4.24 Business combination may lead to disclosure of assets or liabilities that were not
recognized in the financial statements at combination date. In such a situation, the acquirer
should recognize such assets in the combined financial statement.

4.25 In the combined financial statement, such resources should be recognized as meet the
definition of internally created assets. All assets and liabilities recognized in accounting books
should meet the definition of assets and liabilities, as presented in the conceptual framework
for the codified standards.

    Accounting for variable interests entities is defined in Accounting Standard Codification 810 "Consolidation".
It is an entity in which the acquirer has not invested enough resources for the entity to be able to operate without
cash inflow from third parties. Shareholders of the variable interests entities: a) cannot influence most important
aspects of the operations, b) are not entitled to profits of the entity

                                                                                                                60
                                         Example 43
 Company A acquires 100% shares in B. Along with B's assets company A acquires customer
 base. Is the customer base is an asset in the combined financial statement?

 Customer relationships developed internally do not meet the definition of the asset. Thus,
 in unit financial statements of Company B before the combination, expenses incurred for
 the purpose of building a customer base could not be recognized as assets. Under the
 business combination, Company A acquired this customer base. The customer base is an
 element of intangible assets that should be recognized in the combined financial
 statement.



                                         Example 44
 Company A acquires 100% shares in Company B. Company B has been operating on the
 market for many years and offers its products under a self-developed trademark. Should
 company A recognize the trademark separately from goodwill in the combined financial
 statement?

 In unit statements before the combination, Company B was not entitled to recognize the
 expenses related with the development of its own trademark as assets. However under
 the combination agreement, Company A has purchased the trademark from Company B
 and in the combined financial statement, the trademark should be recognized separately
 from goodwill.



4.26 In addition to the business combination the parties may enter into other transactions.
Provisions of ASC 805 should not be applied to assets acquired within the framework of such
additional transactions.

4.27 Business combination may be associated with restructuring activities. Usually at the
combination date future planned outflows resulting from such activities do not meet the
definition of liabilities. They should be accounted for by acquirer, if conditions described in
Accounting Standard Codification 420 "Exit or disposal costs obligations" are met.

4.28 In some cases both before and during the negotiations on business combinations, the
parties entered into other business transactions. These types of transactions are not
associated with business combination and should not be covered by the acquisition
method. Only the transactions associated with business combination should be accounted for
using acquisition method.




                                                                                            61
4.29 The acquirer is required to analyze the business combination, as well as other
transactions with the acquiree, in order to identify those elements of transaction, which
determine the acquirer’s control of the acquiree. Such an obligation arises from the fact that
during the negotiations, before control is assumed, the parties may trade as if they were
affiliated entities. As a result, conditions of transactions entered into by acquiree-to-be might
be structured in such a way as to achieve, in its combined financial statement after the
combination, financial effect desired by the acquirer70.

4.30 When determining whether a transaction is part of a business combination, it should be
assessed which party to the transaction earns benefits from business combination. If the
benefits of the transaction that was entered into before the business combination goes to the
acquirer and not to the acquiree or its owners, the transaction should be accounted for as
part of business combination.

4.31 In making such an assessment, the acquirer should consider:
a)       what was the economic objective of the transaction,
b)       who initiated the transaction - determination of the entity that initiated the transaction
         may be helpful in assessing whether the transaction is part of a business combination:
              if the transaction was initiated by the acquirer is less likely that it represents a part
               of business combination,
              if the transaction was initiated by the acquiree or its pre-combination owners it is
               more likely that it represents a part of business combination,
c)       the time of the transaction - the analysis of the time at which the transaction was
         entered in can be helpful, for example, if the transaction was concluded at that moment,
         in which it would benefit the acquirer with high degree of probability71.

4.32 Transactions that have been concluded during the combination negotiations are the
benefit of the acquirer and as such should not be accounted for as part of the business
combination. They are separate transactions and principles set out in the other standards
should be applied.

4.33 Not all expenses related to the business combination should be accounted for under the
acquisition method.

4.34 The costs associated with a business combination should be recognized in profit or
loss. These are for example: expenses for legal, accounting, tax advisory, expenditure for the
valuation services. There is one exception from the rule. The standard provides that costs of
registration and the issuance of shares as well as the costs associated with the issuance of
debt securities should be recorded in accordance with other relevant standards. Expenditure

for the issuance of shares reduce the inflows from the issuance. Costs of issue of debt
securities are deducted from the proceeds of the issue or are recognized as an expense in the
period in which they are incurred, or alternatively, it can be amortized to profit and loss over
the period of the loan.


                                          Example 45
 Company A acquires 100% shares in the company B. As part of the business combination
 agreement, shareholders of B bear the costs associated with handling this transaction in
 the amount of PLN 80,000. Purchase consideration amounts to PLN 3,500,000. The parties
 have agreed that all expenses are paid by the buyer. How to account for such transaction
 in the books of Company A?

 Purchase consideration stated in the agreement amounts to PLN 3,500,000, but part of
 this amount is the reimbursement of costs incurred by previous owners in connection
 with the combination. This means that for accounting purposes, purchase consideration
 is PLN 3,420,000.



4.35 Prior to the business combination the parties may trade with each other. They may
supply goods or render services. It is also possible that combining companies are parties to
a court dispute. As a result of the business combination, mutual claims are settled. The
acquirer should recognize gain or loss on such a settlement as follows:
a)   if the claims arise from the ruling of the court, at fair value,
b)   if the claims arise from the supply of goods and services, gain or loss should be valued
     at the lower of:
          the amount by which the contract is favorable or unfavorable for the acquirer
          amount needed to settle the contract.


                                          Example 46
 Company A acquires 100% shares in Company B. Two years before the merger companies
 entered into an agreement for supply of goods. On the business combination day the
 contract has three years to elapse. Early termination involves a penalty fee amounting to
 PLN 2,000,000. The total value of the contract is PLN 1,500,000. Purchase consideration
 is PLN 15,000,000 and fair value of net assets acquired is PLN 12,000,000. Market prices
 for the delivery of commercial goods have fallen. If on combination date the acquirer
 enters in the 3 year contract for supply of similar goods with another supplier, the acquirer
 would save PLN 800,000. How should acquirer account for the business combination in its
 accounting books?




                                                                                             63
     Accounting for the business combination, the acquirer is required to apply the acquisition
     method. The amount of the early termination of the contract is greater than the amount
     by which the contract is unfavorable compared to market conditions. Therefore, the
     company should account for a loss in the amount of PLN 800,000.

     The entries in the books of A are as follows:

            Dr Net assets                                            PLN     12,000,000
            Dr Goodwill                                              PLN      2,200,000
            Dr Loss on settlement of the contract with B             PLN        800,000
               Cr Cash                                               PLN     15,000,000

     On combination date, the unfavorable contract is settled. Therefore, purchase
     consideration should be adjusted by the amount of difference between market value and
     value of the contract with Company B.




Employee services for the acquirer

4.36 The acquirer should assess whether the contingent payments to the former owners or
employees of the acquiree are part of the purchase consideration or should be accounted for
separately. The assessment should consider the following factors:
a)       the reasons why the contingent payments are included in the business combination
         agreement,
b)       who was the initiator of such agreement,
c)       when (at what stage of negotiations) the parties entered into an agreement for future
         payment.

4.37 In order to classify the contingent payments properly, first of all the terms of
employment contracts should be analyzed. If the termination of the employment contract
cancels contingent payments, they should be regarded as arising from the employment
relationship. Opposite situation may indicate that the consideration specified in the contract
of employment is part of the purchase consideration. In this case, benefits derived from such
an agreement should be accounted for in accordance with ASC 80572.

4.38 If an employee is required under an employment contract, or similar, to remain in the
employment relationship for a period that is equal to or exceeds the amount of contingent
payments, it may indicate that contingent payments are part of remuneration and are not
part of purchase consideration.

                                                                                              64
4.39 If a fixed amount of contingent payments is similar to remuneration received by
employees in similar positions in the acquirer it may indicate that it is a salary and not part of
the purchase consideration.

4.40 If the contingent consideration for shares, paid to the previous owners who did not
become employees are lower than for those who did become employees, it may indicate that
additional payments are not part of the purchase consideration.

4.41 If the previous owners own a material number of shares in the acquirer and occupy key
positions in the combined company it may mean that contingent payment is in fact a profit
sharing agreement, which provides remuneration for post-combination services. If the
previous owners have only a small number of shares. However, if contingent consideration is
dependent on predefined conditions, it is remuneration for services rendered after
termination of employment contract73.



Assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination

4.42 To allow the acquirer to apply accounting standards in the combined financial
statements, management is required to make a decision regarding the classification of net
assets acquired as of combination date. Decisions concerning classification should be taken
on the basis of the acquirer's accounting policy, economic substance and use of acquired
assets and liabilities, as well as provisions of the combination agreement 74. The standard
provides examples on classification which the acquirer should make in its books:
a)    classification of individual investments in shares as held for trading, available for sale or
      held to maturity75,
b)    classification of derivatives as hedging instruments76,
c)    an assessment of whether an embedded derivative should be separated from the main
      contract or not.

4.43 Classification of assets and liabilities in the books of the acquirer at the date of initial
recognition is important, as subsequent measurement is different for different assets and
liabilities.

4.44 ASC 805 exempts lease agreements and insurance contracts from classification on the
day of business combination77. Such contracts should be accounted for in the books of the

acquirer in accordance with terms in force at the date of the conclusion by the acquiree and
not in accordance with the terms as of the combination date.

4.45 The acquirer measures tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired in business
combination at fair value. If business combination results in non-controlling interests being
acquired, they should also be measured at fair value.

4.46 Regardless of whether the acquiree is the lessor or lessee, acquirer assesses at
combination date if acquired lease contract is favorable or unfavorable compared to the
market. It should be assessed, whether the same asset could be leased from another company
on terms that are more favorable, worse or the same. If terms and conditions of the lease
contract are favorable the acquirer should recognize an asset (separately from goodwill). If
the terms of the lease are worse than market, the company should recognize a liability.

4.47 Fair value of leased assets owned by the acquiree being a lessor in an operating leasing
contract is measured separately from the lease agreement based on which they are being
used.

4.48 Fair value takes into account the uncertainties inherent in future cash flows associated
with certain assets78. Therefore, an impairment write-off should not be recognized separately
by the acquirer.

4.49 Fair value measurement is based on the assumption that the assets will be used in the
most effective manner. Such an approach should be adopted also for the assets acquired in
a business combination even if acquirer does not intend to do so.



                                            Example 47
     Company A and Company B are competing in the market of mobile value-added services.
     Company A acquires the assets and liabilities of B in the business combination. Products
     of companies A and B marketed to individuals are very similar. Immediately after the
     acquisition customers of B will be transferred to the company A's platform, and company
     A products will be withdrawn from the market. Company A acquires the trademark of B
     but it will not be actively used.

     A trademark acquired in a business combination is used to protect company A’s market
     position. Despite the fact that it will be not actively used, company A should measure the
     trade mark at fair value at initial recognition. Valuation at subsequent balance sheet date
     should include an impairment charge.

                                                                                               66
4.50 The acquirer should recognize identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business
combination separately from goodwill. The initial recognition of intangible assets should be
accounted for in accordance with ASC 350. This standard governs the accounting of intangible
assets subject to amortization, those without specific useful economic life and goodwill. In
a business combination the acquirer should present value of intangible assets if they meet
the definition of an asset and can be measured reliably79. In addition, these assets must meet
one of two criteria:
a)    self-reliance - an intangible asset should be separately recognized if it can be separated
      from the company which is the owner and it may be sold, transferred, licensed,
      exchanged, regardless of whether the acquirer intends to do so or not,
b)    legal - the intangible asset results from contractual or other legal title80.

4.51 The standard lists intangible assets that are subject to a separate presentation. This list
is divided into five groups:
     Intangible assets in form of trademarks, trade names, internet domain names, non-
      competition agreements, etc.
     Intangible assets in form of customer lists, customer orders, business relations with
      clients, etc.
     Intangible assets in form of works of art
     Intangible assets resulting from acquired contracts. Examples of such assets include
      contracts under which the acquirer will be entitled to revenues from licenses,
      advertising, leasing agreements.
     Intangible assets resulting from technology used by the acquirer. It covers patents,
      copyrights, databases, processes, production lines, etc.

4.52 The list of intangible assets subject to a separate recognition does not include
employees. This stems from lack of a reliable measurement method. In particular, the
replacement method does not lead to determining fair value of such an asset.

4.53 Intangible assets are amortized over the useful economic life. Factors that should be
taken into account when determining the economic useful life are as follows:
a)    contractual and other legal restrictions that affect the length of use of the assets,
b)    the possibility of extending the right to use assets
c)    the volume of demand, the strength of competitors and other economic factors,
d)    the useful economic life of assets cooperating with a given intangible

not.

                                                                                                            67
e)   the way intangible and legal assets are used,
f)   maintenance costs of an intangible or legal asset.

4.54 If the useful economic life cannot be determined, the asset is not amortized. In certain
circumstances, useful economic life of an intangible asset cannot be determined at the
business combination date, however on subsequent balance sheet day it may be possible.
Reversely, if an asset was subject to depreciation on initial recognition, upon measurement
as of subsequent balance sheet date it might no longer be subject to depreciation.

4.55 As a rule, the entire value of the asset will be depreciated. However, in some situations,
residual value of an asset should be determined, which will reduce the amount of
depreciation. Residual value arises when the useful economic life of the acquired business
will be shorter than the useful economic life of intangible assets. The residual value can be
determined based on the prices of assets in an active market and it can be reasonably
assumed that such a market will exist throughout economic life of the asset. The residual
value may also be determined if a third party agreed to acquire the intangible asset from the
acquirer at the end of its useful economic life. Amortization method should reflect the pattern
in which the asset generates inflows to the company. If it is not possible, straight-line method
should be used. The intangible asset is tested against impairment.

4.56 ASC 805 requires all intangible assets used in research and development acquired in the
business combination to be to disclosed and measured item by item or grouped.

4.57 Such disclosures should take place even if the acquirer has no other alternative ways of
using the assets. Measurement at fair value should be determined as of combination
date. Measurement at fair value in accordance with ASC 820 should be made based on same
assumptions as would be made by market participants. Assets that will not be used by the
acquirer, or that will not be used in the most optimal way, are also measured at fair value.

4.58 Intangible assets associated with research and development are classified as assets that
do not have economic useful life. Such a classification continues to the point where R & D will
be completed or abandoned. Until the useful economic life is determined, the assets are not
amortized. They are subject to impairment tests. When the determining of the economic
useful life is possible, the depreciation should be started.

4.59 Business combinations can also include tangible assets used for research and
development. Accounting of such assets is done according to their economic nature (e.g.,
inventories, depreciable assets, etc.).

4.60 ASC 805 introduces exceptions to the general rules for measurement of assets and
liabilities at fair value as of combination date.

4.61 Assets held for sale - these types of assets are measured at fair value at the combination
date less the costs of sale, in accordance with ASC 360. They are not subject to


                                                                                             68
amortization. The costs of sale do not include losses associated with maintaining assets held
for sale or groups of assets held for sale. The costs of sale are cover costs that would be
incurred even if the sales transaction did not happen. For example, brokerage fees, taxes and
other charges resulting from applicable law.



Contingent assets and liabilities

4.62 In some cases, the acquirer should recognize in its books contingent assets and liabilities
of the acquiree. Such disclosure is dependent on whether fair value measurement of the asset
is possible on combination date. If so, the acquirer should recognize such contingent assets
or liabilities at fair value as of acquisition date81.

4.63 In a reverse situation, the asset or liability is recognized as of combination date if both
following conditions are met:
a)       information available before the end of the measurement period indicates that it is
         likely that the asset or liability existed at combination date,
b)       measurement as of the date of initial recognition can be performed reliably82.

4.64 If these criteria are not met then the acquirer cannot recognize assets or liabilities at
combination date.

4.65 In subsequent periods, provisions of relevant standards should be applied for the
purpose of accounting for such assets.

4.66 The acquirer is obliged to recognize all contingent contracts of the acquiree taken over
within the framework of combination at fair value as of combination date.

4.67 The board of directors of the acquirer should develop such accounting policy for
contingent assets and liabilities, as would take into account their economic substance. These
principles should be applied continuously.



Indemnification assets

4.68 Typically, agreements on business combinations contain provisions concerning
indemnification payments, which the acquirer would receive in case of occurrence of adverse
events, known or unknown at balance sheet date. These provisions are designed in such

     ASC 805-30-25-5.

     ASC 805-20-25.


                                                                                             69
a way as to reduce to a minimum costs incurred by the acquirer as a result of adverse events,
by way of indemnification83.

4.69 The acquirer is required to recognize and measure indemnification assets in accordance
with same accounting principles as applied to indemnified items. Measurement of such assets
should take into account all the uncertainties concerning the amount and timing of cash flows.

4.70 If the asset is measured at fair value at combination date, impact of these uncertainties
is included in the fair value. Therefore impairment loss is not separately recognized.

4.71 Some of the indemnities relate to assets or liabilities that are not recognized in the
financial statement. In particular, they may apply to contingent assets or liabilities that do not
meet the conditions relating to the disclosure. Indemnities may be related to the settlement
of tax liability of the acquiree. In such a case, the indemnification asset should be recognized
and measured in accordance with the rules governing the valuation of indemnified items.

4.72 Uncertainty associated with payment of indemnification in itself is not included in fair
value. Therefore, if the inflow of indemnity is not certain, the acquirer should consider
provision for impairment.

4.73 At each balance sheet date subsequent to the date of acquisition, the acquirer is obliged
to measure indemnification assets applying the same accounting principles as are applied to
the indemnified asset, taking into account indemnification provisions of the agreement. If the
indemnification asset is not carried at fair value then it should be tested against
impairment. An impairment provision may be created if needed.



Reacquired rights

4.74 As part of the business combination the acquirer may acquire assets and liabilities arising
from agreements concluded before the combination, such as leases, licenses,
franchises. Under agreements concluded prior to the combination, the acquiree paid the
acquirer for the use of tangible assets or intangible assets that belong to the acquirer84.

4.75 In such a situation, the acquirer should recognize a depreciable asset, separately from
goodwill. Terms of reacquired rights should be compared with market conditions. If they are
beneficial for the acquirer, compared to contracts that could be concluded on similar or
identical assets, the acquirer shall recognize gain in the lesser of:
a)       the amount by which the contract differs from contracts that could be concluded on the
         market

b)       the amount of penalty for termination of the contract by the party, for which it is
         unfavorable compared to the market.
If conditions are unfavorable then the acquirer should recognize a loss (on the same basis)

4.76 Reacquired rights recognized in the acquirer’s balance sheet are amortized over the
remaining period of the agreement. Contract expiration date should be used even in
a situation in which independent parties would intend to extend the contract.



Income tax

4.77 Measurement of assets and liabilities resulting from income tax is not based on the fair
value concept nor the technique of discounting.

4.78 On the date of acquisition the acquirer is required to recognize deferred tax assets or
deferred tax liabilities constituting future impacts of temporary differences that existed at the
combination date or arose due the business combination85.

4.79 Measurement of tax liability or tax receivable should be based on Accounting Standard
740 "Income Taxes" (ASC 740). This valuation is used to estimate the taxable profit of the
acquiree. The board of directors should adjust the tax bases of assets and liabilities related to
the business combination.

4.80 New information related to the tax events and tax circumstances that existed at the
combination date and come to light in the later period are recognized as follows:
        If the circumstance affects the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the
         measurement period, goodwill is adjusted. If this adjustment results in goodwill being
         reduced to zero, then the remainder of the adjustment is recognized as a gain from the
         combination.
        If the circumstance affects the measurement in the next period, such change is
         recognized in accordance with ASC 740.

4.81 Deferred tax assets are written off, when it is more likely that the value of the assets will
not be realized than it is likely that the value of the assets will be realized.

4.82 On the day of the business combination all the benefits resulting from temporary
differences or future tax allowable losses may be recognized in the financial statements only
if the acquirer is entitled to these benefits under the applicable tax law.

     ASC 805-740-25.


                                                                                               71
4.83 These benefits should be recorded in the gross value. If it is more likely that the deferred
tax assets will not be realized then it should be written down. It may be the case, when it is
expected that the business would not generate income sufficient to realize the tax benefits.

4.84 If national legislation imposes constraints related to the settlement of tax benefits in the
combined companies, the constraints will be reflected in the impairment provisions on
deferred tax assets.

4.85 In some jurisdictions, it is possible to submit joint tax return of the combined entities and
to settle tax losses of the acquirer against the profits generated by the acquiree when the
deferred tax assets on the loss was impaired. In such situation, if reversal of the impairment
is reasonable then it is not accounted for as part of the business combination. This benefit is
recognized as a tax benefit at the combination date.

4.86 Changes in impairment write-off after the combination date, stemming from deferred
tax assets arisen as a result of the combination, should be recognized as follows:
a)       if the adjustment is in the measurement period (as defined in 805), which does not
         exceed one year from the date of acquisition, and is due to circumstances which existed
         at combination date the adjustment influences the goodwill. If the adjustment results
         in a decrease of goodwill to zero, the acquirer is required to recognize the reversal of
         impairment loss as a gain on the business combination,
b)       if the change in the valuation arises in the period following the measurement period it
         should be recognized as an adjustment to deferred tax assets in the period in which the
         change occurred. Standard provides for an exception to this rule for the option plan for
         employees. In such case the adjustment is recognized directly in equity and not as
         income tax expense.

4.87 Until 1993, goodwill was not treated as tax deductible item on the basis of U.S. tax law. To
the extent that goodwill is not tax deductible temporary differences do not arise and it does
not influence deferred tax. Amendment of provisions of the Tax Act from 1993 allows
recognition of goodwill in calculation of income tax for a period of 15 years. However, the
way goodwill is calculated for tax purposes differs from the one provided by ASC 805 for
accounting purposes86.

4.88 In a situation, in which amortization of goodwill pursuant is considered a cost by tax law,
temporary differences between the carrying value and tax value arise. In such situations,
impairment write-off based on accounting law does not affect the tax return.

4.89 Goodwill represents the excess of purchase consideration over the separately
identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. Standard requires the
recognition of the goodwill separately from the deferred tax associated with that goodwill.

Measurement and recognition of non-controlling interests

4.90 In the current version of codified standard, the notion of minority interests was replaced
by the notion of non-controlling interests. Standard setters decided, that the term “minority
interests” in certain circumstances did not describe the situation correctly. According to ASC
805 and ASC 810, an entity may be a majority shareholder in another unit without holding
majority of the voting rights. Therefore it would be wrong to use the term “minority
shareholders” in relation to the shareholders, who hold the majority of shares.

4.91 ASC 805 requires for non-controlling interests to be measured at fair value based on the
prices in an active market on the business combination date. If the acquirer does not acquire
all the shares in the acquiree and there is an active market for the remaining part of the shares
the acquirer should measure them based on the market prices. If there is no active market
the shares should be measured by other methods of valuation. Application of other
measurement techniques is likely to result in a situation in which value per share in the control
package is different from value per share of non-controlling interests. Such a situation is
justified because the investor will want to pay less for the shares, which do not allow him to
exercise control over the business than for shares, which give such control87.



Determination of purchase consideration

4.92 Purchase consideration is measured at fair value at combination date. It may be
expressed in cash, other assets, acquirer’s subsidiary or acquirer's shares. It may be
conditional. The total purchase consideration is the sum of its parts measured at combination
date at:
a)       fair value of the assets transferred by the acquirer,
b)       fair value of liabilities towards previous owners of the acquiree assumed by the acquirer,
         and
c)       fair value of equity instruments issued by the acquirer, including the valuation principles
         used to account for the option plan for the employees of the acquiree88.

4.93 Where the purchase consideration consists of assets or liabilities of the acquirer other
than cash, the acquirer is required to measure them at fair value. The difference resulting
from revaluation is charged to the profit and loss account as of combination date. However if
after the combination the components of purchase consideration remain under the control
of the acquirer, they are measured at carrying value as of the day preceding the combination

date. Such a situation may occur when the acquirer transfers assets or liabilities to the
acquiree and not to its former owners.

4.94 The way the business combination is structured may involve transfer of acquirer's shares
to the acquiree or its former owners. If on the combination date fair value of the shares of
the acquiree is more reliable than the value of the equity instruments of the acquirer then
the value of the acquiree should be used to measure purchase consideration.



Contingent consideration

4.95 Contingent consideration can be determined in many ways. As a result, it may be
necessary to recognize either assets or liabilities. In each case, contingent asset or liability
should be measured at fair value at combination date89.

4.96 If the contingent consideration includes obligations for future payments, the obligation
should be recognized either as a liability or as part of equity in accordance with ASC 480, ASC
815-40 or other standards.

4.97 The acquirer is required to analyze the information obtained after the conditional
consideration is measured. Additional information obtained during the measurement period,
pertaining to circumstances existing at the combination date result in an adjustment of
contingent consideration in correspondence with goodwill or gain on the
combination. Changes that are the result of events occurring after business combination, such
as achieving certain level of profits do not constitute a change occurring during the
measurement period and should be recognized in the books as:
a)       if the contingent consideration was classified as equity, it is not revalued and the
         difference resulting from the settlement is recognized in equity,
b)       if the conditional purchase price was classified as an asset or liability it should be re-
         measured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the final settlement.

4.98 Changes in the fair value should be recognized as a gain or loss in the current period
unless the contract is a hedging instrument; then changes should be recognized in the
statement of other comprehensive income (equity).



Measurement of goodwill or gain from transaction

4.99 Acquisition method involves measurement of goodwill or a gain from
combination. Goodwill is an intangible asset, that results from the fact that the buyer decides

                                                                                                74
to pay more for obtaining control, than market value of the net assets acquired measured in
accordance with ASC 805.

4.100 Goodwill is a non-identifiable asset and cannot be measured separately. Its value is
derived from the consideration transferred and the value of net assets acquired90.

4.101 Goodwill
is the sum of:
a)       purchase consideration
b)       non-controlling interests
c)       fair value of the interests in acquiree, owned by the acquirer, in case of business
         combinations effected in stages.
less:
a) the value of net assets measured in accordance with under ASC 805

4.102 In a reverse situation, i.e. when the purchase consideration is lower than the value of
the net assets acquired, negative goodwill is created and the acquirer will recognize a profit
on the combination.

4.103 If the acquirer does not transfer purchase consideration, the acquirer is required to
apply valuation techniques to determine the value of the shares in the acquiree. Then the
value of the shares of the acquiree is the price of the acquisition.



Gain on business combination

4.104 If the combination results in negative goodwill a bargain purchase occurred91. In
accordance with ASC 805, such bargain purchase should be recognized directly in the profit
and loss statement as a one-off gain on business combination at the combination date.

4.105 This profit is not an extraordinary profit and should be recognized as profit from
continuing operations.

4.106 Given the complexity of the calculation of goodwill, the FASB recommends the use of
a control protocol if negative goodwill arises. Before the negative goodwill is recognized in
the books, the management is obligated to:
        Verify the completeness of acquired identifiable tangible assets, intangible assets and
         liabilities. Identified errors must be corrected before the gain is recognized.

        Verify the method of measurement of acquired assets and liabilities to make sure that
         the measurement method takes into account all information available at the acquisition
         date on:
         a)    identified assets and assumed liabilities,
         b)    the purchase price,
         c)    non-controlling interests,
         d)    shares which the acquirer had in the acquiree before the combination.



The measurement period

4.107 Usually, the management of the acquirer does not possess all the necessary information
needed to measure acquired assets and liabilities at the combination date, or even at the date
of first annual financial statement following the combination92.

4.108 If the measurement has not been completed before the preparation of the first annual
financial statement, the acquirer is obligated to recognize estimated values of assets and
liabilities in its financial statement.

4.109 ASC 805 provides the possibility to make retrospective adjustments to those estimated
values. Such adjustments result from the circumstances that existed at combination date, but
that the board was not aware of at the time of preparing the estimates.

4.110 In assessing whether new information should affect the reported estimates,
management of the acquiree should consider all possible circumstances. The most important
thing is to determine whether this information applies to facts and circumstances that existed
at the time of acquisition or relate to events that took place after that date. Therefore, it will
be important to determine:
a)       the date on which the board received additional information,
b)       whether it is possible to identify the reasons for which this new information affects the
         estimates.

4.111 In addition to these adjustments to recognized estimate values, the acquirer is allowed
to recognize assets and liabilities, which were mistakenly omitted on the date of
acquisition. During the measurement period, the assets and liabilities should be valued
retrospectively.

4.112 In determining the adjustments to the estimated values of balance sheet items,
relationships between assets and liabilities should be analyzed. For example, new information

     ASC 805-20-25-19.


                                                                                               76
will be revealed about indemnified liability; this new value of the liability could affect the
indemnification asset. Thus, due to change in value of the liability, value of indemnification
asset will change as well.

4.113 Changes in fair value of assets and liabilities may affect the temporary differences,
which constitute the basis for calculation of deferred tax assets or provisions.

4.114 Adjustments to the estimates are entered into the accounting records retrospectively,
i.e. as if they were recognized on combination date. This rule results in adjustments to
comparative data, such as depreciation or changes in equity.

4.115 Measurement period ends on the date on which the acquirer receives all the
information regarding the facts and circumstances that existed at the combination date or
learns that he will not be able to get any other information in relation to those that he already
has, however no later than one year from combination date.

4.116 After the end of the measurement period, adjustments to previously recognized items
arising from a business combination may be treated as correction of errors in accordance with
Accounting Standard Codification 250 "Accounting changes and error corrections."



Business combinations effected in stages

4.117 Business combination achieved in stages is a combination, in which the acquirer holds
interests in the acquiree prior to obtaining control over it93.

4.118 On the day of combination, the acquirer measures its interest in the acquiree at fair
value. Gain or loss on the measurement shall be recognized in the statement of
comprehensive income.

4.119 If the acquirer has previously recognized changes in carrying value of interests in the
acquiree directly in the statement of other comprehensive income, because e.g. they were
designated as assets available for sale, the amount of such change should be re-classified and
recognized in calculation of profit or loss from revaluation as of acquisition date.



Reverse acquisitions

4.120 Reverse acquisition occurs when the entity which from the accounting perspective is
the acquirer is the entity that from the perspective of commercial law is the acquiree.

4.121 In the combined financial statement, assets and liabilities of the legal acquiree are
measured at carrying value as of the day preceding the combination date and combined with
assets and liabilities of the legal acquirer measured in accordance with ASC 805.

4.122 Retained earnings of the legal acquiree are recognized as retained earnings in the
combined financial statements.

4.123 Value of the share capital in the combined financial statement is determined based on
the sum of the share capital of the legal acquiree at the date preceding the combination date
and the fair value of the purchase consideration.



Business combination under common control

4.124 Business combinations accounted for by the pooling of interests was very popular from
1950 to about 2000. Pooling of interests has been developed for combinations of similar size
entities with similar activities for which it was difficult to determine which entity is the
acquirer, as all or most of the shares in the entity acquiring the assets and assuming liabilities
were in hands of the shareholders of the merging companies. With the passing of time, rigid
rules that restricted the application of pooling of interests had been loosened. As a result use
of the pooling of interests has become possible also in a situation where the merging
companies were of different sizes and the identification of the acquiring entity was possible 94.

4.125 The main motivation for the use of the pooling of interests method was to hide the real
cost of the combination. No fair value measurement and the lack of goodwill in case of
applying the pooling of interests result in the fact, that the true costs of the investment are
not recognized either as an asset or as part of the profit and loss account95.

4.126 Accordingly, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), with effect from 20 June
2001 ruled out the possibility of applying pooling of interests method in a business
combination. Since then, all business combinations should be accounted for using the
acquisition method. To justify the change in the method of accounting for business
combinations, members of the board admitted that the use of the pooling of interests is
appropriate only in cases where the combining entities are of the same size and there is no
possibility to identify an acquirer. In practice, this happens very rarely. Leaving the pooling of
interests as an alternative to the acquisition method in a situation where its application occurs
very rarely would be impractical. In addition it creates the alternative which may be
intentionally misused96.

4.127 Regulations in force until 20 June 2001 had authorized the use of the pooling of
interests method if 12 criteria were met. However, most of the combinations were designed
in such a way as to allow use of pooling of interests. Under the current ASC 805, all business
combinations except for non for profit entities and entities under common control should be
accounted for using the acquisition method.

4.128 Business Combinations, which have common ownership is not considered a business
combination, because there is no transfer of control at the level of ownership.

4.129 Consequently, this type of connection is not regulated in ASC 805.

4.130 Similar to international accounting standards, U.S. regulations do not specify how
combinations of businesses under common control should be accounted for. According to
analyzed literature, business combination under common control should be accounted for
using predecessor accounting method or push down accounting method.

4.131 In the combined financial statement the acquirer recognizes the share of non-
controlling interests in equity of the acquiree as of the day preceding combination date.

between specific international accounting standards and U.S. standards.



Main differences between IFRS 3 and standards applicable in the
UK

5.2 Accounting for business combinations is described in Financial Reporting Standard 6
"Acquisitions and mergers" (FRS 6). Standard was established in 1994 and its significant
modification occurred in 2009. Following there are the major differences between FRS 6 and
IFRS 3.

5.3 The provisions of the UK GAAP are currently being modified. Financial Reporting Council,
which is responsible for creating legislation in scope of accounting, has developed a Financial
Reporting Standard 102 "Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Ireland" (FRS
102). This standard replaces all previous standards. It is based on the provisions contained in
International Accounting Standards for small and medium-sized enterprises. However, the
standard text in the section on business combinations is not fully consistent with IFRS 3.
Mandatory application of FRS 102 starts from 1 January 2015, however early application of
its provisions is possible.



German accounting standards

5.4 In 2009, the German parliament adopted amendments for the accounting law. The aim of
the reform was to simplify accounting rules and to bring them into alignment with
international accounting standards. The table below presents the main differences between
the amended provisions of German standards and international accounting standards in
scope of business combinations.

 6. APPLICATION OF ACQUISITION METHOD, POOLING OF
INTERESTS AND PREDECESSOR ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS
                   COMBINATIONS


Introduction

6.1 In this chapter, a practical example of accounting for a business combination is presented.
In order to be able to present all the accounting methods for business combination,
combining entities are under common control.

6.2 Profit or loss is combined in the same way in each method. It is based on the elimination
of mutual transactions from the combined financial statement. Such elimination is based on
assumption, that a company cannot make a profit from transacting with itself.

6.3 What is different for each method is the consolidation of balance sheet. Therefore, the
author of the study restricted the presentation of each method to consolidation of assets,
liabilities and equity.


                                             Example 48
 Company A and Company B belong to the same capital group. Company A owns 100% of
 shares in B, which was acquired two years ago. Company C has a 100% shares in the
 company A. Company C prepares consolidated financial statements. Company A uses the
 exemption for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Company A took
 over the assets of company B on 31 December 2013. Following the combination, Company
 B ceases to exist. Company A and B did not trade with each other.

6.5 Accounting for a business combination by acquisition method involves determination of
goodwill. Goodwill is defined as the difference between the purchase consideration and the
net assets acquired at fair value on the acquisition day. The value of the net assets measured
at fair value on the combination date is PLN 2,364,475.49 (PLN 1,280,502.56 + PLN
3,075,781.18 + PLN 8,487.27 + PLN 1,983,320.98). When applying the acquisition method for
business combinations under common control, purchase consideration is the historical price
paid for shares in B. Therefore, purchase consideration will be the carrying value of the shares
presented in the statement of A before the merger.

6.6 Goodwill that company A recognizes in its accounting books measured by the acquisition
method amounts to PLN 486,202.51.

6.7 Company A, in accounting for the combination, recognizes individual elements of the
acquired business (assets and liabilities) to the account Shares and interests in subsidiaries,
on which value of investment is recorded. As a result, company A should make the following
entries in its accounting books:

Predecessor Accounting

6.16 Predecessor accounting method can be used in situations when the combining entities
are under common control. The acquirer, which accounts for the combination using
predecessor accounting does not measure assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying
values of the acquirer are combined with the values of the acquiree derived from the
consolidated financial statements of the parent company of the capital group. If more than
two companies prepare consolidated financial statements, data should be derived from the
consolidated financial statements prepared by the ultimate parent company.

6.17 The acquirer does not calculate goodwill. However, application of predecessor
accounting method involves recognition of goodwill in the books of the acquirer. Value of
goodwill is imported from consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent company,
attributed to the acquiree.

6.18 Under the predecessor accounting there are two possible ways for consolidation of
financial result. The acquirer may include in its accounts the financial result for the entire
financial year, even though the combination took place during the financial year. In such a
situation, the comparative figures should be adjusted so as to take into account the acquiree’s
data for the previous year. Alternatively, the company recognizes the acquiree’s result in its
financial statements and books of accounts prospectively, i.e. from the combination date. In
such a situation, there is no need for adjustment of comparative data.

6.19 When accounting for a business combination by predecessor accounting method, data
from consolidated financial statements should be used.

Comparison of methods applied

6.24 Acquisition method applied to business combinations results in assets and liabilities
recognized at fair value on combination date. Thus depreciation and amortization in the
combined financial statement is calculated based on fair value of all identifiable net assets.
This method requires recognition of goodwill and its depreciation and/or testing against
impairment. Applying this method to account for business combinations under common
control results in measurement performed at combination date rather than the date of
obtaining control. In case of acquisition method applied for business combinations under
common control, the main difficulty lies in determining the moment of taking control. In such
transactions, the acquirer obtains control during the period preceding the combination date.

6.25 Pooling of interests applies only to accounting for business combinations under common
control. Depreciation in the financial statements is calculated based on the book value of the
acquired assets. No goodwill is recognized. This means that the combined financial
statements prepared after combination date include depreciation charges lower than in case
of the acquisition method. Consequently, in case pooling of interest method is used, profit
and loss statement does not reflect the true cost of the business combination. The excess of
the costs of obtaining of control over assets acquired is recognized directly in equity.

6.26 If predecessor accounting method is applied, depreciation is calculated based on the
values attributed to acquiree’s assets, derived from consolidated financial statements of the
ultimate parent. These assets were measured at fair value as of the day of the group assuming
control. This means that profit and loss recognizes cost of combination as of the day control
over acquired assets was assumed, rather than combination date.

6.27 Two alternative approaches can be applied under the predecessor accounting method:
a)   prospective approach - the combined financial statement should take into account
     acquiree’s data from the combination date onwards,
b)   retrospective approach - the combined financial statement should include the data of
     the acquiree for the entire reporting period in which business combination took place;
     use of this method requires restatement of comparatives as if the merger occurred in
     the previous period.

                             7. FRESH START ACCOUNTING


Introduction

7.1 Fresh start accounting is provided in Accounting Standard Codification 852
"Reorganization". It regulates accounting principles to be followed by companies after
reorganization. The underlying assumption of this method is that after bankruptcy procedure
is completed, a new company is created – a successor of the restructured company – and this
new company applies the fresh start principles99.

7.2 Pursuant to accounting regulations, a new company is formed, whose assets should be
measured separately. This method is similar to acquisition method applied for business
combinations. Carrying amount of the assets and liabilities of the company after the
reorganization is similar to purchase consideration, is determined in a business combination
accounted for using acquisition method.

7.3 Method of fresh start accounting may be applied by companies that prepare their financial
statements in accordance with U.S. accounting standards. International accounting standards
do not provide for such a possibility.



The criteria for the application of fresh start accounting

7.4 In order to apply the fresh start accounting method, the entity needs to meet certain
criteria.
      Reorganization value of the new company immediately prior to court approval for the
       reorganization plan should be lower than total value of postpetition liabilities and allowed
       claims.
      Immediately prior to court approval for the reorganization plan, holders of voting rights
       will have less than 50 % of voting rights in the new company100.

7.5 U.S. law requires that a reorganization plan is submitted to the court for approval. Only
after receiving such approval, entities may apply reorganization principles.

7.6 Reorganization value of an entity is determined in accordance with U.S. reorganization
law. This is an approximation of fair value of the entity, excluding liabilities. It is determined
in order to determine the price at which the entity could be sold after completion of the
reorganization process. The value is usually calculated using discounted cash flows.

Application of fresh start accounting

7.7 An entity applying fresh start accounting method should adjust its financial statement
from the day preceding the date of approval of the reorganization plan by the amount of
impact of reorganization plan on liabilities and equity as well as effects of application of fresh
start accounting.


                                             Example 49
  Company A is in process of reorganization. Reorganization plan was approved by the
  court. The value of liabilities subject to redemption is PLN 3,100,000. Reorganization
  value, i.e. value of the company excluding liabilities, is PLN 4,000,000 and has been
  confirmed by the court. The value of the company after reorganization amounts to PLN
  2,600,000. How should fresh start accounting method be applied to reorganization of
  company A?

  Company A is in process of reorganization, therefore, ongoing concern is at risk. In such
  a situation, the company should present all assets and liabilities as short-term.

        8. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS OF NOT-FOR-PROFIT
                        COMPANIES


Introduction

8.1 The objective of private sector entities is to earn profits. However some entities have been
created for other purposes. Their goal is to provide goods and services to the public but they
are not profit-oriented. Therefore, the position of interest holders in such entities might be
different. Not for profit entities might include public sector entities or other organizations.

8.2 Not for profit entities do not provide return in form of profit to interest holders.

8.3 Not for profit entities are obligated to apply generally accepted accounting principles. The
basis for keeping books is the Act on accounting. In case of public sector entities, issues
related to accounting are also regulated by other legislation, such as the Ordinance on specific
principles of accounting in public finance sector entities, as well as Act on public finance.

8.4 Not for profit entities may be combined. This gives rise to certain consequences arising
from the provisions of the Act on accounting.

8.5 Since the provisions of the Act on accounting do not regulate non-profit combinations,
other rules should be applied in order to comply with the economic nature of the transaction.

8.6 International accounting standards do not regulate combinations of not for profit entities
in a manner different from other entities. Given the fact that the position of the owners of
such entities is different than in profit oriented entities, application of rules governing
accounting for profit oriented entities will not always be consistent with economic nature of
the transaction.

8.7 US GAAP refers in detail to business combinations of nonprofit entities.



Business combinations according to Accounting Standard
Codification 958 "Not-for-profit entities"

8.8 Combinations of private sector always are commercial in nature. Combinations of non-
profit organizations in many cases are not pursued with the desire to make a profit.



8.9 In a business combination of not for profit entities, U.S. regulations distinguish between
two types of transactions: mergers and acquisitions.


                                                                                            111
8.10 Combination of non-profit is a transaction or other event in which the governing bodies
of two or more units give control over these units to create a new non-profit entity.


                                          Example 50
  The governing bodies of the Museum of City X and the Museum of City Y decided to merge
  their operations. The merger created the Museum of District X. The director of the
  Museum of District X is a person who was not a member of the managing body of any of
  the merging museums.

  This type of combination must be accounted for by pooling of interests. Following the
  merger, the governing bodies of the merging museums ceased to exercise control over
  the newly established cultural institution.



8.11 Acquisition by a non-profit entity is defined as a transaction or other event in which
a non-profit acquirer obtains control over one or more non-profit activities or businesses, and
at initial recognition recognizes in its financial statement acquired assets and liabilities.


                                          Example 51
  Public hospital in the town of X combines its operations with the public hospital in the
  town Y. As a result of merger, the hospital in X ceases to exist. Directors of the hospital in
  town X were incorporated into the governing body in hospital of town Y. Following the
  merger, the managing body of the hospital Y consists of directors of hospitals X and Y.

  This type of connection is an acquisition. The existing managing authorities did not
  surrender control over the combining entities - the managing hospital Y took control of
  the hospital X. It is therefore necessary to identify the acquirer and apply the acquisition
  method of accounting for this type of combination.



8.12 In the case of a business combination of nonprofit entities US GAAP provides for
a carryover method, which is similar to a pooling of interests. Using the pooling of interests
method, we combine the assets and liabilities as if the merger occurred at the beginning of
the financial year and adjust the comparatives. Applying the carryover method the assets and
liabilities of the merging entities are combined since the combination date, the comparatives
are not adjusted.

8.13 If the entity is a party to acquisition, acquirer should be identified and acquisition method
applied.




                                                                                              112
8.14 Both the acquisition method and the pooling of interests method are presented in
Chapter 6 of this report.

8.15 In case of applying the acquisition method for business combination of non-profit
entities, goodwill or negative goodwill may arise. The acquirer recognizes goodwill if the
acquiree’s activity is supported mainly by costs and returns associated with the investment.
In case the opposite is true, the non-profit does not recognize the goodwill but the expense
in the income statement. Negative goodwill is recognized directly in the income statement.




                                                                                        113

9. PROPOSALS FOR CHANGES IN THE EXISTING PROVISIONS
              OF ACT ON ACCOUNTING


9.1 Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on
the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of
certain types of undertakings, distinguishes between entities applying accounting rules for
microunits, small units, medium units and large entities. This division takes place, due to their
income, total assets and number of employees.



Micro entities

9.2 According to the author of this publication business combinations between micro entities
may be accounted for applying simplified rules. Possibility of applying pooling of interests
method for micro entities should be considered. Simplified rules for business combinations
are allowed by the Directive.



Small and medium entities

9.3. In designing the provisions of the Act on accounting, one must take into consideration
the cost of applying regulations, as borne especially by small and medium sized entities. On
the other hand, it should be remembered that the role of small and medium enterprises in
the economy is growing and therefore so does the importance of financial information
presented by those entities in their financial statements. Increased importance of small and
medium entities is exemplified by e.g. creation of NewConnect stock market in 2007. Financial
statements are the basic source of information about companies listed on that market. Small
and medium companies listed on NewConnect market are obligated to prepare and publish
their financial statements, both unit and consolidated, in accordance with the Act on
accounting (Polish GAAP). This means, that the safety of investors depends largely on
reliability of national accounting regulations. It should be remembered, that quality of
information contained in the financial statements, while it does not determine the choices
made by investors, nonetheless does influence their decisions. When designing amendments
to the Act on accounting, facilitating solutions for SMEs should be kept in mind, remembering
however, that shares of such entities might be traded on the regulated market. Does that
mean that provisions in scope of scope of business combinations should be the same as IFRS
rules applied by large entities? I believe not, however such provisions should obligate the
medium and small entities to present economic impacts of transactions. Therefore, any
provisions not capable of meeting this overriding principle of accounting should be removed


                                                                                             115
from the Act and guidelines should be provided for application of new solutions in the
national accounting standards. Therefore, it would seem that small and medium companies
would be obligated to increase their efforts in presenting the economic nature of
combinations, but a national accounting standard in this scope could effectively mitigate costs
related to increased scope of presentation.

9.4 Proposed amendments to provisions in scope of business combinations may involve the
need to modify other areas of accounting as well. The scope of this study does not envisage
identification of such areas.



Recommendations and justification hereof

9.5 Recommendations were prepared based on provisions of the Act of 29 September 1994
on accounting (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2013, item 330 as subsequently
amended) and provisions of the Directive. However, it should be noted, that the Directive
says very little about the issue of business combinations. Current provisions, which were
described in the recommendations, do not raise any doubts with me. In some situations,
I recommend maintaining existing regulations, e.g. those pertaining to cost of combinations.
In such cases I present a justification anyway, since I had certain doubts with respect to these
areas and I believe the readers of this study could have similar doubts.

9.6 Amendment introducing a definition of business combination into the Act.

  Current provision                            Recommended provision
 No definition.         Art. 3 par. 1. A business combination is a transaction or other event
                        through which an acquiring entity takes over control over one or
                        more undertakings. Transactions sometimes referred to as “true
                        mergers” or “merger of equals” also constitute business
                        combinations.
                                   Justification for amendment
 Act on accounting uses the term “business combination” but does not provide a definition
 for it. As a result of lack of statutory definition of business combinations, pursuant to art.
 10 par. 3 of the Act on accounting, the entities may (and in practice, should) refer to the
 provisions of the National Accounting Standard. Absence of a national standard in scope of
 business combinations results in entities applying the accounting law referring to
 international regulations.

 Proposed definition of business combinations was taken from International Financial
 Reporting Standard 3 "Business Combinations". In the opinion of the author of this study,
 importing the definition of business combination from the international standards will
 facilitate application of accounting law and thus reduce the cost of its application. First,


                                                                                            116
 entities applying the national regulations in scope of business combinations would not be
 forced to familiarize themselves with international regulations. Both the content and
 structure of those standards may significantly increase time expenditure, and thus costs,
 related to accounting for the combination. In the current legal system, there is a dynamic
 connection between national accounting law and international standards. As a result,
 frequent modifications of international standards have an impact on national accounting
 law. Therefore, it should be noted, that introducing a definition of business combinations
 into the national accounting law would change this relation from dynamic to static.

 Lack of obligation to follow changes in international regulations reduces cost of operations
 by, for example, reducing the amount of training in this scope. Providing a definition for the
 term “business combinations” would dispel any doubts with respect to application of
 combinations accounting also by companies which are not commercial law companies, e.g.
 by natural persons.

 Regardless of accounting law, business combinations are regulated by commercial law. It
 should be noted, that provisions of the commercial code are separate from accounting law.
 I believe this separation should be maintained, for reasons including the scope of entities
 covered by Act on accounting and Code of commercial companies respectively. Applying
 regulations of the Code of commercial companies in the accounting law would be, in the
 opinion of the author, not beneficial for another reason as well. Namely, in accounting law
 economic events are interpreted based on the principle of economic substance prevailing
 over legal format. Based on commercial law, such an interpretation is not always applicable.

9.7 Amendment introducing the definition of a business.

              Current provision                        Recommended provision
 Art. 3 par. 1. No provision.               Art. 3 par. 1. A business is an integrated set of
                                            activities and assets that is capable of being
                                            operated and managed for the purpose of
                                            providing a return in form of dividends, lower
                                            costs or other economic benefits directly to
                                            investors or other owners, members or
                                            participants.

 part of another entity, including the case
 of a demerger.
                                  Justification for amendment
 Act on accounting uses the term “organized part of another entity". This term is not defined
 by the Act on accounting. It is also not defined in other branches of the law. Regulations of
 tax law do define an organized part of an enterprise, however this definition gives rise to


                                                                                            117
 many doubts and disputes. For example, there could be doubts as to whether an
 autonomous branch without a lease agreement can be considered an organized part of an
 enterprise.

 In practice, the term “organized part of another entity” is considered to be the same as the
 definition of an organized part of an enterprise. Therefore, if based on tax law the object of
 a transaction meets a definition of an organized part of an enterprise, it is accounted for in
 accordance with the principles for business combinations as set forth in the Act on
 accounting. I believe such an approach is not correct. Provisions of the accounting law are
 separate from the provisions of tax law. Therefore, accounting principles for business
 combinations should be separated from the definition of an organized part of an enterprise.
 It can be done by defining business combinations based on a business, and then defining
 the notion of a business. How would such a change impact the situation of micro, small and
 medium enterprises? It may increase the cost of application of accounting law. Those
 would, first and foremost, be related to the need to apply the acquisition method for
 a larger number of transactions, so more frequent determination of fair value than is the
 case now. However, thanks to this change, reliability of financial statements would
 increase, which would have a positive impact on improved situation of users of such
 statements. As a result, these costs will be compensated by increased useful value of
 financial statements.


9.8 Amendment introducing definitions of acquirer and acquiree.

 Current provision                        Recommended provision
 No provision.     Art. 3 par. 1. Acquirer is the entity which assumes control over
                   acquiree.
                   Art. 3 par. 1. Acquiree is a business or units over which the acquirer
                   assumes control as a result of business combination.
                               Justification for amendment
 Act on accounting uses the term “acquirer”, however it does not define the term. Since the
 definition of business combinations is taken from IFRS 3, definition of terms has also been
 taken from international regulations. Defining the acquirer and acquiree makes it easier to
 apply accounting law, for example in context of reverse combinations.


9.9 Amendment introducing the definition of the date of combination.

                      Current provision                      Recommended provision

                                Justification for amendment
 Act on accounting makes the date of combination dependent on the day on which the
 combination is registered in the relevant court register. As a consequence, acquiree
 recognizes the acquiree’s assets and liabilities in its balance sheet not at the moment of
 transferring control, but at the moment of performing the administrative action. The
 moment of initial recognition of the combination is not in line with the general principle
 stemming from initial recognition of assets and liabilities in other types of transactions. For
 example, initial recognition of working assets stemming from a purchase transaction is
 accounted for on the day, on which the seller:
 a)   transferred to the buyer significant risks resulting from ownership rights of the
      resource;
 b)   ceases to be permanently engaged in managing the resources sold to the extent to
      which such a function is performed with respect to resources to which one holds
      ownership rights; and ceases to exert effective control over said resource.

 Within the framework of a combination transaction, the acquirer company also purchases
 assists. However, the moment of their initial recognition in the books is dependent on and
 administrative action, rather than the agreement between the parties. From the
 perspective of purchasing individual assets, a combination is similar to a purchase
 transaction. I believe accounting for a combination transaction should be effected on the
 day of transfer of control, not on the day the combination is registered. Otherwise, assets
 which are controlled by the entity and liabilities assumed by the entity are not represented
 in the combined financial statements. Such a presentation might have an impact on
 reliability of the financial statement.

                                  Justification for amendment
 Act on accounting only applies regulations pertaining to business combinations only to
 commercial companies. Although in my opinion application of overriding accounting
 principle in the given situation should lead other entities to apply the provisions of chapter
 4a, in practice such entities may decide, that since the law explicitly excludes from its scope
 all entities other than commercial companies, this means such entities should not apply the
 provisions of chapter 4a. I believe, that including in the scope of this chapter of all the
 entities applying the Act on accounting would make application of the law easier. In
 particular, this holds true for a situation in which the smallest entities will be able to apply
 simplified principles of accounting by applying the pooling of interests method. Moreover,
 obligating only some of the entities to apply the business combinations provisions in case
 of acquisition does have an impact on their competitiveness. For example, civil law
 partnerships and sole proprietorships in such a situation may account for combinations in
 the same way as for purchase of a group of assets. This reduces cost of doing business and
 thus increases competitiveness. I believe that simplification of application of accounting
 regulations should be introduced based on size criterion rather than form of business
 activity.

                               Justification for amendment
Current definition of goodwill does not include an obligation to identify and separately
present assets assumed as a result of combination. As a result, all assets not included on
the balance sheet of the acquiree, such as e.g. client lists, increase goodwill. I believe this
type of measurement of goodwill does not ensure reliable presentation of the financial
situation of the acquirer. Change of the definition is intended to introduce an obligation of
separate recognition and presentation also of those assets, which are not recognized in the
balance sheet of the acquiree, have an impact on financial assessment of the acquirer and
can be practicably identified as separate. I do believe, that cost of separate presentation
and measurement of assets stemming from re-acquired rights or assets from assumed
leasing contracts in most cases would exceed the benefit of such presentation. Therefore,
definition of goodwill provided in IFRS 3 should not be copied. It would result in a correct
conviction that all assets described in IFRS 3 should be subject to separate presentation.
The phrase “can be practicably identified” is related to ease, practicability and is one of the
features distinguishing the definition in the Act from definition included in IFRS 3.
Separation of significant identified assets, which as of the day of combination were not
recognized in acquiree’s balance sheet will include the burdens on entities applying the Act.
However, the increase in burden will be offset by increased usefulness of financial
statements. Therefore I believe it is justified.

9.12 Amendment eliminating the obligation to depreciate goodwill and introducing the
obligation of testing for impairment.

                                Justification for amendment
Accounting law defines depreciation as s systematic and planned distribution of value of
a fixed asset or intangible/legal asset over the period of economic life of the asset.
Considering the methods for measuring goodwill as of the balance sheet date, one should
analyze what goodwill is and compare it to fixed assets and other intangible and legal
assets. In accordance with domestic accounting law, intangible and legal assets are property
rights acquired by the entity, included in fixed assets, with economic use and expected
economic useful life period longer than one year, intended for the entity’s own use. Fixed
assets are fixed tangible assets and equivalent, with expected economic useful life period


                                                                                            121
 longer than one year, complete, suitable for use and intended for entity’s own use.
 Intangible and legal assets, as well as fixed assets (with some exceptions) are measured as
 of balance sheet date, reducing their initial value by depreciation write-offs. One common
 feature of intangible and legal assets and fixed assets subject to depreciation is the
 possibility of defining their economic useful life period.

 It should be pointed out here, that there are certain fixed assets which are not subject to
 depreciation. For example, land is not subject to depreciation as it is not possible to define
 its economic useful life period. Moreover, market value of land frequently increases over
 time. Therefore, valuation of land based on depreciation would not reflect its actual use,
 and thus would bring book value further from real value. Definition of goodwill shows, that
 it is an asset representing future economic benefits, arising from assets obtained within the
 framework of business combination, such as were not individually identified or separately
 recognized. Goodwill is created, when net assets at fair value are lower than purchase price.
 Thus, purchase consideration reflects the company’s reputation, its employees, business
 contacts etc. Such assets do not have economic useful life. As a result, goodwill does not
 have economic useful life. Since it is not possible to determine economic useful life of the
 given asset, it’s not possible to determine its depreciation rate. Another argument in favor
 of rejecting measurement as of balance sheet date based on depreciation is the fact that
 we are not able to predict, how goodwill is going to change in the future. As in case of land,
 the company’s goodwill may increase in value with time.

 In my opinion, recommended changes may increase the burdens related to application of
 accounting law for those entities which despite legal requirement so far did not test
 goodwill for impairment. Depreciation write-offs have reduced the importance of such
 testing. As a result of recommended changes, goodwill may be transferred to profit and loss
 statement only in case of impairment. It is beyond doubt, that entities and auditors auditing
 their financial statements will have to analyze possibility of impairment with greater
 attention.

 periods, the related goodwill shall be recognized in a manner
 specified in Paragraph 11.
                                 Justification for amendment
 Current principles envisage gradual, spread over time accounting for negative goodwill in
 profit and loss. This accounting is effected via other operating income, so it has an impact
 on operating result of the acquirer. Period, over which goodwill is accounted for depends
 on useful economic life of other acquired assets. This method of accounting for negative
 goodwill indicates, that it can only arise in case of incorrect fair value measurement of
 acquired assets and constitutes protection for users of financial statements from errors
 committed by acquirers. This kind of accounting omits business reasons for existence of
 negative goodwill, such as negotiating position of the acquirer being stronger than that of
 the acquiree. For example, the acquirer takes advantage of (an opportunity) a difficult
 situation of the acquiree. Thanks to this advantage, the acquirer achieves a gain from
 bargain purchase. The gain is a one-off, achieved during negotiations.

 As per current regulations, this one-off gain is amortized to profit and loss in a long time
 horizon. From the perspective of users of financial statements, evaluation of financial
 standing of the company is also performed over a long time period. This means, that for
 such a user long-term gains are more valuable than one-offs, even if the one-off gain is
 relatively high. Obligation of spreading one-off gains over a long period may result in
 erroneous decisions being made based on financial statements.

 In proposing new regulations in scope of accounting for negative goodwill, nature of errors
 in measurement of assets needs to be taken into consideration. First of all, it should be
 analyzed whether such errors could be intentional or do they stem from a mistake. Negative

101
   Verification referred to in the original provision should be understood very broadly. It involves inspection of
the entire process which leads to gain from bargain purchase. Inspecteed aspects must include measurement of
assets, but also technical verification of goodwill calculation, etc. However, obligation to use external contractors
should not be imposed. Entities may fulfill the verification obligatoin using their own resources.


                                                                                                                123
 goodwill means that fair value of acquired net assets is higher than fair value of purchase
 consideration. Therefore, companies which aim to achieve gains from bargain purchase
 shall aim to overestimate the value of net assets. Overestimated net assets mean that
 future long term operating costs will be higher, due to e.g. higher depreciation write-offs.
 Since evaluation of companies is performed in a long time horizon, the companies as
 a principle would not aim to overestimate the value of assets. They are interested in
 keeping costs as low as possible in the long time horizon. This means that in most cases
 overestimation of value of assets would not be intentional, but rather result from a mistake.
 If errors are not intentional, application of control procedures would be sufficient. Such
 control procedures should be described in national accounting standard pertaining to
 business combinations.

 Additionally, when analyzing existing regulations it should be noted that they involve
 creation of a complicated algorithm and estimation of future losses. This makes application
 more difficult. Proposed solution does not have those characteristics. In my opinion
 proposed changes will not increase burdens related to application of accounting law.

9.14 Clarification of reasons justifying maintaining current regulations in scope of accounting
for costs involved in a business combination transaction.

                      Current provision                          Recommended provision

 up costs incurred during the formation of a new joint stock
 company or costs related to share capital increase incurred for
 the purpose of a business combination reduce the
 supplementary capital of the acquirer or a newly-formed
 company to the amount of a share premium, whereas the
 remaining amount is recognized as financial costs.
                                  Justification for amendment
 Provisions of International Accounting Standards as well as American GAAP obligate the
 acquirer to account for costs related to combination directly into profit and loss. Such costs
 typically include costs of legal, accounting and tax consulting, as well as costs involved in
 finding the business. They are inextricably linked with the combination transaction. In
 incurring costs involved in business combination, the acquirer expects that in future they
 would result in economic benefits stemming from future profits generated by the combined
 businesses. Thus, definition of an asset is met. However, in the opinion of authors of IFRS
 3, this cost should be accounted as a one-off in the profit and loss, as of the date it is
 incurred. It should not be recognized in the balance sheet as an asset, since:
 a)   seller of the business sells it at a market price, so at fair value, so increasing the
      purchase consideration by value of costs directly related to the combination results in


                                                                                            124
       the acquired business being measured above fair value in the company’s balance
       sheet;
 b)    cost of additional services increases goodwill.

                                 Analysis of the first argument
 Acquirer and acquiree are two different entities, with different resources and skills. As the
 acquirer effects the investment, it evaluates it for financial feasibility. Financial feasibility
 analysis includes all expenditures related to combination, including those on legal, and
 accounting consulting etc. What has market value from the perspective of the acquirer
 might not be a value from the perspective of the seller. Therefore, it would be difficult to
 deny the acquirer the right to determine that fair value of the acquired business is higher
 than just the purchase consideration.

                               Analysis of the second argument
 Expenditures incurred within the framework of business combination are not a separate
 asset, they are related to every asset acquired, including goodwill. Relating consulting
 expenditures exclusively to goodwill is indeed a certain simplification. I believe that such
 a simplification is acceptable, as every acquirer is obligated to conduct impairment testing
 as of each balance sheet date. If goodwill or any other acquired asset would show value
 above recoverable amount, such surplus would be removed from the balance sheet and
 presented in profit and loss as a write down.

 Possibility of recognizing combination costs as one-off in the profit and loss should also be
 confronted with principles of capitalization of costs related to purchase of individual assets,
 or groups of assets, which do not constitute a business. Costs related to purchase of such
 assets increase the value of the asset. Different recognition of costs related to business
 combination would thus constitute an exception from definition of purchase price, which
 in turn could lead to attempts to state that the subject of acquisition is not in fact a business.

                                Justification for amendment
Pooling of interests method consists of adding up items of acquired assets and liabilities as
per their book value and recognizing the difference between combination price and value
of those assets directly in equity. This method can be used only if combined entities are
under common control. The main disadvantage of this method is that when it is applied,
profit and loss statement for periods after combination represents the cost as lower than
cost derived from fair value of acquired assets. It should be pointed out, that no goodwill is
created when pooling of interests method is applied. As a result, it can be used to conceal
the actual cost of investment and transferring goodwill directly into equity, bypassing profit
and loss.

In case of entitles under common control application of acquisition method does not always
reflect the economics of the transaction. Such a situation occurs when a significant period
of time elapses between the moment of purchasing the interests and the day of
combination. The method consisting of accounting for the combination based on financial
data derived from a consolidated financial statement of a higher tier parent company
eliminates this problem. Thanks to this, the combined financial statements do represent
goodwill measured as of the day of combination and potential impairment is recognized in
profit and loss, in operating costs.

Provisions of the amended Directive enable member states to apply the pooling of interests
method. In accordance with art. 25 of the Directive, the member state may allow or require
that book values of shares or interests included in equity of entity subject to consolidation
were offset only in part which represents their proportion in the equity, on condition that
the entities being combined are ultimately controlled by the same entity both before and
after combination, and the control is not of temporary nature. Keeping in mind the fact,
that many companies use the pooling of interests method to eliminate actual costs involved
in previous investment from the combined financial statements, application of pooling of
interests method should be restricted to micro entities only. I believe that the obligation to
measure acquired net assets to fair value in case of micro entities will result in significant

burdens, which in context of limited information presented in the financial statements and
limited number of users of such financial statements would be unjustifiable. Therefore, I
believe that allowing accounting for combinations between micro entities by pooling of
interests method should be considered, regardless of whether the entities combined are
under common control or not.

In analyzing the changes in this scope, I have considered excluding regulations pertaining to
combination of entities under common control from the scope of the Act. Situation would
be similar to that in IFRS 3. It should be noted, that many combinations are conducted within
capital groups. I do believe that determining the method of accounting for such
combinations directly in the law is a solution actually facilitating application of the law.

Obviously, the recommended provision does not solve all the problems related to
combination of businesses under common control. It seems that a national accounting
standard partially devoted to this issue is necessary.

9.16 Amendment introducing new provisions in scope of the moment for measurement of
purchase consideration.

       purpose of an acquisition - the cost of acquisition
       of own shares;
 3)    if a company acquires the acquiree's shares - the
       cost of acquisition of these shares;
 4)    if, for the purpose of a combination, a company
       makes a payment in a form other than the one
       specified in Point 1-3 - the fair value of the object
       covered by the payment;
 5)    if, for the purpose of a combination, a company
       makes a payment in various forms - the total of
       relevant values referred to in Points 1-4.

                                 Justification for amendment
 The current provision does not obligate the acquirer to determine fair value of purchase
 consideration as of the day of combination. On the other hand, when purchase of assets
 method is applied, assets of the acquiree are measured at fair value as of the combination
 date. What does that mean? It means that some of the assets stemming from combination,
 e.g. those on the balance sheet of the acquiree, are measured as of combination date, while
 goodwill is measured on a different date. It should be noted here, that goodwill is
 determined as of the day of measurement of purchase consideration. I believe this to be
 a logical inconsistency of the provision. Additionally, it should be noted that current
 regulations do allow a certain degree of flexibility. For example, they contain a phrase “If
 the market price underwent significant fluctuations in the period, then the average market
 price...", without defining what should be deemed significant fluctuations. Such a structure
 of the provision allows manipulation of purchase consideration. From the perspective of
 both the buyer and the seller, fair value is the value as of a specific date, it is not an average.
 I believe this amendment would not introduce additional burdens for companies applying
 the provisions of the Act.

9.17 Amendment introducing a single definition of goodwill.

                 Current provision                              Recommended provision

                                  Justification for amendment
 Goodwill has been defined in art. 33 par. 4 of the Act on accounting. I believe there is no
 need to introduce a new definition for the purpose of business combination or repeating
 the definition provided in art. 33.

9.18 Amendment introducing new principles of accounting for contingent price.

                                               on economic character of the transaction.

                                  Justification for amendment
A method frequently used to determine purchase consideration is the earnout method. It
is applied, when the buyer and the seller of a business do not agree as to its market value.
Therefore, part of the purchase consideration will be due to owners of the acquiree if the
acquiree meets a certain condition in the future. Such a condition may be reaching a certain
level of operating profit, level of revenues, etc.

Under the current state of law, change in purchase consideration stemming from
occurrence of specific events does have an impact on goodwill or negative goodwill. So we
have a situation in which, in practice, for many acquirers the actual moment of determining
fair value of acquisition cost is deferred in time. Allowing measurement of acquisition cost
at a later date means, that in many cases information represented in the financial
statements may not reflect actual economic situation of the entity.

What will be the impact of the recommended amendment to the provision on accounting
for contingent price? It is best illustrated using an example. For the purpose of this
justification, let’s assume that the contingent price is based on the level of operating profit
to be achieved by the business in the future, specified in the agreement. The acquirer has
determined fair value of purchase consideration as of the combination date at 70% of
maximum purchase consideration. It turned out, that owners of the business have
generated a higher operating profit. This means that purchase consideration would be paid
in a higher amount than originally assumed. In the combined profit and loss, operating
profit stemming from the surplus generated by the business will be represented and offset
by operating cost in the amount of higher purchase consideration. Such accounting for the
purchase consideration reflects its economics. Since the acquirer had agreed to a higher
purchase consideration than fair value as of combination date, it means, that the additional
payment is tied to already realized higher operating profit. It does not relate to the
possibility of realizing higher than assumed carrying value of net assets in the future.

In summary, since the recommended provision transfers accounting for contingent
purchase consideration into profit and loss, it will mobilize the users of financial statements
to determine fair value of purchase consideration already at the combination date. At the
same time, it will allow for accounting for purchase consideration in line with its economic
character. The new regulation may result in additional burdens to entities applying the Act.
Those will not stem from new regulations, but from forcing application of existing
provisions.

                                 Justification for amendment
 Proposed changes introduce the concept of a business. Organized part of an enterprise
 does fit into the definition of a business. If business combination regulations pertain to
 a business, they automatically pertain to an organized part of an enterprise as well.
 Maintaining the current wording of art. 44d could result in understanding that a business is
 a narrower concept than an organized part of another entity (in practice, an organized part
 of an enterprise).

9.20 Amendment separating indemnification assets from goodwill.

       Current provision                            Recommended provision
 Art. 44b. No obligation to      Art. 44b. Within the framework of a business combination
 represent.                      transaction the seller may, based on an agreement,
                                 determine an indemnification for the acquirer, in connection
                                 with unknown result of a contingent event or uncertainty
                                 with respect to a specific asset/liability or part thereof. Such
                                 indemnification constitutes an asset of the acquirer, which
                                 should be recognized separately from goodwill. As of the day
                                 of initial recognition such assets are measured based on the
                                 same principles as measurement of the indemnified item.
                                 Indemnification assets are subject to impairment testing.
                                 Justification for amendment
 Business combination transactions are usually preceded by a detailed analysis of acquired
 business. Such due diligence is intended to, among other things, determine risk areas
 involved in the acquisition. Identification of risk areas, i.e. events which, if realized in the
 future, could have an impact on the current value of the enterprise does have a significant
 impact on the purchase consideration. Often the acquirer has a different estimation of the
 risk of the contingent event happening than the owners of the acquired business. As
 a result, the seller provides indemnification to the buyer in case of occurrence of the
 unfavorable event. Indemnification is specified in the combination agreement, so there are
 usually no major problems with its identification.

 Provision of art. 4 par. 2 states, that economic events are recognized in the books in
 accordance with their economic character. Therefore, economic character of the
 indemnification needs to be specified. Most certainly, lack of specified indemnification



                                                                                              132
 would increase the risk involved in the combination from the perspective of the acquirer.
 Therefore, in case of absence of indemnification, purchase consideration will be lower than
 price with indemnification. From the perspective of the parties, setting up indemnification
 means an adjustment of the purchase consideration. Since economic character of
 indemnification constitutes adjustment of purchase consideration, indemnification should
 not have an impact on goodwill. Therefore, it needs to be measured separately and
 presented in the combined financial statement as a separate asset. Will the recommended
 provision result in significant increase of burdens related to its application? I believe not.
 Both identification – based on the agreement, and measurement – based on indemnified
 item, should not cause major difficulties.

9.21 Justification for absence of regulation for reverse acquisitions.

             Current provision                           Recommended provision
 No regulation                                 No regulation
                                 Justification for amendment
 Current provisions do not regulate directly such business combinations in which the entity
 which is the acquirer from the perspective of commercial law turns over control over
 a business to the entity which is the legal acquiree. When analyzing changes to regulation
 in this scope, I considered three possibilities.

 1.   Introducing a general provision, for example: "Reverse acquisition occurs, when the
      entity issuing the securities (legal acquirer) is, pursuant to the provisions of the Act,
      the acquiree. Reverse acquisitions should be accounted for in accordance with the
      provisions of the Act."
      I believe such a provision does not solve the problem of accounting for business
      combinations. Regardless whether this provision is introduced to the Act or not,
      entities which apply the provisions of the Act should, pursuant to art. 2 thereof,
      register all economic transactions in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Thus,
      from the perspective of those applying the Act it is irrelevant whether the provision
      is introduced or not. Therefore, I do not recommend introducing such a change.
 2.   Definition of reverse acquisitions and direct reference to IFRS 3. "A reverse acquisition
      occurs when the entity that issues securities (the legal acquirer) is identified as the
      acquiree for accounting purposes on the basis of the Act. Reverse acquisitions should
      be accounted for in accordance with provisions of International Financial Reporting
      Standard No. 3 "Business combinations"
      Such a possibility was introduced to the Act by art. 10 par. 3. Moreover, a rigid
      reference to IFRS 3 resulted in difficulties in applying the Act after a national
      accounting standard devoted to business combinations was introduced. Therefore,
      I do not recommend introducing such a change.



                                                                                            133
 3.   Transferring detailed IFRS 3 based provisions into the Act.
      Act on accounting is based on a system of principles. Reverse acquisitions are business
      combinations and should be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of the
      Act. Introducing detailed regulations for one type of combination only does, in a way,
      change the construction of the Act. I believe that detailed accounting effects of
      specific transactions, as described in national accounting standards, are an effective
      way to explain accounting law. Therefore, I do not recommend introducing IFRS 3
      based provisions into the Act.
      I believe that the most beneficial solution would be to omit the issue of reverse
      acquisitions from the Act and describe detailed principles of accounting for reverse
      acquisitions in the national accounting standard pertaining to business combinations.

9.22 Separate presentation of reacquired rights as well as assets and liabilities from operating
leasing.

                Current provision                            Recommended provision
 Art. 44b. No regulation                             Art. 44b. No regulation
                                 Justification for amendment
In accordance with IFRS 3, reacquired rights are subject to separate identification, and in
certain situations, assets or liabilities from acquired operating leasing agreements need to
be presented as well. Such an obligation stems from the definition of goodwill, presented
in Attachment A to IFRS 3. Recommended modified definition of goodwill does not include
an obligation to present all identifiable assets separately. As per proposed definition,
separate presentation is required only for those assets, which can be separated out.
I believe that the costs involved in measurement at initial recognition, and then
measurement as of balance sheet date, of reacquired rights and assets or liabilities from
operating leasing in many cases would exceed the resulting benefits. It should also be
noted, that some of the users of financial statements could perceive such a presentation as
difficult to understand. Therefore I do not recommend separate measurement and
presentation of reacquired rights.
