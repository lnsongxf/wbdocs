OVERVIEW
Overall Assessments and Ratings
       Grant Objectives:
       THE DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT ARE TO: (1) IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES OF BASIC SOCIAL WELFARE AND
       DEVELOPMENT SERVICES IN REDUCING VULNERABILITY OF THE POOREST AND MARGINALIZED GROUPS (2) IMPROVE THE
       GOVERNANCE OF BASIC SOCIAL ASSISTANCE AND SOCIAL PROTECTION SERVICE DELIVERY THROUGH INTEGRATED REFORMS AT
       NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL (3) BUILD CAPACITY OF THE DSWD AND ASSOCIATED AGENCIES IN PERFORMANCE ORIENTED
       BUDGETING AND MANAGEMENT

       Overall progress from 07/01/2007 to 06/30/2008 with regard to Achieving Grant Objectives:
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory( Previously Rated Moderately Satisfactory on 06/30/2007 )
       Comment:
       The draft reform areas of the Department were presented during the project Preparation Mission. The Mission confirmed the
       indicative WB support for the following components: national targeting system; implementation of the Philippines CCT
       program; monitoring and evaluation; and, policy and strategy development. The major outputs of the Grant for this reporting
       period include the Medium-Term Expenditure Plan (MTEP); final report on risk and vulnerability analysis; inventory of existing
       social protection services; proposed institutional development and capacity building framework; analysis of the current
       monitoring and evaluation system of DSWD; training of reform focal persons; conduct of series of national and regional
       consultations within DSWD. The formulation of the MTEP triggered the consolidation of the various reform packages while the
       various consultations ensure broad acceptability of the reform within the Department. The MTEP has been submitted to the
       Department of Budget and Management and already served as basis for the DSWD#s budget proposal for 2009 thus providing
       the required budget ceiling for the prospective Bank-assisted projects.

       Overall progress from 07/01/2007 to 06/30/2008 with regard to Implementation of Grant Financed Activities:
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory( Previously Rated Satisfactory on 06/30/2007 )
       Comment:
       The Grant is being implemented in accordance with the Grant Agreement. Institutional uncertainties due to he recent issuance
       of A.O 232, however, temporarily delayed the conduct of the final consultations with the external stakeholders. This has
       been rescheduled in August in time for the closing of the Grant since an amended A.O No.232-A has been issued, clarifying
       the role of the DSWD as program coordinator and secretariat of the National Social Welfare Program.

Activity Risk
       Rating: Modest Risk
       Comment:
       There is currently low risk of the grant not leading to the loan. The grant itself will succeed in achieving the stated
       development objectives. The loan will be required to ensure achievement of all develoment objectives and particularly #1.
       as the loan will focus on supporting the development of a CCT program and a targeting system. The DSWD and World Bank are

Manager's comments on this GRM report:

       performed:Approved by Manager
       I'm pleased that there are no issues with respect to this grant. But
        it is a good idea to monitor closely as DSWD has relatively low
        capacity on implementation.

       I'm pleased that there are no issues with respect to this grant. But
        it is a good idea to monitor closely as DSWD has relatively low
        capacity on implementation.
