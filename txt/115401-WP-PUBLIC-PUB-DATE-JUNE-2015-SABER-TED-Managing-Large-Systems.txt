Foreword


The demand for higher education continues to grow. Global university enrolments are now at 180m - over a
quarter of the total age cohort.

An increase in higher education enrolment provides benefits to societies generally and drives better international
understanding and trust between people. However, this rapid expansion has also put pressure on funding from
states, and concerns in providing quality, equity and access.

In India, the British Council has been working with policy makers related to the education sector for over 60
years. The relationship is a strong and deep one. Looking forward, by 2020, India will have the largest university
age group cohort in the world, and careful management of this talent pipeline is not just an Indian concern, but a
global one.

We are delighted to have co-ordinated with our colleagues and partners on this report, which makes a
comparative analysis across nine countries - responsible for two thirds of all global student population. By
sharing experience of these large systems, we are able to extract the common characteristics, understand
the differences and from this analysis, suggest the key areas in how countries can turn the size of their higher
education systems into a benefit rather than a burden.

I trust you will find this both an insightful and useful report.

Preface


The role and reach of higher education are changing rapidly. A more skilled and more knowledgeable world is
emerging. Mass higher education and research science are no longer confined to North America and the English-
speaking world, Western Europe, Russia and Japan. High participation higher education has been achieved, or
is emerging, in every nation with a per capita income of more than about $3000 USD per annum. Further, in a
growing number of countries, ‘World-Class Universities’, meaning institutions with research capacity in science
and technology, are seen as part of the responsibility of government.

The pace of change is truly amazing. In 1972 the United States had the world’s highest Gross Tertiary Enrolment
Ratio (GTER) at 48 per cent, with Soviet Russia at 44 per cent. Only 19 national systems were above 15 per cent.
The worldwide GTER was 10 per cent, held back by low participation in large nations such as China (3 per cent)
and India (6 per cent). Forty years later in 2012 the worldwide GTER was at 32 per cent, driven by major growth
of enrolments in China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria. Almost one young person in every three now enters
tertiary education, meaning programmes of two full time years or more. By 2012, 19 countries had achieved a
GTER of 75 per cent, in 49 countries the GTER was over 50 per cent, and in 107 countries it exceeded 15 per
cent. The worldwide GTER is now growing at the unprecedented rate of 1 per cent each year, meaning 20 per
cent in 20 years.

Workforces are also growing rapidly, but educational participation is expanding faster than the economies
that finance education, and graduate jobs are moving down the occupational scale. This creates strains, but
workforces everywhere are becoming more capable, and populations more socially flexible and politically adept.
These are strong positive outcomes.

The fluorescence of higher education has thrown up many different system configurations, especially in the large
diverse systems discussed here. There is global convergence across nations on the basis of a common Anglo-
American model of the large comprehensive science-based university: a template entrenched, for good or ill, by
university rankings. There is less similarity in institutions of mass access, which are nuanced according to local
and national contexts. Everywhere government is the key actor in system evolution, especially in planning, and in
providing the ‘floor’ of resources and quality regulation. But all governments use much devolution, and work via
partnerships with other social actors, from the family and private education to industry and new technological
platforms. Over time the large systems will probably become more not less distinctive. In a high participation
world models other than the Anglo-American will exercise growing influence. At the same time the different
countries in a globalising world will continue to learn from each other on the basis of common appreciation and
respect. This British Council report has been prepared to facilitate that processes of mutual learning through the
exchange of ideas and experiences.

Key findings


This report focuses on nine of the largest higher education systems in the world: Brazil, China, India, Indonesia,
Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, UK and USA. Together they represent two thirds of the total global student population. It
assesses the distinctive opportunities and challenges facing them, providing a synthesis of nine country specific
papers commissioned by the British Council in 2014.

The following characteristics are identified as common to large systems:

                •	 Diverse institutions and diversifying modes of provision

                •	 Blurred lines between the public and private sectors

                •	 Calls for more effective quality assurance systems

                •	 Concern for developing affirmative action/access policies

                •	 Drives for linking curriculum to the knowledge economy and employability

                •	 Focus on internationalisation

                •	 Growing imperative of research and its concentration in select universities

However, there are also a series of divergences and points of significant difference:

                •	 Drivers for Higher Education growth

                •	 Effects of cultural and demographic factors

                •	 Decision-making process and actors

                •	 Funding models

                •	 Role of public and private sectors in massification

                •	 Priorities in relation to STEM and the humanities

In responding to these dynamics, the following question is posed: How can countries turn the size of their HE
systems into a benefit rather than a burden? The report puts forward the following six recommendations:

                1.	 Ensure that expansion does not compromise quality

                2.	 Adapt curricula for enhancing students’ capabilities

                3.	 Balance institutional autonomy with state capacity to promote equity

                4.	 Promote diversity, not stratification

                5.	 Ensure sustainable and equitable financing mechanisms

                6.	 Foster inward and outward mobility

32 | Managing Large Systems




Conclusion


Size is a double-edged sword. It can enable a tree to move up above its neighbours and enjoy the sunlight,
and give it a thick trunk to whether storms. Yet if it is not carefully balanced its own weight may topple it, and
crash down with even greater force. In the contemporary reality of global competition in higher education,
large systems have a significant advantage in being able to generate the specialisation, garner the resources
and nurture the international interest necessary for world-class universities. Yet without great care they can
struggle to provide quality higher education en masse, leading to a stratified system in which many students (and
principally disadvantaged ones) may obtain a diploma in name, but obtain little learning of worth in practice.

This final section addresses two key questions. First, what do large systems have in common, and what
characteristics pull them apart? Second, how can countries turn the distinctive challenges of large systems into
advantages?


Commonalities of large systems
A high degree of convergence between systems is to be expected given the forces of globalisation, in addition
to any commonalities arising from the size of systems. The following major forms of convergence between the
systems have been identified in this report:

                •	 Diverse institutions and diversifying modes of provision

                      HEIs have diversified over time to fulfil different missions and to serve new populations of students
                      (e.g. mature and working students, those outside the capital city). HE systems are also increasingly
                      expanding by offering new modes of provision at existing HEIs (e.g. online learning/MOOCs,
                      part time or evening programmes), though the forms of adaptation differ between countries.
                      Nevertheless, there is also evidence of mission drift, with technical and vocational institutions
                      becoming increasingly similar to academic ones.

                •	 Blurred lines between the public and private sectors

                      There is a trend towards HEIs which are not wholly and definitively public or private (e.g. public
                      institutions charging fees in the UK; private institutions receiving federal grants in the USA; deemed
                      universities in India). While government financing of HE was once predominant, many HEIs and
                      systems now have more diversified streams of income.

                •	 Calls for more effective monitoring/evaluating and quality assurance systems

                      The call for a more robust system of monitoring and evaluating the health of HE systems is a strong
                      theme. A “one size fits all” model of quality assurance, as many reports describe as the status quo, is
                      no longer deemed adequate on account of the diversity of HEIs’ missions and student populations,
                      and the general move away from government funding (and its “built in” accountability expectation).

                •	 Affirmative Action/Access Issues

                      Despite the cultural and political diversity of the nine countries, inadequate access to and effective
                      participation in HE for disadvantaged groups is a strong theme. Many countries have enacted or
                      wish to enact affirmative action policies. However, the reports cite problems implementing adequate
                      policies and need for more enquiry into effective affirmative action.

                •	 Knowledge economy, relevance and employability

                      While the knowledge economy discourse is more evident in some countries than others, the
                      discussion of graduate employability and the relevance of the education provided to the economy
                      is a common feature. Debates continue as to the benefits of a specified skill set as opposed to a
                      more holistic general education model.

                •	 Internationalisation

                      Emphasis on internationalisation is common to all of the nine countries. The need for better
                      and wider internationalisation was cited, primarily for economic reasons, although the activities
                      differed by country (e.g. Science Without Borders in Brazil sends Brazilian students abroad where
                      universities in the USA and the UK are seeking to recruit more international students).

                •	 Growing imperative of research

                      Research is a key concern of large HE systems, to a large extent concentrated within large, public
                      HEIs (sometimes referred to as “World Class Universities”). When research is cited, bibliometric
                      measures are usually used to describe output.


Differences of large systems
In addition, there are some points of significant difference, stemming from the divergent histories and traditions of
the countries, as well as specific political and economic circumstances:

                •	 Drivers for growth

                      Expansion of the systems has been driven by different factors across the nine countries, including
                      government policy for enhancing economic growth, demand from prospective students and
                      institutional level incentives.

                •	 Effects of demographic factors

                      Conditions for higher education policy and planning are different depending on demographic
                      factors, particularly growth in youth population. Countries such as India and Nigeria face a particular
                      challenge in ensuring the offer keeps pace with the size of the cohort. On the other hand, in
                      countries such as Russia, enrolments have dropped because of decreasing numbers of school
                      leavers.

                •	 Decision-making process and actors

                      While in many systems individual HEIs have a great deal of autonomy, there were many models of
                      HE governance in evidence. Depending on the country and its political system, HE is accountable to
                      certain political bodies or actors for certain decisions. Governance within HEIs also varies, though
                      the use of disciplinary departments is still a common feature.

                •	 Funding models

                      The nine systems featured in this report have a variety of models of funding from different
                      sources and allocated in different manners, as displayed in table #. However, there is a degree of
                      convergence here, with a strong trend towards greater proportions of private funding.

                •	     Role of public and private sectors in massification

                      Countries have adopted diverse strategies for facilitating rapid expansion. In Brazil and India, for
                      example, massification has occurred primarily via the private sector, while in the UK it is through
                      public institutions, albeit with an increasing degree of private funding, and in the USA via both
                      sectors.

                •	 Priorities in relation to STEM

                      In the context of the knowledge economy, there has been global interest in developing the areas
                      of science, technology, engineering and mathematics through universities. However, the relative
                      emphasis on these in relation to other disciplinary areas, and the specific policies adopted, have
                      differed between the countries.


Recommendations for managing large systems
The fundamental question for large enrolment systems is as follows: How can countries turn the size of their
HE systems into a benefit rather than a burden? This final section will address six key points emerging from the
analysis.

                1.	 Ensure that expansion does not compromise quality

While all of the countries in this study either have world-class universities or are moving towards them, providing
consistently high quality across the system is a harder nut to crack. Rapid expansion, often through insufficiently
regulated private organisations, has led to highly uneven standards of teaching and learning, leading to poor
outcomes for many students. Countries like South Korea show that high participation does not have to lead
to loose quality, underfunding and neglect in mass education and vocational institutions. Quality assurance
systems, academic staff development programmes and other interventions are needed to orchestrate continuing
expansion without compromising quality of provision17.

                2.	 Adapt curricula for enhancing students’ capabilities

Problems of graduate unemployment and dissatisfaction with graduate skills are widespread. While labour market
dynamics are to a large extent beyond the reach of universities, there is much that institutions can do to prepare
their students adequately for their future work. Beyond salaried employment, students must be able to acquire
the capabilities they need in all areas of their lives and to make a positive contribution to society. Curricula
need to be adapted to the changing nature of society, and encourage critical thinking, rather than rote learning.
Strengthening STEM subjects is important, but graduates are needed in all areas, including arts and humanities.

                3.	 Balance institutional autonomy with state capacity to promote equity

Governance issues are particularly critical for large and complex higher education systems. Systems need
to ensure that they combine institutional autonomy with the degree of national level leverage necessary to
ensure coherence and equity across the system. Affirmative action programmes have gone some way towards
addressing inequalities of access, but there are still significant inequalities on the basis of gender, race/ethnicity,
social class and other background characteristics.

                4.	 Promote diversity, not stratification

Large systems have a distinct advantage in that size allows for a wide array of different forms of institution, in
terms of mission, scope and disciplinary specialisation. Such a diversity can respond effectively to the diverse
needs and interests of individual students and society. However, it is essential to guard against stratification of
quality, with lower-income students being confined to lower quality provision.

                5.	 Ensure sustainable and equitable financing mechanisms

Providing adequate funding for massified higher education systems is a critical challenge worldwide, particularly
for low and middle-income countries, but even for OECD countries. Cost sharing, loan schemes and other devices
have been implemented to ensure that constraints on public finances do not hamper expansion of the system.
In seeking out innovative funding mechanisms, care must be taken not to negatively impact on equity of access,
and to ensure that the public good mission of universities is not undermined.

  It is important to point out that the considerations as regards the size of an institution may not be the same as those of the size of a system.
Some institutions resist expansion on the basis that their quality and ethos are dependent in significant ways on their compact size and the
ability to maintain close relationships and understanding across the institution. Higher education on a massive scale does not necessarily
mean massive institutions, and systems may opt for a large network of smaller units.

                6.	 Foster inward and outward mobility

Fluidity of movement between institutions is central to a thriving academic environment, as seen in the earliest
European universities and institutions of higher learning elsewhere in the world. Large systems have a clear
advantage in providing a pull for students and staff from overseas, but should also encourage their own staff and
students to be mobile and foster cross-cultural learning and interchange.

More broadly, large higher education systems should take the opportunity to learn from each other. While market
mechanisms have fostered competition in certain areas between institutions, and even between countries, a
thriving global higher education sector is not a zero-sum game. All countries can make steps forward through
collaborating effectively and sharing learning through experiences of policy innovation at national or institutional
level.

Appendix 2: World Bank
commentary

Higher education in the world has experienced in recent years a dramatic expansion, an increased diversification,
and a gradual positioning from peripheral to central in the definition of public policies in governments all over
the world. This especially true in the case of the most populated countries of the world in which due to the
demographic pressures, the higher education sector has rapidly responded with fast, although not always
properly planned, growth. In a number of cases, the growth has led to the creation of large mega-universities in
which significant challenges associated with their massification are quite significant.

As emerging economies in general have made important advances towards fulfilling the Millennium Development
Goals of achieving universal primary education, significant sectors of their young population in those countries
now see higher education as a dream possible, although may be discouraged by the soaring cost of attending,
high selectivity of institutions, limited employment opportunities, as well as other barriers. In this context, higher
education can become a significant enabler of shared prosperity in those countries if it becomes more efficient,
relevant, equitable, transparent, and responsive.

In the case of countries with large higher education systems, it should be noted that although challenges are
unique to each of them due to the peculiarity of their higher education systems, nevertheless, there are important
commonalities providing an opportunity for shared learning based on best practices and on inadequacies and
mistakes to be avoided.

Knowing that higher education is fundamental to development and growth, there are a set of guiding principles
that may be helpful in transitioning large higher education systems in order to make them more responsive to the
needs of their local evolving economies and societies:

                •	 Higher education should provide graduates with the skills and knowledge they need to both
                   find and create jobs, which requires concerted action from governments to establish adequate
                   regulatory frameworks that will expand opportunities from different public and private sources.

                •	 Higher education should be more accessible to more people, especially in developing countries
                   and for those currently underserved.

                •	 Higher education should contribute more effectively to regional development by fostering
                   innovation, as well as production/sharing of knowledge, and by actively engaging higher education
                   institutions with business, government and community-based organizations.

                •	 Higher education must become more efficient, affordable, technologically innovative, academically
                   flexible, accountable/transparent, entrepreneurial, and connected to the realities of the communities
                   in which tertiary education institutions serve and the economy.

Although there is nothing new on the aforementioned list, it is important to emphasize that the virtuous
combination of all of them, will necessarily result in preparing students with ready-to-work skills thus enabling
them to succeed in a changing economic reality. Also, this will greatly contribute to foster in them a strong sense
of community service which eventually will make them more socially and economically responsible. In addition,
by addressing social imperatives such as equitable access and involvement in regional development, higher
education institutions may more effectively contribute to society at large.

Consequently, as evidence shows, some of the following areas may require greater attention by governments and
institutions as they foster a more adequately planned growth of their higher education systems:

                •	 Increasing institutional diversification (growth of non-university and private institutions) to expand
                   coverage on a financially viable basis and establish a lifelong-learning framework with multiple
                   points of entry and multiple pathways.

                •	 Improving the relevance and quality of higher education, which requires to transition from a quality
                   control-quality assurance approach towards a quality enhancement one.

                •	 Strengthening science and technology research and development capacity in selected areas linked
                   to a country’s priorities for the development of comparative advantages.

                •	 Promoting greater equity mechanisms intended to create and expand access and opportunities for
                   disadvantaged students.

                •	 Establishing sustainable financing systems to encourage responsiveness and flexibility.

                •	 Strengthening management capacities, through such measures as introduction of management
                   information systems, to promote improved accountability, administration, and governance and more
                   efficient utilization of existing resources.

                •	 Enhancing and expanding information technology and communications capacity to reduce the
                   digital divide.

There is no question that demographic pressures will continue being the major driver for growth in higher
education, especially in highly populated countries. A key principle to consider is that in addressing growth
challenges, an important role not to be avoided is the one of the government. However, this is not enough: higher
education institutions have too much to do on their own in becoming more efficient, more affordable, more
innovative in their use of technology, more flexible in their academic offerings, more accountable and transparent
to society, more entrepreneurial, and more connected to the realities of the economy and the communities
in which they serve. The Ivory Tower model of a highly elitist, affordable mostly for the better-off, and isolated
university is no longer sustainable.

In conclusion, strengthening the capacity of large higher education institutions to respond flexibly to the new
demands of knowledge societies, is an urgent and important task that will result in long-term economic effects
and the associated welfare benefits that come from sustained growth.
