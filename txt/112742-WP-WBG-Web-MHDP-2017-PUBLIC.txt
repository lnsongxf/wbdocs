“Every day, millions of men, women and children around the world are burdened by mental illness. Yet mental health
too often remains in the shadows, as a result of stigma and a lack of understanding, resources, and services.

Two decades ago, we faced a similar situation with HIV and AIDS. People affected by AIDS faced severe stigma,
and there was a widespread failure of policymakers to acknowledge or address the growing number of people
dying in the world – especially in Africa – from the lack of access to affordable treatment. It was unjust, it was
wrong, and it was unleashing a health and development catastrophe. So a group of us decided to raise our voices
and bring HIV and AIDS out of the shadows, and we demanded action.

Today, we are here to bring mental health into the spotlight and squarely on the global development agenda
where it belongs.”

"I decline to accept the end of man. It is easy enough to say that man is immortal simply because he will endure:
that when the last dingdong of doom has clanged and faded from the last worthless rock hanging tideless in
the last red and dying evening, that even then there will still be one more sound: that of his puny inexhaustible
voice, still talking. I refuse to accept this. I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal,
not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of
compassion and sacrifice and endurance.”
