THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

Burkina Faso is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                Legal form: Société à Responsabilité Limitée
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through           (SARL) - Limited Liability Company
collaboration with relevant local professionals and
the study of laws, regulations and publicly available          Paid-in minimum capital requirement: XOF
information on business entry in that economy.                 100,000
Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,           City: Ouagadougou

procedures are those that apply to a company                   Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita

collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

        Companies are assigned a unique company identification number for
        company registration, fiscal identification, and social security affiliation.

        The official time for the completion of the registration process in this
        procedure is 7 working days. Because CEFORE forwards the documents
        to the respective agencies, however, in practice the delay is longer.

        On May 23, 2007, the Minister of Labor and Social Security, the Minister
        of Commerce, and the Minister of Employment signed a decree that the
        required declarations must be filed with CEFORE. CEFORE then transfers
        the relevant information to Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale (CNSS),
        which has the mandate to disseminate that information to the National
        Agency of Employment Promotion (ANPE) and the Labor Inspectorate.

        Registration fees are XOF 47,500 as follows: XOF 12,500 (RCCM) + XOF
        7,500 (IFU) + XOF 5,000 (CNSS) + XOF 7,500 (CEFORE) + XOF 5,000
        (Court registration) + XOF 10,000 (fee for publication).

        The sworn declaration (declaration sur l'honneur), instead of a copy of
        the criminal records of the manager is provided with the registration
        application. The entrepreneur will need to send a copy of her/his
        criminal record within 2 months.

        Obtain soil survey from National Laboratory of Building and

        The soil survey is carried out by the National Laboratory of
        Construction and Public Works (Laboratoire National des
        Batiments et Travaux Publics Burkina). The purpose of this study
        is to analyze and inform the construction company of the
        parameters for the foundations (what type of foundations are
        required, how deep in the soil should they dig, what is the
        quality of the soil, etc.).

        circulaire N 10-01195/MID/SG/LNBTP, the cost of the soil survey

      Obtain fire safety study from a licensed fireman or
      competent private agency

      As of January 2011 a fee schedule has been established in
      Ouagadougou for the cost of the fire safety study. To obtain this
      study, a company must make a request with a licensed fireman
      (‘personne agréée’ - pompier) or at the agency SCEPSI -- ‘Societe
      Commerciale d’Etudes, de Prevention et de Securité Incendie’.

      The fee schedule has reduced the fire safety study fees for
      Category 3 buildings (e.g., warehouse) from FCFA 500,000.00 to
      FCFA 165,000.00. The document takes about 1 -- 2 weeks to be
      issued.

      * Obtain a land survey from a private consultant

      A land plot survey (plan de bornage) is obtained from a private
      surveyor. This is necessary since there is Master plan for the city
      of Ouagadougou, therefore in order for the builder to ensure
      that the boundary of the land is correct, a private surveyor will      7 days     XOF 116,000

      do a land survey. This is not a requirement to obtain a building
      permit, but it is done in practice by the builder.

      Agency: Private company



      Obtain building permit at CEFAC one-stop shop and pay fees

      Documents obtained from the first 3 procedures (soil survey,
      legalized copy of ID and land title, and fire safety study) along
      with the architecture plans are brought to CEFAC. The files will
      be reviewed by one of CEFAC’s two experts on construction
      permits. If the agent finds that the application package is
      incomplete, the agent will inform BuildCo before sending the
      application to other agencies and will ask BuildCo to provide the
      missing materials.

      The following documents must accompany an application to
      construct a warehouse (category C):
5     • An application form, with a FCFA 200 stamp fee                      20 days     XOF 158,508

      • A demarcation plan
      • An architectural study report established by a recognized
      architect by the Order of Architects
      • An engineering report detailing the construction requirements

      When the application package is complete, the file is ready to be
      submitted to the CEFAC Commission. Four agencies are
      represented in this commission: the fire department, the tax
      office, the municipality, and the Urban Planning Ministry
      (Ministere de l’Habitat et l’Urbanisme). The committee meets
      every fifteen days. By law, they have to get back to the applicant

      within 18 days so a decision is delivered every 20 -- 30 days. The
      Commission can reject an application for many reasons
      (including wrong zoning) but BuildCo can only appeal once. An
      application is rarely rejected. Even in cases when the application
      requires further information, the Commission issues a conditional
      permit, allowing the applicant to work on the remaining
      elements. The permit issued by the Commission is valid for 5
      years and can be renewed once.

        The customer could also request an inspection of the internal installation
        from one of the private companies subcontracted by the utility, but this
        is optional.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       Prior to the GUF, there was an option to accelerate the Procedure and
       have it done in 1 day instead of 3 days. However, with the GUF the
       statutory time is fixed at 3 days. In practice, it takes 7 calendar days. If
       there are any charges on the property, there is an additional FCFA 2000         7 days           FCFA 4000

       for information on each such charge. In our case, there are no charges
       and therefore only the basic price applies.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
