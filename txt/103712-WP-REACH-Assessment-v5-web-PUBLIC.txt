REACH: Assessment of
the Pilot Year
Introduction
Results-based financing (RBF) has the potential to transform how education systems
operate, and the types of results they achieve for children the world over. As a financing
instrument, RBF shows much promise for helping clients enroll the 121 million children
still out of primary and lower secondary school, and teach the 250 million in school but
still unable to read or write. Indeed, RBF has dramatically improved the delivery of health
services in over 30 countries to date. Although more nascent in the education sector,
RBF programs can foster the right incentive structures in education systems, overcoming
challenges that impede additional and better education services for the most excluded
children and youth. Generally speaking, RBF programs do this by rewarding the delivery of
education outcomes through financial incentives, upon verification that the agreed-upon
result has been achieved, and do so in a manner that can be credibly sustained over time.

In 2015, the World Bank Group (WBG) launched REACH, a multi-donor trust fund that
strives to support country clients in this space, and accelerate the RBF agenda within the
institution. With generous financial support from the Governments of Norway, the United
States, and Germany, REACH has just completed its pilot year. Highlights of activities during
that year include the allocation of a Country Program Grant (CPG) to Nepal (US$4 M), and
the approval of 19 Knowledge, Learning, and Innovation (KLI) Grants, in addition to training
activities and knowledge and learning events with over 100 participants.

This assessment reflects on lessons learned in 2015, and estimates the demand for future
RBF in education. The lessons have been distilled from the early experiences with the 20
REACH-funded grants, as well as from the just-in-time support provided to Bank teams and
country clients across the globe (about 20 countries in total). The assessment concludes with
recommendations for the continued evolution of REACH.

    Serving Clients: Top Ten Things we
    Learned about RBF in 2015
    Lesson 1. RBF means different things to different people.
    Many international actors have developed        away from input-based school financing
    a lexicon around RBF. A quick glance            policies.1
    reveals a true alphabet soup, distinguishing    As we have been learning “how to speak
    between Results-Based Aid, Ouput-Based          RBF”, we have chosen to adopt a Glossary
    Aid, Results-Based Budgeting, and so much       of Terms from the health sector (see table
    more. The differences in terminology are        1). In short, RBF is the umbrella term that
    predicated on who is financing, who is          we use for any program that rewards
    receiving, what results are sought, and under   verifiable results. We believe that this

    financing approach that can transform           the financing (e.g. whether government or

TABLE 1. A Short Glossary of RBF Terms, based on Musgrove, 20112

 Term                                 Definition

 Results-Based                        Any program that rewards the delivery of one or more outputs or
 Financing, RBF                       outcomes by one or more incentives, financial or otherwise, upon
                                      verification that the agreed-upon result has actually been delivered.
  
                                      Incentives may be directed to service providers (supply side), program
                                      beneficiaries (demand side) or both. Payments or other rewards are
                                      not made unless and until results or performance are satisfactory.
                                      The definitions of results or objectives and rewards are embodied in
                                      contracts between one or more principals who provide the incentives
                                      and one or more agents who contract to deliver the specified results,
                                      outputs or outcomes.

 Pay for Performance                  Can all be considered synonyms. Performance in these labels means the
 (P4P), Performance-                  same thing as results, and payment means the same thing as financing.
 based Payment and                    These terms do not introduce any additional distinctions.
 Performance-Based
 Incentives (PBI)

 Performance-Based                    Incentives are directed only to providers, not beneficiaries; awards in
 Financing, PBF                       current programs are purely financial, although discussion in some
                                      countries contemplates provided non-financial rewards such as
                                      improved housing or transportation or the provision of schooling...
                                      Cash payment is by FFS for specified services; and payment depends
                                      explicitly on the degree to which services are of approved quality, as
                                      defined by protocols for processes or outcomes. Payments can be made
                                      to facilities or to individuals; “provider” includes both categories and
                                      can refer to any level of the health system, from community workers to
                                      hospitals. The relation between results and payments can be linear or
                                      non-linear.

 Performance-Based                    Setting a fixed price for a desired output and then adding a variable
 Contracting, PBC                     component that can reduce payment for poor performance or increase
                                      it for good performance compared to the standard defined in the basic
  
                                      contract (Loevinsohn). The variable share at risk is often small, of the
                                      order of five percent of the base price in either direction, but it can be
                                      much larger... These are otherwise classical contracts that do not involve
                                      FFS or other output-related payments. They are usually applied to
                                      NGOs; the fixed price component leaves it to the provider to allocate
                                      funds among inputs. One may describe PBC as “contracting out” to
                                      distinguish it from PBF, which is a form of “contracting in”.

 Output-Based Aid,                    A subset of RBF […] includes only financial rewards. Output is used as a
 OBA                                  synonym for results and does not usually include results better classified
                                      as outcomes. The distinguishing feature is that the principal is an aid
  
                                      donor; the agent is therefore typically a recipient government or public
                                      agency, although it could be an NGO or private for-profit organization
                                      if external assistance is provided directly to such an entity rather than
                                      passing through a government.

     COD, Cash on Delivery           Defined as “a new approach to foreign aid” it overlaps with OBA.
                                     However, delivery may refer to outcomes rather than just outputs. It
                                     is distinguished by the maximal degree of autonomy for the agent in
                                     deciding how to produce and deliver the results. Once the objectives
                                     and the payment are contracted, the principal does not dictate or
                                     supervise the agent’s decisions or methods. This difference from RBF
                                     or OBA programs in general is procedural rather than referring to the
                                     objectives, the verification mechanism or the manner of payment.
     CCT, Conditional                Describes demand-side programs where the incentives apply exclusively
     Cash Transfer                   or primarily directly to the program beneficiaries rather than to the agent(s)
                                     delivering services. Results are defined by the enrollment of beneficiaries
                                     in the program and their compliance with required behaviors such as
                                     consuming specific services. Incentives to recruit and enroll beneficiaries
                                     or to provide them with services may also apply on the supply side in these
                                     programs, as in RBF generally. For the name CCT to apply there must be a
                                     financial payment to the beneficiaries for compliance. CCTs typically offer
                                     non-financial rewards, such as food packages, as well.



    Lesson 2. Theories of change: a nudge instead of a lever.
    There exists a view that external financing                outset, between donor and country or within
    can provide governments with an incentive                  the country system itself, success is unlikely,
    to undertake actions that they otherwise                   especially in the long term.
    might not, actions which are more important
                                                               In contrast, rather than shifting objectives,
    to the financier than to the client. Based
                                                               we believe that RBF serves more to shift
    on the principal-agent model, this theory
                                                               the focus of attention and effort. By using
    argues that external financing can serve
                                                               results as the starting point, and by using
    as a lever to shift the agent (e.g. recipient
                                                               financing to sustain that attention over
    government) toward the principal’s (e.g.
    donor’s) objective, creating an alignment                  time, successful RBF works more to clarify
    of sorts (Clist and Verschoor, 2014). This                 and organize existing objectives and send
    presumes, however, that the agent does                     stronger signals about what matters. It
    not inherently value the result, or at least               therefore nudges program actors – financiers,
    not to the same extent as the principal. Our               recipient governments, service providers,
    experience to date has been different: If                  beneficiaries – to put resources towards the
    there is no alignment in objectives at the                 activities most likely to achieve those results.


    Lesson 3. Discretionary action is unlikely to drive solutions.
    One idea associated with RBF is that it must               governments remain hands-off with schools or
    include discretionary action for recipients in             teachers. It also suggests that the recipients

    full autonomy to recipient governments, or                 the problem at hand, whether increasing

                                                that help teachers teach at the level of

learning simply by being left to their own      to identify the critical pathways toward
devices, and given the autonomy to act as       achieving the desired results.


Lesson 4. But discretionary spending might.
A related idea is that discretionary            is little reason to suggest that active
spending – the freedom to choose when           supervision regarding budget execution
and how to spend the resources to achieve       adds the same kind of value. As such,
results – is a desirable feature of RBF. Here   teams are encouraged to design RBF with
we would tend to agree. While external          discretionary spending for recipients—
actors can add value in terms of technical      whether governments, districts, firms or
support toward achieving results, there         schools—embedded therein.


Lesson 5. RBF requires more than the usual level of client ownership.
For RBF to work, the signals need to be         to resolve bottlenecks in service delivery,
strong. This means not only clarifying          withholding payments to firms, schools, or
incentives, but also following through          teachers requires a much greater degree
with integral program parameters such as        of political will. When governments are

Lesson 6. The relationship between incentives
and performance is not linear.
Much of the RBF approach rests on               availability of resources). If the incentive can

such as those that link school grants to        reveals that such incentives work best when

When exploring the idea of using RBF              that has worked for previous objectives
to improve student outcomes such as               of increasing access and improving
learning, there is a natural tendency to look     intermediate outcomes such as community

success. To start to test this hypothesis,        toward greater learning. Importantly,

a	 This indicator is primarily for reporting purposes and will change over time as a function of the nature of projects supported. The indicator is calculated by dividing the total REACH
   investment, assumed at US$40m in 2016, by the average government expenditure per primary student (US$) of countries benefitting from REACH (if that country has reported data
   as part of the World Development Indicators - WDI database). Given that average expenditure is US$297 but REACH CPGs (the largest investment of REACH) are only open to
   IDA countries where average expenditure is US$97, US$200 is used. Data as of Jan 7, 2016 comes from the 2012 WDI, which was the year that had the largest number of countries
   reporting data. The US$40m investment is assumed to be additional to existing commitments, where US$36m is allocated to 6 CPGs in equal amounts and US$4m to KLI grants
   between 2018 and 2019. In the future, CPG grants will be required to choose from a menu of indicators that will be aligned with global IDA indicators. Actuals will be added as
   data become available.
