GARANTI BANK ROMANIA:
STRIVING TO LEAD -
A STUDY ON WOMEN
IN BANKING
LEARNING STUDY ON IMPACT OF BANKING ON
WOMEN PROGRAMS IN EUROPE, CENTRAL ASIA,
MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA
DISCLAIMER
IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, creates opportunity where it’s needed most and delivers lasting
solutions for development. This report was commissioned by IFC through its Financial Institutions
Group (FIG) in Europe, Central Asia, Middle East and North Africa (EMENA), IFC’s Development
Impact Unit and IFC’s Gender Secretariat. FIG IFC works through financial institutions to provide
much-needed access to finance for millions of micro, small, and medium enterprises – including those
owned by women. The IFC Gender Secretariat in turn works with firms – including banks - to reduce
the gap between men and women as entrepreneurs, but also as employees, corporate leaders, suppliers,
consumers, and community stakeholder. The conclusions and judgments contained in this report should
not be attributed to, and do not necessarily represent the views of, IFC or its Board of Directors or the

          Garanti Bank Romania has a vision for growth in which SME banking, including banking for women-led SMEs,
          plays a critical role. The Bank is, however, faced with a number of external market challenges pertaining to the
          Romanian SME segment. To better understand the business rationale and strategic relevance for the Bank’s
          interest in the SME – and in particular of the women-led SME – banking segment, it is important to take a look at
          the overall Romanian market – and in particular the women’s – entrepreneurship space. In 2010, the Bank set up
          a program to reach women-led SMEs, largely leveraging its product menu for SMEs. It is, however, mostly Garanti
          Bank’s products for individuals that have gained the Bank market recognition. Over time, the bank has received
          numerous awards and distinctions, proving customers and general public confidence in our products and services:

                                                            women entrepreneurs, it seems that

                                                            Further, women customers expect a clear
                                                            product differentiation for the financial

                                                            well as non-financial services that help

                                                            pressing challenges, such as enhancing
                                                            cost-efficiencies through energy savings.



Indeed, the company has tapped into other sources
of financing since Garanti Bank launched its BoW
Program and did obtain a €1.5 million loan from the
Bank of Cyprus. This funding was however unrelated
to the financing the company received from Garanti
Bank and the loans it has from Garanti Bank did not
in any way help obtain financing from other banks.
   In spite of its beginning as a start-up, the company
has never used personal loans for its business. Ovo
Design is growing fast and with that have come further
financing needs. The company plans to apply for further
financing in the coming two years, mostly to upgrade and
purchase new equipment. Given Ovo Design’s growth
and expansion, the company would direct any additional
financial resources into upgrading its equipment and
training its employees. It would also consider purchasing
new equipment and hiring more qualified staff. Ms.
Felicia further offers some insight into the challenges
that small businesses in Romania, including women-
led firms, face and the specific finance and non-finance
needs they typically have. The biggest challenge to
the company is tax and labour regulation, in addition
to access to reliable electricity/power. This includes
costs associated with power as well as compliance
with labour regulations. The company considers that
two most pressing needs that can be addressed by the
Bank are lower interest rates for women-led firms, and
customized business consulting services for women
clients. Because of the costs associated with accessing
power, the company is further interested in energy
efficiency financing and energy efficiency audits.
