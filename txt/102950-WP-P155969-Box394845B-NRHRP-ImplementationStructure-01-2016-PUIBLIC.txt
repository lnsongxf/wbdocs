Program’s Implementation Structure: Roles & Responsibilities

    Under    the leadership of the Government of Nepal, the Rural Housing Reconstruction Program’s
    implementation has been carefully structured to reflect the program’s operating principles as well as the
    conditions on the ground. As shown in the diagram below, there is both flexibility as well as regular monitoring
    and evaluation to assure that implementation is responsive to the needs of beneficiaries. Best practices have
    been gleaned from other international reconstruction experiences and incorporated into the implementation
    structure and procedures for the Rural Housing Reconstruction Program.
