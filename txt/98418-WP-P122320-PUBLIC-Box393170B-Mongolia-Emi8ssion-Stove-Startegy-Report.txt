        Building on six years of technical
    assistance, policy dialogue and recent
    stove switching program experience in
    Ulaanbaatar, this report sets out a proposed
    national low-emission stove strategy for
    Mongolia The objective of the strategy is
    to establish a sustainable market for low
    emission stoves in Mongolia. The report
    focuses on clean heating and cooking stoves
    as well as small water heating boilers used
    in peri-urban ger areas of Ulaanbaatar and
    other Aimags and Soum centers.
        The strategy is valid for the current
    clean stove market development situation
    and may change in the near future.
    Therefore, results should be monitored and
    fine-tuned when needed.
        This    report,    it's   asusumptions,
    suggestions and recommendations are
    valid for the clean stove market as of the
    time of writing this repor. Conditions are
    dynamic and can influence the design
    of the strategy. Recently, the Australian
    Government provided funds through
    the World Bank to sustain this dialogue
    through the Mongolia Clean Stove Initiative
    technical assistance project, which financed
    the development of this report.

actual one-time subsidy paid so far ranged
from US$ 250-350 per stove: this level of
costs is far below the annual economic
benefit obtained from using these stoves.
Annex 2 of this strategy provides additional
economic analysis.
    While stoves are only part of the
answer to solving Ulaanbaatar’s air quality
problems, the analysis in this strategy lead
to a conclusion that a higher share of the
urban population needs to have access
to cleaner stoves in order to sustain and
increase their contributions to air quality
improvements especially in Ulaanbaatar.
The strategy calls for not only expanding
to other urban markets but also for
introducing and enforcing standards
for small water heating boilers, which
have received little attention thus far. It
recognizes there are links between stove
markets in Ulaanbaatar and other aimag
centers. This can be a threat, but it can
also be an opportunity as described above.

     Box 1: Terminology
       In this report, the term “clean stoves” and “low emission stoves” are used interchangeably, so are
     “dirty stoves” and “traditional stoves”.
       Traditional stoves: rectangular steel stoves, originally designed for burning wood. With Nalaikh coal,
     the SEET lab showed that traditional stove emit about 600-700 mg/net MJ of PM2.5; with Baganuur
     coal this is 1400-1500 mg/net MJ.
       Low emission stoves: They emit less than 70 mg/net MJ of PM2.5, or a 90% reduction compared to
     traditional stoves operating on Nalaikh coal.
       Heating wall: a hollow, heat retaining wall that is connected to the stove, consisting of a combination
     of horizontal and vertical flue channels.
       Small water heating boilers: also called low pressure boilers. These are stoves with a heat exchanger
     and are used in somewhat larger houses; the working fluid is water that circulates through pipes and
     radiators to heat the house. More expensive systems use pumps to circulate the water, while others
     use the thermo syphon effect.

program’s design to transform the stove
market.
    This strategy has three sections following
this introduction. Chapter 2 is an analysis
of strengths and challenges of the stove
switching programs. Chapter 3 presents
the strategic objectives and plan. Chapter
4 presents a road map for implementing
the strategy.
    The strategy relies on several missions
observing Ulaanbaatar stove market as
well as one mission conducting a rapid
assessment of the stove market outside
Ulaanbaatar. In particular, the strategy
relies on the findings of a 1000 household
survey (referred to in the report as the CSI
survey) in the ger areas of Ulaanbaatar
as well as the rapid assessment in areas
outside Ulaanbaatar. The findings are
published in Mongolia: Heating Stove
Market Trends in Poor, Peri-Urban Ger
Areas of Ulaanbaatar and Selected Markets
Outside Ulaanbaatar (December 2013)
and translated into Mongolian. The 1000
household survey made use of a similar
1000 household survey conducted by the
Bank in 2009 (before any major stove
switching program). These two surveys
help to detect and describe impacts of the
stove switching program on the market and
user characteristics. The Survey’s findings
are reflected in this analysis.

     to connect consumers in ger areas of Ulaanbaatar to heating services producing less particulate emissions
     and to develop selected medium-term particulate abatement measures in Ulaanbaatar. The UBCAP has
     three components: A. Ger Area Particulate Matter Mitigation; B. Central Ulaanbaatar Particulate Matter
     Migration; and C. Public Awareness Raising, Program Coordination and Project Management. The results
     of the project will be measured by: (i) coverage of remaining HHs with eligible stoves; (ii) the number
     of studies for medium term pollution abatement measures prepared; (iii) number of days an air pollution
     coordination mechanism is functioning.

   Box 2 Low-emission stove market segments
      In order to successfully meet market demands, market segments need to be clearly defined. Markets
   for heating appliances, both in and outside Ulaanbaatar, consist of three distinct market segments:
   (i) stand-alone stoves used in gers (felt tents) and detached homes (made from wood and/or brick,
   occasionally with two levels, often poorly insulated); (ii) stoves attached to heating walls in medium-
   size detached homes; and (iii) SWHBs in larger detached homes with radiators and/or piped hot water
   systems in most rooms, which is the high-end of coal-fired heating appliances. Households in general
   use their heating stoves for most of their cooking, especially during the winter months, although some
   households with SWHBs also have another cooking appliance.


     From 2007-2012, the number of                        are the largest (73 m2).

    If policies to introduce alternative fuels
such as semi-coke coal are pursued, it is
imperative that the alternative fuels are
tested for emissions when burned in a
stove and that the results are made public.
This information helps evaluate estimated
impacts on emissions against program
costs. Mandating new fuels may also
require introducing new types of stoves that
are designed specifically for those fuels. If
the right stove is not paired with the right
fuel, emission reductions will differ. So far,
the government has provided significant
support to alternative fuel producers
(especially for semi-coke coal). Yet, the
CSI survey reveals that only 5 percent of
all households reported using semi-coke
coal on a regular basis. These include only
49 percent of households in the Bayangol
District where raw coal is formally banned.
Comparatively, 98 percent of households
in the six districts report using raw coal,
while 6 percent burn dried animal dung.
    In summary, support for different
possible air pollution solutions should be
based on PM emission performance of
fuel and stove combinations, in addition
to quality and fuel consumption criteria.
However, air pollution performance is more
stringent and takes precedence over other
criteria, which are normally satisfied for
well designed and built stoves. Households
should continue to be reminded that their
stoves need to be operated appropriately
to minimize emissions and maximize fuel
efficiency.

     to continue a rigorous quality control
     and verification system, which may
     be cost prohibitive when expanded
     nationally; and (iii) some households
     could have an incentive to sell their low-

appears to be necessary in the short-term
to gradually adjust distorted consumer
expectations so as to promote further
stove switching. Eliminating it in the short

   Box 3 Reassessing Principles of the Current Subsidy Scheme
      The current subsidy comprises 3 elements in principle; the value is justified based on future economic
   health benefits, which are considerable. In addition to air pollution benefits, these elements could
   be brought out more in public relations campaigns to raise public awareness of the rationale for the
   subsidy:
   (i)	 Replacement component; households hand in their old stove which represents a value to them;
   (ii)	Equalization component; to render the price of the low-e-stove similar to the traditional stove;
         households are able to purchase a traditional stove, so they should be able to buy a low-emission
         stove at that price level too;
   (iii)	Promotional component; to convince households to buy a low-emission stove now rather than in
         the future.

    Although there is a clear preference
among many government officials to
promote local production, the regulatory
framework should treat all producers and
models, whether imported or domestic,
even handedly. This will foster competition,
innovation and keep open doors to new
technologies and materials unavailable in
Mongolia. Currently, all low-emission stoves
are imported (except for one model) and
all dirty stoves are manufactured locally14.
    Stricter regulation will be easier to
apply for SWHB than for stoves. The prices
of SWHB are already fairly high and any
incremental costs due to regulation are
likely to be relatively low. Since many
SWHB are imported, it would be fairly
simple to immediately stop imports of
dirty SWHBs. It will be more difficult to
stop the local manufacturing of dirty
SWHB models, although it would fit well
in an effort to professionalize the heating
equipment market. A licensing procedure
is recommended to professionalize
local producers of SWHB and start
manufacturing only low-emission SWHB

     Box 4 Local Mongolian Manufacturing Capacity
       There are several different types of stove suppliers in Mongolia: (i) backyard/garage type of
     operators with a minimum of equipment and able to manufacture a few stoves per day; (ii) semi-
     industrial operators with a small metal workshop that is used for the production of stoves and other
     products, and able to manufacture a few 10s of stoves per day; and (iii) industrial operators. The
     industrial operators have modern production facilities and can easily produce different stove models at
     a capacity of 100 per day; their core business is to produce other products.
       The one Mongolian stove model that is eligible for support under UBCAP is produced in such an
     industrial production facility. The backyard/garage operators are not likely to be able to provide the
     quality and quantity required for large-scale dissemination of low-emission stoves. In general traditional
     stoves do not necessarily have quality issues even though they are produced in several backyard/
     garage facilities throughout town: the earlier 1000 household survey found that the typical life time
     of traditional stoves is 10 years. However, the production capacity is limited. Given the small number
     of new models over the years, innovative, small scale production is not possible from the existing
     backyard/garage producers. The suppliers will also not be able to quickly satisfy demand at scale.
       It may be worthwhile to explore if a production facility could be opened to a consortium of smaller
     producers that have developed eligible models. This idea has floated among stove producers and MUB
     for some time but was never realized. With the assistance of SDC, however this is an idea to pursue.

    In the long-run, if and when suppliers
become more professional, the Government
may wish to set up a licensing system to

    Box 5 The Sales and Distribution System in UB
       Producers and stove models are selected competitively, against specific criteria. Once selected,
    Producers sign a Producers Agreement with the Project Management Unit. The Producers Agreement
    sets the rules and responsibilities of suppliers, including minimum service standards, installation
    responsibilities and penalties for non-compliance. Producers have the right to sell their eligible models
    through Product Centers. Ineligible models and producers are excluded from the Product Centers.
       Product Centers are managed by a Distribution and Sales Agent (DSA). The DSA is XacBank who
    places representative in each PC to process paperwork, offer microloans for down payments, and
    record sales. In addition, NGO staff are available at each PC to provide consumers with product
    information. Customers make payments at XacBank branches, which transfer funds to producers.
    XacBank also collects emission reduction rights from customers and sells these rights to carbon
    markets. This covers only part of the costs of the PCs and the government, through the Clean Air
    Fund, pays an additional fee for its services. XacBank representatives at the PC also make an electronic
    record of installation (and removal of old stoves) by SMS when stoves are installed, recording the
    location. It maintains a database (accessible to the PMU) of sales, installations by model number and
    location that is frequently updated. Paperwork is forwarded to the Project Management Unit which is
    used as evidence, together with the electronic verification, for paying the consumer’s subsidy to the
    eligible stove supplier. The roles and responsibilities of the DSA are defined in a DSA Agreement signed
    between the DSA and the PMU. Verification of installation will be impossible for stoves sold during
    Phase 1 of the expansion program.
       Customers sign a User Agreement which defines the roles and responsibilities of households, including
    following the user manual, allowing the QAA to visit, and promising to use the stove and not resell it.
       Upon verified down payments by households, lists are sent to suppliers by the DSA and delivery
    schedules are arranged. As a part of their agreement, suppliers visit each household, install the new
    stove, train customers in lighting, refueling and use, and remove old stoves. Old stoves are deposited
    at collection sites managed by a company that transports them to a scrap metal and recycling facility
    in Darkhan. The installation and removal costs are included in the price of the stove. Stove disposal is
    commercially based with no additional charges to consumers or the government.
       A Quality Assurance Agent (QAA) is hired by the PMU to independently verify installation. It visits
    households at the point of installation, verifies their training and sends a separate report to the
    PMU. It also visits households a few months after installation to check on proper use and household
    satisfaction. It also makes spot checks by sending random units to the SEET laboratory for testing.
    Monitoring reports are provided to the PMU.
       A Project Management Unit is proposed to be established for the national program to supervise the
    program. The Ulaanbaatar city maintains a Steering Committee to govern the program.

level is low compared to the level applied
to previous years, when the subsidy was
90% of the price (that created unrealistic
market expectations of what a clean
stove might cost). The lower subsidy
level is suggested with the intention to
especially avoid market distortions and
give impetus to a sustainable supply.
Without a sustainable low-emission stove
supply, continued financial assistance will
be needed continuously and this should
be avoided. It is also based on cost
information obtained from stove suppliers
who confirmed that less expensive stove
models are available that can meet UB’s

    The advantage is that this system is
simple to administer. A QAA should check
part of the installations, with a larger
sample early on in the program and a
smaller sample once it is established that
the supplier operates correctly; monitoring
requirements are less stringent than under
the current program because the subsidy
level is much lower and in principle all
households are eligible. If the quality of
stoves from a certain supplier declines, he
will be warned and eventually disqualified
if the problems persist.
    Option c: incentive package
    In this scenario, support is provided
to suppliers during six month campaigns
for competitively selected stove models.
This might stimulate suppliers and keep
them alert, and it is simpler to control the
quality of the stoves. The variety of stoves
available for dissemination might be more
limited, and could change after every six
months. The price of the stoves to end-
users is likely to be lowest from the three
options.
    Six contracts are issued to the lowest
bidders, two each for three different supply
quantities over a 6 month period: 10,000
stoves, 5,000 stoves, and 1,000 stoves.
For each supply level, the supplier who
requests the lowest amount of subsidy will
be selected as well as the runner up. They
can sell their stoves during 6 months; the
sales levels are capped at the supply level
for which they submitted a bid, and they
receive their subsidy once they provided
proof of sale and installation of batches
of 100 stoves. The added advantage is
that the subsidy level may change (reduce)
after six months.
