      Policy Goals for Independent Private Schools                                                          Status
       1. Encouraging Innovation by Providers
          Policies allow independent private schools to make their own decisions on appointing,
          deploying, and dismissing teachers; schools determine teacher salary levels; schools set
          class size standards and determine the curricula. The only restriction placed on
          independent private schools requires them to follow centrally-mandated teacher
          certification standards to maintain active registration.

       2. Holding Schools Accountable
          Standardized exams are administered to select grades on an annual basis. However, no
          current policy stipulates that the results of these exams should be disaggregated. No
          standardized exams are administered at the primary level. Public and private schools are
          to be inspected on a “periodic basis.” As captured by current policy, schools are not
          required to submit improvement plans following an inspection.

       3. Empowering All Parents, Students, and Communities
          Although Ghana administers standardized exams at the junior and senior high school
          levels, there are no policies in place to guarantee parents access to the results of these
          exams. Likewise, parents are not provided information on the results of school
          inspections. Currently, students are interviewed as part of the school inspection protocol,
          but parents’ feedback is not included. The government does provide tax relief to parents
          for children to attend independent private schools.

       4. Promoting Diversity of Supply
          All types of providers—community, not-for-profit, for-profit and faith-based organizations—
          can operate private schools. There are neither standardized school fee schedules nor
          explicit restrictions on tuition; however, fees must be approved by the Ministry. Current
          policy allows the government to provide tax relief and/or subsidies to duly registered
          private education institutions. Public and private schools must meet relatively equivalent
          operating standards.

This report presents an analysis of how effectively
policies in Ghana engage the private sector in basic
(primary and secondary) education. Given that data
collection for this report took place in 2013, potential
policy options may either have diminished or have
varying relevance, depending on current circumstances

improving education systems.
The four policy goals enable a government to increase
innovation and strengthen accountability among the
critical actors in an education system (figure 2).
Empowering parents, students, and communities
enhances the ability of parents to express their voice and
hold policymakers accountable for results. Additionally,
when parents are empowered, in most contexts, they
can have greater influence over provider behaviors.
Increasing school accountability strengthens the quality-
and equity-assurance mechanisms between the state
and education providers. Encouraging innovation and
promoting diversity of supply can allow providers to
respond to local needs. Increasing school-level
autonomy in critical decisions improves the services
provided to students. Allowing a diverse set of providers
to enter the market can increase client power and enable
citizens to choose from a wider range of models. By
developing these policy goals, a government can
improve the accountability of all providers in an
education system and, subsequently, have a positive
impact on educational outcomes.

SABER-EPS recognizes that the four policy goals outlined
in box 1 can assist governments in raising accountability
for the education services provided in their countries.
The tool allows governments to systematically evaluate
their policies and implement practices that are effective
across multiple country contexts.

Four types of private provision of education
Across the world, governments can implement
numerous strategies to improve educational outcomes
by supporting non-state education provision. SABER-EPS
benchmarks key policy goals across the four most
common models of private service delivery:
    1. Independent private schools: schools that are
       owned and operated by non-government
       providers and are financed privately, typically
       through fees.
    2. Government-funded private schools: schools
       that are owned and operated by non-
       government providers, but receive government
       funding.
    3. Privately managed schools: schools that are
       owned and financed by the government, but
       are operated by non-government providers.
    4. Voucher schools: schools that students choose
       to attend with government-provided funding;
       these schools can be operated by the

include complementary basic education, the Capitation

in rural and marginalized areas to improve their access to

The National Literacy Accelerated Program (NALAP) is a
transitional bilingual literacy program in 11 Ghanaian
languages for implementation in grades KG–P3. The
NALAP curriculum and materials focus on improving
literacy through mother-tongue instruction in
kindergarten through third grade, with an early
transition to English.

Many of these programs have been hampered by
inconsistent resource targeting to the poorest students.
For example, in the case of the school feeding program,
only 21 percent of the outlays benefit the poor (Wodon
2011). Supply-side programs have also suffered from
program management issues (Darvas and Balwanz 2014).

A number of research studies find that poor
accountability in the public sector is a substantial barrier
to student learning. This includes problems such as
teacher tardiness, absenteeism, and limited instructional
time (Fobih, Akyeampong, and Koomson 1999; CARE
International 2003; World Bank 2004). As part of a 1993
decentralization, school management committees
(SMCs) were introduced. However, these bodies focus on
overseeing the use of capitation grants, not on
educational issues such as teacher absenteeism and
pedagogy. Recent efforts to implement school report
cards, school performance improvement plans, and
school performance assessment meetings show
promise, but evaluation of their effectiveness has not yet

Ghana’s Education Strategic Plan (ESP) 2010–2020
outlines the importance of the private sector in
supporting the government provision, and more
particularly, the financing of education services:

   “The ESP identifies several areas where increased
   efficiency, cost sharing, and decentralization provide
   cost-savings to the Government of Ghana…. Increased
   need to secure finance[ing] via fundraising at
   decentralized levels, cost sharing at government-
   funded public schools (especially at the post-basic
   levels), and increased growth of private schools will
   likely be features of a system, realizing significant
   enrollment expansion in all sub-sectors over the next
   decade.” (Ghana MOE 2010).

As part of its efforts to tap into the financial resources of
the private sector, the ESP specifies that support will be
provided “to primary and JH [junior high] schools by
providing non-salary inputs (e.g. textbooks) and in-
service training” (Ghana MOEYS 2004).

The Ghanaian government also subsidizes fees for the
Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) in private
as well as public schools. This exam is used to determine
which students are eligible to proceed from junior to
senior high school. In 2012, the combined cost of these
public and private subsidies was US$ 4.2 million (Ghana
MOF 2013).

for independent private schools, i.e., those that are

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
       initiative collects data on the policies and institutions of education
       systems around the world and benchmarks them against practices
       associated with student learning. SABER aims to give all parties
       with a stake in educational results—from students, administrators,
       teachers, and parents to policymakers and business people—an
       accessible, detailed, objective snapshot of how well the policies of
       their country's education system are oriented toward ensuring that
       all children and youth learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies of engaging the private
       sector in education.
