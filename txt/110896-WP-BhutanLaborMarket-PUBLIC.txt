EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

COUNTRY CONTEXT
The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) places great emphasis on the creation of a sufficient
number of high-quality jobs to achieve full employment. The vision of Bhutan’s Ministry of Labour and
Human Resources is “a Nation where all its citizen have the opportunity for a gainful and quality employment
characterized by harmonious and productive relationship in the workplace and the broader community,”
while the goal of Bhutan’s National Employment Policy is “the achievement of full, productive, meaningful,
gainful and decent employment for the people of Bhutan, which shall drive the country towards achieving
high levels of human development and contribute to the maximization of the Gross National Happiness.” To
achieve Bhutan’s target of full employment, new jobs for approximately 120,000 job seekers entering the
labor market need to be created during the period of the country’s 11th Five-Year Plan (2013 to 2018).
This report aims to provide robust evidence to inform the RGoB’s policy-making with regard to
critical labor market challenges, underlying causes and potential solutions. Building on a conceptual
framework introduced in the World Bank’s World Development Report 2013: Jobs, the analysis takes into
account policy fundamentals that are essential for both growth and job creation, labor market policies that
can help ensure that growth translates into employment opportunities and a list of policy priority areas where
jobs might do the most for development given Bhutan’s specific country context. The report relies primarily
on two data sources that provide recent robust and complementary information on labor supply and demand
in Bhutan: First, the Bhutan Labour Force Survey (BLFS) 2014, a representative labor force survey with a
newly expanded questionnaire that was implemented by the MoLHR with support from the World Bank.
Second, the Bhutan Enterprise Survey (BES) 2015, a survey of firms conducted by the World Bank that
improved the understanding of the conditions, experiences and perspectives of Bhutan’s nonfarm private
firms. The report also uses evidence from previous studies, legal documents, and discussions with experts and
stakeholders from Bhutan and beyond.
In recent decades, Bhutan has seen rapid, sustained economic growth and broad-based, inclusive
poverty reduction. Bhutan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita reached Nu 156,267 ($2,560 at
current exchange rates) in 2014. Bhutan is now officially classified by the World Bank as a lower-middle
income country. Between 2007 and 2012, the proportion of Bhutan’s population with consumption below the
official poverty line dropped by half (from 23 per cent in 2007 to 12 per cent in 2012). Over the same period
Bhutan’s extreme poverty rate, measured by the international poverty line of $1.90 a day declined from 8
percent to 2 percent. Multidimensional poverty indices and indicators related to education and health
outcomes have also improved significantly in recent years.
In the next few years, Bhutan’s potential for hydropower generation will present tremendous
development opportunities. Bhutan’s terrain comprises steep mountains crisscrossed by snow-fed rivers
with considerable hydropower generation potential of an estimated 30,000 megawatts (MW). Of this
potential, 1,606 MW are already operational. An additional 3,153 MW are projected to be on line in 2018,
with another 2,170 MW following shortly. The development of Bhutan’s hydropower generation capacity will
have a direct impact on several key macroeconomic indicators. In particular, it is expected to lead to a large
increase in export revenues and sustained economic growth. The World Bank forecasts that electricity export
earnings will jump from less than Nu 20 billion in 2015 ($300 million at current exchange rates) to more than
Nu 67 billion in 2019 and Nu 145 billion in 2025. The contribution of hydropower to economic growth will
mostly come from the boost it will give to aggregate demand during the construction phase of the different
projects and the additional revenue these projects will generate at the time of commissioning. Between 2013

and 2019, hydropower generation is expected to add an additional percentage point to Bhutan’s annual
economic growth. Taking into account the hydropower projects in the pipeline and under construction,
Bhutan’s GDP per capita is forecast to double within about 15 years, reaching $6,000 by 2030. The
development of the hydropower industry is also expected to contribute to continued rapid poverty reduction
(Figure 1).

At the same time, hydropower development risks exacerbating existing labor market challenges, in
particular with regard to sectoral imbalances. General challenges created or exacerbated by hydropower
development are likely to include macroeconomic management and reinvesting natural resource revenues into
national assets (infrastructure, human capital and institutions). In addition, hydropower development will
make some labor market challenges that are already apparent today more pressing, especially in sectors that
do not directly benefit from the money that is projected to flow into Bhutan. Already, the nonfarm private
sector faces difficulty being competitive and attracting well-qualified labor. Once the planned massive
hydropower projects come on stream these difficulties will likely worsen due to overall higher labor costs.
Moreover, workers in the informal, rural and agricultural part of the economy risk falling even further behind.
Supported by Bhutan’s advantageous development trajectory, its current labor market conditions
appear favorable compared to those in many other lower-middle income countries. In 2014, around 62
percent of Bhutan’s population aged 15 and older was part of the labor force. This meant that Bhutan was
better able than many other lower-middle income countries to make good use of the economic potential
offered by its population. Bhutan’s current overall unemployment rate of 2.6 percent is relatively modest by
international standards. Recently, there have also been trends toward almost universal enrollment in primary
education and rapidly increasing enrollment rates in secondary and tertiary education. In fact, among all South
Asian economies, the most significant change in primary net enrollment rates between 2001 and 2010 took
place in Bhutan. Over a single decade, Bhutan’s primary net enrollment rate increased by 30 percentage
points to 88 percent. In parallel, the country’s secondary gross enrollment rate increased from under 40
percent to around 70 percent. Recently, an ever greater emphasis has been placed on tertiary education.

Bhutan’s positive labor statistics hide important challenges, including declining rates of
participation in the labor force and pockets of unemployment and quantitative and qualitative
underemployment. Labor force participation rates have been steadily declining in recent years, dropping
from 69 percent in 2010 to 63 percent in 2014. The decline in labor force participation has been particularly
steep for women. This is a common phenomenon in lower-middle income countries. In low income
countries, most able-bodied adults must work to sustain their household’s livelihood, whereas the relative
prosperity of lower-middle income countries makes it possible for some adults to become homemakers. In
Bhutan, the decline in labor force participation rates might have been reinforced by the insufficient
availability of child care services. Besides the declining labor force participation rates, Bhutan’s labor market
includes pockets of unemployment and underemployment. Unemployment is a concern for the young, urban,
relatively well-educated and well-off. While quantitative underemployment is not high by international
standards, it is prevalent among younger workers and women. In 2014, among women the underemployment
rate reached 1.5 percent; among workers aged 15 to 24 it stood at 1.9 percent. There are also widespread
reports of qualitative underemployment, that reports of workers being employed in jobs that do not make the
best use of their qualifications and skills.
Informal labor is a particular concern as it is widespread among the general population and endemic
in certain groups, such as individuals with low education, from rural areas, and from poor
households. Bhutan still remains a largely rural and agrarian economy. Typically for such an economy, the
ratio of informal employment to total employment is relatively high. World Bank staff estimates put the
informal labor rate at around 80 percent. The proportion of informal jobs is highest among workers with no
schooling, at 93 percent. Informal labor is also closely related to poverty. Nearly all, 98 percent, of workers
from households in the poorest quintile engage in informal work. Informal employment is frequently seen as
a concern because informal workers tend to be less productive and lack social protection. Government
policies meant to improve the living conditions of workers rarely reach the informal economy.
Bhutan’s labor market challenges with regard to unemployment, underemployment and informality
can be traced back to the stratification of its labor market. The stratification of the labor market into
three segments—the public sector, the private non-agricultural sector and the private agricultural sector—is
reinforced by labor market regulations, particularly those regarding foreign labor, and by some social
protection programs that are biased toward the public sector, formal employment and urban areas. Given the
major hydropower projects coming on stream in the next few years, now is the time for Bhutan to decide
how to manage the proceeds from hydropower development and labor market stratification.


LABOR MARKET CHALLENGES
Notwithstanding Bhutan’s unique qualities, it may be characterized as a country that is rich in
natural resources, agrarian and urbanizing as well as sharing some traits with small island nations.
According to the systematic classification proposed by the World Bank Jobs report. Bhutan is an “agrarian”
economy. More than half, 60 percent, of its population lives in rural areas where work consists mainly of
small-scale and subsistence agriculture and related industries, and is thus mostly informal. In addition, Bhutan
is classified as an “urbanizing” economy, since the share of the population in urban areas has risen by a rather
significant 8 percentage points over the last ten years. Urbanizing economies frequently struggle to integrate
rural-to-urban migrants into urban labor markets, and therefore see higher unemployment rates in urban
areas as compared to rural ones. Following the classification of the Jobs report, Bhutan is also a resource-rich
country. In 2012, minerals (including electricity) accounted for 43 percent of the country’s exports. This
proportion is expected to increase more in the future. Resource-rich countries often have substantial foreign
exchange earnings but sometimes struggle to translate this wealth into the creation of a sufficient number of
jobs that guarantee living standards, improve productivity and foster social cohesion. While Bhutan is of


                                                      - xi -
course not an island, to some extent it also shares the characteristics of small island nations, in particular a
small size and remote location. These lead to a relatively high cost base for any kind of productive activity,
especially for activities oriented toward external markets. This means that diversification of the economy and
the export base are more difficult to achieve in Bhutan than in some other countries.
This multi-faceted classification calls for analyzing possible links, conflicts, and complementarities
between any proposed recommendations. In Bhutan, an urban-rural gap exists, especially with respect to
poverty, food security and access to formal sector jobs and services. This gap is closely linked to the
prevalence of agricultural jobs in rural areas, as opposed to non-agricultural jobs in urban centers. Globally,
the private sector is the main engine of job creation and the source of almost nine out of every ten new jobs.
A prosperous private, non-agricultural sector is seen by many as an important engine of growth, development
and jobs that can gradually improve firms’ productivity and workers’ living standards and protection. While
Bhutan’s agricultural sector is shrinking in relative terms, it is still large and will continue to dominate
employment for years to come. Through hydropower development, natural resources offer a strong growth
and revenue driver which, if well managed, can support a broad-based and inclusive growth path for
Bhutanese society. Being small, remote and landlocked also calls for a particular set of measures. As noted
previously, like small island states, Bhutan’s geographic limits on productivity and growth pose challenges to
raising and sustaining the demand for and supply of human capital.
Bhutan’s labor market has been stratified into the public sector, the private non-agricultural sector
and the private agricultural sector. The public sector accounts for about a fifth of all jobs and almost half
of the jobs outside agriculture. General government employment—a subsector of the public sector that
includes the civil service, other government agencies and the armed forces but not public/government
companies—accounts for more than three-quarters of public sector employment and for one-seventh of all
jobs. As only 43 percent of Bhutan’s workers are employed outside agriculture, and public sector employment
is entirely non-agricultural, almost half of all jobs outside agriculture are in the public sector. Public sector
workers have relatively secure, well-paying jobs and access to education- and labor-related social protection
programs. The sector employs a large number of young, relatively well-educated and well-off individuals,
often in urban areas. The second segment of the labor market, and by far the largest, is the agricultural sector.
In 2014, 57 percent of workers were active in agriculture. This sector provides low salaries, few fringe
benefits, and restricted access to education- and labor-related social protection programs. It mostly employs
less educated workers from poorer households in rural parts of the country and also serves as an alternative
source of employment for those struggling to find work elsewhere. The third segment of the market is the
private non-agricultural sector, which in many ways lies between the two other sectors. The sector has
struggled to develop, largely because of competition for well-educated workers from the public sector but
also because of its high cost base and insufficient productivity. It remains underdeveloped and accounts for
only a quarter of all jobs, barely more than half of those outside agriculture.
Workers in the public sector are generally younger, more urban and from richer families than
workers in the nonfarm private sector, who are in turn generally younger, more urban and richer
than workers in agriculture. In a small country like Bhutan, a large public sector can prevent the emergence
of a vibrant nonfarm private sector as it reduces the number of workers available and able to work in this
sector. Since a majority of the Bhutan’s relatively few highly educated workers are in the public sector, the
problem appears particularly acute for the country. Among workers without formal education, 75 percent are
employed in the agricultural sector, 19 percent in the nonfarm private sector, and 6 percent in the public
sector. Among workers with tertiary education, the pattern is the opposite. Sixty-six percent of workers with
tertiary education are employed by the public sector, 32 percent are employed in the private sector outside
agriculture, and less than two percent in agriculture. Age and location are two other variables with striking
differences between the three sectors. For instance, 48.3 percent of public sector workers are age 15 to 34 and



                                                     - xii -
only 4.3 percent of workers are 55 or older. In the nonfarm private sector 49.5 percent of workers are under
35, while 10.1 of workers in this sector are older than 55. Among workers in agriculture, 30.4 percent of them
are younger than 35 and 26.1 older than 55. With regard to location, 52.4 percent of private sector jobs
outside agriculture and 98.4 percent of private sector jobs in agriculture are located in rural parts of Bhutan.
Less than one third—32.6 percent—of public sector jobs are located in rural areas (Figure 2).

Decent earnings, job security, high productivity and other attributes that make a job attractive are
most widespread in the public sector and least common in agriculture. The private nonfarm economy
takes up a middling position. While some differences between the three sectors in job attributes can be traced
back to the distinct characteristics of workers in each sector, this can only explain part of the picture. Even
when controlling for workers’ characteristics, significant differences remain. For instance, the prevalence of
self-employment, casual and regular work differs significantly between the public and the private sector. An
overwhelming majority of public sector jobs are for regular paid employees, whereas the private sector offers
a much smaller proportion of this type of jobs. In the public sector, 94 percent of jobs are for regular paid
employees. In the private sector, 27 percent of jobs outside agriculture and a negligible proportion of jobs
inside agriculture are filled by regular paid employees. Instead, the private sector makes much greater use of
other job types, in particular self-employed workers outside agriculture (47 percent) and unpaid family
workers in agriculture (64 percent).
The private nonfarm sector is squeezed by competition from the public sector, a high cost base,
insufficient productivity, and stringent labor market regulations constraining the availability of
foreign labor. One outcome of the public sector’s dominance in the labor market is widespread queuing for
public sector jobs, which in turn is a major reason for the relatively high unemployment rate among young,
well-educated and well-off city dwellers. Unemployment rates are higher for exactly the population groups
that are prevalent in the public sector and prefer public sector jobs (especially young individuals in urban
areas with a relatively high level of education). Quantitative and anecdotal evidence confirms that a number of

unemployed individuals do not take up private sector job offers because they would prefer to work in the
public sector.
Some of Bhutan’s social protection programs reinforce existing imbalances between public, the
private nonfarm and private agricultural sectors. Education- and labor-related social programs are
accessed first by households headed by public sector workers, second by nonfarm private sector workers, and
lastly by farm workers. Although free education is used in relatively even proportion by all three groups,
benefits from work, government scholarships, subsidized college education and education loans are all more
widely accessed by households whose head works in the public sector than by other households. For instance,
stipends for skills training can improve workers’ productivity and allow them to secure better jobs. But
whereas 21 percent of households headed by public sector employees use such stipends, only 6 percent of
households headed by private sector nonfarm workers and only 3 percent of households headed by
agricultural employees do (Figure 3).

Similarly, labor regulations, particularly restrictions on hiring foreign workers, have made labor
scarcer by limiting the private sector’s access to labor from outside Bhutan. In principle, private
nonfarm enterprises might react to competition from the public sector by hiring foreign workers. In practice,
this is not always straightforward. As a consequence, many view restrictive immigration rules as a significant
obstacle to their operations. In fact, the exact same types of firms that account for most of the jobs in
Bhutan’s nonfarm private sector are also those that are most constrained by the country’s immigration rules.
According to a recent World Bank Enterprise Survey among nonfarm private enterprises in Bhutan, a
plurality of jobs in this sector are created by relatively large companies; relatively large companies are in turn
those affected most by restrictive immigration policies. Large companies with at least 100 workers account
for 49 percent of jobs in the nonfarm private sector, and 47 percent of these companies complain about the
restrictiveness of immigration rules. Medium-sized firms with 20 to 99 workers account for a smaller
proportion of jobs (24 percent of jobs) and a smaller proportion of these firms (32 percent) say they are
constrained by immigration rules. Small firms with five to 19 workers and microenterprises with fewer than

five workers together account for only 25 percent of all jobs in the nonfarm private sector and less than 30

THE WAY FORWARD
In the years to come, the impact of hydropower construction and generation on the availability and
quality of jobs will need to be consciously managed. Even when investments in extractive industries
represent a sizable fraction of a developing country’s GDP and lead to spectacular increases in export
revenue, they tend not to create many jobs. Countries have basically followed two distinct strategies to spread
the wealth resulting from natural resources. The first option is a public-sector-led development path that
places citizens in well-paid public sector jobs. Alternatively, they take a private-sector-led development path,
aiming to create jobs outside of the extractive industries and to develop a diversified economy. Further
complicating the calculation, Bhutan is in the distinct situation of being not only resource-rich but also
agrarian, and it shares similarities with small islands. Therefore, the agricultural sector will deserve
considerable attention for years to come.
Some countries confronted with resource booms have successfully followed a private-sector-led
development path. Norway offers what may be the most famous example of a resource-rich country that
has successfully followed a private-sector-led development path. With strong backing from the labor
movement, centralized collective bargaining agreements ensure that real wage growth is moderate. Wage
moderation supports employment opportunities for everybody, to the point that the unemployment rate
remained close to three percent during the recent global financial crisis. Norway’s oil revenue is used for long-
term investments rather than being immediately converted into higher labor earnings or public sector jobs.
Norway is also well-known for its comprehensive welfare state and considerable investments in education and
training. Among resource-rich countries elsewhere, the United Arab Emirates has also managed to follow a
private-sector-led development path and to diversify its economy through financial and logistics services.


                                                               - xv -
Many states around the Persian Gulf have taken a different, public-sector-led path, making national
citizens direct beneficiaries of their resource bonanza through well-paid jobs in the public sector. In
most states around the Persian Gulf, the general government sector and public enterprises account for more
than 60 percent of all formal sector employment, while the formal private sector is rather small. For instance,
employment in the formal private sector is almost nonexistent in Iraq and below ten percent of total
employment in Egypt. While the public-sector-led development path has enabled a large proportion of the
population to benefit from resource rents, it has also had unintended negative consequences. In many states
around the Persian Gulf, public sector jobs are rationed and some groups, such as women and youth, have
less access to them than do older males (and those with good connections). In addition, menial jobs are
routinely performed by immigrants on temporary contracts who receive modest pay and benefits. As a result,
public sector jobs have become a window to rent sharing for some but do not give a stake in society to
others.
Now is the time for Bhutan to choose between three very different development paths: public-sector-
led, private-sector-led or balanced. So far, Bhutan has mostly followed a public-sector-led development
path. Today, it is in a similar situation to other resource-rich countries that have made citizens the direct
beneficiaries of their resource bonanza through well-paid jobs in the public sector. For a long time, Bhutan’s
public sector has been seen as the most desirable sector for those aspiring to a successful career. Even today,
the majority of young, urban and relatively well-educated and well-off workers in Bhutan are either employed
in the public sector or aspire to secure a public sector job. To a certain extent, hydropower development
would make it possible for Bhutan to continue along a public-sector-led development path. The likely
outcomes would be continued dominance of labor by the public sector, sustained challenges for Bhutan’s
fledgling private nonfarm enterprises, continued divergence between the situation of public sector workers
and workers in the informal, agricultural sector, and possibly challenges in the medium term to social
cohesion, due to an insufficient number of well-paid public sector jobs.
Hydropower development creates a window of opportunity to set out on an alternative, more
balanced development path. The objective of balanced development would not be to weaken the public
sector but to allow more nonfarm private sector jobs to emerge and prosper to support the creation of a
growing number of private-sector jobs that secure living standards, increase productivity and foster social
cohesion. In this context, returns from Bhutan’s natural resources would not be used to create of well-paid
public sector jobs but instead to finance social programs, social protection programs, labor market programs
or other initiatives that will support the path to a new equilibrium and sustainable development for
generations to come. For Bhutan to pursue a balanced development path, a comprehensive approach to
sectoral rebalancing will be needed. Rebalancing would strengthen the relative position of workers in the
private non-agricultural sector compared to the public sector and could not omit the many workers in the
private agricultural sector. While a balanced development path holds promise, it would not be entirely without
risks. Some resource-rich countries that have refrained from following a public-sector led development path
have diversified their export base. Because of Bhutan’s high cost base and specific geographic situation, this
will be a tougher option for the country.


RECOMMENDATIONS
Only a concerted effort to establish interlinked and complementary policy reforms will assure that
Bhutan is firmly on track to balanced development. In contrast, partial reforms are likely to be less
successful and to face more difficult obstacles. For example, rebalancing the earnings gap between the public
and the private sector by slowing the pace of wage increase in the public sector might well make younger,
well-educated workers available to the nonfarm private sector. But unless that sector also has easier access to
low-skilled workers (either from Bhutan or abroad) and opportunities to grow and develop, reducing the


                                                    - xvi -
earnings gap will ultimately not create more private sector jobs. A comprehensive package of policy reforms
would address a range of interlinked and complementary areas, including labor demand (both by the private
and the public sector); labor supply (education, skills); social protection; and labor market policies, programs
and interventions.
The foremost recommendation is to redefine the balance between the public and private sectors by
providing demand-side opportunities for the private sector to grow, as laid out in the recent World
Bank Macroeconomic and Public Finance Note (World Bank 2015a). Today, Bhutan’s young people
vote with their feet in preferring public over private sector jobs. To rebalance the jobs market, government
must encourage and support private sector growth. With large hydropower revenues flowing into the
Treasury in the coming years, the public sector will have to crowd in private sector jobs by deliberately
creating “smart partnerships” between the public and the private sector. As revenues will flow into Bhutan,
the prices of non-tradable goods and services (such as land and real estate) will increase relative to the price of
tradable goods (such as food or software), constraining private sector competitiveness in external markets.
Policy reforms aimed at developing a more supportive investment climate can partially offset this
disadvantage but may turn out to be insufficient in light of the magnitude of the inflows Bhutan will receive.
Thus, a pro-active public finance approach supporting the emergence of a private sector is needed as well.
New approaches to procurement of infrastructure building and maintenance can deliver very
positive results. Many private sector companies work as contractors for the government, and because they
need to play by the rules to be eligible for government contracts, they provide jobs complying with labor
regulations. Outsourcing a larger proportion of non-core government activities, such as maintenance or IT
services, could also go a long way toward providing new opportunities for the private sector at the same time
that it would increase spending efficiency. Bhutan’s experience in these areas has not been encouraging so far,
but to some extent this reflects problems with the design of public procurement, rather than with the
approach.
While outsourcing at the margin can lead to failure, the government could be proactive in generating
the scale necessary to brings costs down, and in designing tenders in a way that addresses imperfect
competition. This can be accomplished by consolidating purchases across agencies. An area in which the
government could reach the scale needed to elicit a competitive private sector response is in the framework
agreements for IT services. Greater scale can be attained by relying on multi-year framework agreements
instead of individual transactions to procure goods and services. Importantly, the benchmarking of eligible
bids relative to competitive prices would provide a safeguard to avoid proceeding with potentially costly
tenders. Border prices—including import duties and taxes—can be used as the price ceiling whenever
possible.
Recent years have seen the emergence of a wide range of public-private partnerships (PPPs), with
varied degrees of risk taken by the private and public sectors. “Smart partnerships” between the private
and public sectors can take a variety of forms, ranging, for example, from concessions to public service
contracts (PSCs). The latter define rights and obligations between a public entity (such as a government or
municipality) and a public or private provider, including the formula for the service payments made to the
provider in return for the delivery of services. PSCs should also make provision for capital investments.
Arrangements of this sort are being increasingly used with success in the public transport sector in Eastern
Europe. Bhutan could usefully explore entering into such PSCs for public urban transport or with other
public organizations which receive public subsidies.
Improving the private sector’s access to labor, both unskilled and skilled, is paramount. The private
sector suffers from skills shortages and mismatches, while two-thirds of workers with tertiary education are


                                                      - xvii -
employed in the public sector. This situation limits the development of a vibrant private sector and the
creation of more well-paying and otherwise desirable private sector jobs. To address this issue, investments in
improving the quality of education and training (preschool, tertiary and professional) and increasing access to
it are needed. Greater education will improve workers’ job prospects and productivity and ultimately
stimulate private sector employment. Bhutan could also benefit from making sure education and training
interventions incorporate the development of core technical skills (such as computer skills) and soft skills
(such as leadership and team work skills) that many employers currently see as insufficiently established.
Equalizing public sector compensation packages with nonfarm private sector packages is necessary
to make private sector jobs as attractive as public jobs. Keeping adjustments of public sector wages
modest to allow private sector wages to catch up will be an important element of balancing Bhutan’s
development. Today, compensation packages are more generous for the public sector than the private sector.
For instance, while the majority of workers should be entitled to receive a range of different fringe benefits, in
fact such coverage is incomplete. Public sector workers are more likely to receive all types of benefits. For
each of 8 fringe benefits covered in the BLFS 2014, coverage among public sector workers easily exceeds 90
percent, but only between around 25 percent and 65 percent of private sector workers receive each particular
benefit. It is recommended that public and private sector compensation packages be gradually aligned by
ensuring that public sector wages grow at a modest pace, at most in line with private sector wages.
Fringe benefits and pension coverage need to be gradually aligned between the public and the
nonfarm private sector. Even though fringe benefits and pensions are mandated by law, only a relatively
small share of Bhutan’s private sector workers can avail themselves of tips, gratuity, provident fund payments,
overtime payments, paid leave (annual, sick, casual or parental) and compensation for work accidents or
occupational diseases. Public awareness campaigns and greater efforts to enforce existing labor regulations
could help align benefits between the public and the private sector. At the same time, it is important not to
overburden the formal or semi-formal private sector with regulations that would put it at a disadvantage
compared to the significant part of the private sector that is informal and does not necessarily follow
regulations. Therefore, reductions in fringe benefits offered to public sector workers that are not legally
mandated—such as free or subsidized housing—might ultimately be necessary.
The overly generous pension scheme is a major factor skewing the compensation balance towards
employment in the public sector. Previous studies have found that the pension wealth that accumulates
over a full career is equivalent to roughly 14 times the workers’ wage. (In South Asia, only Sri Lanka showed a
higher figure). Were this to be taken into account as an annual flow of deferred compensation it would result
in a significant public-private wage differential. Moreover, the defined benefit scheme will eventually run
deficits if not reformed. Parametric reforms to reduce the mismatch between long run revenues and
expenditures would also reduce the gap between public and private sector compensation.
Expanding pension coverage is an important long run objective but expanding the public sector
scheme to private sector workers will simply create a larger tax wedge and may promote informality.
One alternative would be to promote voluntary participation in defined contribution scheme through
matching contributions aimed to benefit lower income workers in particular. Matching contributions (as
opposed to tax deductions) have been introduced in a number of countries including China and India and
have the potential for reaching both formal and informal private sector workers with some capacity to save.
In light of the fundamental change in the revenue outlook since the inception of the pension scheme
in 2001, the government may want to reconsider the current contribution rate model for both public
and private sector workers. After decades of low coverage, many countries are moving away from the
traditional Bismarckian social insurance model and delinking pensions and health insurance from
employment status. A broad social pension scheme would not only ensure coverage but would also encourage

the demand and supply of labor in the formal private sector relative to an expanded payroll tax-financed
scheme.
Bhutan’s nonfarm private sector needs more predictable, systematic access to foreign labor to
compensate for the shortage of domestic labor, both skilled and unskilled. As mentioned above, many
firms see the restrictiveness of immigration rules as a significant obstacle to their operations. What is more, in
many cases the skills of Bhutanese and non-Bhutanese workers complement each other. Many foreign
workers either have specialized qualifications that Bhutanese workers lack or are willing to perform tasks in
which Bhutanese workers are reluctant to engage. This means smarter regulation of non-Bhutanese workers
would actually also increase the employment prospects of Bhutanese workers and reinforce the positive
impacts of other policies that address the domestic supply of labor (in particular an expansion of quality
education). Based on international best practices, three broad principles could guide policymakers in Bhutan
to develop an orderly, well-regulated process to manage economic immigration. First, the process should be
market-driven: that is, immigration flows should be aligned with labor market demands as well as with
Bhutan’s overall economic, social and cultural objectives. Second, it should be comprehensive: a
comprehensive immigration system would recognize the need for immigrants of different types but also
differentiate among these types. Third, it should be balanced: it should seek to maximize the employment of
Bhutanese citizens and minimize any negative impacts of immigration on Bhutanese workers while also
protecting immigrant workers from mistreatment or abuse.
Creating a national social assistance system as a unified mechanism for the sharing of rents will be
instrumental in supporting the rebalancing of the agricultural, nonfarm private and public sectors.
While universal access to free education and healthcare benefits the whole population and Bhutan’s social
protection programs are generally progressive, ensuring protection of all workers would require an enhanced
focus on workers in the informal economy, particularly in small-scale and subsistence agriculture. For rural
households, a large majority of risks to income, assets and food consumption are climate- or weather-related.
Therefore, the expansion of measures that encourage savings among agricultural households as well as the
introduction and scale-up of agricultural insurance is critical. Equally critical is to ensure that those who are
no longer able to work in agriculture for physical reasons receive income support, allowing them to live at a
minimum standard. There is also a need to gradually modernize and expand existing social assistance
programs. For example, it would be useful to expand the Targeted Household Poverty Programme and link
its database with that of other social protection programs. The modernization of social assistance programs
could be guided by an expansion of the evidence base around the impacts of existing programs through
increased monitoring and impact assessments.
Combined with more effective active labor market programs, an income support program could
contribute to a “flexicurity” approach that protects and fosters formalization and nonfarm private
sector jobs. Today, Bhutan already has relatively flexible employment protection legislation. Combined with
the introduction of an income support program for unemployed private sector workers, the launch of more
effective active labor market programs (including more thorough and tailored employment services), could
have significant impact on workers’ formalization and their interest in private sector jobs. Under this scenario:
First, employment protection legislation would continue to be used mainly to safeguard core labor standards.
Second, the income support program would be financed out of general government revenues to minimize
disincentives for formalization. Third, active labor market programs would support retraining and job search
assistance for job seekers. Such a “flexicurity” approach might give more workers the confidence to take on
the risks inherent with any private sector job and pursue employment opportunities in the private as opposed
to the public sector.
Coordinated enactment of interlinked and complementary policy reforms will help overcome barriers
to the enactment of reforms and maximize their expected impacts. Some of the proposed policy


                                                     - xix -
options can be expected to have a greater impact than others. Moreover, some will be easier to implement in
terms of both technical challenges and political economy hurdles. Enacting reforms that interlink and
complement each other simultaneously could be expected to maximize their impact, help overcome some
barriers to implementation and put Bhutan on a firm track to balanced development. At the same time,
practical considerations might make it necessary to pursue a staggered reform process. Should this be the
case, it would be advisable to begin with reforms that lay the groundwork for other reforms, are relatively
easy to implement and promise high impact. Once these reforms are in place, they will build momentum for
the subsequent pursuit of policy options that are more difficult to implement or that require more analysis
(Table 1).

BHUTAN’S LABOR MARKET:
TOWARD GAINFUL QUALITY
EMPLOYMENT FOR ALL
1 INTRODUCTION

1.1   BACKGROUND
1.     The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) places great emphasis on the creation of a sufficient
number of high-quality jobs for its citizens. The vision of Bhutan’s Ministry of Labour and Human
Resources (MoLHR) is “a Nation where all its citizen have the opportunity for a gainful and quality
employment characterized by harmonious and productive relationship in the workplace and the broader
community.” The goal of Bhutan’s National Employment Policy is “the achievement of full, productive,
meaningful, gainful and decent employment for the people of Bhutan, which shall drive the country towards
achieving high levels of human development and contribute to the maximization of the Gross National
Happiness”. Accordingly, to achieve the country’s target of full employment—defined as an unemployment
rate of not more than 2.5 percent—new jobs for approximately 120,000 job seekers entering the labor market
need to be created during the period of Bhutan’s Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2013 to 2018). Sixty percent of job
seekers entering the labor market during this period will have completed at least ten years of schooling. They
will seek jobs commensurate with their educational level. (GNHC 2013).
2.     This report aims to provide robust evidence to inform RGoB policy making on labor market
issues. It uses new evidence on labor demand and supply to delve into the fundamental challenges
constraining the availability and quality of jobs in Bhutan. The report identifies significant and urgent
labor market challenges, the causes underlying these challenges and potential solutions. It focuses on four
issues that are key for Bhutan’s labor market: imbalances between the public and the private sector, barriers
to private sector development, labor market policies and social protection for workers. Building on a
conceptual framework introduced in the World Bank’s World Development Report 2013: Jobs (World Bank
2012d), the analysis takes into account policy fundamentals that are essential for both growth and job
creation, labor market policies that can help ensure that growth translates into employment opportunities and
policy priority areas where jobs might do the most for development, given Bhutan’s specific country context.
3.    In recent decades Bhutan has seen rapid, sustained economic growth and broad-based,
inclusive poverty reduction. Bhutan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita reached Nu 156,267
($2,560 at current exchange rates) in 2014 according to the World Development Indicators, and Bhutan is
now officially classified as a lower-middle income country. As noted by the National Statistics Bureau (NSB)
and the World Bank (2014), between 2007 and 2012 the proportion of Bhutan’s population below the official
poverty line dropped by half (from 23 per cent in 2007 to 12 per cent in 2012). Over the same time period
Bhutan’s extreme poverty rate, measured by the international poverty line of $1.90 a day, declined from 8 to 2
percent. Multidimensional poverty indices and indicators related to education and health outcomes have also
seen significant improvement in recent years, and Bhutan has become more and more integrated into the
global economy.

4.     Bhutan continues to develop rapidly and the country’s hydropower generation potential raises
the prospect of tremendous development opportunities in the future. Bhutan’s terrain comprises steep
mountains crisscrossed by snow-fed rivers with considerable hydropower generation potential of an estimated
30,000 megawatts (MW). As detailed in World Bank (2015a), of this potential 1,606 MW are already
operational and an additional 3,153 MW are projected to be online in 2018, with another 2,170 MW following
shortly thereafter. The development of hydropower generation capacity will have a direct impact on several
key macroeconomic indicators. In particular, it is expected to lead to a large increase in export revenues and
sustained economic growth. The World Bank (2015a) forecasts that electricity export earnings will jump from
less than Nu 20 billion in 2015 (about $300 million at current exchange rates) to more than Nu 67 billion in
2019 and Nu 145 billion in 2025. The contribution of hydropower to economic growth will mostly come
from the boost it will give to aggregate demand during the construction phase of the different projects and
the additional revenue these projects will generate at the time of commissioning. Again according to World
Bank (2015a), between 2013 and 2019 hydropower generation is expected to add an additional percentage
point to Bhutan’s annual economic growth. Taking into account the hydropower projects in the pipeline and
under construction, Bhutan’s GDP per capita is forecast to double within about 15 years, reaching $6,000 by
2030. The development of the hydropower industry is also expected to contribute to continued rapid poverty
reduction (Figure 1.1).

5.    At the same time, hydropower development is also expected to create or exacerbate a number
of significant challenges, including those facing the labor market. As detailed in World Bank (2015a),
challenges created or exacerbated by hydropower development are likely to include macroeconomic instability
and a lack of economic self-reliance. In addition, hydropower development will make some labor market
challenges that are already apparent more pressing, especially in those industries that will not directly benefit
from the money that is projected to flow into Bhutan. As detailed in Chapter 2 of this report, the private
sector already faces difficulties in being competitive and attracting well-qualified labor. Once the planned
massive hydropower projects come onstream, higher labor costs could worsen these difficulties. Moreover,
informal, rural and agricultural workers risk being left behind.



                                                                  -2-
6.     Thus, while hydropower generation presents a huge opportunity for Bhutan’s development
over the coming decades, this opportunity will need to be consciously managed, with an eye on its
impact on labor and the availability and quality of jobs. The World Development Report 2013 stresses
that even when investments in extractive industries represent a sizable fraction of a developing country’s
GDP and lead to spectacular increases in export revenue, they tend not to create many jobs. The report notes
that countries have basically followed two distinct strategies to spread the wealth resulting from natural
resources. The first strategy has been to place citizens in well-paid jobs in the public sector. This strategy has
been pursued in many states around the Persian Gulf. While it has made some Gulf country citizens direct
beneficiaries of the natural resource bonanza, the strategy has also had negative consequences. In particular, it
has often led to a situation where immigrants perform menial jobs, while public sector jobs are rationed. This
has in turn meant that some groups, such as women and youth, have had limited access to public sector jobs.
The second strategy has been to create jobs outside of the extractive industries and to diversify the export
base. For instance, the United Arab Emirates has managed to diversify its economy beyond the natural
resource industry and has created jobs in financial and logistics services and other industries. Norway offers
another example of a resource-rich country that has successfully followed a private-sector-led development
path. With major hydropower projects coming onstream in the next few years, now is the time for Bhutan to
decide if it wants development to follow a path led by the public sector, the private sector or to create a
balance between the two paths.


1.2 KEY LABOR MARKET INDICATORS
7.     Compared to many other lower-middle income countries, current labor market conditions in
Bhutan appear favorable; labor force participation rates are high, overall unemployment rates low
and gender differences small. According to the Bhutan Labour Force Survey (BLFS), in 2014 around 62
percent of Bhutan’s population aged 15 and older was part of the labor force. This meant that Bhutan was
better able than many other lower-middle income countries to make use of the economic potential its
population offers.1 In 2014, the labor force participation rate was 71 percent for men and 55 percent for
women. This difference in labor force participation rates between genders is significant but relatively small
compared to the average for lower-middle income countries. Nor is Bhutan’s current overall unemployment
rate of 2.6 percent high by international standards. Unemployment is more prevalent in urban areas than in
rural Bhutan (Table 1.1). 2
8.     Recently, there has been a trend toward almost universal enrollment in primary education,
along with rapidly increasing enrollment rates in secondary and tertiary education. More than 60
percent of individuals in the Bhutanese labor force have no formal education, according to the BLFS 2014.
Just 7 percent complete primary education but not secondary education and around 24 percent complete
secondary education but not tertiary education. Less than 7 percent of the labor force has completed some
kind of tertiary education. The large proportion of individuals with little or no education can be traced to
Bhutan’s former position as a rural society that long lacked a well-developed educational system. At the same
time, as noted in World Bank (2014b), of all South Asian economies the most significant change in primary
school enrollment rates took place in Bhutan between 2001 and 2010. Over a single decade, Bhutan’s primary
net enrollment rate increased by 30 percentage points to 88 percent. At the same time, secondary gross

labor force defined as encompassing all persons who worked or were unemployed during the week before the BLFS interview (cf.
ILO, 2011).
2 While this report relies on data from the BLFS 2014, information on key labor market indicators from the BLFS 2015 has recently

become available. Key labor market indicators for 2014 presented here are generally consistent with those now available for 2015. For
instance, the unemployment rate in 2015 was 2.5 percent, only 0.1 percent different than in 2014.

placed greater emphasis on tertiary education.

The positive statistics hide a number of important challenges, including declining labor force
participation rates, a dominant public sector and pockets of quantitative and qualitative
underemployment. Labor force participation rates have steadily declined in recent years, dropping from 69
percent in 2010 to 63 percent in 2014. This decline has been particularly steep for women. Other challenges
for Bhutan’s labor market include the relative predominance of public sector employment—discussed in
more detail in Chapter 2—and pockets of underemployment, especially among younger workers and women.
In 2014, quantitative underemployment amounted to 1.1 percent of total employment in 2014. While this rate
is quite low, among women it reached 1.5 percent and among workers aged 15 to 24 it stood at 1.9 percent.
In addition, there are also widespread reports of qualitative underemployment.3
9.     Informal work is a particular concern because it is widespread among the general population
and endemic among certain groups, such as individuals with low education, from rural areas, and
from poor households. While attention has recently focused on the relatively high urban unemployment
rate, Bhutan remains a largely rural, agrarian economy. This is reflected in the high proportion of informal
employment to total employment, which World Bank staff estimates at around 80 percent.4 Informal

3 Following ILO (2011), the quantitatively underemployed are defined as all persons in employment who had worked less than 35
hours per week during the week before the BLFS interview and were willing to work additional hours. It is more difficult to define
qualitative underemployment in precise terms but it is generally understood to workers that are employed in jobs that do not make the
best use of their qualifications and skills
4 It is challenging to define and measure informal employment. Building on ILO (2013) this report defines informal employment as

encompassing all workers who work as casual paid employees, contract/piece paid workers, self-employed workers and family
workers. In addition to that, informal employment also includes those regular paid employees without a contract of employment




                                                                 -4-
employment can be a concern because informal workers tend to have low productivity and lack social
protection. Government policies meant to improve the living conditions of workers rarely reach the informal
economy.
10. Informal labor is a complex, multifaceted phenomenon that is shaped by both the modes of
socioeconomic organization and the relationship the state establishes with private agents through
regulation and monitoring. World Bank (2012b) argues that development and formalization do not
necessarily go hand in hand. Instead, formalization is shaped by a number of structural parameters and is
hence a consequence of policy choices. According to World Bank (2012b), cross-country regressions show
that labor informality is negatively and significantly related to the strength of law and order, business freedom
from regulation, and average years of secondary schooling. It is positively and significantly associated with
sociodemographic transformation factors (agricultural share, youth population, and rural population).

11. In Bhutan, informal labor is closely linked to lack of education and poverty, among other
variables. The incidence of informality decreases with increased educational attainment. At 93 percent, the
proportion of informal jobs is highest among workers with no schooling. On the other end of the scale, less
than 30 percent of workers with tertiary education are informally employed. Informality is also closely related
to poverty. While the BLFS 2014 does not contain data that allow the classification of households according
to Bhutan’s official poverty line, it is possible to use a stylized wealth index to categorize households into five
quintiles. Based on this classification, 98 percent of workers from households in the poorest quintile are
engaged in informal work. In contrast, the informality rate stands only at 51 percent among workers from the
richest fifth of households. More formally, econometric estimates using the BLFS 2014 confirm that certain
individuals—in particular those who are older, have less education and are from less well-off households—
are significantly more likely to be engaged in agricultural jobs, a close proxy for informal work. For instance,

and/or access to any kind of fringe benefits (gratuity, provident fund payments, overtime payments, annual payments, sick leave,
casual leave, maternity/paternity leave, or compensation for injury, disability or death due to work accidents or occupational disease).

12. Unemployment should be seen as a challenge for specific groups—including the young,
urban, relatively well-educated and well-off—and should be considered in the context of overall
labor market challenges. As mentioned above, compared to other economies with a similar level of
economic development, Bhutan’s overall unemployment rate is low. At the same time, unemployment rates
are much higher for specific groups. As previously noted, the urban unemployment rate is four times higher
than the rural rate. As with informal labor, unemployment is closely related to education and household
wealth: However, the trend lines run in opposite directions. Unlike the incidence of informal labor, which
decreases with wealth and education, unemployment is more prevalent among better educated individuals and
richer households. Whereas the unemployment rate is extremely low for individuals with no formal education
(0.2 percent), it is 12.3 percent for individuals with tertiary education. Similarly, the unemployment rate is 0.3
percent for individuals in the poorest 20 percent of households but 6.5 percent for those in the richest

5 To construct a wealth index that is a close approximation of household wealth, this report uses a principal components analysis to
convert a range of distinct but possibly correlated measures of household wealth (ownership of dwelling, different types of livestock
and land as well as consumer goods like mobile phones, rice cookers, composite bows or cars, and electricity connection) recorded in
the BLFS 2014 into exactly one measure for household wealth. Following World Bank (2003), it is assumed that the first principal
component is an adequate measure of wealth. Subsequently, households are classified into wealth quantiles, i.e. five groups of equal
size ordered by the value of their household wealth.

quintile. Overall, unemployment seems to be more common among young, urban, relatively well-educated
and well-off persons. This means policies to address it need to target these specific groups. Furthermore, one
might ask why unemployment is particularly elevated for certain groups. In Chapter 2, this report argues that
one important reason is the overwhelming attractiveness of the civil service and the willingness of many job
seekers to wait for openings in the public sector (Figure 1.3).

13. Alarmism about youth unemployment is unwarranted. It is true that Bhutan’s youth
unemployment rate stands at 9.4 percent. This rate is more than three times higher than the general
unemployment rate and considerably above the target set by the RGoB’s Eleventh Five-Year Plan, which
aims for full employment and a youth unemployment rate at or below 2.5 percent. However, one has to keep
in mind that youth unemployment rates measure the proportion of the youth labor force that is without work
and looking for a job. The rate does not account for those who are inactive or those in education or training.
In countries where enrollment in secondary and tertiary education is high, a more meaningful and policy-
relevant variable is the share of unemployed youth in the overall youth population. As already mentioned
above, in recent years Bhutan has seen rapidly increasing enrollment rates in secondary and tertiary education.
As a result, in 2014 only 27 percent of individuals aged 15 to 24 participated in the labor market. Thus,
Bhutan’s youth unemployment rate of 9.4 percent in 2014 corresponded to a 2.5 percent share of
unemployed youth in the youth population. According to data from the International Labour Organization
(ILO), this was the lowest percentage of unemployed youth in the youth population among all South Asian
countries.


1.3 PRIORITY POLICY CHALLENGES
14. Conceptually, this report is guided by the classification of jobs challenges in the World
Development Report 2013. The World Development Report 2013 introduces a “jobs challenges” typology
that uses systematic criteria and a data-driven methodology to distinguish between six distinct country types
with specific priority policy challenges. It classifies countries as urbanizing, agrarian, formalizing, aging,


                                                                                                                -7-
resource-rich, or having high youth unemployment.6 Obviously, many countries face not just one but several
of these challenges. The World Development Report 2013 stresses that the criteria used to categorize
countries are not mutually exclusive.
15. The classification of jobs challenges used by the World Development Report 2013 makes it
possible to get an initial sense of the kinds of jobs that promote development in a particular setting.
The typology introduced in the report allows a first identification and prioritization of a country’s particular
policy challenges and the steps that can be taken toward overcoming it. However, the report also emphasizes,
“The types of jobs that can contribute the most to development depend on the country context. Jobs that
connect the economy to the world may matter the most in some situations; in others, the biggest payoff may
be for jobs that reduce poverty or defuse conflict” (World Bank 2012d, p. 17).

16. According to the World Development Report 2013 classifications, Bhutan is an agrarian
economy. An agrarian economy is one in which the majority of the population lives in rural areas where
work consists mainly of small-scale and subsistence agriculture and related industries. A country is considered
agrarian if 60 percent or more of its population lives in rural areas. This is the case for Bhutan, where 62
percent of the population lived in rural areas in 2014. An urban-rural gap also remains in many dimensions,
including with respect to poverty, food security and access to services (Figure 1.4).
17. The World Development Report 2013 argues that in agrarian economies the main avenues to
improving living standards are to increase agricultural productivity, create a dynamic economic
environment in cities and promote labor reallocation from rural to urban areas. A combination of
more productive smallholder farming and more urban jobs connected to global markets can spark a positive

6 According to the World Development Report 2013, small island states and conflict-affected countries are two additional country
types that face separate priority policy challenges. As Bhutan is neither a small island nor a conflict-affected country, these are not
directly relevant for Bhutan. At the same time, the main challenge for small island states is that their geography limits productivity and
growth. Due to Bhutan’s small size and remote location, the country in fact faces similar challenges.

spiral of productivity growth and improvement in living standards. It also leads to the expansion of off-farm
employment opportunities, which in turn can be an important driver of poverty reduction.7
18. Bhutan is classified as an urbanizing economy. A country is considered to be urbanizing if the
share of the population in urban areas has risen by 4.5 percentage points or more over a 10-year period. In
Bhutan, the share of the population living in urban areas increased by 8 percentage points between 2004 and
2014 (Figure 1.4 and Box 1.1).

19. In general, urbanizing economies benefit from jobs that provide opportunities for women,
move the economy up the export ladder, integrate rural-to-urban migrants and do not lead to
excessive congestion. As detailed in World Bank (2014a), governments of urbanizing economies face
challenges related to quickly integrating migrants into the urban economy, avoiding exclusion and urban
poverty and minimizing the costs of congestion. Other priority areas for urbanizing economies are urban
planning and management and the provision of opportunities for women (as in the course of urbanization
countries typically pass through an important developmental juncture at which the participation of women in
work outside the home begins to rise significantly)
20. Following the classification of the World Development Report 2013, Bhutan is a resource-rich
country. Resource-rich countries are those where mineral exports account for at least 20 percent of total
exports. Even before the hydropower boom expected in the coming years materializes, Bhutan easily
surpasses this threshold. In 2012 mineral exports—which according to the Harmonized Commodity
Description and Coding System of the World Customs Organization include the export of electrical energy—
accounted for 43 percent of the country’s exports. More recent data are not yet available.

7 World Bank (2014a) argues that most job challenges can best be understood as a continuum along which a country can move and
that the thresholds introduced by the World Development Report 2013 and reproduced are potentially a source of contention in that
how they are chosen determines which challenges countries could prioritize. As also argued in World Bank (2014a), the exercise
should be seen as insightful and stimulating rather than as definitive or conclusive.

21. Good jobs for resource-rich countries are those outside the extractive industries and those not
subsidized through wealth transfers. As already mentioned above and explained in World Bank (2014a),
the extractive industries necessary to exploit mineral resources rarely create a lot of jobs, and few of these
jobs last beyond the initial construction phase. Moreover, if mineral resources account for a large share of
export revenue, this can attract large inflows of foreign exchange that may induce inflation and “Dutch-
disease” effects, causing a country’s currency to appreciate and reducing the competitiveness of tradable
industries. As a consequence, for resource-rich countries the best forms of work are those outside of the
extractive industries and those not subsidized through transfers (Figure 1.5).

22. According to the World Development Report 2013, Bhutan is classified as neither an aging
country, one with a formalizing economy, nor one with a particularly elevated level of youth
unemployment. Formalizing economies are defined as those where pension contributors represent 25 to 75
percent of the total labor force. Aging societies have an elderly population (aged 65 or above) that is more
than 8 percent of the working-age group (15-to-64-year-olds). According to recent data from the World Bank
Pensions Database and the United Nations Populations Division World Population Prospects, Bhutan
belongs to neither category. To assess whether a country has particularly high levels of youth unemployment,
the World Development Report 2013 proposes a “youth bulge index.” The youth bulge index is calculated by
multiplying total youth employment by the youth unemployment rate and dividing the resulting figure by total
population. A score of 0.90 or above signifies high youth unemployment. At 0.52, Bhutan’s score is well
below the threshold. This confirms the assertion made above that alarmism about youth unemployment is
unwarranted (Figure 1.5 and Figure 1.6).
23. The classification of Bhutan as agrarian, urbanizing and resource-rich has implications for the
country’s prioritization of its policy challenges. The systematic classifications of counties by the World
Development Report 2013 should not be seen in isolation; they can imply complementary priority policy
challenges or the need to prioritize among a set of conflicting challenges. In Bhutan’s case the agrarian nature
of the economy points to a priority policy challenge of promoting labor reallocation to urban areas to

promote productivity growth. At the same time, urbanizing economies can face congested urban areas due to
the large number of arriving rural-to-urban migrants. As a result, strong trade-offs exist with regard to any
policy that would explicitly encourage or discourage rural-to-urban migration in Bhutan.


1.4 REPORT OVERVIEW
24. The remainder of the report digs deeper into select key issues for Bhutan’s labor market. It is
guided by Bhutan’s current situation and future prospects, the state of key labor market indicators and the
priority policy challenges presented in this chapter. Throughout the report, Bhutan’s classification as an
agrarian, urbanizing and resource-rich economy serves as a guiding thread that ties to a number of different
issues defining Bhutan’s labor market and the road toward gainful and quality employment for all. These
different issues serve to organize the different chapters of the report.
25. The report concentrates on important and urgent labor-related issues. The report does not try to
be exhaustive or to dissect all possible topics affecting Bhutan’s labor market. Instead, it selectively focuses
on some of the most important and urgent issues. In terms of methodology, it relies on a desk review of
existing studies, evidence and legal texts, on discussions with experts and stakeholders from Bhutan and on
two primary data sources that provide recent, robust information on labor supply and demand in Bhutan. The
BLFS 2014 is a representative labor force survey with a newly expanded questionnaire that was implemented
by the MoLHR with support from the World Bank. The Bhutan Enterprise Survey (BES) 2015 is a firm
survey conducted by the World Bank that improved understanding of the conditions, experiences and
perspectives of Bhutan’s nonfarm private firms.8
26. Chapter 2 addresses imbalances between the public and private sectors. Whether to place
citizens in public sector jobs or to focus on jobs outside of the extractive industries is a key strategic choice
for resource-rich countries. This chapter documents that Bhutan’s public sector is oversized for a small,
landlocked country with a relatively undiversified economy. It also demonstrates that overall compensation
packages for workers are more generous in the public sector (in violation of the “prevailing wage principle”
established by Fogel and Lewin, 1974) and that the unemployment rate among a number of population
groups is elevated due to queuing for public sector jobs. The chapter finds that if Bhutan wants to avoid the
pitfalls facing other resource-rich countries that rely mostly on public sector jobs and jobs subsidized through
transfers, a comprehensive approach to sectoral rebalancing is needed—not to weaken the public sector but
to allow private sector jobs to emerge and prosper.
27. Chapter 3 outlines barriers to private sector employment. This chapter analyzes Bhutan’s labor
market from the perspective of labor demand. This approach is motivated by the priority policy challenges of
creating jobs that are not subsidized through transfers and creating urban jobs connected to global markets.
The chapter investigates the validity of often-heard complaints about skills mismatches. It also analyzes the
relative importance of different labor-related constraints on business such as competition for workers, labor
regulation and inadequate worker education or motivation. The chapter argues that reinforcing efforts to
foster broad-based private sector development and productivity could increase the attractiveness of the
private sector as an employer of highly educated workers and strengthen its capacity to absorb a higher
number of job seekers. Bhutan could also consider focusing education and training interventions on the
development of a core set of technical skills and soft skills demanded by the country’s private sector, and on
ensuring that training content is relevant and in line with labor demand.


8 Both the BLFS 2014 and the BES 2015 achieved a high degree of reliability through the use of computer-assisted personal
interviews. For more information on the BLFS 2014 and the ES 2015, cf. the Appendix, MoLHR (2015) and World Bank (2015d).

28. Chapter 4 analyzes Bhutan’s labor market policies. The chapter examines Bhutan’s labor market
regulations (like the minimum wage, employment protection legislation, provisions against child labor and
occupational safety and health standards), labor market interventions (active and passive labor market policies
where costs of interventions are borne by all taxpayers whether they participate in the labor market or not)
and labor market institutions (industrial relations) from a legal and a quantitative point of view. Specific
emphasis is put on the implementation of labor market regulations on the ground as well as on policies
regulating the movement of people into and out of Bhutan. Restrictions on the movement of people are
particularly significant because they are directly related to Bhutan’s stated goal of achieving economic self-
reliance by 2020 (GNHC 2013).
29. Chapter 5 analyzes the adequacy of existing social protection measures for different groups of
workers. In addition, it identifies specific groups of vulnerable workers in need of protection. Following the
terminology in World Bank (2012c), the chapter is concerned both with social protection programs (including
social safety nets such as cash transfers, school feeding and targeted food assistance, and social insurance such
as old age and disability pensions and unemployment insurance) and with other social programs (like
Bhutan’s universal access to free education and healthcare). It investigates workers’ vulnerability to different
shocks and the adequacy of existing social protection measures for distinct groups of workers. Subsequently,
it identifies specific groups of vulnerable workers in need of social protection and outlines possible policy
responses, including recommendations for the government’s future social protection strategy. The chapter
argues that the appropriate set of social protection policies will partly depend on whether the government
implicitly cares for workers by assigning them possibly unproductive or unnecessary public jobs. If the
government instead pursues private sector development and broad-based economic growth, a much more
comprehensive social protection system will be required.
30. Chapter 6 reviews the report’s findings and summarizes potential policy options. The chapter
goes back to the introductory section describing Bhutan’s development success story and discussing the
country’s future hydropower developments and both their huge potential and the challenges they pose with
respect to Bhutan’s labor market. In the process, the chapter reiterates the report’s main findings,
recapitulates common themes from Chapter 2 to Chapter 4 and summarizes possible policy options for the
short, medium and long term.


BOX 1.1 URBANIZATION AND INTERNAL MIGRATION
As in many other urbanizing countries, in Bhutan the labor market is affected by a constant flow of labor
migrating from rural to urban areas. The first decennial Population and Housing Census of Bhutan carried
out in 2005 offers a detailed picture of this flow. The census defines internal migrants as individuals who were
born in Bhutan but reside somewhere other than their place of birth. The Census documents 111,770 rural-
to-urban migrants. This group of rural-to-urban migrants accounts for the biggest population flow, followed
by an almost equal number of rural-to-rural migrants (111,548 individuals).
In addition to large numbers of rural-to-urban migrants and rural-to-rural migrants, the Census counts 19,992
people who moved from urban to rural areas while 23,874 individuals moved from one urban center to
another. Among Bhutan’s twenty dzongkhags (districts), Thimphu (the district that includes the eponymous
capital) received the highest number of migrants. The census counted 54,685 individuals who moved to
Thimphu from another dzongkhag. Second and third place among dzongkhags in terms of incoming migrants go
to Chhukha (25,951) and Sarpang (17,997), respectively. Both of these dzongkhags received less than half as
many internal migrants as Thimphu.




                                                     - 12 -
The Census also records the reasons behind individuals’ migration decisions. According to the census, a
plurality of migrants (32 percent) migrated for family reasons. The second most frequently cited reason is
employment (17 percent) followed by education and training (15 percent), marriage (11 percent) and work
transfers (10 percent). Seven percent of respondents indicate they migrated to live with relatives, and 3
percent for resettlement. The remaining 7 percent moved for other unspecified reasons.
Finally, the Census records specific “push” and “pull” factors that influenced individuals’ decisions to move
from rural to urban areas. According to the census, a lack of educational facilities is the most common reason
for individuals in Bhutan to leave rural areas (46 percent). Further “push” factors for leaving rural areas
include: a lack of job opportunities (17 percent), inadequate service facilities (15 percent), and small land
holdings (7 percent). In terms of pull factors, the primary reason for migrating to a city is the availability of
better employment opportunities (33 percent). Further pull factors include relocation of the spouse (24
percent), religious pursuits (9 percent) and better business opportunities (4 percent).

2 IMBALANCES BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE
  SECTORS

2.1 COUNTRY CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
31. This chapter addresses imbalances between Bhutan’s public and private sectors. As discussed
in Chapter 1, whether to primarily place citizens in public sector jobs or to focus on jobs outside the
extractive industries is a key strategic choice for many resource-rich countries. Against this backdrop, the
chapter documents the excessive size of Bhutan’s public sector and finds that this is especially problematic
for Bhutan, a small, landlocked country with an underdeveloped private sector (see Chapter 3). It also
demonstrates that overall compensation packages for workers are more generous in the public sector and that
unemployment among a number of population groups is elevated as they wait to secure public sector jobs. It
argues that if Bhutan wants to avoid the situation of other resource-rich countries that rely mostly on public
sector jobs and jobs subsidized through transfers, a comprehensive approach to sectoral rebalancing is
needed—not to weaken the public sector but to allow private sector jobs to emerge and prosper.

Note: Primary education includes pre-primary.

32. Bhutan’s public sector is relatively large; it accounts for about a fifth of all jobs and almost half
of the jobs outside agriculture. Overall, 19.1 percent of jobs in Bhutan are in the public sector—defined as
the civil service, other government agencies, the armed forces and public/government companies. General
government employment—a subsector of the public sector that, following ILO (1999), includes the civil
service, other government agencies and the armed forces but not public/government companies—accounts
for more than three-quarters of public sector employment and for 15 percent of all jobs. Given that only 43.3
percent of Bhutan’s workers are employed outside agriculture and public sector employment is entirely non-
agricultural, 44.1 percent of all jobs outside agriculture are in the public sector (Figure 2.1 and Table 1.1).




                                                             - 14 -
33. Two-thirds of Bhutanese with a tertiary education work in the public sector, which limits the
pool of talent available to the private sector. Only 6.5 percent of workers without formal education are
employed in the public sector. As for educated workers, 21.6 percent of those with a primary education and
30.2 percent, 37.9 percent and 56.3 percent of those with lower, middle and higher secondary education,
respectively, work in the public sector. Fully 66.3 percent of workers with tertiary education are employed in
the public sector. In fact, more than half (51.2 percent) of workers with tertiary education work in general
government. The fact that a substantial majority of workers with tertiary education are in the public
sector!in particular, in general government!severely limits the pool of talent available to private sector
firms (Figure 2.1).
34. An oversized public sector is especially problematic for a small, landlocked country that has an
underdeveloped private sector. Countries differ widely in the proportion of jobs that are located in the
public as opposed to the private sector. For instance, according to internationally comparable definitions,
public sector employment accounts for less than 3 percent of overall employment in Uganda, Madagascar and
Guinea but more than 40 percent of overall employment in Belarus, Kuwait and Cuba. An analysis of data for
a large number of different developing and developed countries shows that globally, an average of 18.9
percent of all workers are employed in the public sector and 13.8 percent in the government. Overall public
sector employment in Bhutan is on a par with the international average, although general government
employment is somewhat higher. However, this figure is high for a small, landlocked country such as Bhutan
that has a relatively underdeveloped private sector (Figure 2.2).

35. Workers and jobs in Bhutan’s public sector have very different characteristics than those in its
private sector. A range of sociodemographic and productive characteristics clearly distinguish a typical
public sector worker from a typical private sector worker. Chief among these differences are education and
age. Jobs in Bhutan’s public and private sectors also differ with respect to prevalent job types and urban or
rural location. Significant differences also exist between private sector workers in jobs inside and outside of
agriculture. This hints at two areas of conflict in Bhutan’s labor market: first between the public sector and


                                                              - 15 -
the private non-agricultural sector (see Chapter 3), and second, between the private non-agricultural and the
private agricultural sector (see Chapter 4).
36. Public sector workers are comparatively well-educated. Over the last few decades, Bhutan has
made impressive improvements in increasing access to education. Nonetheless, the overall education level of
the country’s workforce is still relatively low. In the private sector, 49.1 percent of workers outside agriculture
and 83.4 percent of workers in agriculture have no formal education. Conversely, only 7.9 percent of private
sector workers outside agriculture and 0.2 percent of private sector workers in agriculture have a tertiary
education. Public sector workers tend be much better educated. Only 21.5 percent of workers in the sector
have no formal education, and 20.9 percent of them have a tertiary education. The percentage of workers
with secondary education is also much higher in the public than the private sector. These numbers reflect the
large proportion of well-educated workers active in the public sector, as mentioned above (Figure 2.3).
37. Public sector workers tend to be younger than private sector workers. Overall, 38.3 percent of
workers in Bhutan are aged 15 to 34 while 18.2 percent of workers are aged 55 or older. However, in the
public sector 48.3 percent of workers are aged 15 to 34. Just 4.3 percent of public sector employers are aged
55 or older. At the same time, 49.5 percent of private sector workers outside agriculture and 30.4 percent of
private sector workers in agriculture are younger than 35, while 10.1 percent of private sector workers outside
agriculture and 26.1 percent of private sector workers in agriculture are older than 55 (Figure 2.3).

38. The prevalence of self-employment, casual and regular work differs significantly between the
public and private sectors. An overwhelming majority of public sector jobs are for regular paid employees,
while the proportion of this type of job in the private sector is much smaller. In the public sector, 93.8
percent of jobs are for regular employees. In the private sector, 26.7 percent of jobs outside agriculture and a
negligible proportion of agricultural jobs are filled by regular employees. Instead, the private sector makes
much greater use of self-employed workers outside agriculture (47.2 percent) and unpaid family workers in
agriculture (63.5 percent). Casual employment and contract work only play a role in the nonfarm private

sector, where 8.1 percent of jobs are allocated to casual employees and 5.9 percent to contract workers
(Figure 2.4).
39. Significant differences exist between the public and the private sector with respect to job
location. As mentioned in Chapter 1, the World Development Report 2013 classifies Bhutan as an agrarian
economy. Accordingly, 74.9 percent of jobs are located in rural areas. However, while a majority of
agricultural and nonfarm private sector jobs are rural (98.4 percent and 52.4 percent, respectively), less than
one third—32.6 percent—of public sector jobs are located in rural areas (Figure 2.4).

40. To assess the relative position of public and private sector workers it is imperative to compare
their overall compensation packages. The processes that determine the generosity of workers’ overall
compensation packages—which include wages but also fringe benefits, pensions and other forms of social
insurance, the level of job security, job prestige and other intangibles—differs fundamentally between the
public and the private sectors. Competition tends to impose discipline on private sector compensation
packages, whereas most public sector compensation packages are not governed by market forces. Public
sector compensation is instead influenced by political developments, government priorities and similar non-
market processes. In an influential paper, Fogel and Lewin (1974) establish that by law, public sector workers
in many jurisdictions are supposed to receive compensation equivalent to that of private sector workers
performing comparable work. Fogel and Lewin (1974) argue that while this “prevailing wage principle” is
sensible in terms of equity and efficiency, in practice it is often violated.
41. Average wages in Bhutan’s public sector are significantly above those in the private sector, but
this wage differential can be accounted for by differences between public and private sector workers
and jobs. In Bhutan, average wages are 55.7 percent higher in the public than in the private sector. However,
since both workers and jobs are very different in each sector, a simple comparison of average wages is
misleading. Instead, statistical techniques can be used to control for differences between public and private
sector workers and jobs to compare pay for workers with similar education and jobs. In addition to
observable differences, the estimated wage gap between public and private sector might also be influenced by
the self-selection of workers in any one sector. Statistical techniques can again be used to control for this self-

selection. If one controls for observable characteristics and sector self-selection, the public sector wage
premium practically disappears. Average public sector wages adjusted for observable characteristics and
selection are only 0.4 percent higher than average private sector wages. This difference is not statistically
significant (Figure 2.5).9

42. Disparities between workers or jobs explain a larger proportion of the public/private wage gap
in Bhutan than in almost all other countries for which comparable data exist. Evidence on the
public/private wage gap adjusted for observable characteristics and self-selection into sectors is not widely
available. But a number of studies have attempted to compare both naïve average wage gaps between the
private and public sector and wage gaps adjusted for worker and job characteristics. While there is substantial
variation between countries, most of these studies find a pattern that is qualitatively similar to the one
observed for Bhutan. In other words, average wages in the public sector are usually higher than in the private
sector, but this wage gap tends to diminish if it is adjusted for observable characteristics. For instance, in
many European and Latin American countries the average naïve wage premium for public sector workers is
34 percent. The wage premium adjusted for observable characteristics shrinks to 15 percent. What
distinguishes Bhutan from most other countries is the quantitative difference between the country’s very
sizable raw public sector wage premium and the practically nonexistent wage gap once characteristics are
controlled for. In fact, observable characteristics of workers or jobs explain a larger proportion of Bhutan’s
public/private wage gap than in almost all other countries for which comparable evidence exists (Figure 2.6).




9The statistical techniques used here are Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions of the pay gap into job characteristics and returns to those
characteristics (cf. Schmilllen, 2016, for methodological details). As all statistical techniques, they are subject to statistical error and
should be interpreted with caution.

Notes: Data are for different years. In the case of Bhutan, wage differentials are only estimated for workers with non-zero wages.

43. Overall compensation packages received by Bhutan’s public sector workers, however, are far
more generous than those offered in the private sector. In a sense, Bhutan’s public sector follows what
has been called the prevailing wage principle (once wage gaps are appropriately adjusted). In other words, the
country’s public sector workers tend to receive wages equivalent to those earned by private sector workers
performing comparable work (Fogel and Lewin 1974). At the same time, wages are only one element of
overall compensation. This is an important observation since overall compensation packages received by
Bhutan’s public sector workers tend to be far more generous than those offered in the private sector. For
instance, public sector workers have better access to pensions and other social insurances, better coverage by
free or subsidized housing and other fringe benefits, more job security and greater prestige. Therefore, to
align overall compensation packages between the public and the private sector and truly satisfy the prevailing
wage principle, Bhutan’s public sector wages would need to be lower than private sector wages for
comparable work.
44. Public sector workers are much more likely to receive a wide range of benefits in addition to
base salary, including free or subsidized housing, gratuities, provident fund payments and
compensation for work accidents or occupational diseases. For many public sector workers, particularly
civil servants, free or subsidized housing is an important element of overall compensation. This benefit is
much less common for private sector workers. Moreover, public sector workers are much more likely to
receive a wide range of other fringe benefits. The BLFS 2014 collects data on whether workers receive one or
more of the following eight distinct fringe benefits: gratuity, provident fund payments, overtime payments,
paid annual leave, paid sick leave, paid casual leave, paid maternity/paternity leave and compensation for
work accidents or occupational diseases. While the majority of workers should by law be entitled to all eight
fringe benefits, in practice coverage is incomplete, and public sector workers are more likely to receive all

eight types of benefits. For each of the eight benefits, coverage among public sector workers easily exceeds 90
percent, whereas only 25 to 65 percent of private sector workers receive any particular benefit (Figure 2.7).10

45. Bhutan’s public sector is seen as the sector of choice by many job seekers, especially those
with secondary or tertiary education. Data from the BLFS 2014 shows many unemployed persons would
like to work in the public sector and are even willing to forego private sector job opportunities to look for
work in the public sector. Highly educated persons are particularly keen to find a job in the public sector.
According to the BLFS 2014, 70.6 percent of unemployed or inactive respondents with higher secondary
education and 86.8 percent of respondents with tertiary education stated that they desire a job in the public
sector. Among respondents without formal education, only 40 percent expressed a preference for public
sector jobs. Jobs in government are seen as the most attractive form of employment. More than half, 51.9
percent, of all unemployed or inactive respondents in the BLFS expressed a preference for government
employment, while 66 percent of respondents with tertiary education did so (Figure 2.8).11
46. The (perceived) superior salary, good benefit packages and high job security of the public
sector are among the main reasons cited for why public sector jobs are so attractive. Respondents to
the BLFS 2014 gave a relatively wide range of reasons for preferring public sector jobs. Among the most
frequently cited the notion that public sector jobs would be a good fit and align with respondents’ personal
interests. In addition, the public sector’s high reputation, high salaries, and flexibility were often mentioned. A
number of unemployed or inactive respondents to the survey had actually rejected private sector jobs that

10 The BLFS 2014 only contains data on fringe benefits for regular paid employees, casual paid employees and contract / piece paid
workers in state-owned or private enterprises. It seems safe to assume that differences between the public and the private sector
would be even more pronounced if data on fringe benefits were also collected for other groups of workers.
11 The findings from the BLFS are confirmed by a recent survey among unemployed youth in Bhutan, where 50.3 percent of

respondents said they would prefer to work for the government and another 32.4 percent aspired to a job in a state-owned enterprise
(MoLHR and UNDP, 2013).

oft-cited reasons for not taken up a private sector job included the lack of benefits, a bad fit, long working
hours and an inadequate salary (Figure 2.9).

2.2 CHALLENGES AND CURRENT GOVERNMENT APPROACH
47. Widespread queuing for public sector jobs is a major reason for high unemployment rates
among young, well-educated and well-off city dwellers. Unemployment rates are elevated for exactly
those population groups that have a strong preference for public sector jobs (especially those with a medium
to high level of education). Quantitative as well as anecdotal evidence confirms that a number of unemployed
individuals do not take up private sector job offers because they would prefer to work in the public sector.
These are symptoms of widespread queuing for public sector jobs. Queuing has a number of negative
consequences. It not only stymies the development of a vibrant private sector but also increases the number
of unemployed individuals. Unemployment, in turn, goes hand in hand with a fall in earnings and
consumption. If employers discriminate against individuals with unemployment experience or human capital
deteriorates during periods of inactivity it can even have long-term negative consequences (Schmillen and
Umkehrer 2013).
48. An oversized public sector is particularly problematic for a small, landlocked country such as
Bhutan that has a relatively underdeveloped private sector. As noted in Chapter 1, Bhutan’s priority
policy challenges include the need to create urban jobs connected to global markets and jobs not subsidized
through transfers. These types of jobs depend on a vibrant private sector. While the overall size of Bhutan’s
public sector is not excessively large by international standards, the situation still appears problematic. In a
small country like Bhutan an overwhelming public sector can prevent the emergence of a strong private
sector as it reduces the number of workers available and able to work in the private sector. This problem is
particularly acute for Bhutan because the growth of the private sector is hindered by several barriers (see
Chapter 3) and because a majority of the country’s relatively small number of highly educated workers are
currently active in the public sector. These workers are for the most part not available for work in nascent
private industries like information technology or outsourcing that is dependent on a pool of well-qualified
workers.
49. Lucrative compensation packages in the public sector reinforce workers’ preference for public
sector jobs and inhibit private sector growth. In effect, they further reduce the already limited pool of
young, well-educated and skilled workers available for work in the private sector, and increase reservation
wages. Nascent private industries that depend on the availability of a pool of well-qualified workers can often
only count on the few younger job seekers not already committed to public sector jobs. For the large majority
of this group there is no realistic prospect of government employment; hiring by the civil service has been
subdued in recent years. Still, many job seekers prefer to wait for public sector jobs or are open a private
sector job only if it offers the same elevated—or simply unaffordable, see Chapter 3—compensation
packages that can be found in the public sector.
50. With major hydropower projects coming on stream within the next few years, the government
will have more incentive to further expand the public sector and to increase the generosity of the
compensation packages offered to public sector workers. As has happened in many Persian Gulf
countries, at some point Bhutan might be tempted to use the increased fiscal space generated by hydropower
development to “solve” the challenge of high unemployment among young, well-educated individuals by
expanding the size of the public sector, more specifically of government employment. At the same time,
pressure may rise to use the additional revenue to improve public sector compensation as a way to spread the
gains derived from the hydropower projects.
51. If not countered, these incentives will likely lead to increased pressure on the private sector
without substantially decreasing unemployment. While the objectives of limiting unemployment and
spreading the gains derived from hydropower projects would be laudable, increasing public sector
employment and further decoupling public sector compensation packages from the private sector could have


                                                     - 22 -
a number of negative consequences. Increasing the relative attractiveness of the public sector might induce
even more people to wait for a public sector job. This would increase the already acute challenge faced by the
private sector in competing for young, well-qualified job applicants (see Chapter 3). Moreover, it would
actually increase in the unemployment rate. Thus the “solution” of reducing unemployment by increasing the
size of the public sector might only work in the very short term. Finally, it might also prove fiscally
unsustainable.
52. The RGoB has recognized that Bhutan’s future development crucially depends on a vibrant
private sector and private sector employment. The Eleventh Five-Year Plan stipulates that an “enabling
environment for private sector development and stimulating export growth” is one of the main objectives for
the trade, industries and mines sector. Similarly, the RGoB has indicated that public sector employment—
especially the civil service—will no longer grow in line with job seekers’ expectations and will not absorb all
job seekers entering the labor market.
53. On the policy side, a number of helpful initiatives have been launched to strengthen the
private sector. The RGoB has, for instance, embarked on an ambitious plan to improve Bhutan’s position in
the World Bank’s annual Doing Business Report ranking. Bhutan was in position 141 out of 189 countries on
this ranking in 2013. Subsequently, Bhutan’s Prime Minister and Cabinet committed to placing Bhutan in the
top 100 countries on the report within two years. By 2016, Bhutan ranked 71st out of 189 countries in the
ease of doing business, according to the report. This made it the best-performing country in South Asia,
placing it behind only a handful of other lower-middle income countries such as Armenia, Georgia, Kosovo,
Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia. While some of the improvement in the Doing Business ranking can be
attributed to reforms initiated by the RGoB, it is in part also due to modifications in the methodology
underlying the ranking.


2.3 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
54. If Bhutan wants to avoid the situation of other resource-rich countries that rely mostly on
public sector jobs, a comprehensive approach to sectoral rebalancing is needed. As mentioned in
Chapter 1, the World Development Report 2013 notes that resource-rich countries have basically followed
two distinct strategies to spread the wealth resulting from natural resources: First, some countries have rapidly
expanded the public sector workforce. Second, other countries have aimed to support the creation of private
sector jobs outside of the extractive industries. If Bhutan decides that it wants to follow a more balanced
development path, now is the time for the country to begin to address imbalances between the public and the
private sector. These imbalances are already strikingly apparent today and likely to become more pronounced
once hydropower projects that are currently planned or under construction come on stream. As in the future
Bhutan will continue to need highly qualified, skilled and motived public sector workers, the rebalancing
should not imply a weakening of the public sector but rather a levelling of the playing field between public
and private sector work.
55. The prevailing wage principle could be established gradually if adjustments to public sector
wages follow adjustments to private sector wages—not vice versa. Public and private sector
compensation packages could in theory be rebalanced in four ways: (i) a reduction in public sector wages, (ii)
a reduction in public sector non-wage fringe benefits, (iii) an increase in private sector wages, and (iv) an
increase in private sector fringe benefits. However, while it is relatively easy to raise public sector wages, wage




                                                      - 23 -
cuts usually face heavy resistance.12 In the public sector, political considerations might make outright wage
cuts next to impossible. A sudden increase in private sector wages also appears unrealistic, as Bhutan’s private
sector firms already today struggle with unaffordable wage costs (see Chapter 3). Moreover, around the world
government efforts to actively increase private sector wages (for example, through abrupt increases in
minimum wages or the imposition of wage brackets) have a bad track record. Therefore, it appears more
realistic to gradually align the public and private sectors by ensuring that public sector wages if adjustments to
public sector wages follow adjustments to private sector wages. In practice, this would mean private wage
growth at a modest pace and (at most) in line with private sector wage growth.
56. To actually meet the prevailing wage principle, the fringe benefits for public and private sector
workers would need to be gradually aligned. Even though equality of benefits is often already mandated
by law, only a relatively small share of Bhutan’s private sector workers can avail themselves of fringe benefits
like gratuity, provident fund payments, overtime payments, paid annual leave, paid sick leave, paid casual
leave, paid maternity/paternity leave and compensation for work accidents or occupational diseases. Public
awareness campaigns and renewed efforts to enforce existing labor regulations—further discussed in Chapter
4—could gradually lead to an alignment of fringe benefits in the public and the private sector. At the same
time, it is important not to overburden the formal or semi-formal private sector with regulations that would
put it in a disadvantage compared to the (still overwhelming) part of the private sector that is informal and
does not necessarily adhere to applicable regulations (see Chapter 5). Therefore, reductions in certain fringe
benefits offered to public sector workers that are not legally mandated—such as free or subsidized housing—
might ultimately be necessary. Political space for public sector fringe benefit reductions might be easier to
create if a national social protection system and a mechanism for broad sharing of rents were both put in
place at the same time.
57. The development of a social protection strategy for workers, the alignment of pension
coverage between public and private sector workers and the introduction of an income support
scheme for jobless private sector workers could further balance the attractiveness of public sector
and private sector jobs. As explained in more detail in Chapter 5, existing social protection measures for
private sector workers fail to protect a large proportion of these workers from prevalent shocks and
vulnerabilities. While the propensity of certain shocks (such as unemployment due to closure of a workplace)
will always be greater in the private than the public sector, a comprehensive social protection strategy for
workers could nevertheless help make private sector jobs more attractive to workers. Reforms to social
insurance provisions, such as the alignment of pension coverage between public and private sector workers
and the introduction of an income support scheme for jobless private sector workers, could also be
considered—though in these cases one would need to carefully study their fiscal costs, expected effect on
different groups of workers and potential tradeoffs (see the discussion in Chapter 5).
58. Continuing the current policy of limiting growth in the public sector workforce, especially the
civil service, would send a clear signal that Bhutan will face up to its priority policy challenges. In
recent years, different government representatives have repeatedly and publicly stated that growth in Bhutan’s
public sector workforce, especially the civil service, will be limited for years to come and that college and
university graduates cannot all expect to find jobs there as out of 20,000 yearly graduates only 1,000 can
expect to attain positions in the civil service. Clear commitment to continued slow growth in the public sector
workforce would send a clear signal to job seekers about the need to acquire skills relevant for private sector
work. It would thus respond to one of the priority policy challenges of Bhutan as a resource-rich economy by

12 This phenomenon has been called downward nominal wage rigidity and been documented for many countries. The most prevalent
explanation is that nominal wage cuts damage worker morale and that morale is in turn a key determinant of worker productivity (cf.
e.g., Kahn, 1997, and Elsby, 2009).

supporting a diverse range of private sector jobs outside of the hydropower industry that are not subsidized
through transfers. It would also have other important effects far beyond the labor market, including on public
finances.
59. A reform of the civil service examinations—in particular greater emphasis on private sector
work experience—could increase the quality of civil service recruits and reduce queuing for public
sector jobs. Bhutan’s civil service examinations are a rigorous and highly competitive procedure to select the
best qualified candidates. They emphasize formal academic achievements, technical expertise, communication
skills in English and Dzongkha, analytical skills and a range of other relevant selection criteria. However,
private sector work experience is not one of the main criteria. This has at least two effects. First, candidates
who do not pass the civil service examinations at their first attempt or graduate at an inopportune time but
still want to strive for a civil service job have an incentive to prepare for the next round of examinations by
studying the relevant subjects and possible exam questions— not by gaining work experience. Second, while
incoming civil servants are technically qualified and highly skilled they rarely possess private sector work
experience, even though that would often increase their effectiveness. If the civil service examinations
rewarded private sector work experience, this could both reduce the time spent queuing for public sector jobs
and increase the quality of civil service recruits. In this context, Singapore’s experience may be interesting.
That country’s civil service follows a recruitment model that places a high level of emphasis on private sector
work experience. Many observers consider it to be a model bureaucracy characterized by high quality and
efficiency (UNDP 2015).

3 BARRIERS TO PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYMENT

3.1 COUNTRY CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
60. This chapter outlines barriers to private sector employment in Bhutan. As Chapter 2 illustrated,
there is little sign of the private sector being the main engine of growth and job creation in Bhutan since more
than 50 percent of jobs outside of agriculture are in the public sector. Both the Tenth and the Eleventh Five-
Year Plans (for 2008 to 2013 and 2013 to 2018, respectively) recognize the underdevelopment of the private
sector and highlight the need to focus on improving the quality and quantity of private sector employment.
This chapter investigates both the demand and supply sides of private sector employment, using recent data
on a representative sample of 367 firms (253 of them small, medium-sized or large enterprises and the
remaining 114 microenterprises) and 659 of their employees collected through the BES 2015. The BES 2015
is an enterprise survey covering private enterprises in Bhutan’s manufacturing and service industries that was
conducted by the World Bank in mid-2015. After establishing the context of the issues, the remainder of this
chapter analyzes the dynamics of job creation, addresses worker retention and labor-related obstacles to
firms’ operations, discusses current policies undertaken by the government, and suggests additional policy
options.

61. While there are many more small firms than large firms in Bhutan, nonfarm private sector
employment is dominated by relatively large enterprises. According to the BES 2015, microenterprises
with less than five employees make up close to 70 percent of all firms in Bhutan. Small firms with five to 19
employees account for around 22 percent of all firms, medium-sized enterprises with 20 to 99 employees for
about seven percent and large firms with 100 or more employees for only about one percent of all firms in
the economy. However, while large firms represent only a very small fraction of all firms in Bhutan, they
employ almost 50 percent of all private sector workers in the manufacturing and service industries.

Microenterprises, in contrast, account for only for about ten percent of nonfarm private sector employment
(Figure 3.1).
62. The service industry accounts for about 90 percent of the firms and the jobs in Bhutan’s
nonfarm private sector. Of the four industries covered by the BES 2015, the food and beverage industry
represents 1 percent of firms and a roughly equal share of jobs. Other manufacturing firms make up 8 per
cent of firms and 11 percent of jobs. The service industry is much more important than manufacturing in
terms of the total number of firms and workers. Tourism alone accounts for 31 percent of firms and 18
percent of jobs, which means that the industry is of great importance for nonfarm private sector employment
(and also that it consists mostly of relatively small firms). Other firms in the service industry make up the
remaining 60 percent of firms and 70 percent of the jobs in Bhutan’s nonfarm private sector (Figure 3.2).

63. The employment share of microenterprises in Bhutan is unusually low for a developing
country. In Bhutan, the employment share of microenterprises is six percent in the manufacturing industry
and 20 percent in the service industry. These numbers are much lower than those in a wide range of other
developing countries surveyed by Li and Rama (2015).13 Bhutan’s share of microenterprises is especially low
for the services industry, where even in developed economies the contribution of microenterprises to
employment is often at least 20 to 30 percent (Li and Rama 2015). The small share of people employed by
microenterprises in Bhutan is not in itself negative. Its economic impact ultimately depends on the percentage
of microenterprises that represent subsistence entrepreneurship and also on how fast small companies grow
and on how productive they are. As detailed below, numbers on the growth of microenterprises in Bhutan are
not particularly encouraging (Figure 3.3).


13Li and Rama (2015) stress that when using enterprise surveys to estimate the employment share of different segments of the private
sector it is important to properly account for the existence of microenterprises. Given that the BES 2015 contains data on
microenterprises and that according to World Bank (2009) almost 100 percent of firms in the nonfarm economy in Bhutan are
registered at start-up, the BES 2015 takes account of the full contribution of microenterprises to employment levels.

64. Bhutan has a very high percentage of temporary employment. In the average Bhutanese firm, 12
percent of workers have a temporary contract. Thus, temporary employment in Bhutan is more prevalent
than in most other countries in South Asia. For instance, in an average firm in Nepal and Pakistan, 5 and 7
percent of workers, respectively, are employed under a temporary contract, (Afram and Del Pero, 2012, and
World Bank, 2013c). Moreover, the distribution of temporary workers across firms is very uneven: Close to
50 percent of those employed in the private sector are employed temporarily. The discrepancy between 12
percent of workers in an average firm having a temporary contract and 50 percent of workers in the private
sector being employed through such a contract is due to the fact that while only 30 percent of all firms
employ temporary workers and the median firm employs no temporary workers at all, those firms that do
employ temporary workers tend to employ a lot of them and also tend to be relatively large (Figure 3.4)
65. The proportion of temporary workers is highest in large firms and in the manufacturing and
tourism sectors—areas of the economy that often depend on temporary and seasonal workers. The
share of workers with temporary contracts increases with the size of the firm and is as high as 40 percent on
average for large firms. Furthermore, for larger firms there is also a larger disparity between the mean and the
median proportion of temporary employment. This is again due to the fact that the largest firms have the
largest share of temporary workers. Industry-wise, temporary employment is most prevalent in the food and
beverage industry and least prevalent in services.14 Large firms that tend to be the main employers of
temporary workers are more likely to be in the manufacturing, construction, and food and beverage industries
which are usually characterized by higher needs for temporary and seasonal workers.15 This suggests that



14.However, due to the very small number of firms in the food and beverages industry captured in the BES 2015, the number that
indicates the very high proportion of temporary workers in the industry has to be interpreted with caution.
15 A third explanation might be that a lack of adequate available local skills requires large firms to hire non-Bhutanese workers on

short-term contracts. However, the idea that non-Bhutanese workers are mostly hired for short-term projects finds little support in
the BES 2015 data as non-Bhutanese workers are no more likely to hold a temporary employment contract than Bhutanese ones.

demand the needed flexibility to continuously adjust their workforces (Figure 3.4).

66. Approximately 30 percent of those employed in the nonfarm private sector in Bhutan are not
Bhutanese citizens. However, on average just 19 percent of a company’s employees are non-Bhutanese, the
median firm in Bhutan has no non-Bhutanese employees and only 30 percent of firms have any non-
Bhutanese employees. The proportion of non-Bhutanese workers is highest among medium-sized enterprises
and lowest among microenterprises. There is no strong pattern in terms of non-Bhutanese workers being
significantly more likely to be present in one industry or the other (Figure 3.5).
67. According to the BES 2015, non-Bhutanese workers tend to earn lower wages than Bhutanese
workers, both on average and across the wage distribution. Data from the BES 2015 show that non-
Bhutanese workers are present across the entire skills spectrum but for the most part active in jobs that
require little education and pay relatively low wages. In the nonfarm private sector, Bhutanese workers on
average earn significantly higher wages than non-Bhutanese workers. The difference in average wages
between Bhutanese and non-Bhutanese workers remains significant when one controls for workers’
education level and gender as well as firm size, industry and location. In addition, only about 20 percent of
non-Bhutanese workers have more than a high school education compared with more than 40 percent of
Bhutanese workers, as captured in the BES 2015. Similarly, close to 60 percent of non-Bhutanese workers
and less than 40 percent of Bhutanese workers have less than secondary education. Overall, while some
highly-skilled foreigners might fill gaps in providing specialized skills that may not be available locally, the
majority of non-Bhutanese workers in the nonfarm private sector are hired for jobs that require only relatively
basic skills and are not particularly sought after by Bhutanese workers (Figure 3.6).
68. The findings from the BES 2015 indicate that Bhutanese and non-Bhutanese workers tend to
be employed in very different jobs and to have very different skills profiles. This is evidence that
immigrant workers are not perfect substitutes for natives but might in fact complement Bhutanese workers.
Such complementarities have important policy implications because immigration may then be shown to

improve the employment prospects and raise the wages of many native-born workers. For instance, if
Bhutanese and non-Bhutanese workers are complements, an increasing number of low-skilled immigrant
workers in the construction industry might stimulate construction activities and in the process lead to more
jobs for relatively well-qualified Bhutanese citizens as supervisors or administrators in the same industry.

69. In recent years, sales and employment in existing nonfarm private sector firms have grown at a
slower pace than previously. An analysis of BES 2009 data found that the private sector in Bhutan was
developing quite rapidly. Excluding microenterprises, which were not covered by the BES 2009, the median
firm that existed both in 2006 and 2008 was found to have sales growth of 36 percent and employment
growth of 25 percent between the two years. The BES 2009 also found that about 24 percent of enterprises
surveyed were less than five years old (World Bank, 2009). According to the BES 2015, private sector growth
in sales and employment has continued in recent years, but more slowly. Again excluding microenterprises for
the sake of consistency, the median enterprise in Bhutan experienced sales growth of 33 percent and
employment growth of 20 percent between 2012 and 2014. If microenterprises are included, employment
growth was 37 percent over that period (Table 3.1).

Notes: Private nonfarm enterprises only. Jobs for permanent full-time workers only. Calculations take into account only those firms
that either existed in 2012 and survived between 2012 and 2014 or were created between 2012 and 2014 and survived until 2014.

70. The percentage of new firms created between 2012 and 2014 was highest among
microenterprises, but this was largely due to churning. About a fifth, 21 percent, of microenterprises
that existed in 2014 were created between 2012 and 2014. Such as high percentage of newly created
microenterprises within the span of two years could be either a positive sign of high dynamism and firm
creation or a negative sign of churning. Churning in this case refers to the process where a large number of
firms are created but most do not survive or do not grow. So firms close only to be replaced by new firms
that will also follow the same fate. In Bhutan’s case, there is strong evidence that the seemingly large




                                                              - 31 -
dynamism in terms of the creation of new microenterprise was due to churning. This is because the median
microenterprise that existed in 2012 did not grow in subsequent years.16 Thus, while it is relatively easy to
start a firm in Bhutan, many obstacles still prevent micro-firms from either growing or becoming stable and
sustainable microenterprises that provide more than a subsistence income to their owner. Other than
microenterprises, very few firms were created between 2012 and 2014. Overall employment growth during
this period was largely driven by the growth of enterprises that existed at the beginning of the period (Table
3.1).
71. Most employment growth between 2012 and 2014 was driven by medium-sized and large
enterprises. According to the BES 2015, close to 7,000 jobs were created by these firms between 2012 and
2014. Large enterprises created 45 percent of these jobs; the services industry created 60 percent of them.
While microenterprises dominate Bhutan’s private sector in terms of sheer numbers, between 2012 and 2014
they contributed little to job creation. The median firm in Bhutan—a microenterprise with two employees—
did not add any jobs at all between 2012 and 2014. The employment growth rate of the median
microenterprise also stood at zero percent, which means very few of Bhutan’s microenterprises turn from
“mice” (small firms that never grow much) into “gazelles” (small but fast-growing enterprises). At the same
time, there was positive employment growth in the median small, medium-sized and large enterprises. The
highest employment growth rate, 20 percent, was observed among small enterprises (Table 3.1).
72. Bhutan’s job creation dynamic is rather peculiar for a developing country and suggests that
Bhutan’s microenterprises face particular challenges to their viability or productivity. According to Li
and Rama (2015), microenterprises account for over 60 percent of job creation in most developing countries.
While larger enterprises everywhere tend to be more productive than smaller ones, the particularly low job
creation dynamic among Bhutan’s microenterprises points to particularly significant differences in
productivity between large and micro firms. In effect, the most productive firms are the most likely to grow
and thus to be categorized as large in 2014. While this explanation is consistent with the findings in the
literature on productivity and firm growth in developed countries (e.g., Ayyagari, Demirguc-Kunt, and
Maksimovic, 2011) no direct evidence on the productivity of large versus small enterprises in Bhutan exists.
In addition to low productivity, external factors (for example, taxes or access to finance) might also prevent
Bhutan’s small firms from growing and thus hamper their ability to contribute to job creation.17


3.2 CHALLENGES AND CURRENT GOVERNMENT APPROACH
73. All sizes of enterprises in Bhutan—large firms most of all—perceive labor regulations to be
one of the three biggest obstacles to operations. According to the BES 2015, close to 20 percent of all
firms cite labor regulations as the main obstacle to their operations. This makes labor regulations the second
most pressing obstacle to firms’ operations after access to finance. Moreover, for firms of all sizes, in all
industries, and across all locations, labor regulations are at least one of the top three most pressing obstacles.
Large firms seem to be most concerned about labor regulations. Overall, 14 percent of firms perceive labor
regulations as the biggest obstacle to their operations, while 22 percent of medium-sized firms and 26 percent
of large firms feel that way (Supplementary Table 3.2 below).


16 The calculations are based on the recall data of full-time permanent employment in 2012. This results in two main limitations: (i)
temporary jobs are not accounted for due to a lack of recall data; (ii) calculations represent only surviving firms and therefore do not
allow to account for job destruction associated with firms going out of business.
17 As already mentioned above, almost 100 percent of firms in the nonfarm economy in Bhutan are registered at start-up. Therefore,
the BES 2015 takes account of the full contribution of microenterprises to employment growth. If anything, the contribution of these
enterprises to job creation as captured in the BES 2015 may be overstated, given the high likelihood of microenterprises to exit the
market and thus destroy jobs.




                                                                 - 32 -
74. A major reason for the constraint labor regulations place on employers are the stringent
requirements governing employment of non-Bhutanese workers. 30 percent of firms with non-
Bhutanese workers cite labor regulations as the biggest obstacles to their operations while 34 percent of these
firms report that the restrictiveness of immigration rules are a moderate, major or very severe obstacle to their
operations. In statistical terms, a t-test shows that firms that consider labor regulations the biggest obstacle
have a significantly higher proportion of non-Bhutanese workers than those that do not see labor regulations
as a problem. Firms with temporary workers are also particularly likely to cite labor regulations, especially
immigration rules, as obstacles to their operations. Relaxing these constraints could lead to higher
productivity and growth in Bhutanese firms that employ foreign workers. In addition, given the
complementary skills of Bhutanese and non-Bhutanese workers, this move could increase private sector
employment, not only for migrant workers but also for Bhutanese, who would likely employed in supervisory
positions. (Supplementary Tables 3.2 and 3.3 below).
75. Many firms that would like to hire non-Bhutanese workers are unable to do so due to
restrictive or opaque immigration regulations. More than 40 percent of firms that perceive immigration
rules as at least a moderate obstacle to their operations do not employ any non-Bhutanese workers. This
indicates that firms already employing non-Bhutanese workers have found ways to deal with immigration
constraints but that other firms which would like to employ non-Bhutanese workers are unable to do so, thus
hampering their growth and development (Supplementary Table 3.3 below).
76. Many firms see high salary costs as an obstacle to their operations. Across all sizes and categories
of employers, a minimum of 20 to 30 percent of firms report that high salary costs pose at least a moderate
obstacle to them. Among large firms, the salary complaint rate reaches a high of 47 percent. What makes
matters worse from the perspective of these companies is that even though they perceive their salary costs as
high, many workers perceive the salaries they offer as low. As a result, the perceived unattractiveness of wages
is cited consistently across almost all types of firms as one of the three biggest reasons that it is difficult to
retain workers (Supplementary Tables 3.3 and 3.4 below).
77. Almost one-fourth of the firms in Bhutan’s nonfarm private sector has trouble retaining
workers. The issue of worker retention appears most pressing in the food and beverage industry and among
large firms. According to the BES 2015, 45 percent of firms in the food and beverage industry and 47 percent
of large firms report difficulty in retaining workers. Together with what workers consider unattractive wages,
lack of interest in the type of work and competition from other employers, these constitute the reasons it is
hard to keep workers. The last point may indicate that there are other characteristics of a job besides its
salary, location and other variables explicitly included in the BES 2015 questionnaire that might make it
unattractive (Supplementary Table 3.4 below).
78. Competition from the public sector is by far the most important reason that large firms find it
difficult to retain workers. Fully 42 percent of large companies indicate that competition from the public
sector is the biggest reason they cannot retain employees. Competition from the public sector is also one of
the top three reasons that medium-sized companies believe they cannot retain workers. The numbers indicate
that many workers now employed in the public sector or hunting for such jobs used to work in the private
sector but quit to pursue a public career. In many economies, large firms are generally more productive than
smaller ones. Therefore, the finding that many large private firms indicate that competition from the public
sector is the most significant reason for their difficulty in retaining employees is particularly worrisome. It
once again confirms the overwhelming reach of the public sector in important segments of Bhutan’s labor
market that was already documented in Chapter 2 (Supplementary Table 3.4 below).
79. A significant portion of Bhutan’s workers do not have the skills, knowledge or aptitude
required by private employers. Almost half of all firms, 41 percent, report that the unavailability of skilled



                                                      - 33 -
manpower is at least a moderate obstacle to their operations. Lack of skilled labor is an even more pressing
issue in the manufacturing industry, where 58 percent of all firms indicate that it is at least a moderate
obstacle. More than a third of firms—35 percent —see a lack of available workers with previous industry
experience as a significant constraint. Again, manufacturing firms are most affected: 58 percent of them
report that they face this constraint (Supplementary Table 3.5 below).
80. Among workers in Bhutan, technical skills, computer skills and soft skills are all in short
supply. Overall, close to 40 percent of firms regard their employees’ job-specific skills as lower than required.
The employees themselves are more upbeat: only 10 percent of them think that their job-specific skills are
inadequate. Even more worrisome, even though uptake of ICT is generally thought to be low among
nonfarm private sector firms in Bhutan (especially among those of modest size) close to 60 percent of
employers say their workers have insufficient computer skills. Only 23 percent of employees think this is the
case. Furthermore, from the perspective of employers, employees often have insufficient soft skills such as
leadership and teamwork skills. According to the nonfarm private sector firms surveyed in the BES 2015,
workers at 35 to 40 percent of firms have insufficient problem solving, critical thinking or leadership skills.
Additionally, employees at one-fourth of firms have teamwork skills that are below their employers’
requirements. Lack of English language, mathematical or management skills seems to be less of an issue.
These skills are mentioned as inadequate by only 23 percent, 15 percent and 13 percent of firms, respectively
(Supplementary Tables 3.6 and 3.7 below).18
81. Few firms offer training, even those that regard their workers’ insufficient skills as a constraint
on operations. Overall, only 14 percent of firms in Bhutan offer training for their workers, significantly
below the regional average.19 Nearly 80 percent of firms that do not offer training say this is because there is
no need for it. The finding is somewhat puzzling, given that many firms simultaneously complain about their
employees’ lack of skills. The answer might lie in companies’ perception that returns on (formal) training are
low, but no data on this point exists. Large firms are the only exception to this contradictory finding: 23
percent of large firms report that their operations are negatively affected by a lack of skilled manpower, and
86 percent of this group offers training (overall, 73 percent of large firms offer training) and none say there is
no need to offer training. Furthermore, large firms are the only category where the most prevalent reason for
not providing training is a lack of external training providers (Figure 3.7).
82. The RGoB has recognized the private sector’s important role in job creation and has taken
significant steps to foster the sector’s growth and development. The Eleventh Five-Year Plan calls for
the creation of 82,000 jobs by 2020. In contrast to earlier plans, it also explicitly shifts the focus away from
hydropower development alone and instead emphasizes achieving economic diversification through the
development of other industries. It identifies six industries as most promising for the employment of young
workers: (i) tourism, (ii) arts and crafts, (iii) construction, (iv) agriculture, (v) health, and (vi) information and
communication technology (ICT). This list of promising industries is consistent with the key strategies to
achieve economic self-reliance and full employment in 2020 as outlined in the Economic Development Policy
(launched by the government in 2010), which include: (i) diversifying the economic base, while leaving a
minimal ecological footprint, (ii) harnessing and adding value to natural resources in a sustainable manner, (iii)
18The relatively positive rating of employees’ language or mathematics skills might in part be due to the fact that BES 2015
respondents interpret skill levels relative to relevant comparison groups, such as workers in other South Asian countries. LaPrairie
(2016, p. 121) notes in the context of a case study of English-medium education in Bhutan that in spite of “graduates of Bhutan’s
education system having a tenuous mastery of English grammar, structure and vocabulary, leaving many unable to engage easily in
conversation in English,” employers and other stakeholders often positively assess the English language skills of these graduates
because they are better than the even more tenuous English language skills of students in other South Asian countries.
19For reasons of data availability, any regional comparison has to be based on data that do not include microenterprises. Hence, the

appropriate comparison is 26 percent in Bhutan versus 28.2 percent in the South Asia region according to World Bank Enterprise
Surveys from across the region.

increasing and diversifying exports, (iv) promoting Bhutan as an “organic brand,” (v) promoting industries
that build the Brand Bhutan image, and (vi) reducing dependence on fossil fuel in the transport industry. In
line with this policy of diversifying the economy and also diversifying some industries, the RGoB has also
taken active steps in engaging with the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other development
partners in various projects focused on the development of the ICT industry, agricultural value chains, and
small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as on the improvement of the investment climate.

83. The government has also recognized that there is a substantial mismatch between the skills
supplied by job seekers and those demanded by the private sector. While the Eleventh Five-Year Plan
explicitly acknowledges the challenges posed by an acute shortage of certain skills, in particular in the tourism
industry, it also notes that “an increasing numbers of students, including graduates from vocational and
tertiary institutions, are inadequately prepared to enter the workforce. On the other hand, Bhutan continues
to face an acute shortage of skilled and highly specialized manpower such as doctors, engineers, ICT experts
and teachers. This has resulted in a paradoxical situation of relatively high levels of youth unemployment and
a critical skills shortage at the same time.”
84. At the same time, the Eleventh Five-Year Plan and a number of other important policy
documents offer little detail on how the skills shortages and mismatches should be addressed.
Instead, policy documents often shift to the topic of incentivizing businesses and industries that give priority
to the employment of Bhutanese citizens. To the extent to which employment of non-Bhutanese workers
happens as a result of shortages of specialized skills that may not be available locally or because Bhutanese
workers are reluctant to engage in certain types of activities (such as jobs that do not pay high salaries and
might be deemed dirty, dangerous or difficult), this threatens to constrain the development of some

potentially promising industries as well as to hamper the productivity of firms that currently employ migrant
workers in reaction to the shortage of relevant labor supply among the native-born population.20


3.3 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
85. The analysis of labor demand with the help of the BES 2015 has identified a number of barriers
to the growth of employment in Bhutan’s private sector. Barriers to private sector employment in
Bhutan include (i) restrictions on the employment of non-Bhutanese workers, (ii) a lack of workers with the
necessary technical, computer and soft skills, (iii) high wage expectations and competition from the public
sector, and (iv) workers’ lack of interest in the employment opportunities provided by the private sector.
Many of these obstacles are similar to those faced by various other resource-rich countries like Oman and
other oil-rich economies around the Persian Gulf (Malik and Awadallah 2013; World Bank 2012c).
86. Expanded access to better quality education would improve private sector employment
creation in the long run. As mentioned in Chapter 2, in Bhutan two-thirds of workers with tertiary
education are employed in the public sector. At the same time, the country’s private sector suffers from skills
shortages and mismatches. This situation limits the development of a vibrant private sector and the creation
of more well-paying and otherwise desirable private sector jobs. Heavy investment in further expansion of
access to education (specifically at the preschool level and beyond grade ten), and even more importantly in
increased quality of education, would improve workers’ jobs prospects and productivity and ultimately
stimulate private sector employment. Hits recommendation is in line with the emphasis of access and quality
of education in both the Eleventh Five-Year Plan and the Bhutan Education Blueprint 2014–2024 (Ministry
of Education MoE 2014). The Bhutan Education Blueprint 2014–2024 also lays out a comprehensive
roadmap for how to transform the education system to ensure that students in Bhutan receive the best of
indigenous wisdom and global competence.
87. Bhutan’s training and education system could benefit from providing more opportunities for
on-the-job training. For those who are already out of school opportunities for mid-career retraining could
be expanded and training curricula revised with the objective of (i) incorporating on-the-job training or
internship components to provide trainees with practical experiences, and (ii) aligning training content more
closely with the needs of the private sector. Nepal’s Employment Fund is one example of a successful short-
term training program that combines many international best practices. Each year, the Employment Fund
issues a call for proposals for various short term-trainings. Interested training providers complete a Rapid
Market Assessment outlining potential employment opportunities for trainees. The Employment Fund selects
providers according to their capacity, track record, the demand for their proposed trainings, and the proposed
costs. Training includes classroom-based learning but also job placement services. The Employment Fund
verifies trainees’ employment status three months and six months after they complete training, and the
payment for training providers is outcome-based. This creates strong incentives for training providers to
provide placement assistance (Chakravarty et al. 2015).
88. More intensive computer and soft skills training could increase the relevance of the
educational and training system. For the population that is still in school or university, the introduction
and facilitation of internships to gain industry experience and to acquire necessary work ethics could be


20It should be mentioned that for a number of sector more detailed strategies for how to address skills shortages and mismatches
have been developed. For instance, for the ICT sector a strategy has been proposed to establish industry-academia linkages.
According to the strategy, institutions of higher education will collaborate with enterprises to resolve the mismatch between labor
supply and demand. Various specific activities such as internships, guest lectures and research collaboration are all part of the strategy.
The government will also play a critical role in terms of institutionalizing the linkages between academia and the private sector.




                                                                  - 36 -
helpful. Furthermore, given the widespread lack of soft skills, the introduction of soft-skill specific training
modules in education and training curricula could be useful. Since computer literacy is relatively low, it would
be advisable to identify the exact computer skills that are missing as well as lessons learned from existing ICT
training programs such as the three-tiered skills program for promoting the ICT/ICT-enabled services
industry introduced as part of the World-Bank-supported Private Sector Development Project. Based on
these existing experiences and whenever possible and appropriate, ICT training modules could be introduced
and strengthened in both general education and vocational training programs.
89. Clearer and simpler regulations associated with the employment of foreign labor could ease
constraints to firms’ operations. To a large extent, the sentiment that labor regulations are an important
constraint to doing business in Bhutan can be traced back to specific constraints related to the employment
of non-Bhutanese workers. The revision, clarification and simplification of regulations associated with the
employment of foreign labor would improve the business climate in Bhutan and promote the growth of the
private sector. In this context, Bhutan could learn from international best practices for managing labor
migration. Models worth studying might, for instance, include those of South Korea or Malaysia. As detailed
in World Bank (2013b), since 2004 South Korea has managed the migration of low-skilled workers through
the Employment Permit System. The core principles of the system are complementarity (between native and
foreign workers), transparency, alignment with firms’ needs, and a focus on temporary migration and non-
discrimination (foreign workers have access to social insurance and receive lump-sum pension payouts at the
end of their contracts). In Malaysia, while some challenges still need to be addressed with respect to migration
management, the country has taken many steps to improve the system’s efficiency and effectiveness. These
steps include the introduction of online processing portals for all immigrants and the deployment of new
technologies and policies to streamline migration management processes (World Bank 2015c).
90. To address the widespread lack of interest in private sector jobs among Bhutan’s workforce, a
number of interventions could potentially be helpful. An information, education and communication
(IEC) campaign to increase the prestige and desirability of private sector jobs could be mounted. Today, IEC
campaigns are predominantly used in the area of public health to promote healthier lifestyles or to limit the
spread of epidemics. There is a growing body evidence of evidence that IEC campaigns in these areas have
had a significant impact. IEC campaigns have also increasingly been used in social protection or human
development programs to change the behaviors of beneficiaries or their families and communities in order to
create an environment that enables productive participation and human capital accumulation.
91. Reinforced efforts to foster broad-based private sector development and productivity could
increase the attractiveness of the private sector to highly educated workers, and strengthen its
capacity to absorb job seekers. As mentioned above, the RGoB has recognized that Bhutan’s future
development depends on a strong private sector and has launched a number of laudable initiatives to
strengthen the private sector. As jobs are a product of labor demand, only reinforced efforts to foster broad-
based private sector development and productivity can ultimately increase the attractiveness of the private
sector as an employer of choice for highly qualified job seekers and reduce the existing imbalances between
the public and the private sector. Moreover, they can contribute to the creation of a dynamic economic
environment in Bhutan’s cities. Such efforts can therefore play a big part in confronting the policy challenges
that Bhutan faces as an agrarian and resource-rich economy (Box 3.1).21



21 Renewed efforts to foster broad-based private sector development, expanded access to better quality education, and clearer, simpler
regulations on foreign labor would all serve the same objective: to increase the productivity of private sector workers in Bhutan and
thereby improve the number and quality of jobs in the sector. If pursued together, all three policy directions could be mutually
reinforcing.




                                                                - 37 -
92. Efforts to foster business productivity and profitability could be particularly helpful for
microenterprises. On average, microenterprises struggle more than larger firms when it comes to retaining
workers. The main reasons that microenterprises cite for not being able to retain workers are unrealistically
high salary expectations and competition from other firms. Almost 50 percent of microenterprises cite high
salary costs as an obstacle to retaining workers, compared to an average of 20 to 30 percent of firms of other
sizes. Microenterprises also seem to be more likely to lose workers because the jobs they offer are not
desirable. On the other hand, microenterprise have less trouble finding workers with the right skills. This
might be explained by the fact that their business model builds on the skills available in the labor market and
that they would thus be less likely to demand a high level of skills. Therefore, the most beneficial
interventions for microenterprises would be those that would allow them to increase their profitability and
productivity, ultimately enabling them to pay higher wages.

BOX 3.1 PROMOTING PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
According to the 2015 edition of the Statistical Yearbook of Bhutan, the size of the private sector in 2014 was
over 42,000 businesses. About 69 percent of businesses are classified as cottage, micro or small businesses
where cottage or micro businesses are defined as those with up to four employees and a total investment of
less than Nu 1,000,000 (about $15,000 at current exchange rates). Small businesses have five to 19 employees
and total investment of Nu 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 ($15,000 to $150,000). Another 34 percent of businesses
are classified as contract businesses. Since the great majority of contract businesses are micro businesses as
well, together micro and small businesses are 99 percent of the private sector (NSB 2015). There are about
350 limited liability companies (LLCs), and a handful of joint-stock companies and partnerships. The
remaining businesses are essentially sole proprietorships, with or without employees. The stock market is
small, with about 20 listed companies.22
Specific factors hurt the competitiveness of private firms operating in Bhutan, including a difficult investment
climate and low productivity levels. In the World Bank’s Doing Business Report 2016 (World Bank 2015b),
Bhutan, represented by its capital Thimphu, ranked 71st out of 189 countries in the ease of doing business.
This made it the best-performing country in South Asia, placing it behind only a handful of other lower-
middle income countries including Armenia, Georgia, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia. Bhutan
performed best in the area of trading across borders, where it is ranked 28th. Its weakest areas are starting a
business (91), protecting minority investors (115), and resolving insolvency (189).
Over the past few years, the RGoB has taken important steps to improve Bhutan’s investment climate. In the
area of business registration, it eliminated two procedures that required name approval and location clearance.
In the area of property registration, in 2008 it created a Land Commission to handle cases involving the
transfer of property. In 2009, it improved its credit information system by launching a public credit registry.
In 2013, the Royal Monetary Authority opened a collateral registry for movable collateral. More recently,
Bhutan made getting electricity easier by speeding up the process for obtaining a new connection and also
made transferring property easier by introducing a computerized land information system.
The World Bank Group is supporting the RGoB’s efforts to further improve its business environment as part
of a broader technical assistance engagement on investment climate reform. In some reform areas, like the
improvement of business registration procedures, improvements in e-government and e-services, or revision
of the Bankruptcy Act, the RGoB’s efforts are also supported by the World Bank through the Second
Development Policy Credit.

employment protection, provisions against child labor and occupational safety and health standards), labor
market interventions (active and passive labor market policies) and industrial relations both from a legal and
an empirical point of view. Special emphasis is put on the implementation of labor market regulations on the
ground and on policies regulating the movement of people into and out of Bhutan. Regulations on the
movement of people are particularly significant because they are directly related to Bhutan’s stated goal of
achieving economic self-reliance by 2020 (Box 4.1).
94. Labor regulations in Bhutan are administered through the Labor and Employment Act of 2007.
The Act covers hiring conditions, minimum wages, working hours, leave policies, employment and income
protection, the hiring of foreign labor and industrial relations. In addition to the Labor and Employment Act,
the MoLHR has adopted directives on labor market interventions as well as 21 rules and regulations
supporting the Labor and Employment Act. Twelve of these rules and regulations refer to employment
conditions (like the Rules on Hours of Work of 2009, the Leave Regulations of 2009 and the National Wage
Order of 2014). The other nine cover occupational safety and health. The rules and regulations on
occupational safety and health encompass both preventive and protective measures that are to be observed
and implemented by workers and employers.
95. While Bhutan is neither a member of the ILO nor a signatory to any ILO convention, the
country’s Labor and Employment Act is in compliance with most of the core ILO conventions. Eight
fundamental ILO Conventions—on forced labor, child labor, freedom of association and the right to
organize, and non-discrimination—are binding upon all the organization’s member countries. Bhutan is
neither a member of the ILO nor a signatory to any ILO convention. Nevertheless, Article 6 of the Labor
and Employment Act prohibits forced or compulsory labor, Article 9 prohibits the worst forms of child labor
and Articles 11 to 13 prohibit discrimination against employees and job seekers and mandate equal pay for
equal work. In addition, Article 170 sets 18 as the minimum age of employment and limits employment of
youth aged 13–17 to certain workplaces and categories of work. Finally, according to Article 176 of the Act,
the workers of an enterprise that has 12 or more workers with an employment contract may form a workers’
association. While workers’ associations are permitted to engage in collective bargaining, failure to ratify the
core ILO conventions related to freedom of association and the right to organize might be the biggest
obstacle to Bhutan joining the organization.23
96. In practice, only the minority of workers in Bhutan who are regularly paid employees with a
contract of employment with a duration of one year or more are covered by the provisions of the
Labor and Employment Act. As detailed in Chapter 1, informal work is widespread among Bhutan’s
population and endemic among certain groups, such as individuals with low education and those from rural
areas and poor households. Moreover, according to the Labor and Employment Act, the rules regarding

23 It should be noted that Bhutan has ratified the following international treaties that concern the welfare, rights and protection of its
citizens: the Charter of the United Nations; the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination;
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; the United Nations Convention on
the Rights of the Child; the SAARC Convention on Regional Arrangements for the Promotion of Child Welfare in South Asia; the
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; and the two CRC Optional Protocols on the Sale of Children, Child
Prostitution and Child Pornography, and on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (cf. MoF, 2014).




                                                                  - 46 -
employment contracts apply only to employment relationships with a duration of one year or more. 24 Many
provisions of the Labor and Employment Act do not apply to temporary employment contracts and there are
no restrictions in the Act governing the length or renewal of temporary employment contracts, or their use
for permanent tasks. Given this lenient regulatory environment, it should probably come as no surprise that a
large proportion of Bhutan’s private sector workers are on temporary employment contracts (as explained in
more detail in Chapter 3, nearly 50 percent of all those employed in Bhutan’s nonfarm private sector are in
fact on temporary contracts).
97. Compared to other lower-middle income countries, Bhutan’s statutory minimum wage is
relatively low and does not pose a threat to job creation. On August 1, 2011, Bhutan introduced a
national minimum wage of Nu 100 per day or Nu 3,000 per month applicable to all workers irrespective of
age, sex, disability or skills. On the same day, a separate (and higher) minimum wage was introduced for the
National Work Force: those Bhutanese employed by government agencies for their projects or works. On
February 1, 2014, Bhutan’s general minimum wage was revised to Nu 125 per day or Nu 3,750 per month.
This is equivalent to $61 per month at current exchange rates. According to the BLFS 2014, a Bhutanese
worker aged 15 years or older earns Nu 14,199 ($233) a month on average. Bhutan’s minimum wage thus
amounts to approximately 26 percent of average earnings. According to the World Bank’s Doing Business
Report the ratio of the minimum wage to value added per worker in 2015 was 0.21 (World Bank 2015b).
Both the ratio of the minimum wage to average earnings and its ratio to value added are lower in Bhutan than
in most other lower-middle income countries. As a result, few job seekers in Bhutan would accept job offers
at the statutory minimum wage level. Among the unemployed surveyed in the BLFS 2014, less than half a
percent say they would be willing to take up a job that paid at or below the minimum wage.
98. Bhutan’s leave provisions correspond to international norms, while the country’s standard
working hours are comparatively long. In Bhutan, an employee is legally entitled to sick leave, annual
leave, casual leave, and maternity or paternity leave (see Chapter 2 for effective coverage rates in the public
and private sectors). Additionally, employees are legally entitled to be absent from work during a minimum of
nine public holidays each year. The mandatory minimum amount of paid annual leave is one and a half days
of annual leave for each month of work. Accrual begins after six months of employment, and annual leave
can only be taken after twelve months of continuous employment. This equates to international norms, but
working hours are longer. A standard workday is hours, and a standard work week lasts six days. As a result,
many workers in Bhutan are engaged in comparatively long working hours. According to the BLFS 2014, the
average work week in the country (including overtime) comprises more than 50 hours.
99. The rules and regulations for terminating a contract for economic reasons are more flexible in
Bhutan than in most neighboring or otherwise comparable countries. In Bhutan, a party to a contract
of employment may at any time give notice to the other party, in writing, of the intention to terminate the
contract. By paying a sum equal to the basic pay that the employee would have earned during the notice
period, either party may terminate the contract without waiting for the end of the notice period. If an
employer terminates an employment contract under redundancy provisions, the employer is obliged to (i)
consult with the workers’ association or if there is no such association—with the employees, advising them of
the number of employees likely to be made redundant and the period over which redundancies may occur; (ii)
give notice of not less than 30 days and additional notice of seven days for every year of continuous
employment, up to a maximum of 42 days; and (iii) notify the Chief Labor Administrator (the head of the
MoLHR’s Secretariat) about the redundancy proposal.


 The employment and working conditions of the uniformed members of the Royal Body Guards, the Royal Bhutan Army and the
24
Royal Bhutan Police are also formally outside the scope of the Act.

100. The Labor and Employment Act does not stipulate severance pay, and there is also no
unemployment insurance scheme. However, if an employer terminates an employment contract
unlawfully, the employee may initiate dispute resolution procedures. In the case of wrongful dismissal the
courts may do one or more of the following: (i) with consent of the employee and employer, order that the
employee be reinstated to his or her employment to the same or an equivalent position, and that the
employee be treated as if he or she had never been dismissed; (ii) order the employer to pay compensation to
the worker equal to one month’s pay for each year of continuous employment up, to a maximum of six
months’ pay; and (iii) order costs to be paid in such sums as the courts consider just.
101. Bhutan’s legal minimum age of employment, 18, would seem to protect children but
nevertheless some children are employed. Based on data from the Child Labor Indicators compiled by the
Understanding Children’s Work inter-agency research cooperation program, in Bhutan 3.8 percent of children
aged five to 14—or about 6,000 children—are employed. About 1.1 percent of five-to-14-year-olds are
employed and not attending school, and 2.7 percent of this age group are employed while also attending
school. Both numbers are lower than the corresponding average figures for lower-middle income countries.
In the mean, in lower-middle income countries 2.8 percent of children aged five to 14 work without attending
school and 12.8 percent of children of the same age range combine school and work. At the same time, at
14.1 percent the proportion of five-to-14-year-olds who are neither in school nor working is higher in Bhutan
than in other lower-middle income countries (12.8 percent). This discrepancy can largely be explained by the
comparatively low proportion of children aged five or six in Bhutan who are in kindergarten, preschool or
school (Table 4.1).

102. Bhutan’s policy for the enforcement of labor regulations is in line with international best
practices. According to the Labor and Employment Act, the main functions of Bhutan’s labor inspectors are
(i) to advise employees and employers about their legal rights and obligations, (ii) to facilitate the
implementation of the Act by providing information, advice and guidance to employers and employees as
well as to the self-employed and (iii) to investigate and, when necessary, take action in accordance with the
Act and other applicable regulations to deal with alleged infringements. This is in line with international best
practices for modern labor inspectorates. Internationally, labor inspectorates aspire to 60 percent proactive
inspections and 40 percent reactive inspections (in response to accidents or complaints), and to apply risk
prioritization toward workplaces with the highest risks of occupational safety and health infringements
(TNO, 2008).
103. Only a fraction of workplace accidents and incidents are reported to the authorities, who visit a
minority of workplaces liable for inspections each year. Between July 2013 and June 2014, the MoLHR’s
Department of Labor received 106 complaints, including 53 associated with non-payment of wages, 18
related to non-payment of benefits, and 13 associated with termination without notice. During the same time


                                                                 - 48 -
period, 55 workplace accidents and incidents were reported to the Department (MoLHR 2013). However, the
Annual Health Bulletin for the year 2013 lists 28,705 work-related injuries (MoH 2013). This indicates that
most workplace accidents are not reported to the MoLHR. Also, while 4,975 workplaces are liable for
inspection visits, according to the annual report of the MoLHR’s Department of Labor for July 2013 and
June 2014, inspectors visited only 1,202.
104. Strict rules regulate the employment of non-Bhutanese workers. Bhutan’s Labor and
Employment Act requires that no person shall employ a foreigner unless the employer has obtained prior
approval from the Chief Labor Administrator. Moreover, quotas have been established for the maximum
number of foreigners who may work in Bhutan, including quotas for specified industries and occupations.
The Labor and Employment Act also stipulates that no employer shall terminate a Bhutanese worker’s
employment contract for the purpose of employing a foreigner. An employer also may not terminate
Bhutanese workers’ employment unless the employer has first terminated the employment contracts of all
foreigners working in a capacity similar to that of the Bhutanese citizen or resident.
105. Bhutan’s active labor market programs stress training, entrepreneurship support, and
employment opportunities abroad. While no rigorous evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
of Bhutan’s labor market programs exists, the country generally focuses on programs with relatively high unit
costs and a small number of beneficiaries. For example, the Guaranteed Employment Program (GEP) aims
to support 5,000 youth during the period of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. Under the GEP the MoLHR pays a
monthly allowance to program participants. Employers are required to top up the allowance by an amount
specified in the program guidelines. In terms of entrepreneurship support, a prominent program is the Skills
for Employment and Entrepreneur Development (SEED) initiative, which provides vocational skills to
aspiring entrepreneurs. The SEED initiative aims to provide skills to young, ambitious individuals interested
in setting up their own businesses. It offers practical experience in entrepreneurship, technical skills and soft
skills (such as communication, marketing, and resource management). The objective is to train 500 individuals
during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. Another employment support program is the small-scale but high-profile
Overseas Employment Program. The Overseas Employment Program gives Bhutanese citizens a structured
way to take up employment abroad.

Notes: Data are for 2015. Tabulated are taxes and contributions payable by a medium-sized company in the second year of operation,
expressed as a share of commercial profits. Profit tax gives the amount of taxes on profits paid by the business, labor taxes and
contributions the amount of taxes and mandatory contributions on labor paid by the business and other taxes the amount of taxes
and mandatory contributions paid by the business that are not already included in the categories of profit or labor taxes.

106. Taxes on profits are in line with the regional average; employers pay no specific labor taxes.
The Doing Business Report measures labor and other taxes as a share of commercial profit. It finds that in
Bhutan, businesses pay an average of 33.9 percent of commercial profits in taxes. This is broadly similar to
most comparable countries in South Asia. At the same time, a key difference between Bhutan and other

South Asian countries is that employers in Bhutan pay no labor taxes. The only other South Asian country
that doesn’t impose labor taxes on employers is Bangladesh (Table 4.2).25
107. While workers’ associations are regulated through the Labor and Employment Act, social
partnerships generally play only a limited role in shaping labor relations in Bhutan. Social partnerships
can be defined as tri- or multi-party arrangements that may involve employers, trade unions, the government
and other stakeholders. Bhutan’s constitution states, “[a] Bhutanese citizen shall have the right of freedom of
association, other than membership to associations that are harmful to the peace and unity of the country,
and shall have the right not to be compelled to belong to any association.” As already mentioned above, the
Labor and Employment Act also explicitly allows workers in an enterprise with 12 or more employees with
an employment contract to form a workers’ association. Nevertheless, there are only few organized interest
groups in Bhutan, and these are of minor importance. Trade unions spanning multiple enterprises or entire
industries do not exist. On the employers’ side, there are some influential business organizations such as the
Association of Bhutanese Tour Operators or the Bhutan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) are few in number and mostly focus on issues such as the environment
and women’s and children’s welfare. Overall, the government remains dominant in designing and
implementing labor market policies (Bertelsmann Stiftung 2014).


4.2 CHALLENGES AND CURRENT GOVERNMENT APPROACH
108. Labor market policies, in particular labor regulations, are an important component of a
country’s business environment. As argued in the World Development Report 2013 on Jobs, labor
regulations should avoid both over- and under-regulation. For instance, overly strict employment protection
laws may discourage hiring and reduce economic growth by creating disincentives for workers to move from
lower- to higher-productivity jobs. At the same time, under-regulation can also have adverse effects. For
example, health and productivity can decline if workers are constantly asked to work long hours with no
weekly rest days or are not allowed to take sick leave. According to the World Development Report, between
these two extremes there is a plateau where appropriate regulations can alleviate market failures, protect
workers, and contribute to shared prosperity, without imposing unreasonable costs on firms.
109. With the notable exception of limits on the employment of foreign labor, labor regulations in
Bhutan are rather flexible and the country seems to be on the plateau that avoids both over- and
under-regulation. Apart from stringent rules and regulations on the employment of non-Bhutanese workers,
the Labor and Employment Act stipulates few restrictions in hiring and firing of workers. For example, there
are no limits on fixed-term contracts and few restrictions on terminating employees for economic reasons. In
addition, minimum wages are low compared to average wages.26 Therefore, with the notable exception of
regulations on the employment of foreign labor, labor regulations are not a major impediment to job creation.
At the same time, the Labor and Employment Law regulates work hours, annual leave and occupational
safety and health in ways that are in line with international standards. For employees covered by the
Act!and under the condition that rules are enforced in practice!workers are generally offered adequate
protection.
110. The only overly stringent aspect of labor regulations concerns the employment of non-
Bhutanese workers. Bhutan’s enterprises are heavily dependent on foreign labor. In 2013, Bhutan’s

25 Although employers in Bhutan pay no labor taxes, employees pay personal income tax on their labor earnings and an additional 1
percent of their gross salaries as health insurance contributions.
26 As mentioned above the statutory minimum wage amounts to approximately one-quarter of average earnings, lower than the ratio
in most other lower-middle income countries.




                                                               - 50 -
enterprises employed 41,400 non-Bhutanese workers, according to the MoLHR. As detailed in Chapter 3,
non-Bhutanese workers account for a fifth or more of all workers in half of the enterprises covered by the
BES 2015, and dominate employment in about 10 percent of nonfarm private sector firms. Overall, demand
is highest for workers from abroad who possess specific skills that are in short supply in Bhutan, although
most foreign workers actually have relatively low qualifications (Chapter 3). In spite of the high demand for
foreign labor, regulations concerning the employment of non-Bhutanese workers are very restrictive. In the
future, the government plans to introduce a foreign workers fee system to streamline recruitment and to
decentralize approval procedures for employment of foreign worker. Other steps that have been undertaken
to streamline the access to non-Bhutanese workers include the establishment of an online system to apply for
employment permits.
111. Even though protections against the worst forms of child labor form an integral part of the
Labor and Employment Act and the government is committed to strengthening the child protection
system, some children are still working rather than attending school. Child labor is less prevalent in
Bhutan than in other South Asian countries (Khan and Lyon 2015). Nevertheless, as cited above about 1.1
percent of five-to-14-year-olds work rather than going to school, and another 2.7 percent of children this age
work while also attending school. These numbers make it clear that child labor is an issue that deserves
considerable attention.
112. The capacity of the government to oversee labor regulations and occupational safety and
health standards is limited. The availability of resources, including inspection officers and dedicated
vehicles, dictates the pace of labor inspection visits. There are only 23 inspectors in the Department of Labor
of the MoLHR. In order to compensate for the shortage of inspectors, the Department of Labor has
prioritized the formation of health and safety committees in companies in heavy industries that employ more
than 50 workers. A health and safety committee enables management and worker representatives to meet
regularly and work cooperatively to develop policies and procedures that improve occupational safety and
health.
113. Active labor market programs have two basic objectives: economic (making it more likely that
the unemployed find jobs) and social (improve inclusion and participation rates for productive
employment). If well-designed, properly targeted and correctly implemented, such programs have the
potential to significantly improve labor market performance. At the same time, various reviews of active labor
market programs indicate that such programs are not a panacea for resolving large-scale unemployment
problems, and that expectations must be realistic. Active labor market programs cannot substitute for
structural labor market reforms (Kuddo 2013).

Note: “Effective” means that the average employment or reemployment probability of a person participating in the indicated measure
is increased, “unanimous” means that virtually all studies show the indicated effect, “mixed” means that some studies show the
indicated effect but other studies do not.

114. No rigorous evidence exists on the effectiveness or efficiency of Bhutan’s existing active labor
market programs; however, it can be observed that the country generally focuses on programs with
relatively high unit costs and a small number of beneficiaries. Bhutan places a lot of emphasis on
training and entrepreneurship assistance programs. While international evidence suggests that these types of
active labor market programs can be helpful in improving labor market outcomes, international experience
also shows that public employment services (including career guidance services, job and vocational
counseling, and various job search assistance programs such as job search skills training programs, job clubs,
and vacancy and job fairs) are often more effective and cost-effective, provided that a reasonable number of
job vacancies is available (Table 4.3; Kluve 2006; Betcherman et al. 2007 Lehmann and Kluve 2008).
115. Strengthening public employment services is a key element of the RGoB’s Eleventh Five-Year
Plan. The Eleventh Five-Year Plan emphasizes the need to strengthen the capacity of regional employment
and labor offices to effectively deliver services related to labor administration and intermediation. This
includes revamping the job portal system to improve delivery of employment facilitation services, conducting
periodic market surveys, and commissioning studies to provide relevant, up-to-date information on
employment (GNHC 2013).
116. Labor taxes, which discourage labor demand by raising labor costs for employers and reduce
labor supply by lowering the disposable income of wage workers, are not an acute problem in
Bhutan. Labor taxes create a “tax wedge” between labor costs to the employer and the worker’s take-home
pay, thereby reducing both employment and economic growth. International evidence suggests that high
payroll taxes can be associated with higher unemployment rates and lower formality rates (Elmeskov, Martin
and Scarpetta 1998). It is estimated that a ten-percentage-point increase in the labor tax wedge can reduce
formal employment from 1 to 5 percentage points, with the biggest effect on youth and low-skilled workers
(Lehmann and Muravyev 2014). As Bhutan has comparatively low labor taxes, a tax wedge between labor
costs and workers’ take-home pay is not a priority challenge.


4.3 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS NS
117. The government could consider revising, clarifying and simplifying regulations associated
with foreign workers. As mentioned in Chapter 3, business constraints related to labor regulations rank
high on employers’ list of impediments to doing business in Bhutan. In the BES 2015, 22.6 percent of
employers considered labor regulations the single biggest obstacle to the operation of their firm. To a large
extent, the sentiment that labor regulations are a major constraint on business can be traced to specific
constraints on the employment of non-Bhutanese workers.27 The revision, clarification and simplification of
regulations associated with the employment of foreign labor would improve the business climate in Bhutan
and promote the growth of the private sector. Moreover, in many cases the skills of Bhutanese and non-
Bhutanese workers are complementary. Many foreign workers either have specialized qualifications that
Bhutanese workers lack or are willing to perform tasks that Bhutanese workers are reluctant to engage in.
This means smarter regulations concerning the employment of non-Bhutanese workers would not only
improve the business climate but would also increase the employment prospects of Bhutanese workers.



27As noted by Rutkowski (2007), employers’ subjective perceptions of labor regulations are not necessarily correlated with indices of
labor market rigidity because they are formed relative to other obstacles to firm activity.

118. Regulations on foreign labor could be designed to promote knowledge transfer between
foreign and local workers and the hiring of foreign workers whose skills complement Bhutanese
labor. One possibility of realizing both knowledge transfers and complementarities within the confines of a
single firm would be to issue permits for hiring non-Bhutanese workers to firms based on the recruitment or
on-the-job training of Bhutanese workers. As discussed in World Bank (2013a), in many Arab states of the
Persian Gulf, similar administrative requirements require firms to employ a threshold share of nationals in
their workforces (so-called Bahrainization, Emiratization, Kuwaitization, Omanization, Qatarization, and
Saudization policies).
119. The capacity of the government to oversee labor regulations and occupational safety and
health standards could benefit from strengthening. Because only a fraction of workplace accidents and
incidents are reported, more awareness and advocacy on occupational safety, health, and accident reporting
procedures is needed for all workplaces in Bhutan. Although the extent of child labor is limited in scale
compared to other countries in South Asia, it also needs constant monitoring. The Department of Labor may
need more labor inspectors and more resources to conduct labor inspections, especially in remote areas.
Greater capacity to enforce the Labor and Employment Act will increase compliance and ensure that workers
are paid, work reasonable hours and receive all legally mandated benefits (coverage of which is often
underwhelming, as noted in Chapter 2). While the enforcement of Bhutan’s Labor and Employment Act has
had some unintended consequences it has also had the desirable effect of increasing paid employment and
reducing hours worked (Box 4.2).
120. Bhutan could systematize monitoring and evaluation of active labor market programs, and
complement training and entrepreneurship support programs by more thorough, more tailored
employment services. More systematic monitoring and evaluation of existing active labor market programs
could improve understanding of their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. In addition, it might be possible to
complement existing programs focused largely on training, support for entrepreneurship and employment
opportunities abroad by introducing or enhancing basic employment services. These services could include
but would not need to be limited to (i) job search assistance services and job search skills training programs,
(ii) job cafes or clubs, (iii) job and vacancy fairs, (iv) employer-focused intermediation services, (v) small
business advisory meetings, (vi) events providing information on the labor market and the availability of jobs,
and (vii) career, job, and vocational counseling (either individual or group-based). The facilitation of work
opportunities outside of Bhutan, such as through the continuation or scale-up of the Overseas Employment
Program, could also help Bhutanese citizens whose skills are not in demand in the domestic labor market. In
this context, it would be important to emphasize effective measures to protect the overseas workers’ well-
being, safety and security.
121. Bhutan could also consider establishing a labor market observatory (LMO). Currently, little
pertinent, up-to-date and granular information on Bhutan’s labor market is available. To rectify this deficit, a
LMO could (i) compile and disseminate information on the state of the labor market and important trends,
(ii) conduct comparative research, and (iii) evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of active labor
market programs (see, for example, Martín, 2011). A well-managed LMO can improve the functioning of a
labor market by providing information that allows different stakeholders to make rational, evidence-based
decisions. In particular, it can be helpful for groups with scant access to information about labor supply and
demand, and could thus, for instance, help integrate rural-to-urban migrants into the urban economy
(something that is particularly crucial for urbanizing countries such as Bhutan, per the discussion in Chapter
1).
122. Finally, deeper social dialogue could play an important role in framing collective or firm-level
solutions to labor market challenges. Social dialogue between employers and employees can enable
workers to more successfully transition between different employment situations while also helping


                                                     - 53 -
businesses respond more flexibly to the shifting demands of an economy and to changes in the competitive
landscape. In this context, employment protection legislation could continue to be an instrument for
safeguarding core labor standards, and over time workers’ and employers’ associations could play a greater
role in determining employment relations through collective bargaining, with the aim of finding the right
balance between flexibility and security. Ultimately, deeper social dialogue could help create a dynamic
economic environment, especially in Bhutan’s cities, and thus respond to one of the priority policy challenges
that Bhutan faces as an agrarian economy.


BOX 4.1 INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION AND ECONOMIC SELF-RELIANCE
Bhutan aims to achieve economic self-reliance by 2020. In a working paper published in 2015, the Ministry of
Finance notes that self-reliance is defined as “relying on oneself or one’s own effort and abilities rather than
those exerted or supplied by other people.” The paper goes on to argue that while in the narrowest sense of
the word self-reliance might be understood to mean producing everything you need from within the country
“this strict definition is irrelevant in this present interconnected world and particularly for Bhutan, a
landlocked with limited resource endowment nation.” It also asks what economic self-reliance could mean for
Bhutan’s labor force and mentions the high prevalence of non-Bhutanese workers in some industries in
Bhutan today (MoF 2015).
Research on immigration’s impact on Bhutanese workers is very limited. Fortunately, the BES 2015 offers a
unique opportunity to examine the presence of foreign workers in different parts of Bhutan’s private nonfarm
economy. As detailed in Chapter 3, the prevalence of foreign workers is rather high among medium-sized and
large firms in this sector. As again detailed in Chapter 3, the BES 2015 indicates that immigrant workers are
present across the entire skills spectrum but are for the most part active in jobs that require little education
and pay low wages. As noted in Chapter 2, outside agriculture most Bhutanese workers—especially younger
ones entering the labor market—are generally at least moderately well-educated and have relatively high wage
demands. This suggests that the majority of immigrant and native workers in the nonfarm private sector
complement each other.28
Complementarities between native and immigrant workers have important policy implications. In particular,
they imply that the employment of foreign workers improves the employment prospects and raises the wage
levels of many native-born workers. For instance, assume that Bhutanese and immigrant workers in the
construction industry are in fact complements. Assume further that while Bhutanese workers are generally
well-educated and interested in white-collar jobs, non-Bhutanese workers have less formal education but are
more willing to work in blue-collar jobs. In this scenario, an increasing number of immigrant blue-collar
workers in the industry will stimulate construction activity and in the process lead to a higher number of
white-collar jobs for Bhutanese citizens as supervisors or administrators.
The apparent complementarity between Bhutanese and immigrant workers suggests that the strict definition
of economic self-reliance as “producing everything you need from within the country” would not be
appropriate with regard to Bhutan’s labor force. Instead, a broader definition of economic self-reliance would
be more appropriate. This broader definition would stress that Bhutan wants to rely on itself and its own
effort and abilities with regard to labor and skills. But it would also recognize that the country can benefit
from international interconnectedness and labor mobility.

28 In many countries, the question of whether most immigrants and native workers are complements or substitutes remains
controversial; with presently available data, it cannot be answered 100 percent conclusively for Bhutan. At the same time, as discussed
in Peri (2014), complementarities between immigrants and native groups of workers have been documented for many countries.
Similarly, there are strong indications that most immigrants and native workers in Bhutan complement each other.




                                                                 - 54 -
A broader definition of economic self-reliance could include three elements. First would be the expectation
that the majority of Bhutanese workers will find work in Bhutan and that the majority of jobs in Bhutan will
be filled by Bhutanese workers. For this expectation to be realized the coverage, quality and relevance of
Bhutan’s education and training system will need to be continuously improved. Second would be the
understanding that some Bhutanese citizens may have skills that are less in demand in Bhutan than elsewhere,
and that others could improve their skills through work experience abroad. These groups of citizens will
benefit from government support of work opportunities outside the country in an orderly, secure way (e.g.
through the expansion of initiatives such as the Overseas Employment Program). Third would be an
appreciation that a certain amount of economic immigration can be beneficial for Bhutan. This appreciation
will ideally lead to the development of an orderly and well-regulated process to manage economic
immigration.
Based on international best practices, three broad principles can guide policymakers in Bhutan to develop an
orderly and well-regulated process to manage work-related immigration:
The process should be market-driven: Immigration flows should be aligned with labor market demands as
well as with Bhutan’s overall economic, social and cultural objectives.
It should be comprehensive: A comprehensive immigration system is a system that recognizes the need for
immigrants of different types but also differentiates among these types.
It should be balanced. It should seek to maximize the employment of Bhutanese citizens and minimize any
negative impact of immigration on Bhutanese workers, while also protecting immigrant workers from abuse
and avoiding different employment and social protection rules for Bhutanese and non-Bhutanese workers.

BOX 4.2 ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF BHUTAN’S LABOR INSPECTIONS
Most countries around the world have introduced labor regulations that, for instance, establish minimum
wages, regulate overtime work, mandate leave, stipulate pension plans and prohibit child labor. Such
regulations are meant to protect workers’ rights, improve their living standards and rein in abuses by
employers. In practice, written legislation is not always implemented as intended. Instead, enforcement of
labor regulations is often lax. This means that employers are sometimes able to avoid regulatory compliance
without fear of consequences.
In many low- and middle-income countries, the informal segment of the economy, which is beyond the reach
of the authorities, is used as a way to sidestep labor regulations and avoid the costs associated with
compliance. In this context, enforcement of labor regulations may have the unintended consequence of
increasing the relative cost of operating in the formal economy. Therefore, it may drive firms either to employ
workers in the informal economy or to not hire them in the first place.
Ultimately, whether labor regulations really improve working conditions or lead to the replacement of formal
jobs by informal employment can only be answered empirically. A recent rigorous investigation of the topic
for Bhutan using quasi-experimental methods exploits the introduction of random labor inspections to firms
in the country to examine the impact of enforcing labor regulations on formal and informal employment,
earnings, hours of work and other outcomes. The investigation relies on the fact that most businesses were
initially unaware that labor regulations had been established through the Labor and Employment Act of 2007.

To increase awareness and compliance, the government set up regional labor offices and began sending labor
inspectors on visits throughout the country.
Empirical investigation of the economic effects of these visits finds that labor inspections had the desirable
impact of increasing paid employment and reducing hours worked. However, at the same time inspections
also had adverse impacts on new hires and total employment. Thus, while enforcement certainly helped to
improve working conditions for workers whose employment continued after enforcement was intensified, it
also had negative consequences. In effect, the results suggest that firms found it costlier to hire workers after
labor regulations had been introduced and enforced.

5 SOCIAL PROTECTION FOR WORKERS

5.1 COUNTRY CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
124. This chapter analyses households’ vulnerability to shocks and the adequacy of existing social
protection measures, in terms of both the measures themselves and their actual implementation. The
chapter identifies specific groups of workers that are vulnerable and suggests possible responses the
government could provide. The chapter also explores the relationship between vulnerabilities and individuals’
job preferences and choices. In order to identify patterns particular to a specific group, parts of the analysis
are disaggregated by variables such as gender, location, age and sector of employment.
125. In spite of the rapid decline in Bhutan’s poverty rate in recent years, pockets of poverty remain
(especially in rural areas) as do other specific vulnerabilities. As mentioned in Chapter 1, between 2007
and 2012 Bhutan’s poverty rate decreased from 23 percent to twelve percent, with most of the reduction
coming from rural households. However, as Chapter 1 also noted, Bhutan remains an agrarian economy, and
pockets of poverty persist in rural areas and among households engaged in small-scale and subsistence
agriculture. In addition to poverty, an urban-rural gap exists in food security and access to services.
126. The agrarian nature of Bhutan’s economy determines the nature of the most prevalent shocks
and vulnerabilities. According to the BLFS 2104, around 11 percent of households—and 16 percent of
rural households—were affected by wild animal attacks on crops and settlements in the year preceding the
survey. Other frequent shocks included religious and cultural occasions (6 percent of households experienced
this type of shock in the 12 months preceding the survey), earthquakes (5 percent), rains, floods or
windstorms (5 percent), and pest attacks or crop epidemics (4 percent).

Note: The results on the effects of shock, are time sensitive, and only reflect the shocks that occurred during 2014. Only 5 percent of
households reported having faced small earthquakes during this period, which may be the cause of earthquakes’ supposedly limited
affects.



                                                                                 - 57 -
127. In Bhutan, the effects of a shock on households’ income, assets and food consumption often
depend on the nature of the shock. Different shocks have different effects on household income, assets,
food consumption or other variables. For instance, attacks by wild animals can lead to the death or injury of
farmers or—more commonly—their livestock. They can also result in a loss of crops. For many rural
households, livestock and crops are key assets. Moreover, many rural households engaged in small-scale and
subsistence farming get most of their food from their own livestock and crops. Therefore, attacks by wild
animals can result in large losses in rural households’ assets and subsequently lead to large income losses
reduced food consumption. According to the BLFS 2014, the actual effects of different shocks on
households’ income, assets and food consumption varied. But with the exception of wild animal attacks and
earthquakes—which obviously may destroy physical assets—major shocks most frequently resulted in a
decline in income (Figure 5.1).
128. Poor and rural households more frequently experience shocks and are more prone to suffer
declines in assets, income and food consumption as a result. In order to assess the effect of shocks on
different population groups it is helpful to divide all households in Bhutan into quintiles according to their
household income. About a third, 33.7 percent, of households in the first (poorest) income quintile
experienced a decline in income induced by some type of shock in the year prior to the BLFS 2014. However,
over the same period, only 3.1 percent of households in the fifth (richest) income quintile experienced a
decline in income due to a shock. The same pattern is evident for assets (2.5 percent decline for the top
quintile v. 20.4 percent for the bottom) and food (0.4 percent decline for the top quintile v. 27.1 percent for
the bottom).
129. Households and individuals cope with shocks by drawing on their own savings, seeking help
from the government or working longer hours. Responses to shocks tend to depend on the nature of the
shock, in particular whether a shocks is anticipated, idiosyncratic or systematic. In general, the three most
common coping strategies are to draw on savings, to seek help from the government and to work longer
hours. Some people also seek help from NGOs, increase informal borrowing, reduce food consumption or
take riskier jobs in response to shocks. For shocks that can at least partly be anticipated (like religious or
cultural occasions), households are more prone to rely on their savings. In response to more idiosyncratic
shocks (such as attacks by pests or wide animals) households tend to change their own behaviors: they work
longer hours, reduce food consumption, and rely on informal borrowing. Finally, for systemic shocks like
earthquakes, households tend to have no response. This may be because the entire community is affected or
because of an expectation that the government will make provisions to help households cope with the shock
(Figure 5.2).29
130. While Bhutan has long relied on social programs in health and education, there are few
government social protection programs to support individuals and households vulnerable to shocks.
In Bhutan, large social programs such as free health and education services have existed for over 40 years.
Today, such social programs continue to exist in parallel with social protection programs like social safety
nets and social insurance. The RGoB has several social protection programs implemented by a range of
government agencies, including the GNHC, the MoE, the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the MoLHR as well
as by His Majesty the Fifth King of Bhutan’s Secretariat through the Office of the Gyalpoi Zimpon. Other
social protection agencies include the Electricity Authority (which makes provisions or subsidies), the Loden
Foundation and other NGOs that fund scholarships, and the National Pension and Provident Fund. Social



29One oft-quoted anecdotal example of the supposed (over-)reliance by some households on government support is a large fire in
Bumthang that was followed by very efficient provisioning for affected households by the RGoB. After a second fire in the same area,
the local population then expected the same efficient government response.




                                                               - 58 -
insurance is provided through private institutions. Not counting social programs like free health care and
education, the RGoB spends 0.9 percent of GDP on social protection.
131. Bhutan has a mix of universal and targeted social protection programs. Social protection can be
provided to all (universal) or targeted to specific groups based on their need or vulnerability.30 In Bhutan,
some programs are geographically targeted to households in rural areas, for instance the provision of free
electricity. Other social protection programs and related social programs are universal, such as free health
care. As a result, despite some out-of-pocket expenditure, health-related costs or illnesses are not among the
most frequent or severe shocks that households in Bhutan face.

132. Among all of Bhutan’s social programs, free education and free healthcare reach the most
households, followed by free electricity and subsidized fuel. In Bhutan, universal social programs like
free education and healthcare generally reach more households than the smaller targeted social protection
programs. For example, in the year prior to the BLFS 2014 survey, 94 percent of households benefitted from
free health care, while the kidu (welfare) program provided by the Office of the Gyalpoi Zimpon (described
in more detail below) reached 9 percent of household. Only 1 percent of households benefitted from the
existence of old-age homes (Figure 5.3).
133. Contributory pensions for civil servants, employees of state-owned enterprises and members of
the armed forces cover less than 9 percent of the population. This is in addition to a mandatory
retirement scheme that was introduced in 2002 in order to provide income security during old age. Both
employees and employers make monthly contributions of equal size to two schemes. The schemes provide

30Under a universal approach everybody receives the same government-provided benefits while targeting proposes that the provision
of benefits differs based on an individual or household circumstances. Targeting can be based on individual or household
characteristics (such as demographics or poverty) or on geographic locations. Many countries choose to target social protection
programs to increase program efficiency but actual efficiency gains depend on program characteristics like needs, gains and costs.

retirement through the National Provident Fund Plan, a fully funded defined contribution scheme. The
National Pension Plan is a partially funded pay-as-you-go system with a defined benefit scheme. That is, it is a
social insurance scheme that obtains contributions from workers through their careers and provides benefits
after retirement to its members and their spouses. The civil and armed forces old-age retirement plans are

134. A total of 50,728 civil servants, employees of state-owned enterprises and members of the
armed forces are members of the NPPF. Of these, 4,296 are pension beneficiaries (NPPF 2014). The
NPPF delivers services to employees of 445 government agencies, state-owned enterprises and agencies of
the armed forces. In addition to pension and provident fund services, the organization provides housing,
education and student loan services to its members. Housing is provided to 799 tenants in 92 residential
buildings in four dzongkhags (Thimphu, Chhukha, Samdrup Jongkhar and Samtse). Annual contributions to
NPPF accounts constitute an estimated 5.2 percent of Bhutan’s Gross Domestic Savings (NPPF 2014).
According to the Bhutan Living Standards Survey (BLSS) 2012, pension income represents about 1.3 percent
of overall household income.
135. Civil servants benefit from a pension scheme as well as from housing for low-income civil
servants in Thimpu and Phuentsholing. The pension scheme includes (i) post service retirement benefits
for NPPFP members; (ii) income security in the event of permanent disability; (iii) social support to surviving
family of a deceased member; and (iv) a compulsory savings plan for the salaried employees. This is made
available when they reach 56 years of age. Since 2009, housing has been provided to low income civil
servants in Bhutan’s two biggest cities, Thimphu and Phuentsholing. The National Housing Development
Corporation was established in 2009 with the mandate to provide housing to low-income civil servants.
Currently, 2,000 civil servants benefit from the low-cost housing scheme in Thimphu and Phuentsholing.

untimely death and permanent disability, and also provides security to salaried employees after their
retirement. The Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan has also been entrusted by the RGoB to implement
the Rural House Insurance Scheme to indemnify the rural population against damages to homes caused by
fire, floods or earthquake. Finally, the Royal Insurance Corporation provides both short-term and long-term
loans to accelerate Bhutan’s development. The RGoB owns 33 percent of its shares. Recently, a few other
insurance companies have been established.
137. The prices of both Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) and kerosene are subsidized to households
through a grant from the Government of India. Depending on the location, subsidies lower the retail
price of LPG and kerosene by 55 to 70 percent. The BLSS 2012 indicates that 61 percent of all households in
Bhutan use LPG for cooking. In urban areas, LPG is the most important source of cooking fuel. Again
according to the BLSS 2012, more than 92 percent of urban households rely on LPG for cooking.31 Annually,
the fuel subsidies are estimated to amount to about Nu 500 million ($8,000,000 at current exchange rates;
National Council of Bhutan, 2014).
138. Since 2013, all rural domestic households have received up to 100 units of free electricity per
month. This accords with the government’s pledge to provide free electricity to the rural households for
three years. Prior to the 2013, low voltage rural households paid 85 Nu per 100 units. The subsidy was
initiated to encourage the rural community to use electricity to cut down on their dependency on firewood
and other fuel sources. The subsidy is also expected to prevent rural-urban migration and provide support to
the rural poor.
139. Households in Bhutan have long relied on the Royal prerogative of granting kidu as a last-
resort assistance during times of adversity. Even today social policies and initiatives of the government
are reinforced by His Majesty the Fifth King of Bhutan’s continuing tradition of granting kidu to people in
hardship situations. The granting of kidu is managed through the Office of the Gyalpoi Zimpon (Office for
People’s Welfare and Wellbeing). It covers thousands of vulnerable citizens—the elderly, disabled, destitute,
landless, alcohol- or drug-addicted and sick—as well as children who lack the income to attend school. The
social protection benefits administered by the Office of the Gyalpoi Zimpon include the areas of education,
scholarships, medical support, citizenship, land grants, disaster relief and amnesty. Support can also include
cremation and funeral services for the poor. For the most part, the Office of the Gyalpoi Zimpon relies on a
three-pronged approach, which consists of cash transfers, land grants and scholarships.
140. While none of Bhutan’s social protection programs are explicitly designed to be poverty-
targeted, most of them are progressive. Social assistance programs such as kidu and government support
for agriculture, livestock, farming, and free electricity cover a much higher proportion of households in the
first quintile of the income distribution than in the fifth quintile. For some programs, households in the
second quintile of the income distribution have a higher coverage than those in the first quintile. This is likely



31Also in the context of LPG and kerosene subsidies, the Ministry of Economic Affairs estimates that in 2014 only 40,000 LPG
cylinders were in circulation even through 200,000 had been distributed. These numbers imply that there had either been illegal
exports of subsidized LPG out of Bhutan or that households were hoarding many cylinders inside the country (cf. National Council
of Bhutan, 2014)

due to disparities concerning access and information between the poorest households and those that are
slightly better off (Figure 5.4).32
141. The coverage of employment-related social protection benefits is highest among non-poor
households. The coverage of pensions and a range of other work-related benefits is generally higher for
households with higher income. The wealthiest households also benefit the most from government
scholarships. The reason might be that government scholarships are largely focused on individuals pursuing
higher education. In most countries, the cost of higher education is much higher than that of primary and
secondary education, and many less wealthy households are unable to afford it even if they are supported by
government scholarships. Bhutan seems to follow a similar pattern, as free education is provided by the
RGoB only until grade ten.

142. Households headed by an agricultural worker benefit relatively more from universal social
protection programs, social protection programs targeted at the rural population and the kidu
program. Households headed by a self-employed or family agricultural worker also tend to benefit more
from the kidu program, housing insurance, free electricity, and government support in agriculture than
households headed by nonfarm self-employed or family workers. Households headed by an agricultural
worker tend to benefit less from subsidized fuel and employment-related programs.33
143. Households headed by an armed forces employee are more likely to benefit from some but not
all social protection programs. Whereas coverage of some social protection programs varies little between


32 Universal social programs (i.e., free education and free health care) cover the rich and poor almost evenly across income quintiles.
As LPG, kerosene and other fuels are used more frequently and more intensively by richer households, Bhutan’s fuel subsidy program
is the one social protection program that is highly regressive.
33 The analysis of this and the following paragraphs is based on the occupation of a household’s head as recorded in the BLFS 2014.
46 percent of household heads are active in agriculture, 25 percent are in private businesses or companies, ten percent in the civil
service, six percent in other government agencies, seven percent in the armed forces and five percent in state-owned enterprises. Of
course, while the head of a household may be engaged in a specific sector other members of the same household may work in
different sectors or be inactive.

households headed by employees in different sectors, there are some significant differences. Households
headed by someone in the armed forces have relatively high coverage from some social protection programs
such as benefits from work, stipends for skills training, education loans and fuel subsidies. This finding could
potentially be linked to the provision of social protection programs either within or specifically for the armed
forces—a topic that deserves further exploration (Figure 5.5).
144. Social protection programs related to expanding opportunities—such as work-related benefits,
scholarships and subsidized college education—mostly go to households headed by regular paid
employees. In contrast, households headed by family workers benefit the least from these kinds of benefits.
Less than 1 percent of household headed by a family worker are able to take advantage of employment
facilitation or entrepreneurship programs. A slightly higher proportion of these households (4 percent) are
covered by stipends for skills training. In effect, in addition to having no access to pensions, households
headed by family workers also have access to few programs that could help them develop their human capital.

145. Workers in urban areas are more likely to be covered by work-related fringe benefits. In a
comparison of work-related benefits (injury, maternity leave, casual leave, sick leave, annual leave, overtime,
provident fund and gratuity), it is clear that a larger number of workers in urban than in rural areas receive
these benefits. Across all types of fringe benefits, the share of workers covered in urban areas (between 53
percent and 82 percent) is consistently higher than in rural areas (33 percent to 61 percent). However, as
causality cannot be specifically attributed to location, this finding may ultimately be a result of the workers’
location, sector, industry or type of occupation.
146. Almost without exception, coverage of social protection programs in urban areas skews toward
households headed by a public sector employee. This is true for all social assistance programs as well as
for labor-related programs and work-related fringe benefits (the one exception is housing insurance). Over 95
percent of households headed by public sector workers receive work-related benefits. Across all types of
work-related benefits, households headed by public sector workers have far higher coverage rates than
households headed by private sector workers. The most pronounced differences exist with regard to
overtime, followed by provident fund pensions and gratuity. At 40 percent, the coverage of work-related

injury benefits is low among households headed by someone in the private sector. This particular finding
needs to be further explored, since the Labor and Employment Act mandates work-related injury benefits
across all sectors of employment (Figure 5.6).
147. Within urban households, the coverage rates of education, skills and active labor market
programs also differ between households headed by public sector workers and households headed
by private sector workers. Across a wide range of social protection and labor programs—including work
benefits, free education, government scholarships, stipends for skills training, subsidized college education,
education loans, and employment facilitation programs—the share of urban households led by public sector
workers that receive these benefits is far greater than those led by a private sector employee. Only
entrepreneurship support programs are more widely accessed by households headed by private sector
workers.

5.2 CHALLENGES AND CURRENT GOVERNMENT APPROACH
148. In addition to social programs like free health and education services, the RGoB has in recent
years introduced a range of social protection programs. Today, the RGoB’s portfolio of social protection
programs includes both large universal programs and a few smaller targeted ones. The largest targeted
programs are the civil service pensions and the kidu program administered by the Office of the Gyalpoi
Zimpon. Civil society organizations such as Tarayana also provide social services to the elderly, the disabled,
the destitute, and other poor or vulnerable groups. As mentioned above, 0.9 percent of Bhutan’s GDP is
spent on social protection.
149. Despite the RGoB’s efforts, some groups are largely untouched by certain social protection
provisions. As can be seen in Figure 5.3 and Figure 5.4, the coverage of social protection provisions ranges
from less than 1 percent (entrepreneur support and old age homes) to 58 percent (rural electrification
subsidy), depending on the scheme. More than 85 percent of the country’s labor forces are outside the


                                                                                              - 64 -
existing retirement benefit scheme (NPPF 2015). As previously noted, Bhutan is still an agrarian country:
most of the population resides in rural areas and a majority of workers engage in agriculture, often small-scale
and subsistence agriculture. A majority of Bhutanese are thus frequently affected by climate- and nature-
related shocks.34 However, existing formal social protection support mechanisms offer only limited support
for such shocks. As a result, many shocks trigger high losses in income, assets and food consumption that can
be catastrophic.
150. While social protection coverage cuts across a range of categories, it is neither equitable nor
needs-based. Instead it is most available to a number of already privileged groups. In Bhutan, the type
of a worker’s contract as well as his or her location, gender and level of education determine his or her access
to social protection. Workers who are men, have regular contracts, live in urban areas, and have a high level
of education have better access to social protection than other workers. Coverage of work-related fringe
benefits and social assistance benefits is particularly good for public sector employees and their households.
As already mentioned in Chapter 3, this has to be one of the main factors so many queue for public sector
jobs in Bhutan. And social protection provisions and benefits for public sector workers have expanded in
recent years. For example, in December 2015 the RGoB approved new parental benefits for the civil service
including the extension of maternity and paternity leave, the introduction of breast-feeding breaks for
mothers and the establishments of crèches for young children.
151. In the private sector, the implementation of work-related social protection programs is often
lacking. Since 2007 the MoLHR has introduced a range regulations meant to improve the access of private
sector workers to social protection programs and benefits. Newly-introduced benefits include access to
different types of leave and the requirement for employers to contribute to a provident fund. However, the
implementation of these regulations has been lagging and has not been closely monitored. As a result, many
employers have, for instance, not deducted the contributions for the provident fund from their workers’
salaries or have not matched their employees’ contributions to the fund.
152. Social protection for those in the informal economy (including small-scale and subsistence
agriculture) is inadequate, leaving the workers who are most vulnerable most at risk. Workers in the
informal economy often have less education and lower earnings. In addition, they are also likely to lack
private protection against risks such as ill health, accidents, death and old age. The provision of public social
protection programs for workers in the informal economy thus presents a complex challenge.
153. The RGoB has been drafting a social protection framework for workers, which attempts to
equalize options and opportunities for workers in different segments of the private sector, including
informal work. These efforts are in addition to those aimed at improving social protection for workers in the
formal economy and employees of private companies. Among other things, the draft social protection
framework suggests the introduction of pensions that are easily portable across different types of work and
greater use of existing insurance schemes (like those offered by the Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan)
that are in principle open to all but in practice used mostly by specific groups.
154. Opportunities to develop human capital and connect people to productive employment have
been expanded as part of the RGoB’s efforts to lower unemployment. Social protection programs
closely linked to the labor market—such as training, scholarships and enterprise development grants—mostly
reach beneficiaries who live in urban areas, are well-educated, and from households with at least one public
sector worker. This pattern aligns closely with the group of people who are unemployed in Bhutan, (as
mentioned in Chapter 1, unemployment is for the most part concentrated among urban, well-educated

34The types of shocks faced by households in Bhutan are somewhat different to most other countries in South Asia where health and
economic shocks usually play a greater role than natural calamities.

youth). Although the new opportunities to develop human capital and connect people to productive
employment have reached this group and certain others that struggle to find their place in the labor market,
they do not reach individuals from poorer households or those who engage in relatively unproductive,
unprotected employment in small-scale and subsistence agriculture and other segments of the informal
economy.


5.3 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
155. If Bhutan wants to deliver more equitable social protection to all its workers, it could improve
the balance between the types of support it provides. The World Bank Social Protection Strategy 2012–
2022 (World Bank 2012a) recommends that governments use social insurance to support resilience, and apply
social safety nets to support equity and promote the building of human capital and access to jobs. Bhutan
needs to consider the balance between these different social protection programs. The country has several
social protection programs already in place, but to date the bulk of support seems to have been provided to
those who perhaps need it the least—public sector workers and, to a lesser extent, those in formal private
sector jobs. Recently, government efforts have focused on opportunities related to education and jobs. While
this is commendable, these newest programs seem to have again been accessed largely by households headed
by public sector workers.
156. Improvement and expansion of existing social protection programs could support the
rebalancing of program types. Vulnerabilities in urban and rural areas and among population groups differ.
As such, Bhutan would benefit from targeted social safety net interventions to complement existing universal
social programs. Targeting of existing social protection programs, such as fuel subsidies and higher education
scholarships, could be improved to reach a higher number of poor and vulnerable households. This could be
a first step toward a comprehensive national social assistance system.
157. Ensuring protection of all workers would require a renewed focus on those in the informal
economy, particularly in small-scale and subsistence agriculture. As a large majority of the risks
identified for rural households is climate- or weather-related, the expansion of measures that encourage
savings among agricultural households as well as the introduction and scale-up of agricultural insurance,
including crop insurance and livestock insurance, would be critical. It would be equally critical to ensure that
those who are no longer able to work in agriculture for physical reasons should receive income support
allowing them to live at a minimum standard. Moreover, in response to Bhutan’s priority policy challenges as
an agrarian economy, the RGoB may also need to implement complementary measures to increase farming
productivity (Box. 5.1).
158. Narrowing the gap in social protection coverage between public and private sector workers
would not only result in more equitable provision of services, but would also encourage some youth
to shift to private sector jobs. Coherence between social protection policies, employment policies and labor
market and wage policies is important for equity purposes. Improved coherence in such policies would also
help level the playing field between the public and the private sector. The RGoB has recently approved
additional benefits for women with young children and the expansion of child care benefits for public sector
workers. While this is a decision that gives mothers more flexibility to arrange for their children’s care, it also
further widens the benefits gap between private and public sector workers. As a result, the RGoB might
consider amending the Labor and Employment Act to expand these newly-available benefits to workers in
the private sector. However, implementation and monitoring of existing rules and regulation is already limited
(as mentioned in Chapter 2). Ensuring proper implementation of existing rules would likely deliver an even
greater payoff than additional rules.

159. The overly generous pension scheme is a major factor skewing the compensation balance
towards employment in the public sector. Previous studies have found that the pension wealth that
accumulates over a full career is equivalent to roughly 14 times the workers’ wage. (In South Asia, only Sri
Lanka showed a higher figure). Were this to be taken into account as an annual flow of deferred
compensation it would result in a significant public-private wage differential. Moreover, the defined benefit
scheme will eventually run deficits if not reformed. Parametric reforms to reduce the mismatch between long
run revenues and expenditures would also reduce the gap between public and private sector compensation.
160. Expanding pension coverage is an important long run objective but expanding the public
sector scheme to private sector workers will simply create a larger tax wedge and may promote
informality. One alternative would be to promote voluntary participation in defined contribution scheme
through matching contributions aimed to benefit lower income workers in particular. Matching contributions
(as opposed to tax deductions) have been introduced in a number of countries including China and India and
have the potential for reaching both formal and informal private sector workers with some capacity to save.
161. In light of the fundamental change in the revenue outlook since the inception of the pension
scheme in 2001, the government may want to reconsider the current contribution rate model for both
public and private sector workers. After decades of low coverage, many countries are moving away from
the traditional Bismarckian social insurance model and delinking pensions and health insurance from
employment status. A broad social pension scheme would not only ensure coverage but would also encourage
the demand and supply of labor in the formal private sector relative to an expanded payroll tax-financed
scheme.
162. The introduction of an income support scheme for jobless private sector workers should be
considered. Income support schemes for jobless workers come in many different varieties, including
mandatory severance payments financed by employers laying off a worker, unemployment insurance systems
financed through contributions by workers or firms, or support schemes financed through general
government resources. Unemployment insurance is better suited to protect workers’ income than, for
instance, severance payments, because financial risks are pooled across all participants in the unemployment
insurance scheme instead of only the workers of one firm. However, Bhutan’s labor market has features that
would make the introduction of an unemployment insurance scheme challenging. In particular, the
population of the unemployed is rather small and scattered across the country and informality continues to be
widespread. These factors would increase the administrative costs of an unemployment insurance scheme. In
addition, an insurance scheme financed through contributions by employers or employees could discourage
formalization. Therefore, an income support scheme financed through general government revenues appears
more viable. The design and fiscal sustainability of such as scheme would need to be carefully considered
prior to introduction.35
163. The consolidation of social protection programs and modernization of social protection
systems could improve equity and efficiency. The GNHC has recently introduced the Targeted
Household Poverty Programme (THPP), Bhutan’s first social assistance program specifically targeted at poor
households. The THPP provides a unique opportunity to improve the coverage of social assistance benefits
for the poorest households. Additionally, if implemented in a systematic and scientific way, THPP can
provide the database and consolidated monitoring of beneficiaries and impacts needed to modernize Bhutan’s

35Moreover, establishing a provident scheme for private workers could provide an alternative retirement scheme for those in the
private sector and the extension of maternity and flexible leave policies recently introduced for those in the civil service, to the private
sector could further reduce imbalances for women (alluded to in Chapter 1 and discussed in more detail in NCWC, 2013). As with
income support for jobless workers, the appropriateness of the design and fiscal sustainability issues need to be carefully considered,
prior to introduction of such schemes.




                                                                   - 67 -
entire social protection system. As an example, the GNHC could provide the profiles and information of the
poorest households collected through the THPP to other social protection programs, and the agencies can
coordinate on which benefits or services are provided to specific households on the list.. The introduction of
management information systems that are interoperable between different implementing agencies could also
facilitate the integration and coherence of Bhutan’s social protection programs.
164. Finally, ensuring evidence-based decision making on social protection policies requires an
increased level of monitoring and evaluation of existing social protection programs and their
impacts. At present, program-level monitoring in Bhutan is very limited. There is also no national-level
monitoring of social protection programs. Recommendations already mentioned above such as the
introduction of an integrated management information system could facilitate the monitoring of programs. In
addition, independent impact evaluations of key programs could provide evidence on the effectiveness and
efficiency of various programs and guide the improvement of Bhutan’s social protection policies and
programs.


BOX 5.1 INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY IN THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY
The development of Bhutan’s renewable natural resources industry (which comprises agriculture, livestock
and forestry) has been slow. Key reasons are low levels of technology adoption, the predominance of
subsistence farming, a large number of fallow tracts and lack of market access. Moreover, the relatively small
proportion of land suitable for cultivation and the significant flow of migrants from rural areas to urban
centers have contributed to the industry’s slow development as well as its growing trade deficit.
A range of ongoing challenges remain to be addressed to improve agricultural productivity and the quality of
life in rural areas. First, physical access to rural areas and markets needs to be improved. Second, more access
is needed to quality inputs and seeds, as well as more widespread adoption of good agricultural practices.
Third, greater access to credit, technology and farm mechanization is required, as are sustainable approaches
to managing pests and wildlife. Finally, Bhutan must address the loss of agricultural land for other
developments and the impacts of climate change and natural disasters.
The shortage of farm labor is widely viewed as a constraint on agricultural production. Increased farm
mechanization is needed to offset it. In the agricultural census of 2008, approximately 16 percent of
respondents listed labor shortages as a key constraint on agriculture. In addition, efforts to enhance
agricultural production and marketing have lacked adequate coordination. Marketing has mostly focused on
providing infrastructure (for example, farm roads, irrigation schemes and market sheds). This has resulted in a
lack of sustainability and limited income increases for farmers.
In light of these constraints, the RGoB has accorded high priority to the development of agriculture in the
Eleventh Five-Year Plan. Moreover, agriculture is one of Bhutan’s “Five Jewels” frequently cited by
government officials. A number of concrete projects have also been undertaken or are being prepared to
improve the productivity of Bhutan’s agricultural industry. For instance, the Food Security and Agriculture
Productivity Project implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests and supported by the World
Bank aims to increase agricultural productivity and enhance market linkages in selected rural dzongkhags in
southwest Bhutan. These objectives are to be achieved in three ways: (i) the strengthening of farmers groups
(ii), crop diversification and the provision of irrigation, climate-smart technologies and farming practices,
improved agricultural inputs, and mechanization in a packaged approach, (iii) the adoption of value chain
approaches, and (iv) support for production, accessibility, and demand for nutrient-rich foods.

6 CONCLUSION
165. Bhutan’s hydropower generation potential raises the prospect of tremendous development
opportunities in the future but this opportunity will need to be managed with an eye to its impact on
labor and jobs. Over the coming years, the development of Bhutan’s hydropower generation capacity will
have a direct impact on several key macroeconomic indicators. It is expected to lead to an increase in export
revenues, sustained economic growth and continued rapid poverty reduction. It is also expected to provide a
window of opportunity for realizing the MoLHR’s vision of “a Nation where all its citizen have the
opportunity for a gainful and quality employment characterized by harmonious and productive relationship in
the workplace and the broader community.” At the same time, hydropower development can also be
expected to create or exacerbate a number of significant challenges, including labor market challenges.
166. Against this backdrop, this report analyzed select key issues for Bhutan’s labor market that
deserve particular attention now and in the coming years. In particular, the report focused on four
issues: imbalances between the public and private sectors, barriers to private sector employment, labor market
policies and social protection for workers. Throughout, the analysis was guided by an investigation of
Bhutan’s current situation and future prospects, the state of key labor market indicators and an assessment of
priority policy challenges according to the systematic classification of countries by the World Development Report
2013. This chapter reiterates some main policy options for realizing gainful quality employment for all.
167. The report highlighted the desire of many workers in Bhutan to obtain public sector jobs;
queuing for such jobs is widespread and a major reason for the relatively high unemployment rate
among young, well-educated, and well-off city dwellers. If Bhutan wants to avoid the plight of other
resource-rich countries that rely on the public sector to provide jobs for their citizens, a comprehensive
approach to sectoral rebalancing is needed—not to weaken the public sector but to allow private sector jobs
to emerge and prosper. This rebalancing could include a commitment that growth in the public sector
workforce will be subdued for the foreseeable future. Further, in order to gradually align public and private
sector compensation packages, adjustments to public sector wages would need to be modest, in line with or
below private sector wage growth. In the medium term, fringe benefits offered to private sector workers
would need to be brought more in line with those of the public sector.
168. Bhutan’s private nonfarm economy remains underdeveloped; in recent years, sales and
employment in existing private sectors firms have grown at a slower pace than previously. To address
the lack of interest in private sector jobs, an information, education and communication campaign to increase
the prestige and desirability of private sector jobs could be undertaken. More fundamentally, Bhutan could
expand access to education, improve educational quality, focus education and training interventions on the
development of a core set of technical as well as soft skills demanded by the country’s private sector and
ensure that training content is in line with labor demand. More generally, reinforced efforts to foster broad-
based private sector development and productivity could increase the attractiveness of the private sector as an
employer of highly educated workers and strengthen its capacity to absorb job seekers.
169. While labor regulations in Bhutan are generally rather flexible, the country’s rules and
regulations governing the employment of non-Bhutanese workers are stringent, and the
government’s capacity to oversee labor regulations and occupational safety and health standards is
limited. Bhutan could consider revising, clarifying and simplifying the regulations on foreign labor, drawing
on international good practices for managing labor migration (models might be South Korea or Malaysia).
Moreover, measures could be taken to enhance government capacity to oversee labor regulations and
occupational safety and health standards and to strengthen the capabilities of regional employment and labor
offices. Finally, as far as active labor market programs are concerned, Bhutan could improve monitoring and

evaluation arrangements and complement existing training and entrepreneurship support programs by more
systematic and tailored employment services geared toward both employers and job seekers.
170. The RGoB has in recent years introduced a range of social protection programs; despite these
efforts, many informally employed workers (particularly in agriculture) are not covered by social
protection programs. Ensuring the protection of all workers would require a renewed focus on the poorest
households (who often work in the informal economy, in particular in small-scale and subsistence
agriculture). A first step to more effective and cost-effective social assistance could be an expansion of the
THPP implemented by the GNHC and a link between its data base and that of other social protection
programs to assure complementarity in coverage. In addition, narrowing the gap between compensation
packages for public and private sector workers would require the gradual alignment of social insurance
coverage between workers in both sectors and the introduction of carefully considered income support
schemes for private sector workers. Finally, expansion of the evidence base around impacts of existing social
protection programs through increased monitoring, evaluation and impact assessments could guide the
improvement and consolidation of social protection programs for workers.
171. While this report provides recent, robust evidence on a range of topics, deeper analysis of
select issues might be called for, including the management of labor migration, the reform of social
insurance and income support schemes, and barriers to private sector employment. A deeper analysis
of the management of labor migration could uncover more precisely how between Bhutanese and non-
Bhutanese workers complement each other, and guide policymakers in Bhutan to develop an orderly, well-
regulated process to manage economic immigration. Expanded pension coverage for all workers as well as an
income support scheme for jobless workers—both financed through general government revenues—would
help mitigate imbalances between the public and the private sector but the design and fiscal sustainability of
such schemes would need to be carefully considered prior to their introduction. With regard to mitigating
barriers to private sector employment, further analyses could use the BES 2015 to look at the issue in more
detail and aim to offer practical solutions.

APPENDIX

BHUTAN LABOUR FORCE SURVEY 2014 AND BHUTAN ENTERPRISE SURVEY 2015
The Bhutan Labour Force Survey (BLFS) is a household survey that is conducted annually by the
Department of Employment of Bhutan’s Ministry of Labour and Human Resources (MoLHR). It covers a
nationally representative sample of around 6,000 households in all 20 dzongkhags (districts) of Bhutan. As
Bhutan’s urban residents are more heterogeneous than its rural population and economic activities in urban
centers are more diverse, urban households are oversampled. In 2014, the BLFS covered 1,479 rural and
4,440 urban households for a total sample of 5,919 households. On average, sampled households contained
about four household members resulting in a total sample size of 23,587 individuals. The 2014 edition of the
BLFS is described in detail in MoLHR (2015).
In each household covered in the BLFS, all questions are answered by one respondent, often the household
head. Respondents are questioned about variables concerning the household as a whole and about socio-
demographic and work-related characteristics of all household members. Together with items on labor force
participation, the core of the BLFS questionnaire encompasses questions related to the household members’
current work status and employment history. An additional module covers housing and asset ownership, risks
and coping mechanisms, and coverage of social protection programs on the household level. Among other
variables, the BLFS contains information on household members’ monthly earnings and weekly hours. Both
variables are available for dependent as well as self-employed workers. This makes it possible to construct a
measure for hourly wages.
The survey also ascertains whether a worker is employed in the civil service, other government agencies, the
armed forces or state-owned enterprises (which following ILO, 1999, together constitute the public sector), in
agriculture or private enterprises (i.e., the private sector) or by a non-governmental organization, international
non-governmental organization or community service organization. Additionally, the 2014 edition of the
BLFS questions respondents about a wide range of household members’ individual characteristics. These
include information on labor market characteristics such as whether an individual is a regular paid employee,
casually paid employee, contract worker, self-employed worker or unpaid family worker. 36 Comprehensive
information on the industry of employment is also available in the BLFS. Information on socio-demographic
characteristics, such as individuals’ age and education are included in the BLFS as well. Information on an
individual’s location (dzongkhag and urban or rural area) and his or her gender and nationality (Bhutanese or
not) can also be used. Lastly, the questionnaire contains a series of questions on households’ wealth and exact
demographic composition.
Field work for the BLFS 2014 was done in December 2014 and January 2015. For the first time for a large-
scale household survey in Bhutan, tablet-based computer-assisted personal interviews were conducted. The
objective was to improve data quality and streamline data analysis. As another measure to assure high data
quality, all respondents were asked for their cellphone numbers and during a meticulous data cleaning
exercise these numbers were used to reach out to respondents in case any inconsistencies or missing values
had been discovered in the raw BLFS data.

36The BLFS 2014 uses the following definitions for regular wage workers, casual wage workers, contract workers and self-employed
workers: A regular wage worker is an “individual performing any kind of work for wage or salary, in cash or in kind”, a causal wage
worker an “individual working as and when they find a job for which they get paid, in cash or in kind”, a contract worker an
“individual who has a temporary contract to do a particular piece of work but is not an employee of the company he/she is working
for” and a self-employed worker an “individual operating his own enterprise neither employing anybody to operate his/her enterprise
nor being employed by anybody.”

An Enterprise Survey is a firm-level survey of a representative sample of an economy’s private sector.
Enterprise Surveys are routinely conducted by the World Bank in a wide range of countries. They are usually
answered by business owners or relevant top executives and cover a broad range of business environment
topics including access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, crime, competition, and performance measures.
Formal (i.e., formally registered) companies are targeted for interviews and broken down into four categories
according to their size: (i) micro (less than five employees); (ii) small (five to 19 employees); (iii) medium-sized
(20 to 99 employees); and (iv) large (more than 100 employees) companies. The manufacturing and service
industries constitute the core of the survey.37 Occasionally, for a few surveyed countries, other industries are
included or certain industries are oversampled to provide better suited data for a particular country context or
to reflect country-specific questions.
The Bhutan Enterprise Survey (BES) 2015 is used as the basis for many analyses of this report, in particular
those of Chapter 3. For the BES 2015, firms in the food and beverages industry and in the tourism industry
were oversampled. This resulted in the breakdown of all numbers for firms in the following four industries:
(i) food and beverages; (ii) other manufacturing; (iii) tourism; and (iv) other services. Besides, almost 100
percent of firms in the nonfarm economy in Bhutan are registered at start-up which makes it possible for the
BES 2015 to contain data on microenterprises. The BES 2015 directly covers data collected through
interviews with representatives from 367 firms. 114 of these firms are microenterprises, 146 small firms, 84
medium-sized firms and 23 large firms. In addition to the interviews with business owners or relevant top
executives, interviews were also conducted with 659 employees of firms covered by the BES 2015.
Importantly, weights can be applied to all data collected through the BES that reflect the situation in the
whole economy. This means the BES 2015 is representative for the entire nonfarm private sector in Bhutan.
The previous round of the BES happened in 2009.
