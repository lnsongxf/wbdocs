The study has analysed current Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) technology for its potential to
monetise small volumes of this gas (1-15MMscf/d) and avoid or reduce the gas flaring.

Introduction
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is natural gas transported and stored in compressed form
(pressurised to between 100 and 250 barg) in order to reduce the volume to be transported or
stored by between 150 to 300 times that of gas at atmospheric pressure.

Historically, CNG has been used onshore for gas supply over short distances and in relatively small
volumes. While the cost of delivered CNG depends on project specific conditions such as gas volume,
in general CNG can be economically viable for volumes up to around 5 MMscf/d and distances up to
800 km.

Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is mainly used as an alternative fuel for vehicles. Natural gas vehicles
are very popular worldwide, particularly in countries such Pakistan, Argentina, India and China. Use
of CNG as fuel for road vehicles has been driven by two main factors: rising gasoline prices and
increased environmental concerns.

Use of CNG at a larger scale is not yet commercially viable but is being investigated by several
companies as a potential economically viable alternative to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG).

The CNG Chain
The CNG chain is composed of four elements: Production, Transportation, Receiving and Storage.

Production
CNG production consists of gas pre-treatment and compression. The pre-treatment process is
simpler than in an LNG liquefaction plant and is generally set by the requirements of the end users.
The main pre-treatment activities are:

       Removal of heavy hydrocarbons to avoid condensation when storing as CNG,
       removal of contaminates: hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide, etc., and
       dehydration.

The amount of compression required depends on the delivery pressure of the source gas reservoir
and gas quality.

Transportation
CNG may be transported on-shore or off-shore (marine). There are a number of different options
available for each alternative.

Marine CNG Transportation
Transportation cost is the most important factor in the CNG chain. The cost of CNG marine transport
is directly proportional to the volume of gas and distance between the gas source and the
consumers.

Since the early 1960’s the marine transport of CNG has been investigated and analysed by various
developers. The current marine CNG developers and their transportation concepts are as follows:

On-shore CNG Transportation
On-shore CNG transportation is a proven technology that has been used for decades. The on-shore
CNG transportation system consists of:
   gas compression and truck loading at the gas source location;
   truck offloading, heating, let-down and metering at the customer site.

Analysis of the cost of delivered CNG for a number of volumes and distances (see below) shows that,
for production capacities higher than 5 MMscf/d, delivery of CNG by truck becomes difficult not only
due to the substantial number of vehicles required (especially for longer distances), but also the
significant extent of loading and offloading facilities required.
The CNG storage type used for transportation is the main difference between the various suppliers.
The main characteristics are as follows:

Examples of CNG chain costs
The sizing and cost of the different elements of the chain depend on the specific characteristics of
each project such as: gas volume and composition, distance to consumers, storage and
infrastructure requirements, geographical location etc.

The unit cost (capital and operating) for four scenarios have been evaluated: Gas volumes of 3 and
10 MMscf/d, and short and long distances to customers. It must be noted that these cost estimates
are only indicative as specific circumstances (e.g. a challenging physical environment, high labour
costs in an overheated business environment such as the Bakken in N. Dakota), can affect the costs
and hence economics significantly.

CNG market overview
Onshore
There are currently almost 20 million road vehicles in the world in a wide range of countries using
CNG as fuel. The ten countries with the largest CNG vehicle fleets (in millions) are:

The fast growth of CNG as fuel for vehicles has been to a large extent driven by government
subsidies and initiatives to promote conversion to CNG for environmental and economic reasons.

                                                                                         v
Other uses of CNG, such as for power generation; industrial consumers etc., are currently less
developed mainly because the gas volumes required are often too high for truck distribution.

Offshore
The lack of proven commercial options for marine transportation of CNG is the main obstacle to
faster business development in these areas.

Indonesia may become the first-mover in marine transportation of CNG. A 2,200m³ CNG carrier is
currently being built to supply gas to a CNG storage facility in Lombok. The project is planned to start
commercial operations in 2016.

Conclusions
CNG on-shore transportation is well established in a number of countries since the 1990s. Marine
CNG transportation, however, is still under development and with no units yet in commercial
operation.

While the cost of delivered CNG depends on project specific conditions such as gas volume and
composition, in general:
     On-shore delivered CNG can be economically viable for volumes up to around 5 MMscf/d
        and distances up to around 500 miles (800 km).
     Marine CNG is not yet commercially proven but could be economically viable for large
        volumes and distances up to around 2000 nautical miles.
