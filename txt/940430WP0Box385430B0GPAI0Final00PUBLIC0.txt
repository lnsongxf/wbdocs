Abstract: This report reviews some of the accomplishments of the Global Program for Avian
Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI). This multisectoral
program comprised 72 projects in 60 developing countries in all regions and received $1.3 billion
in financing from the World Bank. This support for GPAI projects was one of the World Bank’s
contributions to a coordinated global response to the threats of avian and pandemic influenzas,
which benefited from financing of $4 billion from 35 donors in 2006-2013. Thanks to this support,
developing countries strengthened their capacity for early and effective disease control, bringing
substantial public health and economic benefits to the countries and to the world. According to
Harvard University professor and former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, "[veterinary
and human public health systems are] probably the single most important area for productive
investment on behalf of mankind." Indeed, circulation of the highly pathogenic avian flu virus was
reduced, helping to lessen the likelihood of onset of a pandemic. Moreover, the projects improved
public health systems for reducing locally-relevant health threats. The report presents a brief
background on the global program and cross-country accomplishments and then highlights
accomplishments for each project, by region.

BACKGROUND

 Starting in 2005, the world has seen an increasing threat from avian and human influenzas and other
pandemic diseases. In response, the international community mounted an unprecedented effort that
coordinated animal health and human health interventions. The World Bank worked with the international
technical agencies (World Health Organization – WHO, World Organization for Animal Health – OIE, and
the Food and Agriculture Organization – FAO) and other experts to prepare a Global Program for Avian
Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI). The GPAI was based on
a template of actions and investment choices to promote pandemic preparedness, prevent contagion
through control of avian flu at its animal source, and build response capacity so that contagion would be
stopped quickly and effectively, and therefore at a low cost.

Building capacity so that governments can perform core public health functions of detecting disease
outbreaks early, diagnosing them correctly, and controlling disease spread quickly and effectively are the
highest-return investment opportunities available to countries (Table 1). The expected annual rates of
return shown in Table 1 take into account only the benefits from preventing pandemics. But robust public
health systems also give rise to substantial national co-benefits from reducing the disease burden of locally
significant diseases that do not Table 1. Expected Economic Benefits from Investment

epidemics or pandemics.

Because of its focus on prevention and preparedness for control of contagion at its animal source, the
avian and pandemic influenza response was highly cost-effective and evidence-based, informed by
experience with confronting other health threats that knew no borders, including the severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and HIV/AIDS. Since all influenzas, as well as many other
diseases, originate in animals and infect livestock before adapting to spread among humans, the GPAI
was multisectoral, with coordination globally, within regions, and in countries. The GPAI built capacity that
is relevant to all such zoonotic (animal-origin) diseases and conditions like antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

SELECT GLOBAL ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES’ RESPONSES

The GPAI was global in scope because with greatly increased international trade and travel, a novel
pathogen capable of sparking a pandemic can spread from a remote village in a developing country to
megacities on all continents in 36 hours. The World Bank worked with the UN and other organizations to
monitor the global program, which mobilized $4 billion from 35 donors. These funds assisted developing

countries in tackling the threat. The four main principles that countries and international organizations
agreed would guide the global program are summarized in Box 1.
 Box 1. Main Features of the Global Response to Avian and Human Influenzas (AHI)
   “The emerging international consensus is that the coordinated global response to AHI should be based on a
   common vision for addressing three areas of activity:
         i.   prevent a human influenza pandemic by controlling the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus in fowl and
              preparing for the next pandemic with vastly improved surveillance;
        ii.   contain a human influenza pandemic by rapid detection and care of human cases and preventing
              human to- human transmission of the pathogen;
       iii.  respond in the event of a pandemic to keep vital services and societies going and mitigate the impact
             of the pandemic on human health, society, economic systems, and systems for governance.
   It is widely agreed that a coordinated strategy should recognize the following key issues:
         A multisectoral approach is needed. An integrated response that effectively balances both animal and
          human health interventions must involve actors from a range of disciplines, including human health,
          agriculture, economics, finance, and planning.
         Individual countries are central to a coordinated response. While the threat of AHI is global, the
          coordinated response must be initiated and led at the country level —that is, it must be based on country
          strategies developed and owned by the governments facing the threat of AHI. Country commitment to
          an integrated program is critical, as is coordinated donor support for such programs. Whereas the
          international community can provide critical advice and support, it is the countries that will implement
          the response.
         A balance must be struck between short- and long-term actions. Immediate action is needed to
          prevent the further spread of AHI, both in infected and newly infected countries. In the longer term, the
          strategy will need to address such issues as restructuring the poultry industry, developing the capacity
          of veterinarian services, preparing the health sector (including through health sector reform) to deal
          effectively with future pandemics, enhancing public health surveillance capacity, and addressing the
          global market failure in influenza vaccine and production.
         Evaluation of key interventions and actions will be critical. Comprehensive evaluation systems that are
          capable of providing timely guidance on what actions are and are not effective should be an integral
          feature of program design.”

 Beijing Ministerial Conference.

The World Bank’s support was important at the country level, with financing of $1.3 billion and
implementation assistance to 72 GPAI projects in 60 developing countries. The International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA) together
provided $1.2 billion as loans and limited grants, accounting for most of the financing from the World Bank.
The remainder was from trust funds administered by the World Bank, notably the multidonor Avian and
Human Influenza Facility (AHIF), which received $127 million from ten donors, led by the European
Commission. Countries obtained technical assistance and other support from other agencies as well (for
example, USAID, European Commission, CDC, OIE, FAO, WHO, UNICEF, and the Australian, Canadian
and UK bilateral aid agencies) to help implement the GPAI projects.

The international community also sought to improve coordination across partner agencies, across sectors,
and to sustain implementation momentum in countries. This was pursued in several ways. A series of
ministerial and other high-level international conferences brought together ministers of health and
agriculture and international partners (Table 2). The United States and the European Union led this
important political process while the United Nations and the World Bank provided monitoring, reporting,
and assessments of gaps in the response. These conferences were important opportunities for high-level
policymakers and other practitioners from developing countries to exchange views on the global response
to the avian and pandemic influenza threats. In particular, the Government of Vietnam organized an
impactful week-long learning event, including field visits, before the ministerial conference in 2010.

The World Bank and other development institutions did not sustain these efforts, however. The most
significant finding in the report by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG, 2014) “Responding to Global

was that: “after 2010, the World Bank has not sustained the zoonotic disease risk management and
pandemic preparedness agendas and failed to mainstream them into Bank strategy and operations. ”

Advocacy for prevention and communications to the public and policy-makers were key to a successful
reduction of pandemic risk from the start of the response in 2005 and were was re-affirmed as such by the
ministerial conference in 2010. These activities by leading officials and institutions are indispensable
because it is known that unfortunately substantial risks tend to be underestimated -- or even ignored.
Media coverage follows an outbreak narrative, reporting new developments but neglecting underlying
potential problems. Yet, risk awareness is the necessary first step toward better risk management. When
responsibility for coordination of the avian and pandemic influenza program transferred from a central
department of the World Bank to the Health, Nutrition and Population sector department in 2010, the World
Bank sharply reduced its advocacy for prevention and preparedness, which in turn lowered the momentum
of implementation of the still-ongoing GPAI projects (and other public health investments) in developing
countries. Investments in veterinary and human public health systems thus had lower priority and chance
of success, increasing again the probability and expected costs of a pandemic.

The lack of visibility and recognition of avian flu control efforts by developing countries were all the more
regrettable because poor people in poor countries ended up contributing a substantial part of the costs of
avian flu and efforts to control the disease. Though the GPAI was launched in the context of a global and
country engagement that was to extend to 2020 (and the 2010 ministerial conference urged such
continued efforts), the program itself shrunk almost as rapidly and dramatically as the communications
and advocacy for prevention. By 2014, when the president of a leading international development center
discussed opportunities for ways that the World Bank could contribute to faster global poverty reduction,
she highlighted that “the Bank’s program of surveillance and response to the Avian flu crisis a decade ago
has disappeared; an independent evaluation of the program concluded that the global public good nature
of the program meant it was difficult for the bank to sustain once the sense of crisis passed.”1 This
disappearance results in amnesia about the risks, which leads to yet lower preventive efforts and then to
excessively high costs of tackling the next emergency.

Pandemic risk is high because of extremely low capacity of public veterinary services, combined with a
low capacity of human public health systems in most developing countries. The One Health approaches
that are required to reduce pandemic risk were broadly approved by developing country participants in the
AHI response, but in practice external assistance programs did not include funding for this agenda once
the AHI response ended.

In 2006-2009, the World Bank used the Global Development Learning Network and other
videoconferencing facilities to produce a series of 24 seminars and mini courses on pandemic
preparedness and avian flu control. Participants included leading practitioners, from some 20 developing
countries and from organizations and partners such as the UN, WHO, US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the European Commission (EC), UN Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), US Department of Health and Human Services (USHHS), and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This interactive information exchange was strongly
supported by the UN System Influenza Coordinator (UNSIC) as central to the ability of developing
countries and the international community to prepare and coordinate adequate responses to the multiple
threats arising from outbreaks of avian influenza and a potential human flu pandemic. They shared their
experiences and advice. Nine of the sessions were subsequently edited to serve as reference knowledge
products (Table 3). The World Bank also produced influential economic and policy analyses, notably on
economic costs of a pandemic and on compensation for culled poultry.

The GPAI was the single largest multisectoral public health program in the World Bank’s history. Projects
delivered financing and technical assistance to countries. Country-led responses were the necessary
component, and thus the main priority, of the overall international response. The GPAI projects were
prepared on an emergency basis, and most were implemented rapidly. The projects engaged multiple
sectors and aimed to increase systematic coordination among departments and professionals responsible

for human health, animal health, disaster risk management, and communications. Several features of the
GPAI served as models for the World Bank’s programs to respond to the food crisis and other crises.

METHODOLOGY

The Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) team carried out a desk review of the accomplishments of
GPAI projects. The objective was to collect, in one place, information on the capacity that was developed
and the activities undertaken, since this would help the Bank be better prepared to respond in the next
crisis.    The     team     examined    project
documents,        including     Implementation
Completion and Results Reports (ICRs),                    Figure 1. All Regions had GPAI projects

late 2013 for several then-ongoing projects.         0
There are data from projects in 60 countries               AFR     EAP      ECA     LCR      MNA   SAR
(three regional projects are also included) in
all six regions (Figure 1).

The accomplishments that were identified in project documents were categorized by the team into the
following seven groups, based on the GPAI framework:

    1.   Animal health (prevention, preparedness, surveillance, diagnostic capacity);
    2.   Animal health (disease control, compensation, biosecurity);
    3.   Human health (including pandemic preparedness in health sector);
    4.   Public awareness and communication;
    5.   Coordination between animal and human public health systems;
    6.   Pandemic preparedness (multisectoral plans and simulations); and
    7.   Implementation support and M&E.

FINDINGS

Individual projects vary in the extent to which they include the above seven activity groups. The vast
majority of projects (94 percent) developed or improved a national plan for pandemic response. The vast
majority of projects (94 percent) increased coordination between human and animal public health systems.
Most projects carried out training (67 percent), were able to strengthen laboratory capacity (67 percent)
and conducted public awareness campaigns (63 percent). In total, the GPAI projects trained more than
500,000 people and strengthened capacity for over 800 laboratories. As a group, projects in the Africa
Region (AFR) are outliers, as fewer than 25 percent of projects had accomplishments in these activity
groups. Most of the AFR projects were relatively small and focused on coordination, technical assistance,
and developing Integrated National Action Plans. Overall, too few of the Action Plans received support for
implementation, so capacity to promptly and effectively respond to diseases outbreaks remained weak. 2

  Under the GPAI, action plans were prepared also for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in 2007, identifying the most
urgent priorities for investments in capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks (including avian
influenza, Ebola, and other contagions). The modest financing requirements, totaling $26 million for the three countries
combined, were not met, however. Without investments, the disease-control capacities remained grossly inadequate.
The short-sighted decision by governments and donors not to invest in strengthening core public health capacities
then proved enormously costly during the 2014-15 Ebola epidemic. While the expected rates of return on spending

Other outcomes were achieved by fewer projects. It was less common that projects carried out Knowledge,
Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) surveys (38 percent) or improved Information Technology (IT) use (38
percent). Projects in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region had a relatively high frequency of KAP
surveys and IT use (43 percent and 71 percent, respectively), while the lowest frequencies were in Africa
and East Asia Pacific (EAP) Regions.

ONE HEALTH APPROACHES

Since nearly all GPAI projects included actions to improve veterinary and human public health systems,
the GPAI was the World Bank’s first large-scale engagement in supporting One Health approaches. These
approaches are indispensable to reduce rising health risks at the animal-human-environment interface.
Country clients and partners saw the critical role of the GPAI in systematically bringing sectors together
across bureaucratic and professional barriers, especially in the planning and evaluation phases (joint
budgets and joint implementation included joint rapid response teams to investigate and control disease
outbreaks, but were otherwise less frequent and more difficult to negotiate). In 2010 the Government of
Vietnam organized a week-long learning event on One Health approaches for teams from 50 countries
and agencies engaged in the AHI response. Results were then discussed at the Hanoi Ministerial
conference and reflected in the fourth UNSIC-World Bank global progress report. The World Bank has
been using the operational definition in Box 2.

                                  Box 2. Operational Definition of One Health

         One Health means “the collaborative efforts of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally and
         globally to attain optimal health for people, animals and our environment”
                                                             (American Veterinary Medical Association, 2008)
         One Health is a framework for enhanced collaboration in areas of common interests (intersections),
         with initial concentration on zoonotic diseases, that will reduce risk, improve public health globally
         and support poverty alleviation and economic growth in developing countries. This concept involves
         a better way to deal with risks at the animal-human-environment interfaces.

AFRICA REGION CASE STUDIES

Below are selected case studies of GPAI interventions in the AFR Region. These case studies are
intended to complement the country overviews and provide greater depth and detail regarding the
operations of the GPAI.


ALive: Integrated National Action Programs in Africa

Background. ALive is a partnership for livestock development, poverty alleviation and sustainable growth
in Africa. ALive’s Integrated National Action Program (INAP) on Avian and Pandemic Influenza in Africa
was a rallying point and mechanism of regional cooperation among technical agencies (WHO, OIE, FAO
and the African Union-Inter African Bureau of Animal Resources (AU-IBAR)) and donor institutions
(European Commission-EC, the French government, and the World Bank). These and other partners
were committed to the prevention and control of avian influenza in the Sub-Saharan Africa (AFR) region.

Funded by the European Commission and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and hosted by the World
Bank, the ALive’s INAP program provided technical assistance to SSA Governments towards the Rapid
Assessment (RA) of AHI prevention and control capacities and developing recommendations on improving
such capacities contained in a draft INAP. Following Government endorsement, ownership and
implementation of the INAP rests solely in the Government. ALive also provided assistance to the
Government in accessing international funding (World Bank, others) for financing INAP implementation.

How the collaboration worked. ALive established direct dialogue with individual SSA Governments
regarding their collective responsibility for a regional and global public good by developing and
implementing an INAP program. Once a Government submitted a request to ALive for technical
assistance, ALive coordinated with its technical partners on launching a multisectoral RA mission and
developing the country’s draft INAP. The development of each country INAP involve d assembling the
different components based on the experts’ reports and recommendations, validation and peer review by
institutional experts, final review and clearance by all institutions and ALive, and endorsement by the
Government. ALive experts and technical consultants from each partner technical institution worked hand-
in-hand towards providing each Government a results-oriented and viable INAP. This coordinated
approach for the avian and human influenza program in SSA is an example of best practice in international
collaboration among donors, technical institutions and the Government.

Accomplishments. As of September 2008, rapid assessment missions were completed in 15 countries
and ongoing or planned in further 3 countries. Draft INAPs were sent to the Governments of 7 countries
for their endorsement, and further 4 draft INAPs awaited validation and/or clearance from the technical
partner agencies. ALive assisted Governments in organizing stakeholders’/donors’ workshops aimed at
obtaining international financial support for implementation of their INAPs. All partner Governments as well
as donors supported the integrated and harmonized approach in developing the INAPs and fully welcomed
the workshop as a means of leveraging international financial assistance.

Communication Strategies in Nigeria

Following the first confirmed case of the avian influenza outbreak in Nigeria in January 2006, intense
advocacy by UN agencies and bilateral donors resulted in an early response by the government. As a first
step, a multisectoral National Steering Committee was established to provide policy direction to control
the spread of AI.

The Nigerian government developed an Avian Influenza Control Program (AICP) with support from the UN
and the World Bank. Under the AICP, the National Public Enlightenment Committee was tasked with the
planning, coordination, implementation and monitoring of AI outbreak communication and behavior
change communication/social mobilization activities.

A communication strategy and structure similar to the National Public Enlightenment Committee was
established in all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The objective was to ensure that there is
sufficient technical capacity at the national and sub-national levels:
 To implement mass awareness campaigns;
 To design and roll out inter-personal communication packages for health workers;
 To establish a community surveillance system; and
 To carry out training of trainers at the Local Government and community levels in promoting AI
     preventive behaviors.

Participatory Action Research supported by the UNICEF West and Central Africa Regional Office and
implemented by the Academy for Educational Development in late 2006 confirmed the efficiency of the
Nigerian avian influenza communication strategy in reaching over 60 percent of the population with
appropriate behavioral actions to protect humans from AI. The challenge of doing so within a very short
period in a country of 140 million people was met.

While awareness of AI is high, people’s perception of the risk of getting infected with AI was low. To
address this issue, emphasis has been placed on community level partnerships with key influential groups
such as traditional rulers, religious groups, community development associations, educational institutions,
and women’s groups. These leaders and opinion makers are being encouraged through training and
continued engagement to use their networks to re-enforce preventive behaviors promoted through the
mass media. A draft risk communication strategy has also been developed and is being finalized to
complement the communication strategy developed in 2006.

Avian influenza outbreaks in Nigeria have been largely confined to birds, but there was one human fatality
in January 2007. On-going communication and social mobilization activities reaching various stakeholders
and community and household members are being strengthened to limit the further spread of AI among
humans.

Nigeria’s challenges in fighting avian influenza in poultry include; weak bio -security measures across the
poultry sector, widespread backyard poultry rearing practice, continued operation of live-bird markets that
do not promote bio-security measures, and cultural practices which result in use of live birds for rituals and
co-habitation of birds and humans. Consequently the achievement of behavior change remains of great
importance.

A Multisectoral Response Enabled Wider Benefits and Greater Preparedness in Nigeria

Problem and Context. The response to Avian and Human Influenza (AHI) has provided an opportunity
for Nigeria’s veterinarians and their medical counterparts to work together and address the prevention and
control of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases. The political leadership at the different tiers of
government also came to to view prevention and control of AHI as an issue of good governance. Moreover,
the country saw an opportunity to improve its ailing medical and veterinary infrastructures.

Since the first confirmed HPAI outbreak in February 2006 in Kaduna State, the disease has been
confirmed in 25 states and the Federal Capital Territory, involving 97 local government areas. The disease
has predominantly been experienced in medium and large-scale commercial farms. Outbreaks in backyard
farms involving free-range poultry occurred in only 5 states of the Federation. The outbreaks have had
severe consequences on the economy and on livelihoods of both small and large-scale producers in the
country and the entire West African Sub-region.

Approach and Activities. The government, in collaboration with development partners, adopted a
multisectoral, multi-disciplinary approach because of the complex and zoonotic nature of the disease.
Activities carried out included:
 Strengthening HPAI control and containment plans through effective depopulation and
    decontamination.
 Strengthening disease surveillance and diagnostic capacity through strengthening Pan-African
    Controls of Epizootics (PACE), National Animal Disease Surveillance System (NADIS) epidemio
    surveillance network and upgrading regional and central Labs to BSL2 and BSL3.
 Strengthening veterinary quarantine services through the rehabilitation of strategically located
    quarantine stations and training of quarantine personnel and provision of facilities.
 Improving biosecurity in poultry production and trade through intense biosecurity training for all
    categories of farmers and development of live bird markets.
 Developing a compensation mechanism that involves stakeholder participation.

Results. As a result of the various response activities, the disease was properly controlled and contained.
No outbreaks were recorded from October 2007 to July 2008. In July 2008, two confirmed cases in Kano
and Katsina states were recorded and promptly contained. In addition, two positive cases were
encountered during targeted live bird markets surveillance in Gombe and Kebbi States. Ongoing
challenges to the AHI response include controlling the movement of poultry and poultry products across
the nation, maintenance of biosecurity in farms and live bird markets, confusion among the general
population regarding the difference between AI and Newcastle disease, and a lack of appreciable
behavioral change. The response to the threat of AHI has demonstrated that prevention and control of AHI
is a complex multisectoral and multidisciplinary endeavor. Improving the veterinary infrastructure, capacity
building, and behavior change are essential ingredients in the fight against AHI.

Next Steps and Remaining Challenges. The next steps involve developing a roadmap for a sustainable
control and final eradication of AHI and developing a regional strategy for disease surveillance and
laboratory networking.

Migrant and Border Populations in Senegal

The West African country of Senegal maintains dynamic migration patterns, as it connects Sub-Saharan
Africa, North Africa, and Europe, making it a transit country for many migrants. Senegal produces rice,
sugar cane, seafood, and produce, attracting seasonal migrant workers as well as migrants en route to
Europe. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has implemented various social mobilization
project activities to strengthen migrants and border population’s knowledge and capacity to r espond to
pandemic influenza.

One such activity targeted the Saint Luis region of Senegal, which borders Mauritania, where there is daily
movement of different categories of migrants. IOM’s community social mobilization project centered on
migrant friendly information, education and communication (IEC) material based on WHO and UNICEF
key messages, promoting healthy practices to decrease the spread of pandemic influenza. To target
different migrant groups, the information flyer was designed to be socially, culturally, and linguistically
appropriate as well as gender sensitive.

In November 2009, the IOM worked in collaboration with UNOCHA and the Senegalese Red Cross to
organize a community based exercise for the local government in Richard Toll, Senegal, to raise the
awareness for the need of a pandemic preparedness plan. The exercise highlighted the potential impact
of an influenza pandemic on both the health and non-health sectors and to plan a coordinated response
to pandemic influenza, including addressing the needs of migrants and border communities. Participants
included regional administrative authorities from departments of health, sanitary services, the fire
department, civil protection, security and control border corps. Traditional leaders, community leaders,
community organizations and civil society were fully engaged in this exercise to encourage a sense of
ownership of pandemic planning. The multi-lingual dialogue focused on scenarios to identify solutions that
were possible to implement in their communities, and at the end of the workshop, participants completed
proposals for the development of a pandemic preparedness plan at the district and community level.

Pandemic Preparedness Exercise in Uganda

In October 2009, the Government of Uganda and the United States Africa Command conducted a tabletop
exercise to further develop national and regional capacity in disaster response, focusing on a severe
influenza pandemic. Supported by the US Center for Disaster and Humanitarian Assistance Medicine, this
exercise worked on advancing dialogue among governments to build relationships and enhance modalities
for better civil-military cooperation.

The exercise consisted of two forums (national and regional) for strategic coordination and international
response. The exercise was divided into four sessions, with scenarios progressing through the phases of
the disaster cycle to simulate a realistic sequence of events that could occur during a severe influenza
pandemic. Key areas of focus included transportation, security, engineering, public health/medical,
humanitarian assistance and communication.

The exercise created an excellent opportunity for senior and mid-level military leaders to train with civil
authorities in disaster management, pandemic preparedness and coordination. It assisted participating
nations with understanding the potential roles of international organizations, NGOs, and regional entities
in the management of a pandemic response, and enhanced the capability of host nations to respond to
complex humanitarian emergencies.

Cross-border and Regional Cooperation on HPAI in Western Africa

Following Ghana’s first HPAI H5N1 outbreaks, FAO organized a cross -border meeting among Ghana and
4 of its neighboring countries (Ivory Coast, Benin, Togo and Burkina Faso) in Ghana in June 2007. The
objectives of the meeting were to share experience and develop common approach and strategies on
avian influenza surveillance, prevention and control, focusing on areas where transborder collaboration is
instrumental. This kind of meeting was the first ever organized in Africa. Two follow-up meetings were
organized in Togo (December 2007) and in Ivory Coast (September 2008), with the support of FAO, USAID
and the Regional Animal health Center of Bamako, and with an increased participation from countries of
the sub-region (western and central Africa). WAEMU and ECOWAS also attended the meetings. It
therefore evolved from a cross-border to a sub-regional initiative.

To improve cross border collaboration, these needs were identified:
 Improvement of communication and information exchange between countries in the sub-region
    through regular meetings among the Chief Veterinary Officers, and among authorities at the borders
    including timely notification of disease events to Directors of Veterinary Services of the neighboring
    countries;
 Sharing of technical and human resources along the borders (to join forces), in particular to implement
    efficient surveillance along the borders;
 Improvement of epidemio-surveillance and laboratory sub-regional networks within and between
    countries in the sub-region; setting up of socio-economic and communication networks;
 Development of policy on movement of poultry and poultry products within the sub-region;
 Improvement of biosecurity on poultry farms and safe poultry production and trade in the sub-region;
 Inventory of poultry production systems and mapping of the value chains, thus allowing risk evaluation
    in the sub-region;
 Inventory of border control posts, equipment and allocated human resources;
 Intensification of awareness creation and education of the citizens of the countries in the sub-region;
 Strengthening of collaboration between stakeholders, for example, security agencies, community-
    based organizations, farmers’ organizations, nongovernmental organizations, etc.; and
 Use of legal sanitary certificates from regional organizations.

These above needs have been translated into recommendations.

One first concrete output of these meetings has been the elaboration of an international veterinary
certificate template for ECOWAS countries, to ensure traceability of poultry products, to harmonized
documents for easier veterinary controls at the borders and to ensure compliance with required sanitary
standards. These templates have been issued in July 2008 by the Bamako RAHC and will be discussed
during the forthcoming trans-border meetings, before final endorsement by ECOWAS.

                                 EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC (EAP)
The East Asia and Pacific Region had eight projects that are included                   Countries
in this review. They took place in Cambodia, the People’s Republic of
China, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Myanmar, and Vietnam (2                            Cambodia
projects).                                                                              China, People's Republic
                                                                                        Indonesia
Of the eight projects in the EAP Region, 7 projects (88 percent)
                                                                                        Lao PDR
developed a national action plan, increased coordination, and carried
out public awareness campaigns. Two projects (Vietnam and                               Mongolia
Cambodia) conducted a Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices survey                        Myanmar
and one project improved the use of information technology. Seven of                    Vietnam
the eight projects carried out training, and five of the eight (63 percent)
strengthened laboratory capacity.

EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC REGION CASE STUDIES

Below are selected case studies of GPAI interventions in the EAP Region. These case studies are
intended to complement the country overviews and provide greater depth and detail regarding the
operations of the GPAI.


Cambodia: An Example of Subnational Pandemic Planning
Cambodia established a National Working Group on Pandemic Planning to develop agreed inter-
ministerial coordination mechanisms and multisectoral operational response plans for a pandemic
emergency. The National Center for Disaster Management has been officially assigned as the coordinating
body for multisectoral preparedness.
A sub-national pilot project in Siem Reap province developed a multisectoral operational pandemic
response planning process. Key features of the process included:
 Dynamic group participation,
 Acknowledgement of the necessity for self-reliance
 An emphasis on the need to plan around currently available resources.
This approach has created one of the first and few opportunities for disparate government departments to
plan together, and is attracting the active involvement of civil society groups and private businesses and
the Cambodian Red Cross has been identified as a key stakeholder in the process.
Key outputs included:
 A model provincial pandemic response plan, including standard operating procedures for each sector;
 Identification of policy gaps by operational personnel to inform national-level planning; and
 A documented process to identify lessons learned by the University of Melbourne to also inform further
   extension of planning in Cambodia and other national or regional contexts.

Donor and Government Coordination in Joint Implementation Review in Lao PDR

The principles of coordination and integrated action that underpinned the Lao PDR National Avian
Influenza Control and Pandemic Preparedness Plan 2006-10 ("the National Plan") were tested in
February-March 2007 when all levels of government, affected communities, and development partners
responded to AI outbreaks. These outbreaks resulted in 2 human deaths from infection with the H5N1
avian flu (a poultry disease), over 350,000 poultry were culled, and 560,000 eggs were destroyed.
Learning and responding to the lessons of this experience was a complex, challenging but essential
process. Over a three-week period between April and May 2007, 27 representatives from 10 international
agencies worked side by side with more than 50 of their Government counterparts to undertake a
comprehensive joint implementation review (JIR) that examined each of the five strategy areas that
comprise the National Plan.
The implementation review was structured to improve coordination efforts among development partners
in order to avoid duplication of efforts and build on synergies. Officials and representatives from technical
and development partners worked together in groups corresponding to the five National Plan strategy
areas and each contributed to a detailed collective assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the
implementation process to date. The JIR demonstrates that the Government and its development partners
can work effectively together on the AHI response with the flexibility necessary to respond rapidly to
emerging priorities.

Joint and Coordinated Activities by Animal and Human Health Teams at Local Level in China
Problem and Context. China has a critical role to play in the international response to AHI given its size
and population, the significance of China's poultry industry, and the frequency of H5N1 outbreaks to date.
The government has formulated a comprehensive response to potential AHI threats. However, there are
particular challenges facing the central and sub-national governments in coordinating a response in such
a large and diverse country. Detailed technical assessments of China's response indicated that early
warning and surveillance capacity -- particularly at the grass roots level -- required considerable
strengthening. Rapid response at the grass roots level to investigate and contain human clusters of
disease with outbreak potential has often been implemented by different sectors in an uncoordinated way.
Identification of how the overall response and its coordination can be improved is key, given the wide
range of ministries and agencies involved -- especially those operating at the local level.
Approach and Activities. Under the GPAI, a grant from the AHI Facility supported AHI response capacity
at the county level and at the sub-national level in two Provinces (one has a largely intensive farming
system while the other has predominantly backyard farming systems). This support at the local level was
complemented by support to the central government in providing technical assistance to pilot local
operations as well as to develop knowledge sharing activities that will support the dissemination and
exchange of international experience and operational good practice that is emerging from the field.
Focus was on enhancing prevention and control of animal-to-animal, animal-to-human, and human-to-
human transmission, to strengthen the national plan for HPAI and human pandemic influenza, and to
establish mechanisms to enhance transparent, real time multisectoral communication between officials
involved at all levels of government. There was emphasis on support to officials at the grass roots (county)
level with the specific objectives of: improving coordination and communication between central and lower
levels of government; enhancing the level of human pandemic influenza preparedness amongst animal
and human health staff through the provision of training and drills; and, developing health promotion
awareness campaigns to effect behavioral change in key vulnerable societal groups.
Results. 1. The project has supported the training of local human and animal health staff together by using
some common modules for workers from both sectors. Similarly, animal and human health investigation
and response team exercises have jointly undertaken drills at local levels to foster a coordinated response.
This has led to recognition by the two sectors of how important it is to work together, indeed, to a greater
extent than has been true at the central government level. 2. It has been found more effective to have
international and domestic experts participate in seminars on international experience and then let the
Chinese officials internalize the implications--this in preference to consultants pointing out shortcomings
in the Chinese response system, particularly with respect to surveillance. 3. These efforts have also
contributed to a move away from a primary reliance on vaccination campaigns to more emphasis on
surveillance and other prevention/response strategies (biosafety, etc).
Next Steps and Remaining Challenges. 1. Experiences at local levels with the benefits of intersectoral
coordination need to be better reflected in the national plans and strategies. 2. Attention now needs to be
given to effective ways of scaling up these lessons for broader implementation across the country. If
successful, the pilots have the potential to identify a more integrated disease response strategy for AHI
and other emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. Moreover, if this can be achieved in a country of
China’s size, it offers important operational insights for other large countries . 3. Multisectoral pandemic
planning is still quite limited, but the experience could yield lessons for other developing countries to follow.
4. The project is contemplating building a more multidimensional approach to surveillance. The all-hazards
approach would include a range of key risk factors, using an event-based approach.

Participatory Disease Surveillance and Response in Indonesia
Participatory Disease Surveillance and Response (PDSR) is a system that combines quantitative
epidemiology with a qualitative approach known as Participatory Epidemiology (PE). Participatory
epidemiology is the collection of epidemiologic information using participatory approaches, such as those
that are commonly employed in Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA). Participatory disease searching and
disease reporting make a surveillance system sensitive and timely. Results can be more representative
when appropriately applied as part of an overall surveillance program. Participatory disease searching and
disease reporting provide an effective and logistically feasible means of improving the timeliness of
outbreak detection, reporting, and response, as well as broadening the scope of surveillance to include
neglected or marginalized livestock populations, such as village poultry and small-scale poultry producers.
Participatory disease response uses participatory principles to support a community-based response to
control HPAI. It also catalyzes participatory planning to help communities organize themselves and
mobilize their own resources to prevent the occurrence of HPAI in their villages.
Use of PDSR served to strengthen veterinary services and to empower communities in Indonesia. The
first phase of the PDSR project emphasized the detection and control of HPAI by PDS and PDR teams
primarily in village (sector 4) poultry, in households. Lessons included:
   The importance of strengthening the knowledge base and capacity at community level in order to
    better understand the origin, prevention and control of poultry diseases (especially HPAI);
 Taking a village-level approach to work with all poultry farmers, traders and community leaders within
    the village (including sector 3) for effective and efficient disease prevention and control;
 Linking with, and capacity building of, the veterinary services through PDSR activities; and
 Actively involving local government and human health services in PDSR activities as well as the overall
    HPAI Control Program.
 PDSR assists the overall effort towards disease management and as such forms an integral part of
    the national HPAI control strategy.
The second phase of the PDSR project expanded participatory activities to enable all key stakeholders,
from local communities to district, provincial and central governments, to have a voice in HPAI prevention
and control. The program was expected to culminate in a community-based animal disease prevention
and control program that becomes an integral part of provincial and district livestock services and which
is adequately funded through government budgeting.
By May 2008, 2,112 PDSR officers have been trained and are working in 331 districts across 27 of
Indonesia’s 33 provinces. From January 2006 to April 2008, PDSR officers had made a total of 166,524
surveillance visits, conducted 65,309 outbreak responses, and worked with over one million community
members.
The effectiveness of the PDSR system was evident during the outbreak of HPAI in a village in North
Sumatra province. PDSR officers were called to the village by a subdistrict official. They diagnosed HPAI
on the basis of clinical signs and positive rapid test. Poultry in the village were culled and decontamination
conducted. The PDSR officers informed the local government including human and animal health
authorities. Human health surveillance officers performed an investigation in the village the next day. Two
days after the first notification, suspected H5N1 human cases had been admitted to hospital. (On this

Pandemic Response Simulation Exercise in Indonesia
The Government of Indonesia conducted a full-scale three-day pandemic simulation exercise in April 2008,
to test and later revise the protocols and operational capacity of Indonesia to promptly and effectively
contain an epicenter of human-to-human transmission of a novel influenza virus.

It was one of the largest full-scale pandemic influenza emergency response simulation exercises. The
core objectives of the simulation were:
 To establish well-tested capability at the central, provincial, district and local levels to rapidly respond
    to a pandemic influenza outbreak;
 To establish well-tested and effective protocols and operational plans to be used to contain an
    outbreak of pandemic influenza;
 To establish positive inputs that can be used to strengthen the influenza pandemic containment plan.
As one of the first simulations exercising the operational coordination across multiple sectors and
jurisdictions, the exercise involved more than 8 months of planning and included nearly 1000 planners and
participants as well as more than 200 international and local observers. The value in preparing for the
exercise was two-fold: it engaged exercise participants to brainstorm through several sessions to
understand the intricate concepts related to outbreak containment; and it provided an opportunity to train
local officials from multiple jurisdictions, core simulation centers, controllers, simulators, evaluators and
administrators in simulation design and implementation.
Sectors participating in the full-scale exercise included hospitals, the Ngurah Rai International Airport, the
Armed and Police Forces, the National Commission for Avian Influenza and Pandemic Influenza, and
Ministries of Health, Environment, Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Agriculture, Communication and
Information, and Social Welfare. Key issues addressed through the exercise included:
   Command and coordination;
   Risk communication;
   Surveillance;
   Logistics of supplies and services, including port health;
   Distribution of essential medical supplies including anti-virals, personal protective equipment, vaccine;
   Non-pharmaceutical interventions and area quarantine.

In this simulation exercise, the planning process was just as important as the exercise itself.

At the conclusion of the simulation, feedback and observations were collected and consolidated from the
observers through evaluative meetings. All this information and lessons contributed towards producing
final guidelines, protocols and operational procedures for outbreak containment, included in a training
program for all local jurisdictions (provinces and districts) through the framework of a train-the-trainer
module. These materials and information are essential for increasing advocacy for preparedness and to
conduct pandemic preparedness training and simulations.

Frontline Early Detection of Infected Backyard Poultry by Alert Locals in Lao PDR
The “how” an outbreak is detected is as important as the “what.” In Lao PDR in February 2008, an outbreak
in backyard poultry was notified by a village veterinary worker (VVW) in a remote, ethnic-minority area that
had never received significant services from the government. The VVW had been trained only 3 weeks
prior, by mechanisms provided by FAO, CARE and the National Animal Health Center. As the first case
detected in backyard poultry as opposed to commercial farms, the incident showed the importance of
community-based initiatives for early detection and triggering of rapid control measures.
Establishing an animal disease reporting network down to the village level was clearly critical in Lao PDR
for early detection and notification of outbreaks. Training of VVWs started in 2006 in all provinces, and
included basic avian influenza knowledge and teaching methods. The initiative continued to expand in
2007 (training 1,645 people) and 2008 (over 2,600 trained by June). A national hotline was established.
Empowered with training, knowledge and the skill to detect the signs and differential diagnosis of poultry
diseases, VVWs have been key in addressing the challenges of surveillance in backyard poultry systems.

Mongolia: Innovative Commitment by an At-Risk Country
Problem and Context. Mongolia’s small poultry industry has not seen outbreaks of HPAI . A few
confirmed outbreaks have occurred in wild birds (other infections may have occurred but not been detected
due to limited surveillance). However, Mongolia lies within the three major flyways where infection from
the AHI Asian epicenters of China, Indonesia and Vietnam intersect with those of Western Europe. It also
has over 40 large lakes. Other species such as canids, pigs, camels and horses, which are susceptible to
influenza viruses, all use waterways frequented by wild birds. This and cross-border challenges to
preventing transmission, exchanging information and ensuring coordination make Mongolia pivotal for
monitoring AHI’s global spread and demonstrate the central importance of an integrated disease response.
Approach and Activities. The Government implemented a three-year, National Strategy and Action Plan
for Avian and Human Pandemic Influenza. Complemented by animal and human health strategies, the
National Strategy focused on: improving outbreak and disaster response at the national and aimag
(provincial) levels, wild bird surveillance, early warning and response systems, bio-security measures in
poultry production and health facilities, and hospital capacity for better management of patients.
A unique and promising activity was building of an Incidence Response Information System (IRIS). This
GIS based system maps risks to facilitate response capabilities. It maps key data (presence of
veterinarians, number of households, livestock, health facilities, etc.) needed by disease prevention and
control efforts to define catchments, set the boundaries for response efforts, etc. The National Emergency
Management Agency (NEMA) can thus work jointly with medical and veterinary personnel to respond to
any outbreaks of HPAI in poultry or humans. While initially intended for HPAI, IRIS can help combat other
diseases and thus serve as a cross-sectoral platform for work on diseases at the animal-human interface.
Results. A notable feature was the close collaboration between the government, World Bank and UN
technical agencies. This was true from the project inception mission and continued, as all agencies worked
hard to collectively define the challenges and articulate solutions. The Ministry of Health worked with WHO,
and the Ministry of Agriculture worked with FAO on animal health concerns. NEMA undertook overall
coordination, particularly on monitoring and evaluation. These partnerships have helped overcome the
usual sectoral boundaries and have led to an unusually high degree of collaboration across sectors and
agencies in the formulation of a pandemic influenza preparedness and response plan.
Remaining Challenges. Mongolia’s sparse population and its herder culture and society set it apart. The
project’s methodology, however, has clear applications for other herder societies where animal-human
interaction is commonplace and where zoonotic diseases impact on lives and livelihoods. Livestock is a
large part of the economy and animal diseases, including zoonotic ones, have a macroeconomic impact if
not adequately controlled. Thus, there are benefits from comprehensive, integrated animal and human
health surveillance and disease response.

Sustaining an Effective Response in Vietnam
Since the first AI outbreak in 2003, Vietnam has been at the forefront of efforts to address a disease that
then spread across Asia, Western Europe, Africa and the Middle East. As in the SARS outbreak less than
one year prior, Vietnam’s experience with HPAI has underscored the importance of early detection and
response, backed by strong coordination within the human, animal and other sectors.
AI has proven costly to Vietnam. Since the first outbreaks, Vietnam has reported 100 human cases, 46 of
which have proven fatal – figures exceeded only by Indonesia. In the poultry sector, successive outbreaks
initially overwhelmed provincial veterinary services. Surveillance infrastructure and laboratory facilities for
diagnosis and monitoring of the progress of the disease were limited. Widespread outbreaks were
contained but only through rapid and massive culling of diseased as well as unaffected birds. These efforts
caused losses representing close to 15 percent of the national flock and come at a direct cost of more
than US$200 million or 1.5 percent of GDP.
Control of successive AI outbreaks required stringent containment measures including the establishment
of regulations to close all live poultry markets, the introduction of movement controls at the district level,
and bio-security measures in de-stocked commercial facilities. The enforcement of these measures was
particularly challenging and required extraordinary political and organizational efforts to initiate and sustain
the containment “package” at all levels.
At the central level, a high level Steering Committee has met weekly to guide the national response and
ensured that directives were issued and disseminated effectively throughout the country. At the provincial
level, AI Steering Committees reporting directly to the Provincial People’s Committees (PCC), drew on
various social mobilization mechanisms including mass organizations such as the Women’s Unions and
Fatherland Front, and were successful at coordinating the response, controlling activities across sectors,
mobilizing resources for AI activities, and promoting accountability of the sectors involved to the highest
provincial authority. The government also adopted nationwide poultry vaccination commencing late 2005,
mobilizing tens of thousands of vaccinators at the local level. The application of this intensive –and
distinctively Vietnamese approach–coincided with dramatic reductions in human and animal cases. No
human cases were recorded in an 18-month period and, although the virus was still present in the
environment, no poultry cases were reported during the period December 2005-December 2006.
However, the resurgence of infection in late 2006 and again in May 2007, following this period of effective
– or at least apparent –control has posed a substantial challenge for policymakers. Do these outbreaks
point to “fatigue” in or weakening of the social mobilization mechanisms that appeared to have been so
effective in initial emergency? Is the costly investment in mass poultry vaccination – previously associated
with effective control of outbreaks – still warranted given that outbreaks have returned? Can veterinary
services keep pace with the substantial increase in duck production now that the previous ban on duck
hatching has been lifted? Can the nationwide response be reinvigorated and re-established on a more
sustainable basis so that it can be as effective in – as well as in the absence of – an emergency?
Once again, Vietnam geared up to confront frontier issues. The main challenge was clear: to move from
emergency response to medium and long-term integrated disease control and prevention measures for
both human and poultry populations. There was also a need to consolidate the significant progress already
achieved whilst reducing the overall cost of control. For animal health, the challenge was to transition from
mass vaccination to risk-based interventions such as targeted vaccination and surveillance that will
maintain disease control at lower cost.
For the human health sector, it is encouraging that Vietnam’s case fatality ratio is lower than both the
global average (46 percent vs. 61 percent) and that of the other most affected country, Indonesia (81
percent). However, significant human resource and other constraints in the health system need to be
addressed to ensure there is sufficient capacity to respond should the virus become more easily
transmissible for humans or, even worse, become the next pandemic virus.

Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance Network
The Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS) is a network of six Mekong countries (Cambodia, China
(Yunnan Province), Lao PDR, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand) which since 2001 has been collaborating
successfully in surveillance and outbreak response and control. The partnership was reinforced in May
2007 through renewal of an MOU among the six Health Ministers. The collaboration provides a neutral
mechanism for information exchange and joint response by countries with different political structures. It
encourages sharing of information and strengthens disease surveillance and response to outbreaks of
diseases such as avian influenza and dengue hemorrhagic fever.
Main aims are: (a) strengthening national capacity in disease surveillance, outbreak investigation and
response; (b) strengthening health manpower, development in field epidemiology; and (c) establishment
of a sub regional surveillance network. Since 2006 activities of MBDS Network included:
 Cross-border information exchange
 Information exchange carried out daily to quarterly depending on the disease.
 Joint outbreak investigation and response.
 A joint avian influenza investigation was triggered by the finding of an infected Lao citizen in Thailand.
    Investigation support from Thailand reached Laos within 24 hours after discovery.
 Joint Vietnam and Lao PDR investigations for outbreaks of typhoid and malaria.
 Training of health personnel.
 During 2006-2007 110 workers were trained in either field epidemiology and disease surveillance,
    analytical techniques or social, political and economic aspects of border health.
 Disaster preparedness and table top exercises.
 Each country conducted tabletop exercise on an effective response to an influenza pandemic in 2006,
    and a regional table top exercise took place in March 2007 by convening multisectoral officials from
    six countries.
Overall impact and achievements:
 MBDS provides a policy framework for cross-border cooperation and model for collaboration.
 MBDS demonstrates systems that facilitate implementation of the International Health Regulations.
 Ministries of Health in the network have empowered bilateral and multilateral investigations of disease
   outbreaks through MBDS.

Gathering Evidence for a Transitional Strategy for Poultry Vaccination in Vietnam
Vietnam has been practicing mass vaccination of poultry twice a year (October and April) since autumn of
2005 to control epizootic H5N1 HPAI with some considerable empirical evidence of success. However, it
has been recognized that this control strategy is not sustainable over the whole country in the long term.
Mass vaccination entails a large amount of financial resources from the government and ties up significant
human resources in the agriculture sector.
 The Gathering Evidence for a Transitional Strategy (GETS) project assisted the Government of Vietnam
in transitioning from mass vaccination of poultry to more cost effective and targeted measures for
sustained control of HPAI in five high and low risk provinces. The project used a multidisciplinary approach
to gather data consisting of a vaccine strategic intervention that incorporates public awareness, training
and surveillance field activities, a cost effectiveness component, a sociological behavioral component and
a policy analysis component. The results of the field data were provided to the Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development of Vietnam to assist them in their choice of future vaccination strategy for HPAI.

Vietnam’s Emergency Response to Avian Influenza Created a Model of Resilience


In December 2003, Vietnam experienced its first cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1.
Within four months the disease had spread to 57 of 64 provinces, and 44 million poultry - 17 percent of
the nation’s stock - had died from the disease or been culled to prevent further outbreak. Veterinary health
and disease surveillance systems were rapidly overwhelmed, and with 15 human deaths recorded in 2004,
the threat was raised of a potential pandemic.
Vietnam’s Avian Influenza Emergency Recovery Project (AIERP) was the world’s first comprehensive
HPAI emergency response operation. It was fully implemented in less than three years in the ten provinces
worst hit by the virus and helped enhance national disease surveillance and diagnostic capacity,
strengthened mechanisms in the poultry sector to contain serious outbreaks, and safeguarded public
health by raising awareness of risks and how to mitigate them. The project provided a platform for action,
allowing the government to articulate and lead a concerted response with donors, international technical
agencies and civil society. Complementary efforts supported by the Government of Japan helped low-
income stakeholders recover from losses caused by the epizootic.
A core team of experts on animal health, veterinary epidemiology, poultry vaccination and poultry
production from FAO worked with government counterparts to devise measures to control the outbreak.
Close attention was focused on ensuring that the response (for example, in designing, testing and
monitoring a poultry vaccine) kept pace with the rapidly evolving threat, while enabling the government to
craft a longer-term strategy through investments to upgrade capacity, institutions and key health systems.
Work was undertaken on investments in critical systems to mitigate the threat of HPAI. Vietnam’s approach
informed the design of programs in 60 countries under the GPAI. The project focused on containing the
disease at the animal source as the most effective and efficient way of reducing socioeconomic damage
and the risk of widespread contagion among human populations.
Highlights of the program included:

   Development and adoption in December 2005 of a national Emergency Contingency Plan which has
    become a model for many developing countries in containing a disease outbreak;
   Disease control measures have prevented direct losses in the poultry sector estimated at more than
    US$58 million, and improved veterinary services have yielded the added benefit of better controlling
    several other animal diseases.
   Regular joint supervision missions by the World Bank and FAO facilitated quick fine-tuning in the
    disease control strategy. For instance, around midterm, the project helped design and monitor the
    world’s first large-scale poultry vaccination program against the virus, coordinating some 100,000
    vaccinators. Subsequently the strategy was adjusted to gradually replace blanket vaccination by ring
    vaccinations targeted to contain incipient outbreaks.
   Community-based early warning disease response systems were established in 30 districts of the 10
    heaviest-hit provinces.
   Critical equipment and training provided to Vietnam’s key diagnostic laboratories, including the
    national veterinary laboratory and four regional facilities, enabled complex sample testing to be
    completed within a week of an outbreak.
   Biosecurity was upgraded in all 12 poultry-stocking facilities throughout the country.
   Public awareness and information campaigns were launched in 1,700 communes and reached 51,000
    villagers in the provinces most affected by HPAI. Communications training for veterinary and livestock
    extension staff was provided at the central, provincial, district, commune and village levels.
   Under restocking operations supported through the Japan Social Development Fund, 8,366 poor
    households received 1.22 million poultry that were bred and raised in biosecure conditions and
    vaccinated against avian influenza and other diseases. The overall mortality of restocked poultry from
    delivery to market was 7.7 percent, versus a background mortality rate of 47 percent for backyard
    poultry.
   Using the project to expand dialogue on coordinating donor assistance, the World Bank in April 2006
    coordinated a government-donor joint-assessment mission—with 32 representatives from all relevant

                                                    39
    ministries and 11 bilateral and multilateral organizations, including the Asian Development Bank,
    Denmark, France, Australia, New Zealand and the United States.
   A follow-up donor meeting in Hanoi in June 2006, attended by representatives from 30 donor countries
    and international agencies, pledged more than US$60 million for the AHI response in 2006–08.
The emergency project undertaken in the rush to cope with a rapidly evolving threat was designed as a
pilot to develop and test a comprehensive strategy to control avian influenza in Vietnam. The project
achieved its goals and laid the ground for a broader follow-up effort in 2007, the Vietnam Avian and Human
Influenza Control and Preparedness Project (VAHIP) with an estimated cost of US$35 million. Close
partnership between the government, the World Bank, and international agencies (primarily FAO and the
World Health Organization, as well as with OIE) helped ensure that successful interventions are
sustainable. Successful implementation of the emergency response project also provided lessons for other
countries’ programs, including those to respond to the H1N1 flu pandemic.

Field Epidemiology Training Program for Veterinarians
The goal of the Field Epidemiology Training Program for Veterinarians (FETPV) is to produce high- quality
graduates who are problem solvers and can provide science-based recommendations for government
decision makers.
A regional needs assessment identified key competencies and skills required by veterinary field
epidemiologists. The training curriculum consisted of interdisciplinary training modules including animal
disease surveillance, outbreak investigation, data analysis, animal-human-environmental interface,
geographic information systems, emergency preparedness and response and market chain analysis.
Since the initial level of training in epidemiology in various countries varies greatly, a one-month pre-
requisite course was offered to narrow the gap among trainees from different countries. Each year, at least
three top performing trainees from the short course participated in the two-year FETPV program that
included parallel training modules with medical doctors.
With principles based on “training through providing services”, 75 percent of the trainees’ time was spent
in their home country conducting field studies. During the two-year program, trainees must have completed
one secondary data analysis, one field research project and four outbreak investigations as principle
investigator. Field mentors played a critical role in providing trainees sound skills, and included skilled
epidemiologists from FAO.
The Regional FETPV program enlisted its second cohort of three international and three Thai trainees in
June 2010. The pre-requisite short course and two-year program were fully supported by Chief veterinary
officers in 12 participating countries in Asia (Lao PDR, Cambodia, Myanmar, Nepal, Indonesia, India,
Thailand, China, Mongolia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines). India and China developed satellite
FETPV training nodes that can collaborate closely with the Regional FETPV.
The regional FETPV program exemplified the One Health approach, which promotes and integrates
human, animal and environmental health, both conceptually and practically.

Effective Transition from Emergency Response to Successful Detection and Containment in Turkey
Poultry production in Turkey contributes about 1.7 percent to National GDP, has been growing by 14.4
percent each year, has an annual turnover of $2.5-3.0 billion and employs about 500.000 people. In 2006
the 10,000-odd large commercial (sector 1) poultry holdings contained some 213 million poultry. In
addition, 90 percent of the rural population keeps 23 million poultry in backyards, with flocks varying from
2 to 50 birds.
On October 1, 2005 an outbreak of avian influenza was detected in the Manyas district of Balikesir
province: three turkeys died in a flock of 1,800 in an outdoor grazing facility. Most of the rest of the flock
died over the next three days. The district veterinary service diagnosed AI: laboratory confirmation was
received on October 13. Control measures were initiated by the provincial veterinary service on October
7: a 3-km protection zone was set up with enforcement by military police. In the next 8 days all backyard
poultry (10,000 birds) within the zone were culled, compensation provided to the affected farmers by the
private poultry industry, and 16,000 birds from the remaining two commercial farms were slaughtered. A
10 km radius surveillance zone was established: this contained roughly 45,000 backyard poultry, and 10
active larger poultry farms with a stock of over 130,000 animals. The movement of live poultry was banned,
transport of table and hatching eggs was regulated, market trade of poultry and hunting of wild birds was
banned, and a local awareness campaign was initiated.
The outbreak was quickly contained, with no signs of transmission to humans. But the economic impact was
severe. Within the first week the market capitalization of the traded firms dropped by over 30 percent. Within
two weeks, the consumption of poultry in Turkey (roughly 1.2 kg per capita per month) and egg demand (12
eggs per capita per month) dropped substantially and retail poultry prices fell by 30 percent. The Turkish poultry
and egg sector incurred losses of roughly $900,000 daily in October-December 2005.
In January 2006, a widespread outbreak occurred, starting initially in northeastern Turkey along the border
areas with Georgia, Armenia, and Iran. This area is directly on the flight path of migrating birds (the so-
called Central Asia Flyway) and sits between three large lakes: Sevan in the east (Armenia), Van in the
eastern Anatolia (Turkey), and Urmia in the south (Iran). The response to the initial outbreak in the
provinces of Ardahan, Kars, Erzurum, Ağrı, Iğdır, and Van was rapid with culling of over 50,000 birds in a
week. In the second week of January, the number of provinces reporting suspected or confirmed cases of
AI in poultry rose quickly. As of mid-March, its presence was confirmed in 58 of Turkey’s 81 provinces . To
combat this rapid spread, the authorities culled birds in protection zones around affected villages and
monitored spread in surveillance zones. A phone hotline was set up for people to report loose or sick
poultry, and bazaar market trade of live poultry was prohibited throughout the country. By mid-March, over
2.3 million birds had been culled. The rapid spread of the AI in January 2006 is thought to be due to
challenges with enforcing bans on the movement of birds in the surveillance zones and some well-reported
instances of delayed compensation payments.
There was associated animal-to-human transmission of H5N1. Up to January 19, there were 21 suspected
human cases, including four deaths. 38 percent of the cases were female, and seventeen of the 21 patients
were younger than 15 years old. Most of the cases were transferred to, and treated at, the University
Hospital in Van. The prompt response led to the early control of the outbreaks nationally and the early
detection and the treatment helped keep the case fatality ratio low.
2007 outbreak. During an outbreak in Batman Province (February 8-15, 2007), a total of 1,508 poultry of
various species were culled. The HPAI contingency plan was implemented. Central and local crisis centers
were established. Quarantine measures were introduced, and both protection and surveillance zones were
established. Poultry were culled and compensation was provided. Live poultry markets were closed, and
strict quarantine measures and road checks implemented. Epidemiological studies suggest that wild birds
were the source of infection.
International support. The government has sought assistance from the UN systems agencies (FAO, WHO,
UNICEF), the OIE, and members of the EU, the US and other nations and also developed an Avian
Influenza and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (AIHP) Project for financing by the World
Bank. Good progress has been made with building links between the line agencies, NGOs and local

                                                       55
communities; expenditures from counterpart funds; donor parallel financed actions; providing protective
gear and laboratory equipment; training of animal health and human health staff; laboratory rehabilitation
and public awareness activities. In particular, the joint efforts related to communication and public
awareness have contributed significantly to the early warning and containment of the Batman outbreak.
A “Biosecurity Working Group”, led by the Agriculture Ministry (MARA) with the participation of FAO,
donors and poultry growers associations, is examining options to improve poultry sector bio-security
(particular emphasis on backyard flocks). Five types of pilot project have been initiated in selected
provinces with co-financing from donors.
Evaluation of responses to the Batman HPAI outbreaks in February 2007 suggested that initial response
and containment activities by local and national authorities were rapid and effective, the MARA and
Ministry of Health teams coordinated well together, timely support was provided by FAO and the EU,
$450,000 compensation was paid – promptly – to the owners of birds culled, and adequate information
was provided to the public. Compared with the previous (2005 and 2006) outbreaks, overall poultry
consumption and tourism were not affected and the economic impact was negligible.
Such effective application of control measures by national and local authorities, with prompt and effective
support from other nations, regional bodies and UN agencies, minimizes the risks of dramatic HPAI spread
(of the kind which occurred in January 2006) and of major economic consequences.

Armenia Remained Free from HPAI Despite Regional Threat
Despite reported outbreaks of H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in neighboring countries
(Georgia, Turkey and Azerbaijan) and human deaths from avian influenza infection in two of them (Turkey
and Azerbaijan), Armenia has not had any confirmed cases of HPAI. This suggests that natural mitigating
features may have helped. But, more important, a quick government response and strong commitment
have helped the country prepare for tackling outbreaks.
Armenia responded rapidly to the global threat of HPAI by implementing quick measures against it. The
government instituted an inter-ministerial task force, which was mandated to respond to any emergency
situation, to implement a communication strategy and to coordinate between various government
agencies. While many activities of the task force were sporadic and ad-hoc, it was quite effective in
ensuring coordination between government agencies and in quickly implementing various required
measures. These measures included bans on poultry imports, surveillance at the border posts and
communication with the public. In addition, the task force was effective in preparing the Government’s
program of measures against HPAI, which served as the basis for the overall donor support. The veterinary
services were able to utilize the semi-private community veterinarians and state inspectors for the major
surveillance effort. There are about 870 veterinarians based in communities and the probability of detection
of an outbreak of HPAI at village level is fairly high. In addition, extension efforts appear to have created
a high awareness of the dangers of H5N1 at the community/village level.
This success was in part possible thanks to Armenia’s capacity to quickly secure, from various donors
(World Bank, FAO, USAID, Russia, PHRD, AHIF), support for its national HPAI program. The Government
designed a national program under the GPAI framework within a few months. This program was tailored
to the Armenian context and addressed the immediate AI threat. Harmonization with USAID’s support was
quite instrumental; USAID planned its AI program while the World Bank support was being prepared. The
Bank project built capacity in the veterinary services for AI preparedness. In addition, it addressed broader
veterinary capacity in the country, thus becoming a major intervention to strengthen the veterinary system.

                  LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LCR)

The Latin America and the Caribbean Region (LCR) had 14 projects that are included in this review. They
took place in Argentina (3 projects), Belize, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico (3
projects), Nicaragua, and Uruguay, and also included a Regional
Project, which worked across countries. Of the 14 LCR projects, 13 (93 LCR
percent) developed national plans. All 14 projects increased Argentina
coordination. 64 percent (nine projects) carried out a public awareness
campaigns and only one project conducted a Knowledge, Attitudes, and Belize
Practices survey. The use of information technology was improved in 7 Brazil
projects. Ten projects (71 percent) conducted training exercises, and Dominican Republic
five projects (36 percent) carried strengthened laboratory capacity.

LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN REGION CASE STUDIES

Impact of the 2009 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic in Mexico
Mexican public health authorities responded well and promptly to the newly-emerged H1N1 influenza virus.
Although the virus proved to be less virulent than was initially feared, the economic costs of the epidemic
in Mexico (which then became the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic) were quick to materialize. The costs were
substantial as well, far above the medical costs and the costs due to people being ill. A sharp drop in
demand due to the evolving epidemic hit the tourism and hospitality sectors and related activities hard.
In mid-March 2009 health service providers in Mexico observed an unusual increase in patients presenting
influenza-like symptoms. The increased number of local outbreaks of seasonal influenza in late February
and March (seasonal flu usually peaks in mid-January) as well as clusters of severe pneumonia in young
adults compounded suspicions and led health officials to investigate the outbreaks. On April 16, the
Ministry of Health announced that there had been an unusual increase in seasonal flu cases.
On April 23, when laboratories confirmed that A/H1N1 was responsible for several influenza cases in
Mexico, the Mexican Government began implementation of a series of activities aimed at containing the
spread and mitigating the health impact of the epidemic. Schools, restaurants, museums and other venues
in Mexico City were shut down for 10 days; nonessential businesses were closed for five days. The
Ministries of Health and Education issued a joint statement saying that school closing was a preventive
measure and that everyone should “avoid popular or crowded places except when absolutely necessary” .
The influenza pandemic had a significant temporary impact on the Mexican economy and especially on
service related sectors such as tourism and recreational activities. Though a counterfactual is always hard
to establish, in particular at a time of a global financial crisis and economic recession, current estimates of
the downturn in economic activity in Mexico estimate an additional reduction of economic activity by 0.3-
0.5 percent of GDP or between US$2.7 and US$4.5 billion. This estimate is based on the deviation of the
service sector activity compared to the level of activity that would have been expected given the evolution
of the rest of the economy. In terms of external finances, the drop in international tourism in the 2nd and
3rd quarters of 2009 led to a decrease of gross revenue by US$1.5 billion compared to the same period
of the previous year and can be largely attributed to the H1N1 influenza epidemic.

Regional Interagency Collaboration on Preparedness in Southern Cone Countries
Regional collaboration has been important in preparing Latin American countries for control and prevention
of a potential epizootic of the HPAI virus subtype H5N1, in the still HPAI-free Americas. Capabilities differ
between the countries due to the state of their public health facilities, veterinary services, and their
experience with other bird diseases such as low pathogenic AI virus strains and Newcastle disease.
In 2006, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay, received a regional AHI Facility grant to
strengthen the Consejo Agropecuario del Sur (CAS) for Avian Flu Preparedness. The CAS is a regional
coordination set up by MERCOSUR (Mercado Comun del Sur ampliado).
The engagement of the CAS and of ministers of agriculture is strategic for tackling HPAI and other animal
diseases across the sub-region. The grant financed the building of regional capacity for surveillance and
prevention of HPAI and other current and emerging trans-boundary animal health issues. It recognized
the importance of the potential economic and social damage to a leading poultry producing and exporting
sub-region. The grant’s activities therefore also addressed the potential social impact of HPAI on both
small poultry producers and large-scale commercial producers in all six countries.
Interagency collaboration across IICA (Instituto Interamericano de Cooperación para la Agricultura - the
project implementer), FAO, OIE and the World Bank was important. This collaboration helped to engage
regional experts, and make links between efforts to prevent avian influenza and those to tackle other
poultry and animal diseases.

The Middle East and North Africa Region (MNA) had 9 projects that are included in this review. They took
place in Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Morocco, Tunisia, the West Bank and Gaza, and Yemen (2 projects). There
was also a Regional Middle East Project. Of the 9 MNA projects, 8 projects (89 percent) developed national
plans and 8 projects increased coordination. Five projects (56 percent)
                                                                            Countries
carried out a public awareness campaign and one project (Egypt)
conducted a Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices survey. Three projects Djibouti
(33 percent) improved the use of information technology. All 9 projects Egypt, Arab Republic of
including a training component, and 7 projects (78 percent) Iran, Islam Rep.
strengthened laboratory capacity.

operations of the GPAI.


Close Human-to-Poultry Contact Heightens Pandemic Risk in Egypt


On February 2006, Egypt confirmed its first cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in domestic
poultry. Since then the number of outbreaks in poultry has reached 341, affecting 860 farms and 285
backyard poultry holders. Thus far, 34.4 million birds have been culled, and outbreaks have badly
damaged the local poultry industry with costs estimated at between US$2 billion to 3 billion. Egypt has
also registered the highest number of human infections and fatalities on the African continent with 38
confirmed human infections of H5N1, including 15 deaths.
Combating this disease is made more difficult given Egypt’s poultry systems and the social and cultural
factors that have assisted the disease’s rapid spread in the country. Nearly one-third of Egyptian households
own poultry. These households, together with many small-scale commercial units, rely on centralized live
bird markets for sales as a result of the lack of refrigeration, the limited processing capacity, and the traditional
and cultural preference for purchasing live birds. These markets, along with the proximity observed between
poultry and humans in traditional rearing systems, present a high risk of virus dissemination. A serious public
health risk has been demonstrated if the disease “spills over” into humans in these settings.
The overall government response to the outbreaks in poultry, and in humans, has been swift despite limited
resources and logistical difficulties on the ground. The Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) rapidly took
the lead in combating the spread of the disease. There now exists good laboratory capacity for influenza.
The MOHP Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) performs accurate RT-PCR diagnosis in a timely
manner. Laboratory-based surveillance for influenza has been implemented in three sentinel sites. A
collaboration program is also in place to share specimens and products among the CPHL and the WHO
regional reference laboratory. Though governorate laboratories do not have the capacity for HPAI diagnosis,
their personnel have received training in specimen collection and use of necessary laboratory supplies.
In terms of clinical management, each governorate currently has two designated hospitals to manage
suspected human HPAI cases with isolation wards of about 18 to 24 beds per governorate. On the
community awareness side, a USAID-funded project provided technical assistance at MOHP’s request to
implement a national public health campaign. Print materials were widely distributed to different audiences
and hospitals centrally and at the governorates level. Basic information has been communicated through
seminars at governorate levels and specific sessions have been conducted for university students and
women’s groups. MOHP has also launched a national radio campaign with the support of UNICEF. In
addition, social mobilization campaigns have been conducted in most affected governorates providing
house-to-house educational activities in high-risk areas. Although new cases continue to be reported,
awareness and social mobilization campaigns initiated by MOHP appear to be successful in encouraging
more rapid reporting and diagnosis, and hence limiting fatalities and the possible spread of the disease.
Much more remains to be done and MOHP has been very proactive in expanding its diagnosis and surveillance
capacity for HPAI in humans. The World Bank has approved a reallocation of funds for HPAI activities through
its ongoing Health Sector Project in Egypt. More than $6 million has been disbursed so far to help strengthen
HPAI surveillance, improve public sector response and support a national communication strategy. In addition,
a $7.1 million grant from the multidonor Avian and Human Influenza Facility was approved to support disease
surveillance, diagnostic, control and management capacity in the animal health sector.

Community-Based Education Campaigns in Egypt: Empowerment through Education

Ranked number three among countries most affected by Avian Influenza (AI) and with approximately 91
percent of the human cases occurring in households with backyard poultry breeding, Egypt is combating
the AI threat through communication and education. The Egyptian Government has coordinated a national
communication plan with the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and the Ministry of Health and Population
(MOHP) along with other national and international partners to “catch and contain” in the bird population
before crossing into the human population.

Besides a mass media public campaign, one of the main elements of the strategy is a community-based
education program through community health workers: The community-based education program,
implemented by the MOHP and UNICEF, reaches out to more than 4.8 million families in rural areas of
the most-affected and at-risk governorates in Egypt. The 10 000 community health workers (Raedat
Reefiat) and their 200 supervisors have been well trained and are supported through a tight monitoring
and supervision system. The core of the program is a house-to-house education campaign facilitating the
distribution of the key public health messages “Clean, Protect, Cover up your nose and mouth and report” .
Using a package of educational materials that is specially tailored to affect general and relevant breeding
practices, members of the families responsible for the poultry breeding learn about means to best protect
themselves, and stop infection among birds or humans.

Before house visits started in January 2008, a baseline survey was done. By end-June 2008, each targeted
family had been visited at least 3 times. There were marked improvements, toward the target goals of:
• Outreach education on correct preventive knowledge to at least 80 percent of the households visited;
• At least 70 percent of families understand and practice 3 public health practices: i. wash hands after
    handling poultry; ii. separate poultry from living areas; and iii. keep children away from poultry
• Establish an MOHP institutionalized supervision system supporting AI containment program.

As the figure shows, there have been significant changes in the different behavioral practices: for example,
washing hands with soap after handling poultry increased from 56 percent compared to 36 percent at
baseline. Those separating poultry from living areas increased from 64 percent at baseline to 74 percent
at the fourth visit. Nationally, the percent of positive change for all the 14 measured practices was 36
percent after the fourth visit, showing good impact within only 6 months.

Multisectoral Pandemic Preparedness in Egypt


Egypt has made significant progress in preparing for a Pandemic. Within the Egyptian framework for
Disaster Management, it has set up a strong command and control structure which is divided into three
levels: the political level, the planning and preparation level, and the executive or operational level.

On the strategic level, the Higher Ministerial Committee for crisis management was established and
headed by the Prime Minister with the participation of the Ministries of Defense and Military Production,
Interior Affairs, Information, Foreign Affairs and Health and Population. Other concerned ministries can be
invited to participate as need be.

On the planning and preparation level, the national pandemic inter-ministerial committee was established
and headed by the Minister of Health and Population with the participation of concerned ministers
especially those that provide essential services to the public.

Egypt has also developed response and preparedness procedures at both the national and sub-national
levels. Recent achievements include establishing a sub-committee to organize pandemic simulation
exercises. The sub-committee is headed by the Cabinet of Information and Decision Support Center
(IDSC) with the participation of the Ministries of Defense and Military production, Interior Affairs, Health
and Population, Information, Agriculture and Land Reclamation, Environment, Local Development and
representatives of the National Security Council.

At the national level, a simulation exercise was conducted at the Ministry of Health and Population. The
exercise was successful in testing the reporting and tracking procedures in case of a pandemic. Training
was held in three governorates (El-Beheria, Red Sea and Menia).

At the sub-national level, the Monofia Pandemic Plan was reviewed, developed and evaluated for use as
a model for other governorates. The IDSC ensured that all 26 governorates have Response and
Preparedness Plans. The next step is to organize simulation training exercises in all governorates in order
to test, revise and validate the plans.

On a parallel front, the IDSC was instrumental in providing guidance to the private sector for preparing
Business Continuity Plans through advocacy. It will also undertake a survey, the first of its kind in the
region, to obtain an indication of the extent to which private and public institutions responsible for providing
essential services in Egypt are preparing for a possible pandemic and formulate recommendations on how
to improve pandemic readiness in businesses.

H5N1 Avian Flu Joint United Nations Assessment Mission in Egypt

At the request of the Egyptian National Supreme Committee of Avian and Human Influenza, the UN
Resident Coordinator Office in Cairo and UNSIC facilitated a joint assessment mission by a
multidisciplinary team from FAO, UNICEF, and WHO from 6-16 December 2009. The team was asked to
assess the measures taken by all levels of government to prevent and control outbreaks of H5N1 flu in
poultry and in people, and to identify impediments to effective implementation.
The mission reviewed mechanisms for the control of H5N1 flu in poultry and infection in humans.
Weakness were identified through discussions with key program managers and other stakeholders. The
team explored new mechanisms for controlling H5N1 flu. The mission team made clear operational
recommendations that targeted mechanisms for multidisciplinary approaches, identifying opportunities for
integration across disciplines and inclusion of affected communities in decision-making.
The immediate result of the mission was a comprehensive report on AHI control efforts in Egypt. The
report stressed the impact of the changing epidemiology, as H5N1 flu evolved from distinct outbreaks to a
widespread, enzootic disease. Specific recommendations addressed strengthening the National Supreme
Committee of Avian and Human Influenza, and reinvigorating the national committees for animal health
and communication. FAO organized a workshop in February 2010 to revise the national strategy for
controlling HPAI. Using the recommendations of the joint-UN mission, the ministries of health, agriculture
and environment and their partner NGOs will work together to build sustainable, interdisciplinary
approaches to controlling endemic H5N1 influenza in Egypt.

Donor Coordination Contributes to Effective Response in West Bank and Gaza

Many families in West Bank and Gaza, especially the poor, depend on poultry as their most important
source of protein. In fact, almost 88 percent of total animal protein intake in Gaza is derived from poultry.
Any new major avian influenza outbreak in the near future, particularly in Gaza, could thus
disproportionately impact the poorest families.
The capacity of the Palestinian Authority to address the HPAI threat and to implement necessary
preventative measures has to date been limited. This has been further exacerbated by cuts in aid flows
from the international community in response to the recent transitions in the government. Despite the
difficult situation, regional and international organizations have been able to harmonize their work, and
have efficiently coordinated with the ministries of Health and Agriculture to minimize the impact of the HPAI
outbreaks and in preparing for possible future outbreaks of HPAI and a pandemic.
Through recent cooperation between WHO, UNICEF, WFP, FAO, UNDP and the World Bank, a UN
Interagency Framework for Avian Influenza and Pandemic Response in West Bank and Gaza was
developed, based on a multisectoral approach addressing food security, public health and veterinary
control issues, risk management, as well as restructuring plans for the poultry sector. In parallel, the Islamic
Development Bank sponsored the purchase of equipment for local veterinary laboratories. The Russian
Government also responded by compensating farmers affected by past outbreaks of HPAI. Moreover,
FAO and WHO have contributed from their own funds to assist the Palestinian Authority in carrying out
necessary capacity building and training activities.
Within this framework, the World Bank undertook a Rapid Assessment of the HPAI situation in the
Palestinian territories, along with extensive consultations with its UN partners. Subsequently a grant was
mobilized to minimize the risk of the spread of HPAI to humans and domestic poultry through improved
preparedness, control and response, and to mitigate the income loss of farmers through compensation.
Funding provided through the multidonor Avian and Human Influenza Facility has played a catalytic role
in maintaining good coordination within the donor community and providing an effective response to HPAI
preparedness and control in West Bank and Gaza.

Preparing for Detection and Prevention of Human H5N1 Avian Flu Infections in Iran
OIE has confirmed H5N1 in wild fowl, but to date no outbreaks in domestic poultry or notified human cases
of Avian Influenza have been reported in Iran. The government of Iran (GOI) has taken necessary
regulatory and institutional steps to form a national inter-ministerial HPAI Steering Committee headed by
the Iranian Veterinary Organization and a national HPAI contingency plan has been established and
simulated under field conditions.
Iran has a fairly developed and extensive Seasonal Human Influenza Surveillance system under the
oversight and coordination of the Centers for Disease Control. There is no active influenza-like-illness (ILI)
surveillance, and further investments are needed to train health workers in health posts, centers and
private doctors, as well as CDC staff who work at sub-national level, to increase their capabilities to detect
a possible index case and investigate a possible outbreak.
A well-equipped BSL-II level National Influenza Center (NIC) reference laboratory is based in Tehran. This
laboratory routinely analyzes samples and has proven to be reliable in its diagnostic capacity but can
currently only handle up to 100 samples per week in order to respond within 48 hours, and may not be
able to cope in case of an outbreak. The Iranian Ministry of Health has decided to implement a capacity
enhancement of the sentinel laboratories in the provinces and to upgrade the reference laboratory to bio-
safety level III in the event of an outbreak for virus isolation and culture.
As for case management, Iran has about 1,320 hospital beds for the treatment and case management of
infectious diseases. While these hospitals often have an intensive care unit, these are not accessible to
patients suffering from highly contagious infectious diseases, because none have isolation rooms with
negative pressure to contain contagion and contamination. Efforts are underway to map out all provincial
and central infectious diseases units, which are designated for patient referral and case management to
assess their needs in terms of medical equipment, consumables and training for patient isolation. A few
key units will be selected for infrastructure and equipment upgrade in case of a pandemic. On the other
hand, the country appears to have the necessary supplies of anti-virals for prophylactic use in healthcare
workers, suspected ILI cases and the high-risk population groups.
 In response to the threat to humans posed by the H5N1 virus, the World Bank’s Second Primary Health
Care & Nutrition Project was amended in December 2006 for financial assistance to the Iranian Ministry
of Health to upgrade its medical and laboratory facilities, train health care workers in surveillance and case
detection, and provide seed funding for related medical consumables and pharmaceuticals with a view to
strengthening its preparedness for a potential outbreak of H5N1 in humans or a possible pandemic.

Avian Influenza Prevention and Control in West Bank and Gaza
Proximity to outbreaks in neighboring countries, coupled with a large volume of bird migrations, places
West Bank and Gaza at a high risk. The first outbreak occurred in March 2006, affecting chickens and
ducks, and with the recent H5N1 outbreak in Israel, the probability of repeated occurrence of the virus
continues to be great. The Avian and Human Influenza Facility (AHIF), which receives contributions from
ten donors led by the European Commission, is providing assistance.
In September 2006 a US$ 3 million AHIF grant was approved, with the goal to minimize threats posed to
humans by avian influenza in domestic poultry, consistent with the priorities set out in the Palestinian
Authority’s 2005 National Plan for the Pandemic Influenza. This activity is being implemented by UNDP,
and its key objective is to achieve a minimum level of spread of HPAI to humans through better
preparedness, control, and response. The Grant was originally linked with a US$ 10 million World Bank-
financed project. However, this initiative had to be closed on March 31, 2009 due to long delays in start-
up and implementation difficulties.
After initial implementation and coordination delays that stemmed in large part from political instability,
ongoing security challenges and low technical capacity, the Grant Agreement was amended in November
2009 to include new activities, as well as to reflect changes in project activities which took place due to
evolving needs. These included: (a) the upgrading of a second veterinary laboratory in the West Bank to

                                                     82
replace the work which could not be carried out in Gaza, (b) small upgrading works for specific regional
veterinary laboratories and the equipping of other regional labs in the West Bank; (c) the inclusion of a
Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices survey; and (d) a new category for training and workshops for
information dissemination purposes to capture lessons.
Due to the changed approach, the grant has now laid the groundwork for an effective national approach
for dealing with the threat of HPAI in poultry and humans. Most of the planned grant activities have now
been completed, with US$2.6 million disbursed, and the project will likely reach its objectives. UNDP as
the implementing agency remains committed to achieving the grant’s objective by working closely with and
on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Health and collaborates with other UN agencies
(WHO and FAO) as needed. The closing date of the grant has been extended to September 30, 2010 to
allow for the planning and assessment of newly emerging needs, including in response to the changing
context of infectious diseases globally.

A National Multisectoral Task Force Fostered Commitment to Action in Yemen
Problem and Context. With 42 percent of the people living in poverty, Yemen is among the poorest
countries in the world. Poultry meat currently represents 65 percent of total meat consumption, with 33
percent produced from backyard chickens. A disruption of the poultry industry may threaten the livelihood
of hundreds of thousands of already impoverished livestock farmers in Yemen.
While there have not been any confirmed cases of HPAI in Yemen to date, the risk of H5N1 outbreaks
remains high. There are major threats of infection from both legal and illegal overland entry, from the
import of day-old chicks, rearing of hobby birds, and generally weak poultry farm biosecurity. Such threats
are all the more serious after Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region discovered HPAI outbreaks
in their territory. In addition, Yemen is located directly under two migratory bird flyways.
Approach and Activities. A multisectoral task force - the National High Committee for Avian Influenza -
chaired by the Minister of Health was established in 2005, and preparedness planning addressing the
most pressing needs was initiated. However, rapid avian influenza preparedness assessment for human
and animal health, conducted with the assistance of the World Bank, the World Health Organization
(WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Animal Health Organization
(OIE), in collaboration with the Government of Yemen, indicated that the country's AI preparedness and
response was being hampered by inadequate funding, and limited logistical and human resource
capacities. The assessment recommended the formulation of a multisectoral action plan with clear
objectives, activities, outputs, costing, and deliverables to respond to potential avian influenza outbreaks.
Consequently, the AHI Facility awarded the Government of Yemen a Grant for US $57,260 to finance
technical assistance. The aim was to ensure that a new Integrated National Action Plan for the Prevention
and Control of Avian and Human Influenza under preparation will meet internationally accepted norms and
capture the worldwide experience with AI to date. The chief approach adopted for the Plan’s preparation
was an emphasis on the multisectoral nature of the issue, namely on the need for cooperation between
the health, agricultural, education, finance, planning and law enforcement sectors, while also involving the
private sector and underscoring the importance of communications and a public awareness campaign.
Results. The completion of the Integrated National Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Avian
and Human Influenza was followed by a dissemination workshop in March 2008, which was jointly
organized by the Ministry of Health and Population and Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, and supported
from the AHI Facility Grant. The purpose of the workshop was to facilitate a more active engagement of
all relevant ministries, and secure a commitment to support and implement the Plan from responsible
authorities. Additionally, the workshop aimed to identify key development partners and donors that could
contribute – either financially or through technical assistance – to the implementation of the Plan.

SOUTH ASIA REGION CASE STUDIES

Below are selected case studies of GPAI interventions in the South Asia Region. These case studies are
intended to complement the country overviews and provide greater depth and detail regarding the
operations of the GPAI.

Communication Strategies in Afghanistan, Bhutan and Nepal

In collaboration with UNICEF, the awareness-raising campaign for avian influenza was launched across
the South Asia Region through various media and targeted training.
In Bhutan, the result of the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice (KAP) survey in September 2009 indicated
that the level of awareness about avian flu was overall high across various groups. Notably, 83 percent of
poultry farmers, one of the high-risk groups, were aware of the avian flu. Despite the absence of outbreaks
up to that time, Bhutan has been at high risk of the avian flu as it shares borders with Bangladesh and
India. Most recent outbreak in India occurred in early-2009 in West Bengal, which shares borders with
Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.
It is extremely important for preventing and controlling outbreaks that high-risk groups such as poultry
traders and farmers are well aware of avian flu. In Nepal, the awareness campaign through TV and radio
targeted high-risk districts at border areas. The two outbreaks were successfully contained, thanks to the
intensive campaign in high-risk areas. There is a need for a regional, cross-border approach to
communication. The World Bank therefore considered providing support for a trans-border workshop for
quarantine/security officers in Nepal, India and Bangladesh as well as trans-border simulation exercises.
Afghanistan experienced more than 20 outbreaks in early 2007. A comprehensive communication strategy
was prepared with UNICEF’s assistance. As the majority of poultry are kept in backyards and managed
by women, outreach to rural women is key. In the country where literacy rate for rural women is 11.2
percent, the project authorities have ensured women-to-women awareness raising. This was done by
training women trainers and delivering important messages through women’s Community Development
Councils (CDCs) under the auspices of the Community Driven Development (CDD) project and the
National Solidarity Project (NSP).

Strategic Planning to Tackle the Deeply Entrenched H5N1 Avian Flu Virus in Indonesia
Avian influenza in birds was first reported in Indonesia in 2003. By 2007, 31 out of 33 provinces in the
country confirmed cases of HPAI. The incidence varies within the country; however, HPAI is entrenched
in Java, Bali, Sumatra and South Sulawesi. Human cases continue to be reported since June 2005 with
93 fatalities from 115 confirmed cases as of December 18, 2007. Surveillance data and information on the
incidence of HPAI outbreaks are generally insufficient. Participatory Disease Surveillance (PDS) is
operating in 157/444 districts and 9 provinces. PDS teams have found that HPAI is entrenched in most
areas where they operate. However, it is recognized that HPAI is more sporadic in smaller, more dispersed
poultry populations.
The Government of Indonesia’s National Strategic Work Plan for the Progressive Control of HPAI in
Animals 2006 – 2008 has been developed with international organization technical assistance and
contains 9 key elements:
   Program management coordinated through central and regional management units and 35 local
    disease-control centers;
   Enhancement of HPAI control in animals through stamping-out and emergency vaccination, bio-
    security, quarantine, movement control and tracing;
   Surveillance and epidemiology including early detection, an effective national system for management
    of surveillance information, vaccination program monitoring; surveillance following recognition of a
    human case and surveillance of potential virus reservoirs;


                                                    91
   Improved laboratory services especially diagnostic services, vaccine production and quality
    assurance;
   Strengthening the legislative base for all industry sectors to report disease in a timely manner and
    strengthen the involvement of district and provincial veterinary services in HPAI control;
   Effective communications processes to ensure that all stakeholders are informed of their role and
    committed to the campaign;
   Research and development designed to provide information needed to more effectively implement the
    control program; and
   Restructuring of the poultry production processes and marketing systems to help reduce interspecies
    exposure. This will also include identifying the most effective points for intervention in a complex
    market chain whilst recognizing the potential to create negative impacts for vulnerable people.
Whilst there has been substantial progress made in establishing a supportive basis for HPAI surveillance
and control, it is evident that in order to achieve significant progress on the entrenched status of HPAI in
Indonesia, a broader strategy, supported by relevant investments, needs to be designed and implemented.
A concept paper has been developed to work in relation to the National Strategic Plan which sets out
elements of a phased, progressive control program designed to lead to the eventual elimination of HPAI
from the Indonesian archipelago, and a consultation process has been initiated with all strategic and
technical partners to advance this.

ASEAN’s Support to Regional Cooperation in for Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention
The members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN -- Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam – have been
affected by the threats of avian and human influenzas, with several countries experiencing severe
challenges from HPAI either directly or through exposure to risks from other countries in ASEAN and in
the region. A regional approach to these threats was warranted.
In recognition of the human, economic, social, and security threats posed by communicable diseases,
ASEAN Member States have worked over the past several years to implement integrated approaches in
strengthening surveillance and response to emerging infectious diseases with a focus on multisectoral
collaboration, information sharing and multicountry approaches.
ASEAN supports regional cooperation on pandemic preparedness between member states in a number
of ways. A Technical Working Group on Pandemic Preparedness and Response was set up as a
coordinating body to drive multisectoral cooperation in the region. This work is linked to a regional
Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response (2009).
Issues in the animal-human-environment interface are targeted specifically by the ASEAN Secretariat
Working Group on One Health, which coordinates various health-related initiatives of the ASEAN
Secretariat. For example, a project was developed to stockpile antivirals and personal protective
equipment, in the event of a pandemic.
Information sharing within the region is facilitated via the Emerging Infectious Disease (EID) Plus Three
Countries Program, supported by AusAID, which aims to enhance regional preparedness and capacity
through integrated approaches to prevention, surveillance and response to EIDs. A website
(www.aseanplus3-eid.info) provides a portal for news surveillance and platform for information exchange
across relevant sectors.
Other mechanisms for regional cooperation include multisectoral cross-border outbreak investigation,
exercise management training programs and coordination across laboratory networks through the ASEAN
Plus Three Partnership Laboratories.

Establishing ‘One Health Hubs’ in South Asia


South Asian countries are at high risk for the Avian and Human Influenza (AHI), as the H5N1 virus has
actively circulated in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. Since end-2003, there have been almost 500
outbreaks in animals in the region.

In collaboration with WHO, FAO, OIE and UNICEF, the World Bank and the multidonor AHI Facility (which
is funding by the European Commission and nine other donors) finance nine projects in South Asia at a
total cost of $ 92.6 million, which includes a new initiative, “Regional Training Program in Epidemiology
and Biosecurity.” Benefiting seven countries in the Region—Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka—the regional training program is financed by the AHI Facility and seeks to
(i) provide a total of 70 animal and human health specialists with on-line training at Master’s level in
epidemiology and (ii) establish “One Health” hubs or centers of excellence in epidemiology in the seven
countries by strengthening existing national epidemiology institutions. The Program is implemented by
Massey University in New Zealand.

The Regional Training Program is one attempt to support a mid- to long-term strategy to prevent and
manage AHI and other zoonoses by building local capacity and a regional network. The ongoing projects
have helped contain outbreaks in South Asia; however, countries are now faced with a need to shift from
emergency operations to mid- to long-term local capacity development in an effort to manage emerging
and re-emerging zoonoses. The Regional Training Program brings animal and human specialists together
with an emphasis on the interface, while providing the trainees with specialized courses. The 70 specialists
will play a key role in establishing and managing “One Health” hubs in their respective countries.

                GLOBAL SUPPORT TO COUNTRY PROGRAMS
NATIONAL HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH SYSTEMS ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND BRIDGES

Performance of veterinary and human public health systems is vital to health and economic development.
For infectious diseases, the strength of a public health system in any one country affects the health and
economic security of other countries. The defenses against contagion are only as strong as the weakest
link. Weak public health systems in developing countries not only harm the wellbeing of poor people and
economic development of those countries, but they also reduce welfare in other countries, including in
wealthy countries that have capable national public health systems.

This GPAI project was completed in April 2014 and provided transformative tools that will enable robust
assessments of all countries’ public health systems and thus more effective management of risks of
contagion and other public health threats. As is shown by every uncontrolled epidemic, such as the recent
Ebola epidemic, these investments have extraordinarily high human health benefits, while they also bring
high and lasting economic benefits. Indeed, according to Harvard University professor and former US
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers: "[veterinary and human public health systems are] probably the
single most important area for productive investment on behalf of mankind."

In the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), member countries are required to assess their national
core capacities for surveillance and response to public health events of international concern, and to
develop a plan of action to ensure the development of these capacities when needed. They have
committed to report their level of compliance with the IHR (2005) to the World Health Assembly on a yearly
basis. To facilitate this reporting, WHO has developed a Monitoring Framework and indicators of
performance for predefined core capacities and specific hazards. These include capacities to respond to
zoonosis and food safety events, and therefore the contribution of the animal public health sector is crucial
in the implementation of the IHR (2005).

The OIE’s well-developed systematic evaluation of the Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) with
regard to intergovernmental standards (initial PVS Evaluation) is on a voluntary basis; the process includes
quinquennial costed operational budgets based on integrating the PVS Evaluation findings with national
priorities (PVS Gap Analysis (PVS Costing Tool)); assistance with national Veterinary Legislation (PVS
Veterinary Legislation Support Program); review and improvement of the Veterinary Laboratory network
(PVS Pathway Laboratory mission and Laboratory Twinning projects); strengthening and harmonizing
Veterinary Education Establishments to align with corresponding OIE guidelines (Veterinary Education
Establishment Twinning); ensuring excellence of the veterinary profession in the private sector by setting
standards and establishing measures regarding education and licensing (Veterinary Statutory Body
Twinning); and, a consistent mechanism for the monitoring and evaluation of progress of all components
(regular PVS Evaluation Follow‐up missions).

The project table below highlights some accomplishments supported by the AHIF grant to WHO and OIE
within the GPAI. The main achievement was to develop and refine harmonized operational assessment
tools and a guide for implementation. The work was carried out by WHO and OIE, the leading international
organizations on human and animal health. Use of the tools that were developed will contribute to increase
capacity of countries to address priority diseases, including zoonoses, pandemic threats, and increasing
antimicrobial resistance. Use of the tools will also help build synergies among human and animal public
health systems. As of April 2014, the tools are available from OIE and WHO for use by all countries and
their partners.

    Component                                        Accomplishments
                     Thanks to this project, WHO developed several analytical tools to help
                     countries and WHO evaluate the gaps in national capacities hindering
                     compliance with the requirements of the IHR (2005); the Tools furthermore
                     identify ways and the costs to reduce the capacity gaps in a sustainable
                     manner. The specific tools and related activities were:
                      a. WHO’s costing tool prototype can cost the inputs associated with
                         Core Capacities in the IHR framework. The Tool’s architecture aligns with
                         the Check List of Indicators used for each of the Core Capacities in the IHR
                         Monitoring Framework. For each indicator, possible actions to achieve an
                         expected capacity and associated cost inputs were identified. This
                         approach helped align the costing tool with the OIE PVS Gap Analysis (PVS
                         Costing Tool). An excel‐supported prototype was developed with the
                         “Costs, Effectiveness, Expenditure & Priority Setting” Department in WHO.
                         This tool generates costs associated with the implementation of measures
                         to strengthen country compliance with IHR requirements. The WHO
                         Regional Offices, in coordination with WHO Headquarters, identified
                         countries where the tool has begun to be field tested.
                      b.Readjustment of the WHO assessment tool for IHR. A mapping of the
                         overlaps between the PVS Pathway and WHO IHR capacities Monitoring
                         Framework (IHR MF) resulted in a matrix linking the PVS Critical
                         Competencies and the IHR Core Capacities. Complementarities between
                         the indicators used in the two sectors were identified; this revealed that data
                         in PVS Evaluations can greatly facilitate the work of the IHR National Focal
Development of tools     Points. PVS Evaluation reports contain explicit data on the contribution of
    for the further      Veterinary Services to the Core Capacities defined in the IHR (2005).
     deployment          Responding to 98 out of the 256 questions in the IHR MF Questionnaire
          and            requires input from Veterinary Services; such input can be extracted from
  implementation of      36 out of the 47 PVS Critical Competencies. The new WHO‐OIE Handbook
 WHO International       for the assessment of capacities at the human animal interface provides
 Health Regulations      guidance on taking advantage of OIE PVS Pathway outcomes.
      (IHR, 2005)
                      c. Improvement of the WHO laboratory assessment tool. OIE and WHO
                         analyzed the OIE PVS Pathway Laboratory Tool and the WHO Laboratory
                         Assessment Tool, to determine their respective coverage, overlaps,
                         synergies, differences, and gaps. Adjustments then improved the tools.
                      d.Laboratory Quality Management System. WHO explored how the
                         Laboratory Quality Management System (LQMS) Tools could better
                         address the human‐animal health interface, engaging with veterinary
                         laboratory staff from Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Democratic Republic
                         of Congo, Republic of Congo, Sao Tome & Principe, and Cambodia as well
                         as from the Pacific region. Country professionals were very positive about
                         a cross‐sectoral approach for training in order to ‘speak the same
                         language’. The most relevant topics included: support for shipping and
                         testing of specimens, reagents and equipment management; personnel
                         management; facilities and safety; and standard operating procedures
                         writing and management. Training on biosecurity covered bio-risk
                         management for laboratory users and infectious substance shipping.
                      e. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) laboratory‐based surveillance. WHO
                         country offices jointly with national counterparts implemented small projects
                         to better understand AMR interactions between the animal and human
                         health sectors.
                      f. Workshops and trainings for WHO experts. These included sensitization
                         of Regional and National Focal Points for IHR to One Health and the
                         assessment tools and bridges being developed. Experts from Azerbaijan,

                         Bhutan, Cameroun, Cote d’Ivoire, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Madagascar,
                         Morocco, Philippines, Thailand, Tunisia, Uganda, and other countries
                         benefited. Moreover, two WHO experts attended the PVS Pathway
                         Laboratory Mission and Tools training and are now certified by the OIE for
                         conducting PVS Pathway Laboratory missions.
                       g.Participation of WHO experts in PVS Pathway missions. WHO experts
                         have participated in the following PVS Pathway missions to several
                         countries, bringing human public health perspectives and learning about
                         veterinary public health capacity assessments.
                       a. Refinement of OIE PVS Tools to evaluate the level of compliance of
                          Veterinary Services. Modifications have primarily concerned the
                          competencies for veterinary education, laboratory infrastructure, One
                          Health, food safety, and animal feed safety. The PVS Tool is based on the
                          OIE standards contained in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. More than
                          just a diagnostic tool, the PVS Evaluation helps countries’ to improve
                          management of responsibilities of all actors, in both the private and public
                          sectors (including other ministries and departments). A final result is a
                          culture that promotes and stimulates the national Veterinary Service,
                          inspiring it to improve in all 47 critical competencies until it reaches, when
                          appropriate, level 5 (full compliance with OIE standards). As of June 2014,
                          the OIE has received a total of 129 country requests for a PVS Evaluation
                          mission, of which 117 have already been implemented. As countries are
                          the sole owner of their development efforts and ambitions for the future, the
                          PVS Gap Analysis (PVS Costing Tool) facilitates the definition of a
                          country’s Veterinary Services’ objectives and priorities. The PVS Gap
                          Analysis mission also encourages the constructive engagement and
                          participation of private sector and consumer groups, among others.
                       b.Refinement of the specific pilot PVS One Health Tool and integration
                          into the OIE Manual for Assessors. In missions to Costa Rica, Kenya,
 Refinement of OIE
                          and the Philippines, there was collaboration with public health and wildlife
   Performance of
                          services and a hybrid capacity-building approach where the Veterinary
 Veterinary Services
                          Services themselves initiated identification of areas where collaboration
(PVS) Pathway Tools
                          and capacity building could improve performance. This experience was
                          shared with WHO and others, recommending that the One Health approach
                          should simultaneously enhance the existing PVS evaluation and offer
                          discussions that focus on One Health approaches. Conscious efforts
                          increased intersectoral collaboration by the Veterinary Services with other
                          partners, particularly the Competent Authorities of public health and wildlife
                          services, to achieve quality of performance of the Veterinary Services. In
                          the 6th Edition of the PVS Manual of the Assessor, Chapter 3.3 on One
                          Health highlights the Critical Competencies, which may require the
                          involvement of more than one Competent Authority in order to achieve
                          compliance with OIE standards. The results of a PVS Evaluation mission
                          can also contribute to a country’s understanding of its level of IHR (2005)
                          compliance and how the Veterinary Services can contribute to public health
                          outcomes, and therefore to a country’s IHR compliance.
                       c. Development and testing of the OIE PVS Manual and Tool for
                          Veterinary Laboratories. A PVS Pathway Laboratory Mission not only
                          determines the resources needed by the national veterinary laboratory
                          network, but also evaluates the pertinence of its structure and its viability.
                          A national laboratory network’s relationships with all other service providers
                          are analyzed. The PVS Pathway Laboratory Mission Manual and Tool has

   Component                                      Accomplishments
                         been finalized. To date, four pilot PVS Laboratory missions took place
                         (Laos, Libya, Tanzania, and Tunisia) and more are planned.
                      d.Training of PVS Pathway experts and staff from OIE and WHO on PVS
                         Pathway Tools. Achievements included a five-day course for 48 OIE-
                         certified PVS Pathway experts and a three-day course on laboratory
                         assessment missions for 16 participants (including 2 from WHO).
                      e. Missions to countries requesting support in the implementation of the
                         PVS Pathway. The project supported OIE’s PVS missions to fifteen
                         countries in all regions.
                      f. Participation of OIE experts in WHO IHR missions & vice versa. Five
                         WHO experts joined OIE’s PVS missions, and more opportunities are
                         planned.
                      g.Workshop with the World Bank to explore how to improve the use of
                         PVS Pathway mission outputs for World Bank operations. This took
                         place in Washington, DC in February 2014.
                      The two standard-setting organizations jointly prepared The WHO‐OIE
                      Manual ‘Good governance at the human‐animal interface: Bridging WHO and
                      OIE Tools for the assessment of national capacities’ (2014).
                      Part I introduces the concepts of governance and of good governance. It
                      provides details on the global legal basis for human and animal disease
                      notification and intergovernmental standards. It reviews experiences with
                      coordinated prevention of diseases at the human‐animal interface, in
                      particular diseases with high public health and animal health impacts.
                      Part II reviews the support available in the WHO and the OIE to assist their
 Operational Manual   members, and the two sectors’ overlapping complementarities. It aims to
on good governance    clarify the benefits that countries and others can obtain from using the tools,
of human and animal   how the tools complement and reinforce each other, and how their use
   health services    benefits the other sector as well. It highlights the cross‐sectoral activities and
                      cooperation areas for human and animal health services to effectively
                      address key diseases and issues causing negative impacts on public health.
                      Comprehensive information on the WHO IHR Monitoring Framework and the
                      OIE PVS Pathway makes clear their synergies. The outcomes of two national
                      workshops (in Azerbaijan and Thailand), on the tools and bridges, are
                      presented and the approach will be deployed by WHO and OIE going forward.

ART TO RAISE AWARENESS OF PANDEMIC RISK

In 2006 the World Bank received a generous gift of nine
paintings in gold leaf on canvas: the Avian Flu Series by
Mexican artist Gerardo Bravo Garcia. The artist contacted
senior management of the World Bank and offered to
donate the artwork to the World Bank Art Collection. He felt
that the World Bank was best-placed to make the world
safer in the face of the pandemic threat. He was
concerned about pandemic risk and the catastrophe that a
pandemic could cause for the world because developing
countries would be hardest-hit.

According to the World Bank's Art Curator, "the visual and
emotional impact that Mr. Bravo's work has on staff is
remarkable", and "the use of artworks to talk about
complex topics has been very successful in the past. We
hope we will be able to educate people on a more pro-
active preventive behavior on avian flu with the
presentation of Mr. Bravo's series.”3

The UN System Influenza Coordinator and the World Bank
used the images from these nine paintings on the covers
of all global progress reports for five ministerial
conferences on avian and pandemic influenza in 2006-10,
as well as on some GPAI project documents.

The paintings were exhibited in prominent places in the
World Bank buildings in Washington, DC for several years.
However, lately the Art Curator has struggled to find space
for the paintings that communicate the ever-present
pandemic risk. Even the World Bank’s Executive Directors'
offices complained that they do not like to look at reminders
of pandemic risk when walking down their hallway. It's
unpleasant and scary. The paintings thus stayed most of
the time in storage since 2009.

Art with a message about the need to prevent a
catastrophic disaster may therefore remain hidden from
view, unable to help communicate a message about a real
threat. Risk awareness is, however, the necessary first step
toward improved risk management. Absence of
communications about a top global catastrophic risk is
possible even in the main global development institution
that has a strong interest in reducing pandemic risk.
Reduction of pandemic risk is a necessary precondition to
sustained achievement of the goals of elimination of
extreme poverty and boosting of shared prosperity. It also
enhances the capacity of World Bank borrowers to repay
their loans.

This report reviews some of the accomplishments of the Global Program for Avian Influenza Control and
Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI). This multisectoral program comprised 72
projects in 60 developing countries in all regions and received $1.3 billion in financing from the World
Bank. This support for GPAI projects was one of the World Bank’s contributions to a coordinated global
response to the threats of avian and pandemic influenzas, which benefited from financing of $4 billion
from 35 donors in 2006-2013. Thanks to this support, developing countries strengthened their capacity for
early and effective disease control, bringing substantial public health and economic benefits to the
countries and to the world. According to Harvard University professor and former US Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers, "[veterinary and human public health systems are] probably the single most
important area for productive investment on behalf of mankind." Indeed, circulation of the highly
pathogenic avian flu virus was reduced, helping to lessen the likelihood of onset of a pandemic.
Moreover, the projects improved public health systems for reducing locally-relevant health threats. The
report presents a brief background on the global program and cross-country accomplishments and then
highlights accomplishments for each project, by region.
