I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Kosovo perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Kosovo
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Kosovo
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From May to June 2016, 240 stakeholders of the WBG in Kosovo were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/
contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments; bilateral/
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/
private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 105 stakeholders participated in
the survey (44% response rate).
Respondents received and returned the questionnaires via post or courier. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Kosovo; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Kosovo; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate was 50%, N=101). As a rule, the COS data are weighted for
year comparisons in order to reach the same stakeholder composition in two fiscal years.
However, in the case of Kosovo, due to the small number of respondents in the FY’13 and
FY’16 Country Surveys and different stakeholder composition in the samples, weighting would
have been statistically unsound. Therefore, only basic comparisons of the unweighted data from
the FY’13 and FY’16 Country Surveys are presented in the report and should be considered
provisional. For the FY’13 and FY’16 stakeholder breakdown and year comparison results,
please see appendix D (page 94).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister were
       combined with respondents from the office of a minister; respondents from NGOs/
       community based organizations and youth groups were combined in the “CSO” category;
       and the few respondents from independent government institutions, local governments,
       academia/research institutes/think tanks, and the media were included in the “Other”
       category. There were no respondents from private foundations, financial sector/private
       banks, trade unions, faith-based groups, and the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Locations
     Note: Because of the small number of respondents from areas other than Pristina,
      analyses comparing geographic locations would not be statistically reliable and,
      therefore, were not conducted.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
          Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and the FY’13 Country
           Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (mean familiarity
           rating in FY’16 = 6.7; mean familiarity rating in FY’13 = 6.6).1
          Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, moderately
           correlated with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Kosovo, the extent to
           which the WBG plays a relevant role in development in Kosovo, and the extent to which
           the WBG contributes to the country’s development results.

IV. General Issues Facing Kosovo
Headed in the Right Direction
      Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, respondents from the Office of the
       President/Prime Minister/Minister were significantly more likely to indicate that Kosovo
       is headed in the right direction, whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies
       and CSOs were least positive about the prospect of Kosovo.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Kosovo, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty one specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Kosovo. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at gender equity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at law and justice; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Kosovo, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The area determined to be key driver from these
       analyses was:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at law and justice;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at transport; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at gender equity.

Appendix D: Responses to Selected Questions by Year5
Comparing responses across Country Opinion Surveys (COS) reflect changes in attitudes over time, but also
changes in respondent samples and changes to the survey instrument itself. To reduce the influence of the latter
factor, only those questions with similar response scales/options were analyzed. As a rule, the COS data are
weighted for year comparisons in order to reach the same stakeholder composition in two fiscal years.
However, in the case of Kosovo, due to the small number of respondents in the FY’13 COS ( 101 respondents) and
the FY’16 COS (105 respondents) and different stakeholder composition in the samples (see the table below),
weighting would have been statistically unsound. Therefore, only basic comparisons of the unweighted data
from the FY’13 and FY’16 Country Surveys are presented and s hould be considered provisional.

 population. Improvement in the Shared Prosperity Indicator requires growth and well-being of the less
 well-off. When thinking about the idea of “shared prosperity” in your country, which of the following
 TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Kosovo? (Choose no more than TWO)
  1    Consistent economic growth
  2    More reliable social safety net
  3    Greater access to micro-finance for the poor
  4    Greater voice and participation for citizens to help ensure greater accountability
  5    Greater access to health and nutrition for citizens
  6    Better entrepreneurial opportunities (i.e., to start small and medium sized businesses)
  7    A growing middle class
  8    Better opportunity for the poor who live in rural areas
  9    Better opportunity for the poor who live in urban areas
  10   Better employment opportunities for young people
  11   Better employment opportunities for women
  12   Greater equity of fiscal policy
