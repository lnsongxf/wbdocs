       Box 2: Wage Concepts and Definitions

       According to the ILO Protection of Wages Convention No. 95 (1949), the term ‘wages’ means remuneration or earnings,
       however designated or calculated, capable of being expressed in terms of money, and fixed by mutual agreement or
       by national laws or regulations, which are payable in virtue of a written or unwritten contract of employment by an
       employer to an employed person for work done or to be done or for services rendered or to be rendered.

       The minimum wage is defined as “the minimum amount of remuneration that an employer is required to pay wage earn-
       ers for the work performed during a given period, which cannot be reduced by collective agreement or an individual
       contract.”38 Minimum wages fixed by collective agreements and made binding by public authorities are included in this
       definition.

       The Council of Europe’s Social Charter provides for the right to ‘a fair remuneration’, referring to ‘a remuneration such as
       will give the workers and their families a decent standard of living’. The Social Charter defines the decency threshold as
       60 percent of net national average wage (that is, after deduction of taxes and social security contributions).39

       The provision of a living wage should allow the workers and their families to lead a simple but decent life considered
       acceptable by society, in light of its level of development, among other things, to live above the poverty line and partici-
       pate in social and cultural life.40

       The concept of fair wages encompasses 12 dimensions. In particular, wages must be paid regularly and in full to the
       workers; they must comply with the minimum wage regulations; they should not require excessive working hours; and
       they must lead to a balanced wage structure, free of discrimination.41

This report reviews international experiences and presents options for the design
of four types of labor regulations: employment contracts, minimum wages,
dismissal procedures, as well as severance pay and unemployment beneﬁts. In
each case, it discusses the market failures that these regulations aim to address
and suggests options to better protect workers while preserving incentives to
create good jobs. The main message from the report is that labor regulations are
important to protect workers from abuse and exploitation and allow them to
better manage labor market risks. The report also shows that it is possible to
establish a balance between workers’ protection and ﬂexibility in the management
of human resources at the ﬁrm level, avoiding both over- or under-regulation.
Between these two extremes, there is a ‘plateau’ where labor regulations can o er
adequate protection to workers, and contribute to shared prosperity without
imposing unreasonable costs on ﬁrms.

This report reﬂects a shared vision between the ILO and the World Bank on
policies that traditionally have been controversial. This has been possible thanks to
the commitment of both institutions to focus on the lessons derived from rigorous
research and international experiences.
