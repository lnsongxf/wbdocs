This 2016 World Bank GRI Index provides an overview of sustainability considerations within the World Bank’s lending and analytical services as well
as its corporate activities. This index of sustainability indicators has been prepared in accordance with the internationally recognized standard for
sustainability reporting Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines (https://www.globalreporting.org) and complies with the “core option.” The World
Bank aims to be comprehensive in its reporting and thus the Index includes indicators from GRI's Financial Sector Supplement.
The GRI Index covers activities from fiscal 2016, July 1, 2015, through June 30, 2016.
About the World Bank Group
The World Bank Group plays a key role in the global effort to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. It consists of five institutions: the
World Bank, which includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA);
the International Finance Corporation (IFC); the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA); and the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID). Working together in more than 130 countries, these institutions provide financing, advice, and other solutions that enable
countries to address the most urgent challenges of development.
The GRI Index addresses the activities of the World Bank. Except for the eligibility of support and terms of lending to member countries, IBRD and
IDA are tightly integrated and work as a single unit. Certain activities span across the World Bank Group and are therefore cited as such in the content.

DEFINING THE REPORT
Methodology for Determining Materiality
The topics deemed relevant for disclosure in the GRI Index were determined by assessing: (1) the potential impact on the Bank’s business and (2)
the sustainability impacts from its operations.
The business case was determined based on three key categories: (1) potential reputational risks to the organization (based on the reputational heat
map), (2) the importance to stakeholders, and (3) the linkages with the Bank’s mission/goals.
In addition to understanding the business case and stakeholder concerns, equal weight
was given to the sustainability impact of the Bank’s business. After assessing the various     The Natural Step framework, which complements the

Impacts external to the organization [“operational boundary”]
Indirect impacts occur in member countries as a result of World Bank lending and analytical services and may not be directly controlled by the Bank’s
management. Impacts stemming from the World Bank’s work with clients are specified as “operational impacts.”
Impacts internal to the organization [“corporate boundary”]
“Corporate boundary” refers to the impact from activities over which it has direct control, such as operating World Bank facilities and managing staff
members.
Operational impact
The World Bank’s most pertinent sustainability impacts from financial and technical services to clients can be summarized in the following GRI-related
aspects:
1. Economic Performance – Because creating and distributing economic value is part of the mission of eliminating extreme poverty, shareholders
   and investors care about the sustainable economic performance of the institution.
2. Indirect Economic Impacts – These impacts are an essential aspect of the Bank’s goal of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity.
3. Biodiversity – Through lending and grant support to client countries, the World Bank Group is one of the largest international funding sources for
   biodiversity worldwide.

                                                                                                                                                  2
4. Human Rights / Child Labor / Indigenous Rights – The World Bank promotes human rights through its projects, for example, improving poor
   people’s access to health, education, food, and water; promoting the participation of Indigenous Peoples in decision making, strengthening the
   accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens; supporting justice reform; and fighting corruption. In addition, civil society actively
   followed the World Bank’s process of updating its safeguard policies, concluded in fiscal 2016.
5. Local Communities – The World Bank recognizes that CDD approaches and actions are important elements of an effective poverty reduction
   and sustainable development strategy.
6. Anti-corruption – Critical to the World Bank’s mission to alleviate extreme poverty is a well-functioning public sector that delivers quality public
   services consistent with citizen preferences and fosters private, market-led growth while managing its fiscal resources in a prudent manner.
   Opinion leaders in the Bank’s client countries listed anti-corruption as one of their development priorities.
7. Grievance Mechanisms (regarding impacts on people and the environment) – Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are crucial for managing
   risk in the Bank’s portfolio. By offering a channel for citizens to express concerns, comments, and complaints, GRMs create opportunities t o
   resolve disputes before they escalate. GRMs can help the Bank and member countries improve project outcomes, prioritize supervision, identify
   systemic issues, and promote accountability. “Percent of resolved registered grievances” is now a key performance indicator f or the World Bank
   (see the Corporate Scorecard).
8. Product Portfolio and Audit Aspects from the Financial Sector Supplement – World Bank stakeholders look to the Bank to ensure that policies and
   procedures are in place to assess and screen environmental and social risks in its lending portfolio.
Corporate impact
The most material aspects of the Bank’s internal operations include the following:
1. Staff are the World Bank’s greatest asset. They bring a wide range of perspectives to bear on poverty-reduction issues and emerging development
   challenges, and are critical to the effectiveness of the Bank’s core operational and knowledge services. Staff-related indicators are pulled from the
   following GRI aspect categories: economic performance, market presence, employment, occupational health and safety, training and education,
   diversity and equal opportunity, labor practices grievance mechanisms, and nondiscrimination.
2. The Bank recognizes that reducing its own corporate environmental impacts is in line with the institutional mission to reduce poverty, as
   environmental degradation affects the world’s poor disproportionately. Increasing the efficiency of how the organization runs its business—through
   facility-level and staff-behavior changes—reduces natural-resource waste and decreases the cost of day-to-day operations. Key aspects related
   to the Bank’s environmental footprint include: energy, emissions, effluents and waste, and procurement practices (including s upplier environmental
   assessment, supplier assessment for impacts on society, and supplier human rights assessment).

                              The work of the World Bank is anchored in its goals: to end extreme poverty—reducing the share of the global
                              population living in extreme poverty to 3 percent by the year 2030—and to promote shared prosperity—
                              increasing the income of the bottom 40 percent of the population. Both of these goals must be met in a
                              sustainable manner.
                              The World Bank Group Strategy, released in 2013, discusses the significant areas in which the World Bank
                              makes environmental, social, and economic impacts, as well as the associated challenges and opportunities
                              along the path toward ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The strategy
                              combines the strength of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International
                              Development Association (IDA)—collectively known as the World Bank—the International Finance Corporation
                              (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The strategy places the institutions in a
       Description of key
                              position to work with the public and private sectors in partnership in order to achieve the twin goals sustainably.

                              Opportunities and Challenges in the Global Operating Environment
       opportunities
                              Low interest rates, potential financial market dislocations, weak commodity prices, the slowing of growth in key
                              countries and the risks of wider economic slowdown, and geopolitical tensions and political uncertainties have
                              created a challenging operating environment for the World Bank. These challenges affect the Bank’s client
                              countries as well, many of which are oil or commodity exporters facing fiscal pressures. Several client countries
                              also face reduced trade, capital outflows, and potential turbulence in the event of policy normalization in
                              developed economies. All countries need to sustain reforms for long-term structural growth and employment
                              creation.
                              The impact on the World Bank is felt mainly through increased demand for long-term structural support from a
                              wide range of client countries. The Bank seeks to support all clients’ developmental needs in line with strategic
                              priorities while prudently managing its capital and funding costs. It also continues to monitor operational risks,

                                including the growing threat of data and information security breaches and external events that can affect its
                                business continuity and the physical security of its staff.
                                As the world’s leading multilateral development institution, the World Bank continues to innovate and adapt to
                                meet the needs of individual countries, but also to address the needs of global public goods. Climate change,
                                pandemics, and forced displacement are among the high priorities. To address them and other challenges, the
                                Bank is developing innovative forms of financing in partnership with the public and private sectors.
                                The emergence of new multilateral development institutions creates both opportunities and challenges for
                                creative partnerships, and requires fresh thinking about the Bank’s financial structure. The “Forward Look,” an
                                internal strategic exercise launched earlier this year to deliberate the medium- to long-term future of the
                                institution, is examining demand for the Bank’s services and the ways the institution manages its financial
                                capacity across the World Bank Group to meet these demands, with a focus on optimal leverage and
                                mobilization.

                                and supporting development. IBRD is governed by and works with its 189 member countries to achieve
                                equitable and sustainable economic growth in their national economies, and to find solutions to pressing
                                regional and global problems in economic development and other important areas, such as environmental
                                sustainability. IDA works with its 173 member countries to reduce poverty by providing loans (called “credits”)

                               In fiscal 2016, the World Bank employed 11,421 staff and 4,757 full-time-equivalent (FTE) short-term
                               consultants and temporaries who worked in Washington, DC, and in 136 countries worldwide.
                               World Bank lending commitments for development support totaled $45.9 billion in fiscal 2016.
                               New lending commitments by IBRD totaled $29.7 billion for 118 operations in fiscal 2016, higher than fiscal
                               2015’s $23.5 billion. As of June 30, 2016, net commitments in IBRD's active portfolio stood at $109.9 billion.
                               IBRD also offers financial products that allow clients to efficiently fund their development programs and
                               manage risks related to currency, interest rates, commodity prices, and natural disasters. In fiscal 2015, the
                               Bank’s Treasury executed US dollar equivalent (USDeq) 1.1 billion in hedging transactions on behalf of
                               member countries, including USDeq 349 million in interest rate conversions and USDeq 790 million in currency
                               conversions, to assist borrowers in managing interest rate and currency risks over the life of their IBRD loans.
G4-9   Scale of organization   In addition, the Bank’s Treasury executed swap transactions totaling USDeq 12.5 billion to manage the risks of
                               IBRD’s balance sheet and USDeq 1.5 billion to manage the risks of IDA’s balance sheet.
                               IDA commitments amounted to $16.2 billion for 177 operations in fiscal 2016, including $14.4 billion in credits,
                               $1.3 billion in grants, and $500 million in guarantees. As of June 30, 2016, net commitments in IDA’s active
                               portfolio stood at $97 billion. IDA is financed largely by contributions from partner governments. Additional
                               financing comes from transfers from IBRD’s net income, grants from the International Finance Corporation
                               (IFC), and borrowers’ repayments of earlier IDA credits. The IDA17 Replenishment, which covers fiscal 2015–
                               17, total resources amount to 37.7 billion in Special Drawing Rights (equivalent to $56.8 billion).

                                 The World Bank’s workforce is composed of 11,421 individuals of more than 170 nationalities—about 6,300 on
                                 permanent contracts, 5,100 on fixed-term (including special assignments and term consultant/ temporary
                                 contracts), and 4,757 FTE short-term consultants and temporaries. The richness of the backgrounds and
                                 experience of Bank staff continues to be a hallmark of the products and services that clients seek.
                                 There has been a 4.3 percent decrease in the number of full-time employees (those on permanent, fixed-term,
                                 special assignments, and extended-term consultant/temporary contracts) since fiscal 2015. The Bank also
                                 employed about 4,757 FTE short-term consultants in fiscal 2016, a 12 percent increase over FTE short-term
                                 consultants employed in 2015. These self-employed workers make up about 29 percent of the Bank’s
                                 workforce.
                                 The World Bank has a significant global footprint, with 41 percent of full-time staff now working outside the US.
                                 Eighty-four percent of the staff and 2 percent of managers at the director level or above (grade GI+) located in
                                 non-US offices were locally hired.

                                As a development institute, the World Bank does not have a complex corporate supply chain. For those areas
                                where the Bank has a high-value or high-risk (strategic) spend, we work through a category management
                                process that uses market research and industry best practices to manage the supply chain. This allows us to
                                develop strategies and measurable objectives around sustainability that are included and measured through
                                the contract management process. An example of a commodity for which category management is used is the
                                Bank's travel expenditure. Corporate Procurement also works closely with clients to reinforce sustainability
                                options, such as encouraging the inclusion of sustainable building certification criteria in construction and
        The organization’s      renovation projects led by corporate real estate.
G4-12
        supply chain
                                The materials the Bank uses regularly to carry out its internal business include office supplies and electronics,
                                and we rely heavily on transportation services to ensure we interact with clients on the ground. An elevated
                                expectation from donors and the public to demonstrate effectiveness, value for money, and efficiency in
                                delivery has resulted in Procurement’s taking the lead to manage corporate contracts for goods and services
                                globally at optimal quality and minimal total cost of ownership.

                                       Paris COP21.
                                      At the World Bank Group annual Foundations Advisory Council meeting, global foundation presidents
                                       indicated their support for a newly formed alliance between the Bank Group and UNICEF to advance
                                       programmatic interventions and global advocacy efforts for early childhood development.

                                   The topics deemed relevant for disclosure were identified by assessing annual corporate priorities outlined by
                                   the institution’s Boards and President, considering stakeholder input, as well as ascertaining sustainability
                                   impacts of carrying out the mission and vision. Stakeholder feedback is gained through three key channels: the
                                   Country Opinion Survey Program, civil society feedback, and queries from investor research groups.
        The process for            To determine if a GRI aspect is material for the World Bank to report on, an assessment is carried out based on
        defining the report        the potential impacts on the Bank’s business, and sustainability impacts stemming from its business. The
        content and the Aspect     business-case category evaluates potential reputational risks to the organization, the importance to
        Boundaries; how the        stakeholders (based on the above sources), and the linkages with the Bank’s mission and goals. The

        Reporting Principles       or destructive processes; and the extent to which people’s ability to meet their needs are undermined. To
        for Defining Report        ensure representation of sustainable development, an additional criterion was added to give preference for
        Content                    impact on the local economy.
                                   The Principles for Defining Report Content have been applied to identify, prioritize, and validate the information
                                   to be disclosed by considering the World Bank’s activities, impacts, and the substantive expectations and
                                   interests of its stakeholders. Each criterion above is given a point and a threshold is set to prioritize GRI
                                   aspects to include in the report.

                                  As a global citizen and a global employer, the World Bank consults and collaborates with thousands of
                                  stakeholders throughout the world. The Bank groups the stakeholders into two main categories: internal and
        Stakeholder groups        external.
G4-24   engaged by the            Internal stakeholders include Bank owners (shareholder governments) and Bank employees (staff).
        organization              External stakeholders include civil society; faith-based organizations; academic; foundations; parliamentarians;
                                  the private sector (including socially responsible investors); partnering agencies; and international, national,
                                  and local media as well as citizens impacted by projects and beneficiaries.
                                  In the context of World Bank-supported activities, stakeholders are considered those who are affected, whether
                                  positively or negatively, by a proposed intervention. Who the stakeholders are for any given project or issue
        The basis for

2. Employees             Staff are engaged in institutional campaigns to garner support for the twin
                         goals. In fiscal 2016, the End Poverty campaign reached out to staff through
                         intranet communications, internal events, social media messages, and
                         promotional materials. A series of internally broadcast town halls with
                         leadership throughout the course of fiscal 2016 allowed staff to engage in
                         dialogue with management on issues and concerns related to human resource
                         policy, strategic directions, the operational model, and more.
                         Annual staff surveys are used to engage employees by giving them the
                         opportunity to contribute their opinions. In May 2016, a World Bank Group
                         Employee Engagement Survey was conducted to measure staff's views on a
                         variety of key areas—from leadership to career development to the work
                         environment.
                         Staff are also engaged through the Community Connections Campaign. Each
                         year, the CCC raises millions of dollars in staff donations and World Bank
                         Group 100 percent matching to support nonprofit organizations that work
                         domestically and globally to combat poverty and uplift communities.

3. Civil Society (CSO)   The World Bank engages CSOs regularly at the global, regional, and local
                         level. We share information, solicit input on policy reform, consult with them on
                         our strategy, collaborate with them on Bank-financed projects, and forge
                         partnerships to further our dual goals.
                         Consultations with civil society on policy reforms have become an important
                         component of our engagement with CSOs. In the most extensive CSO
                         communications effort in World Bank history, the review of the environmental
                         and social safeguards, CSOs from 93 countries were consulted between
                         August 2015 and March 2016.
                         The Bank’s internal Civil Society Team hosts a monthly update call with more
                         than 500 CSOs invited, and distributes a monthly CSO eNewsletter, which
                         reaches more than 7,000 subscribers. In fiscal 2016, the team kicked off an
                         enhanced engagement approach with civil society in collaboration with the
                         Africa region, which included a one-day workshop of policy dialogue, training,
                         and a site visit to a World Bank-financed project.
                         Twice a year, during the Annual and Spring Meetings, the World Bank Group
                         hosts the Civil Society Policy Forum that convenes more than 600 civil society

                                                                                                  17
representatives from around the world to deliberate on priority development
issues with a broad group of stakeholders. Forty-plus dialogue sessions are
held, organized primarily by CSOs in concert with the Bank.
The World Bank also interacts with CSOs on reports such as the annual World
Development Report (WDR) and evaluations conducted by the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG). In addition, it the Bank regularly seeks input and
feedback from CSOs on diverse topics, from the new gender strategy to
disclosure of information on public–private partnerships, from grievance
redress mechanisms to IDA.
At the country level, the World Bank consults with a broad spectrum of CSOs
on the System Country Diagnostic, the Country Partnership Framework, sector
studies, and individual Bank-funded development projects. Often these
interactions involve multiple stakeholders and CSOs, governments,
businesses, and donor agencies.
With the introduction of the Citizens Engagement Strategic Framework, the
Bank has committed to 100 percent beneficiary feedback by 2018, for which
the views of civil society are solicited to inform impact assessments and future
development planning. The framework seeks to mainstream citizen
engagement in World Bank-supported policies, programs, projects, and
advisory services and analytics to improve their development results and within
the scope of these operations, contribute to building sustainable national
systems for citizen engagement with governments and the private sector.
As of April 2016, 86 percent of World Bank projects included beneficiary
feedback indicators and 89 percent included citizen engagement.
To further support development results and reach the Bank goals of ending
extreme poverty and fostering shared prosperity, the Global Partnership for
Social Accountability (GPSA) encourages civil society and governments to
work together to solve critical governance challenges in developing countries.
To achieve this objective, the GPSA provides strategic and sustained support
to CSOs’ social accountability initiatives.

http://www.worldbank.org/civilsociety, and for more information on the GPSA,

4. Opinion Leaders        The Country Opinion Survey (COS) Program systematically assesses and
                          tracks the views of external opinion leaders across client countries. The World
                          Bank Group has collected thousands of opinions in this mandated program
                          since its inception, in fiscal 2012. Each client country is surveyed once every
                          three years; each year, about 40 to 45 countries are included. In this manner,
                          over a three-year cycle, the COS Program obtains feedback from stakeholders
                          in nearly all client countries. No other multilateral organization engages in a
                          feedback mechanism of such breadth and depth.
                          For more information, see http://countrysurveys.worldbank.org/.

5. Environmental,         Formal and informal engagements are used to work better with the ESG
   social, governance     investor community.
   (ESG) Investor         Each ESG research firm requests updates from the World Bank based on a
   Community              proprietary list of questions. These questions are used as part of the materiality
                          exercise for the GRI Index. The Bank provides responses to the requests
                          regularly.
                          Ad hoc questions about the environmental, social, and governance issues
                          noted under ESG research firms, but prompted by news reports, are
                          addressed immediately. In addition to providing links to relevant websites, such
                          as the pertinent consultations website, the inquiring investors are connected to
                          key staff to address concerns about the specific topic.
6. Partnering agencies    The World Bank works with other international institutions and donors to
                          improve the coordination of aid policies and practices in countries at the
                          regional and global levels. Consultation methods and formats vary depending
                          on the scope of the Bank’s proposed engagement.
                          For more information, see http://www.worldbank.org/partners.
7. Local, national, and   Regularly, the World Bank approaches media to cover its major report
   international media    launches, corporate priority campaigns, and messages, including events
                          involving the President. At key opportunities, like the Annual and Spring
                          Meetings, the Bank proactively drives the primary messages of the institution,
                          such as including its commitment to the twin goals of ending extreme poverty
                          by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity. The Bank approaches traditional
                          media outlets (via interviews and op-eds) and actively uses social media to

                                                              promote issues that need to be addressed to achieve those goals, such as
                                                              major reports on climate change. It also responds to all media queries and
                                                              interview requests to help the media better understand the Bank and what it
                                                              does. In addition, the Bank’s reputation is managed by working with reporters
                                                              to clarify Bank priorities and activities, providing them with institution views so

                                                              Press releases, speeches, transcripts, and feature stories from the Bank can

                                                              The key priority in fiscal year 2016 was the continued promotion and
                                                              implementation of the World Bank goals. This included outreach to key
                                                              audiences through mechanisms such as press releases, op-eds, report
                                                              launches, and other stakeholder engagement about activities to achieve these
                                                              goals. Significant communications efforts were also directed toward the Bank’s
                                                              enhanced efforts in combating specific issues, such as the global issues of
                                                              forced displacement, pandemics, and climate change, while our issuance and

                                       and very effective at collaborating with government and donors. Views are less positive about how the
                                       Bank Group collaborates with groups outside of government, including the private sector and civil

                                   5. Investor community: ESG research firms request information on environmental issues (such as overall
                                      project lending strategy, impacts made, measurement of greenhouse gas (GHG) from projects,
                                      corporate responsibility); social topics (including internal human resources data, human rights policies

                                    The Office of Ethics and Business Conduct (EBC) enables staff members (both past and present) to seek
                                    ethics-related advice. Employees, business partners, and other stakeholders are informed of EBC’s advisory

                                    The Ethics Helpline is an email service account (ethics_helpline@worldbank.org) accessible to staff and
                                    advertised on the external website. Staff members also can seek advice directly from EBC staff during office
                                    hours or arrange to speak with advisory team members at a convenient time. Most advisory services are
                                    provided in English, which is the working language of the organization. Staff members can also contact the
                                    Ethics Helpline by phone (800-261-7497) 24/7. This line is administered in multiple languages by an outside

         The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world.
         The World Bank’s lending is aimed at two different groups of countries: IBRD strives to reduce poverty in middle -income and credit-worthy
         poorer countries through loans, guarantees, risk-management products, and analytical and advisory services. Its companion organization,
         IDA, offers below-market-rate financing to the world’s 78 poorest countries, primarily through credits and grants. IBRD funds itself through
         high-quality bonds offered in the international capital markets. IDA’s funding is predominantly from contributions by donor countries,
G4-DMA
         including OECD countries and, increasingly, middle-income nations.
         The World Bank Corporate Scorecard is designed to provide a snapshot of the Bank’s overall performance in the context of development
         results. It facilitates strategic dialogue between management and the Board on progress made and areas that need attention. Aspects of
         financial strength are measured under the Scorecard’s Tier III, which reviews the overall success of Bank activities in achieving
         development goals and examines the effectiveness of Bank operations, including the performance of its lending portfolio.

                                  methodology and varies from year to year in response to changes in the plan’s financial
         organization’s defined
G4-EC3                            position. Participants of the gross plan (closed plan) contribute 7 percent of the              Full
         benefit plan
                                  pensionable gross salary. Participants of the net plan (open to new entrants) contribute 5
         obligations
                                  percent of their net salary to the mandatory cash balance component. Participants of the
                                  net plan may choose to contribute up to an additional 6 percent of their net salary to the
                                  cash balance.
                                  As of June 30, 2016, the value of accrued pension liabilities for IBRD/IDA was $18
                                  billion, supported by assets of $15.2 billion held in a trust. The funded ratio (assets over
                                  liabilities) was 84 percent.
                                  Assets are evaluated at their fair value, and liabilities are measured as the Projected
                                  Benefit Obligation, discounted with high-quality corporate bonds rates. The two amounts
                                  are estimated in full compliance with the US accounting standards (ASC 715).
                                  World Bank member countries, or shareholders, are represented by a Board of
                                  Governors, who are the ultimate policymakers at the World Bank. Generally, the
                                  governors are member countries’ ministers of finance or ministers of development. They
                                  meet once a year at the Annual Meetings of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank
         Financial assistance     Group and the International Monetary Fund. The governors delegate specific duties to 25
G4-EC4   received from            executive directors, who work onsite at the Bank. The five largest shareholders appoint        Partial
         government               an executive director, while other member countries are represented by elected
                                  executive directors.

                                     Trust funds: Generally accounted for separately from the Bank’s own resources, trust
                                     funds are financial and administrative arrangements with external donors that lead to
                                     grant funding of high-priority development needs, such as technical assistance, advisory
                                     services, debt relief, post-conflict transition, and co-financing.
                                     Taxes: As an organization established by international treaty, the World Bank receives

         The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance for developing countries around the world. It is not a bank in the
         ordinary sense, but a unique partnership formed to reduce poverty and support development. The Bank supports a wide array of
         investments in such areas as education, health, public administration, infrastructure, financial and private sector development, agriculture,
         and environmental and natural resource management.
         The Bank has established ambitious but achievable goals to galvanize international and national efforts: to end extreme poverty—
G4-DMA
         reducing the share of the global population living in extreme poverty to 3 percent by the year 2030—and to promote shared prosperity—
         increasing the income of the bottom 40 percent of the population. Both of these goals must be met in a sustainable manner. The World
         Bank Corporate Scorecard measures the progress on these goals. It reports key sectoral and multi-sectoral results achieved by clients
         with the support of the World Bank Group.




                                     Infrastructure development—in the energy, water, transport, and information and
                                     communication technology sectors—is critical to creating growth opportunities and to
                                     reducing poverty. The World Bank aims to help governments make informed decisions
         Development and             about improving access to and the quality of infrastructure services, which can include,
         impact of infrastructure    where appropriate, using public–private partnerships.

         Countries rely on healthy ecosystems and biodiversity to survive, grow enough food, and make a living. But the world is experiencing a
         dramatic loss of biodiversity, which negatively affects livelihoods, clean water supply, food security, and resilience to environmental
         disasters. This situation particularly affects the 78 percent of the world’s poor who live in rural areas and often rely on ecosystems to
         support themselves.
         The World Bank works with countries around the world to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity. With a portfolio of 241 projects worth
         $1.24 billion in the 10 years from fiscal 2006–2016, the World Bank is one of the largest international financiers of biodiversity
G4-DMA   conservation and sustainable use.
         The World Bank helps countries put policies in place so that biodiversity is valued as a key driver of sustainable development. It works with
         clients to improve their administration to better conserve and sustainably use their biodiversity. The Bank invests in aspects of biodiversity
         services—such as watershed management and protected areas—that help countries achieve their development goals. The World Bank
         also helps countries find ways to generate revenues from biodiversity, such as tourism income, while fighting wildlife crime, as well.
         Biodiversity projects range from establishing and strengthening terrestrial, freshwater, and marine protected areas to eradicating invasive
         alien species, to improving biodiversity management planning in the production landscape.



                                                                                                                                            29
          Wherever feasible, Bank-financed projects are sited on already converted lands in order to preserve critical natural habitats. The World
          Bank does not support projects that involve the significant conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats unless there are no feasible
          alternatives for the project and its siting, and comprehensive analysis demonstrates that overall benefits from the project substantially
          outweigh the environmental costs. If the environmental assessment indicates that a project would significantly convert or degrade natural
          habitats, the project takes mitigation measures, including minimizing habitat loss, and establishing and maintaining an ecologically similar
          protected area. In deciding whether to support a project with potential adverse impacts on a natural habitat, the Bank takes into account
          the borrower's ability to implement the appropriate conservation and mitigation measures.
          A 2013 review of the Bank’s portfolio in the Forest Sector by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) found that protected area projects—
          which constitute just under half (100 projects by count) of the total forest portfolio—have largely been successful in setting up critical
          conservation areas and building their management capacity, but that the poverty impact of the Bank’s forest interventions could be
          strengthened. In response, the World Bank Group developed a Forest Action Plan for fiscal 2016–2020 that aims to boost the potential of
          forests to lift people out of poverty and generate lasting social, economic, and environmental returns in developing countries. It identifies
          two focus areas for our engagement for the next five years: sustainable forest management and forest-smart interventions in other sectors.
          These areas are supported by three themes to strengthen the foundations for positive forest outcomes: climate change and resilience,
          rights and participation, and institutions and governance.


                                      The World Bank’s work toward protecting biodiversity includes establishing and
                                      expanding protected area systems. For example, the Amazon Region Protected Areas
                                      program (ARPA) in Brazil has helped protect around 60 million hectares of rainforest. A
                                      study published by the US National Academy of Sciences credits ARPA with a 37
                                      percent decrease in deforestation between 2004 and 2009. The Bank is also applying
                                      the lessons learned from this experience into a new project in Brazil that aims to triple
                                      the marine area under protection while directly benefiting 800,000 people. Similar to the
          Habitats protected or       ARPA program, the integrated protected areas component of the newly established
G4-EN13                                                                                                                                      Full
          restored                    Amazon Sustainable Landscapes program aims to increase the area of globally
                                      significant forest ecosystems in new protected areas while also addressing the needs of
                                      forest-dwelling communities. In addition, the Coastal & Biodiversity Management project
                                      in Guinea-Bissau helped establish the autonomous Institute for Biodiversity and
                                      Protected Areas to manage the country’s network of protected areas and endangered
                                      species. The project helped conserve 480,000 hectares of its coastal zone (13 percent of
                                      the territory), together with local communities. These protected areas are considered
                                      national assets and are intended to form the backbone of a future tourism industry.

The Bank supports the protection, maintenance, and rehabilitation of natural habitats and
their functions in its advisory work, project financing, and policy dialogue. From fiscal
2006–2016, 92 projects supported habitat protected or restored areas, with a geographic
emphasis on the Latin America and the Caribbean region (LCR) and Africa (33 projects
in LCR and 31 in Africa), 17 in East Asia and the Pacific, six in Eastern and Central Asia,
two in Middle East and North Africa, and three in South Asia. Habitat restoration was
supported through five projects (two in Africa, one in East and Central Asia, and two in
LCR).
Global and regional partnerships play an important role in promoting biodiversity
conservation:
-- The Bank is the lead agency of the Global Partnership on Wildlife Conservation and
Crime Prevention for Sustainable Development, a $90 million grant program by the
Global Environment Facility (GEF), launched in 2015. The program focuses on designing
and implementing national strategies to help countries secure their wildlife resources,
habitats, and the benefits they derive from them while also reducing poaching and illegal
wildlife trafficking.
--The International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC), launched in 2010,
brings together Interpol, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora Secretariat, World Customs Organization, the UN Office on Drugs
and Crime, and the World Bank to promote effective law enforcement nationally and
internationally in order to prevent forest and wildlife crime. ICCWC also supports
sustainable development and equitable benefit-sharing of the proceeds from sustainable
natural resource management.
-- The Amazon Sustainable Landscapes Program is a five-year regional program
spanning Brazil, Colombia, and Peru that was designed to conserve the Amazon Forest
through an integrated approach that incorporates sustainable land use, protected areas
management, and the restoration of vegetation cover. The total amount of investment is
estimated at over $600 million, including GEF grant, donor, and counterpart funds. The
program was approved in 2015 by the GEF Council, and is the collaborative effort of the
World Bank, as the lead agency, the World Wildlife Fund, and the United Nations
Development Programme.

          The World Bank is committed to its goals of eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. Poverty,
          as the Bank recognizes it, encompasses lack of opportunities (including capabilities), lack of voice and representation, and vulnerability to
          shocks. Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are crucial for managing risk in the Bank ’s portfolio. GRMs create opportunities to resolve
          disputes before they escalate by offering a channel for citizens to express concerns, comments, and complaints. Beyond their benefits to
          citizens, GRMs can help the Bank and clients improve project outcomes, prioritize supervision, identify systemic issues, and promote
          accountability. The Bank promotes human rights principles through the projects it supports, for example, improving poor people’s access to
          health services, education, food, and water. Moreover, the Bank promotes the participation of project-affected people, including Indigenous
          Peoples, in decision making and participation; helps strengthen the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens; and
          supports justice reform and fighting corruption. Although development projects are intended to bring about positive change, their
          implementation involves risks, and people or the environment can be adversely impacted. The Bank has policies to help avoid such
          unintended outcomes, but some problems may remain unrecognized or unaddressed. In such circumstances, citizens should speak out to
G4-DMA    bring attention to these problems. This can be done either through project-level GRMs or the Bank’s corporate-level Grievance Redress
          Service (GRS), which was established in January 2015 to field complaints that could not be addressed at the country level. This
          mechanism complements borrowers’ project-level grievance mechanism (where they exist) and the Board’s Inspection Panel.
          The Environmental and Social Standards Advisory Team leads the Bank’s corporate work on grievance redress. GRS provides a
          consistent and systematic approach to the handling of complaints and conflict resolution across all IBRD/IDA operations. The work involves
          a number of the Bank’s major initiatives, in particular, work on risk, results, and beneficiary feedback. The Global Review of Grievance
          Redress Mechanisms found that half of all Bank projects featured a GRM in project-design documents. However, new research shows
          implementation challenges.
          A major focus for the Bank in the future will be to further integrate grievance redress in all projects, increase support for implementation,
          and enhance collection and monitoring of grievances received and resolved across the project’s portfolio.

         The World Bank significantly promotes human rights principles in a range of areas, including: (1) improving poor people’s access to health
         services, education, food, and water; (2) promoting the participation of project-affected communities, including Indigenous Peoples, in
         decision making; (3) strengthening the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens; and (4) supporting justice reform
         and fighting corruption. Thus, the Bank’s role is facilitative, helping its members realize their human rights obligations.
         The Bank screens each project proposed for financing to determine the appropriate extent and type of environmental and social analysis to
         be undertaken during project preparation, and whether the project may involve the application of additional safeguard policies. Policies that
         may be triggered include: OP/BP 4.01, Environmental Assessment; OP/BP 4.04, Natural Habitats; OP 4.09, Pest Management; OP/BP

         growth, human wellbeing, and development effectiveness agenda. OP/BP 4.20 establishes a country-level, strategic approach to
         mainstreaming gender issues in Bank work. For more information on gender issues, see: http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/gender.
G4-DMA   The Bank classifies each proposed project into one of four categories (A, B, C, or FI) depending on the type, location, sensitivity, and scale
         of the project and the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts. The borrower is responsible for any assessment
         required by the safeguard policies, with Bank staff providing advice on the application of the policies. Depending on the type of project and
         its safeguard policy category, the Bank project design incorporates such issues as public consultation, environmental and social
         assessments, Indigenous Peoples’ plans, and resettlement frameworks and/or resettlement action plans. Compliance with these policies
         forms part of the legal agreements for grants and loans.
         In October 2012, the World Bank launched a review and update of its policies to protect people and the environment in its projects. The
         World Bank’s environmental and social safeguard policies contribute to sustainability and development effectiveness in Bank projects and
         programs by helping to avoid or mitigate harm to people and the environment. The new Environmental and Social Framework was
         approved by the Board of Executive Directors (EDs) on August 4, 2016, and the bank-wide implementation is currently under preparation.

                                     World Bank environmental and social safeguard policies are a cornerstone of our support
                                     to sustainable development and poverty reduction. The objective of these policies is to
                                     prevent and mitigate undue harm to people and their environment in the development
                                     process. In fiscal 2016, 126 hours (21 sessions) of training of safeguard policies were

         The World Bank recognizes that child labor is one of the most devastating consequences of persistent poverty. All standard World Bank
         bidding documents contain a clause prohibiting the use of child or forced labor in contracts financed under any World Bank projects. Staff in
G4-DMA
         Bank-supported operations are required to assess social issues such as child labor within the environmental and social aspects of the
         projects and develop specific measures that would be implemented in the course of the project to mitigate the risk.

         Central to the Bank’s mission of reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development is ensuring that the development proc ess fully
         respects the dignity, human rights, economies, and cultures of Indigenous Peoples. The Bank recognizes that the identities and cultures of
         Indigenous Peoples are inextricably linked to the lands on which they live and the natural resources on which they depend. These distinct
         circumstances expose Indigenous Peoples to different types of risks and levels of impacts from development projects, including loss of
G4-DMA
         identity, culture, and customary livelihoods. Gender and intergenerational issues among Indigenous Peoples also are complex. As social
         groups with identities that are often distinct from dominant groups in their national societies, Indigenous Peoples are frequently among the
         most marginalized and vulnerable segments of the population. As a result, their economic, social, and legal status often limits their capacity
         to defend their interests in and rights to lands, territories, and other productive resources, or restricts their ability to participate in and benefit


                                                                                                                                                    35
         from development. At the same time, the Bank recognizes that Indigenous Peoples play a vital role in sustainable development and that
         their rights are increasingly being addressed under both domestic and international law.
         The World Bank policy on Indigenous Peoples, OP/BP 4.10, Indigenous Peoples, underscores the need for borrowers and Bank staff to
         identify Indigenous Peoples, consult with them, and ensure that they participate in and benefit from Bank-funded operations in a culturally
         appropriate way. It also emphasizes that adverse impacts on them are avoided or, where not feasible, minimized or mitigated. For all
         projects that are proposed for Bank financing and involve Indigenous Peoples, the Bank requires the borrower to engage in a process of
         free, prior, and informed consultation. The Bank provides project financing only where there is broad community support to the project by
         the affected Indigenous Peoples.
         In August 2016, the World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved a new Environmental and Social Framework for protecting people
         and the environment in World Bank-financed investment projects, marking the end of a four-year review process that concluded in fiscal
         2016. This was the most extensive consultation the World Bank has ever had. The World Bank now begins an intensive preparation and
         training period (12–18 months) to prepare for the transition to the new framework.
         The new framework advances the Bank’s existing Indigenous Peoples policy by including Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC), and
         by addressing peoples in voluntary isolation, and pastoralists. This provision is well harmonized with those of other International Financial
         Institutions. The safeguards review included a Global Dialogue and Engagement process with Indigenous Peoples that sought to
         incorporate Indigenous Peoples in the review and update of the World Bank’s Environmental and Social Framework, as well as to
         strengthen World Bank support to and engagement with Indigenous Peoples, more generally. The consultations on the framework included
         a number of dedicated Indigenous Peoples dialogue sessions, which yielded important results in terms of participation, information
         gathered, and the beginning of a renewed and stronger relationship with Indigenous Peoples.

         Over the past decade, the World Bank has increasingly focused on lending to community-driven development (CDD) programs in order to
         let communities lead their own development. This process lets communities identify their own development priorities, design the relevant
G4-DMA   response, manage project funds, hire contractors, and on completion of construction, manage and sustain the project. Over the past 10
         years, the volume of lending for community-driven investments has ranged from 5 percent to 10 percent of overall annual Bank lending,
         and the active CDD portfolio (as of December 2015) stands at more than $17 billion, across 178 projects in 72 countries, worldwide.

         Critical to the World Bank’s mission is a well-functioning public sector that delivers quality public services consistent with citizen
         preferences and fosters private, market-led growth, while managing its fiscal resources in a prudent manner. Bank operations across
         sectors systematically incorporate governance and anticorruption measures into project design. The objective is to better manage
         corruption and fiduciary risks and ensure that development funds are used for their intended purposes.
         The World Bank Group has an encompassing Governance and Anti-Corruption Strategy that imbues all its activities. The Integrity Vice
         Presidency (INT) is an independent unit within the Bank Group that plays an important role in this respect. INT investigates allegations of
         fraud and corruption in World Bank-supported activities (external investigations), as well as allegations of significant fraud and corruption
G4-DMA   involving Bank staff and vendors (internal investigations). The resulting debarments of firms and individuals prevent these parties from
         participating in future Bank-financed projects and serve as a deterrent to other potential wrongdoers. INT helps client countries through its
         joint investigations and forensic reviews, the investigative findings it refers to national authorities, and by sharing its insights with relevant
         ministries to help bolster their business systems and administration. INT also works with the private sector and NGOs through its Integrity
         Compliance Office to institute integrity compliance programs that sanctioned entities must satisfy in order to be released from sanction. By
         combining investigations with an enhanced focus on compliance, detection of red flags, and building preventive measures in projects, INT
         promotes a proactive approach to managing fraud and corruption risks. It is vital to manage these risks in an efficient and effective manner,
         as they can impact development resources, particularly in fragile contexts and high-risk sectors.



                                      In fiscal 2016, the Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) opened 64 investigations into possible
                                      fraud and corruption in 60 Bank-financed projects in 36 countries. The investigations
                                      substantiated in fiscal 2016 involved 43 projects and included the review of 124 contracts
                                      and agreements totaling approximately $633 million. In total, 87 investigations were

                                     Within INT, the Preventive Services Unit (PSU) worked with many Task Teams across
                                     the World Bank Group’s six regions in fiscal 2016. PSU assisted 23 Task Teams in
                                     building precautions against the high levels of potential fraud and corruption risks in their
                                     projects. This engagement included training of project officials and Task Teams in-
                                     country. Thanks to PSU’s business intelligence, integrity risks were identified before they
                                     had materialized and allowed for instituting targeted controls.


                                     Training was provided to Bank staff as well as project implementation officials, including

         The World Bank has two goals: to eliminate extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. Poverty, as the Bank
         recognizes it, encompasses lack of opportunities (including capabilities), lack of voice and representation, and vulnerability to shocks.
         Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are crucial for managing risk in the Bank’s portfolio. GRMs create opportunities to resol ve disputes
         before they escalate by offering a channel for citizens to express concerns, comments, and complaints. Beyond their benefits to citizens,
         GRMs can help the Bank and clients improve project outcomes, prioritize supervision, identify systemic issues, and promote accountability.
         The Bank promotes human rights principles through the projects it supports, for example, improving poor people’s access to health
         services, education, food, and water. Moreover, the Bank promotes the participation of project-affected people, including Indigenous
         Peoples, in decision-making and participation; helps strengthen the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens; and
         supports justice reform and fighting corruption. Although development projects are intended to bring about positive change, their
G4-DMA
         implementation involves risks, and people or the environment can be adversely impacted. The Bank has policies to help avoid such
         unintended outcomes, but some problems may remain unrecognized or unaddressed. In such circumstances, citizens need to speak out to
         bring attention to these problems. This can be done either through project-level Grievance Redress Mechanisms or the Bank’s corporate-
         level Grievance Redress Service (GRS), which was established in January 2015 to field complaints that could not be addressed at the
         country level. This mechanism complements the borrower’s project-level grievance mechanism (where they exist), and the Board’s
         Inspection Panel.
         OPCS leads the Bank’s corporate work on grievance redress. The GRS provides a consistent and systematic approach to the handling of
         complaints and conflict resolution across all IBRD/IDA operations. The work involves a number of the Bank ’s major initiatives, in particular,
         work on risk, results, and beneficiary feedback.

          The Global Review of Grievance Redress Mechanisms found that half of all Bank projects featured a GRM in project-design documents.
          However, new research shows implementation challenges.
          A major focus for the Bank in the future will be to further integrate grievance redress in all projects, increase support for implementation,
          and enhance collection and monitoring of grievances received and resolved across the project portfolio.

          The World Bank supports a wide array of investments in such areas as education, health, public administration, infrastructure, financial and
          private sector development, agriculture, and environmental and natural resource management. Bank stakeholders look to the institution, as
          a lending facility, to have policies and procedures in place that assess and screen environmental and social risks in its lending portfolio.
          The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world. We are not a bank in the
          ordinary sense, but a unique partnership to reduce poverty and support development.
          In 2013, the World Bank adopted a new World Bank Group Strategy focused on aligning all of the institutions’ work with the twin goals of
          eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The two goals are now at the heart of the World Bank
          Group’s work. The World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard was developed to monitor implementation and aggregate the contributions of
G4-DMA    all the World Bank Group institutions.
          On a day-to-day basis, in close partnership with country government counterparts and their stakeholders, Bank staff members shape the
          role, financial products, and technical and advisory services to the unique development needs and capacities of each country client. Thus,
          interactions with clients, investees, and business partners regarding environmental and social risks and opportunities form the foundation of
          the Bank’s advisory and loan services. The Bank’s environmental and social safeguard policies are the cornerstones of the financial,
          technical, and advisory services, and are applied to prevent and mitigate impacts and risks to people and their environment in the
          development process. In October 2012, the World Bank launched a review and update of its policies to protect people and the environment
          in its projects. The World Bank’s environmental and social safeguard policies contribute to sustainability and development ef fectiveness in
          Bank projects and programs by helping to avoid or mitigate harm to people and the environment. The new Environmental and Social

                                 The World Bank’s environmental and social safeguard policies embody the institution’s
                                 commitment to sustainable development and poverty reduction. There are 10 safeguard
                                 policies: environmental assessment, natural habitats, forests, pest management,
                                 physical cultural resources, dam safety, Indigenous Peoples, involuntary resettlement,
                                 international waterways, and disputed areas.
                                 These policies aim to prevent and mitigate possible adverse impacts on people and their
      Policies with specific
                                 environment in the development process. These policies provide a mandatory framework

      lines
                                 result of attention to these policies. Safeguard policies have often provided a platform for
                                 the participation of stakeholders in project design, and have been an important
                                 instrument for building ownership among local populations. All safeguard policies have
                                 been approved by the Board of Directors.

                                 The Bank undertakes the screening of each proposed project to determine the
                                 appropriate extent and type of environmental and social analysis. This includes the use
                                 of environmental and social impact assessments, conducted during project preparation
                                 to establish whether the project may involve the application of additional safeguard
      Procedures for             policies. The Bank classifies the proposed project into one of four categories (A, B, C, or
      assessing and              FI) depending on the type, location, sensitivity, and scale of the project and the nature

      lines                      In general, a World Bank environmental and social specialist is assigned to each project
                                 with the potential to have environmental and social impact or risk in its design and
                                 planning stage. A practice manager, who is responsible for a number of projects, most
                                 often in sector and regional associations, manages this process. As the project moves
                                 through design, the Bank works with the clients to understand the technical features of

                               addressing these impacts as risks, as required by the suite of World Bank safeguard
                               policies. For category A and B projects, there is also involvement by the Regional
                               Safeguard Advisor. Higher-risk projects require a series of “safeguard” instruments to
                               identify and explain how the borrower will mitigate any identified risks and potential
                               adverse impacts. Depending on the size and nature of the operation several quality
                               control and review committees meet to authorize the project’s processing, such as the
                               Regional Operational Committee, or the Operations Committee chaired by the Managing
                               Director. Finally, the Board of Directors must approve all projects, and those approvals
                               also require submission or summaries of any environmental assessment and social
                               safeguard documents.

                              The World Bank is carrying out a range of regular programs as well as tailored trainings
                              for staff and borrowers on the application of its safeguards policies, best practices, case
                              studies, and lessons learned. The safeguards team offers weekly workshops on applying
                              safeguard policies, and each regional vice presidency offers trainings on safeguard
                              policies. In addition, an accreditation course has been established for environmental

                               The World Bank is a development institution, providing low- or no-interest loans (credits)
                               and grants to low-income countries, middle-income countries, and small and fragile
                               states. Working closely with country government counterparts and their stakeholders,
                               Bank staff members shape its role, financial products, and technical and advisory
                               services to the unique development needs and capacities of each country client. Thus,
                               interactions with clients, investees, and business partners regarding environmental and
                               social risks and opportunities form the foundation of the Bank’s advisory and loan
                               services.
                               All regional safeguards units conduct various client safeguard capacity-building
                               processes. Many projects use the project kickoff meeting to review the agreements and
                               provisions for safeguards with formal and informal trainings. In many countries, the
                               government project implementation unit attends special safeguards training organized by
      Interactions with        the Bank safeguards staff.
      clients, investees, or   When particular safeguards issues of concern appear common, the Bank may undertake
      business partners        a targeted review of a regional or sectoral project portfolio. In certain cases, one or
FS5   regarding                several environmental and social safeguards specialists undertake a country visit and        Full
      environmental and        conduct site visits with safeguards training to help improve safeguards implementation or
      social risks and         correct past shortcomings. When needed, there are formal face-to-face workshops,
      opportunities            project implementation safeguards training in the field with project stakeholders,
                               consultations by lead safeguards specialists, and rapid-response project visits to deal
                               with high-risk issues of concern.
                               The safeguards implementation reports, the responsibility of the borrower, are bank-
                               required supervision reports summarizing borrower progress on an annual, biannual, or
                               quarterly basis, depending on project safeguards risk. The submission of Environmental
                               Social Impact Assessment and ESMP reports during project implementation is required
                               for Bank review and clearance.
                               The Bank holds regular supervision mission meetings designated for the year and end-
                               of-supervision mission meetings between the Bank and borrowers. There is discussion
                               between Bank safeguards specialists and project implementing safeguards managers or
                               project contract safeguards supervisors and technicians.

         The World Bank values the diversity, health, safety, and security of its staff, who work in Washington, DC, and in 136 countries worldwide.
         The institution’s diverse workforce brings a wide range of perspectives to bear on poverty-reduction issues and emerging development
         challenges. It is critical to the effectiveness of the Bank’s core operational and knowledge services. Our staff diversity is a strategic
         business asset that directly contributes to achievement of our two goals: reducing extreme poverty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity
         for the bottom 40 percent of the population in every country.
         To that end, it is important that the Bank employ the right people in the right place with the right skills at the right time. To deliver on that
G4-DMA   commitment, the Human Resources (HR) Strategy for fiscal 2014–2016 had five critical components: (1) building a culture of performance
         and accountability, (2) driving a more effective organization, (3) fostering a more diverse and inclusive workforce, (4) creating career
         opportunities, and (5) ensuring HR excellence and business-driven delivery. As the Bank retools to increase its delivery and
         responsiveness to its clients, Human Resources has played a pivotal role in the transition of staff from the previous structure to the Global
         Practices model, introduced in July 2014.
         Looking forward, the Bank will continue to ensure full alignment of staffing needs with the World Bank Group strategic priorities.

                                     consisting of private sector firms, and representative quasi-public and nonprofit
                                     organizations. The grading system and benchmark job positions in country offices follow

         Consumption of materials is minimal in the World Bank’s corporate operations, but nonetheless important. Through investor questionnaires,
         “materials” has been identified as an important aspect of the Global Reporting Initiative exercise.
         Key materials include office supplies and electronics purchased to support the work of our staff globally. Reducing the environmental
         impact of these materials by minimizing consumption and preferring recycled content and rapidly renewable choices ensures resources are
G4-DMA
         available for future generations. The World Bank identifies products and services with large environmental impacts or those of which it
         procures in large amounts. The World Bank then works to identify environmentally and socially preferable alternatives. Quarterly reports
         from key suppliers reflect the percentage of products that meet key environmental criteria, such as percentage of recycled content,
         environmental certifications such as Energy Star ratings and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, and other sustainable criteria.

                                   As a development institute, the World Bank does not produce or manufacture any
                                   products. The materials we use regularly include office supplies and electronics.
                                   The World Bank’s use of nonrenewable materials is as follows:
                                   The Bank tracks office electronic purchases for any device that qualifies for the US
                                   Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Energy Star Program, as well as any battery
                                   purchases. In fiscal 2016, the Bank purchased 13.38 tons of such electronics and
         Materials used by
G4-EN1                             batteries. In addition, the Bank tracks purchases from its office supplier. In fiscal 2016,   Partial
         weight or volume
                                   the Bank purchased 103 metric tons of these products. The World Bank also purchases
                                   diesel fuel and natural gas for use in powering our buildings. These materials are
                                   reported on in EN3.
                                   The World Bank’s use of renewable materials is as follows:
                                   The Bank tracks paper purchases of renewable materials. In fiscal 2016, the amount of
                                   paper used was 505 tons.
                                   The World Bank is committed to using resources that are made from recycled or rapidly
                                   renewable materials for its internal operations. The largest material purchases include
                                   paper, office supplies, office furniture, cafeteria napkins, and electronics.
                                   World Bank standard copier and printer paper is 100 percent post-consumer waste
                                   recycled content and FSC certified. The Bank tracks the percentage of all paper used at
                                   the institution that was made of recycled content, as well as the percentage of paper
                                   used that is 100 percent recycled content. In fiscal 2016, this amount was 62 percent, up
                                   from 60 percent in fiscal 2015.

         input materials
                                   22 percent of all purchases from the office supply vendor contained at least 10 percent
                                   post-consumer recycled content, compared to 28 percent in fiscal 2014, the last year we
                                   tracked such information. This decrease is due to the Bank’s use of a managed print
                                   service, which eliminated the use of recycled-content printer cartridges in favor of a
                                   centralized service provider.
                                   More than 40 percent of our office furniture contains a minimum of 10 percent post-

         Energy is a key input to the World Bank’s business operations. Through investor questionnaires, energy has been identified as an
         important aspect for the Bank’s business.
         The purchase and use of energy can have various impacts because of the extraction of materials from the earth’s crust and the production
         of persistent toxic emissions from the combustion of fuels. Combustion of fossil fuels can have severe health impacts on people. Moreover,
         the purchase and use of energy affects the expense-to-business revenue ratio.
G4-DMA   The World Bank manages its energy use carefully by tracking use in each owned facility. Quarterly tracking of the Bank’s energy use is
         evaluated by the Director of General Services. Energy use is evaluated both as an absolute figure as well as on an intensity basis to
         determine progress. Responsibility for increasing the energy efficiency of the Washington, DC, campus, with the goal of bringing all owned
         facilities to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) minimum requirements, falls with the Senior Project Manager in the
         Bank’s Corporate Real Estate unit.

                                     The World Bank purchases natural gas, propane, gasoline, and diesel fuel for
                                     combustion onsite. In fiscal 2015, total global fuel use was 99,041 gigajoules (GJ),
                                     92,793 GJ in fiscal 2014, and 90,135 GJ in fiscal 2013. The portion of this fuel
                                     consumption from renewable resources is not tracked, because data from fuel providers
                                     are not appropriately detailed.

                                     meters in fiscal 2014. This ratio includes all energy (onsite combustion fuel, electricity,
                                     heating, cooling, and steam) except for energy consumption outside of the organization.
                                     In fiscal 2015, the Bank undertook efficiency measures that reduced its energy
                                     consumption by 4,683 GJ, predominately through reductions in heating and electricity
                                     use.
                                     An intensive retro-commissioning effort in one of the Bank’s Washington, DC, buildings
                                     resulted in a 25 percent reduction in gas consumption and a 13 percent reduction in

         Addressing climate change is part of the World Bank’s core mission of helping countries end extreme poverty and boosting shar ed
         prosperity. Climate change threatens to erode development gains around the world—and its effects will be greatest on the poorest and
         most vulnerable countries, which are the World Bank’s clients.
G4-DMA   As a demonstration of its corporate commitment to addressing climate change, the Bank continues to deepen its efforts to measure,
         reduce, offset, and report its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with its global internal operations, including its facilities, key
         meetings, and corporate air travel. The Bank has measured the GHG emissions from its facilities in Washington, DC, since 2005 and
         globally since 2007. Emissions data are collected and emissions are calculated in accordance with the World Resources Institute and
         World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s GHG Protocol, with additional information on proxies, emissions factors, and the

          Inventory Management Plan and the GHG inventory to ensure they meet international best practices.
          In fiscal 2010, the World Bank set a goal of reducing GHG emissions by 10 percent from owned and managed facilities by 2017. As of
          fiscal 2016, the Bank was on track to meet this goal. We will continue to work toward reducing emissions further and report on our progress
          at the end of the goal period.

                                      In fiscal 2015, total gross direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions equaled 8,016 mtCO2e, of
                                      which 1,009 mtCO2e were emissions from the Bank’s US facilities. The remaining 7,007

                                 The World Bank measures indirect GHG emissions from air travel taken by Bank
                                 employees, as well as delegate air travel and other indirect emissions associated with
                                 major meetings that the Bank organizes. In fiscal 2012, the Bank began measuring GHG
                                 emissions from contractor-owned vehicles.
                                 In fiscal 2015, these emissions totaled approximately 102,518 mtCO2e, slightly increased

          The World Bank views reducing effluent and waste production as a material aspect because of the possible negative environmental
          impacts, which include the release of persistent toxic chemicals through waste disposed of in landfills or by being incinerated. Bank
          stakeholders also consider reducing the Bank’s effluent and waste production important.
          The Bank has worked to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills through a combination of source reduction, reuse, and recycling.
          Minimizing the amount of material brought into Bank facilities is the first way it manages the amount of waste created. Avoiding
          unnecessary packaging for purchased items, including encouraging minimum purchase thresholds for office supplies, is one way the Bank
G4-DMA    accomplishes this. Another way is by mandating that large purchases from vendors, such as the Bank’s latest computer monitor purchase,
          be delivered in bulk instead of individually packaged. In fiscal 2016, the Bank continued to pursue efficiencies in the standardization of
          waste management in its headquarters facilities.
          The concentration in 2016 was on standardizing bins in all offices, as well as continuing to increase the diversion rate in cafeterias. All
          offices in Washington, DC, facilities received a standard bin for both landfill and recyclable waste. An evaluation was made of Bank loading
          docks and other infrastructure to find efficiencies and evaluate the practicality of introducing source-separated recycling.
          The most recent audit for the cafeterias was not completed in time for the results to be included in this report.

          Environmental degradation affects the world’s poor disproportionately and therefore, reducing the Bank’s own corporate environmental
          impacts is in line with the Bank’s mission of reducing poverty. For internal operations, this means engaging in responsible b usiness
G4-DMA    practices that reduce negative environmental and social impacts while enhancing the wellbeing of staff, as well as the ecosystems,
          communities, and economies in which staff operate. The World Bank employs a small team of environmental specialists who work to
          mainstream sustainability throughout the organization.


                                     In fiscal 2016, the World Bank lending for environmental and natural resource-
                                     management-themed projects amounted to approximately $3.16 billion, which represents
                                     about 7 percent of total lending. In addition, the Bank is currently working with member

                                     The World Bank’s internal operations are managed by the General Services Department
                                     (GSD), which provides a wide range of integrated services to make the Bank’s internal
                                     operations efficient, comfortable, and environmentally sound. The business managers of
                                     the Real Estate, Travel, Food Services, Printing and Multimedia, and other units are
                                     responsible for incorporating environmental concerns into their work programs. Efforts to
                                     manage the environmental impact from their areas are part of the Bank’s operating costs
                                     and not quantified separately.
                                     The Corporate Responsibility Program supports Bank-wide efforts to integrate
                                     environmental and social concerns into the management of day-to-day activities, and
                                     communicates with staff, clients, and partners regarding these concerns. The program
                                     has an annual budget of $560,000.
                                     In addition, the Bank offsets its emissions in two different ways. It purchases Renewable
                                     Energy Certificates (RECs) in equal amounts (MWh) to the electricity it consumes
                                     globally. Also, the Bank offsets other emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 3) through the
                                     purchase of Verified Emissions Reductions (VERs). In fiscal 2015, the Bank maintained
                                     carbon neutrality by the purchase of credits totaling $285,000 from a portfolio of projects,
                                     including a small-scale hydropower project in Madagascar, a cook stove project in
                                     Rwanda, and a combined solar and wind project in India. An additional $185,000 was
                                     spent on emissions reduction efforts in country offices. Efforts in fiscal 2016 included
                                     upgrading compound and security lighting in many offices to solar-powered LED lighting.



          The World Bank works to reduce the environmental footprint of its facilities by procuring goods and services that have reduced
          environmental impacts. The World Bank Corporate Procurement unit is responsible for coordinating and overseeing the sourcing strategy,
          selection, and contract execution for Bank offices around the globe, including adherence to the Bank’s policies on socially and
G4-DMA
          environmentally responsible corporate procurement policies. Major corporate material purchases (including office construction and

                                     In fiscal 2016, 1,418 full-time staff were hired, as compared to 1,072 in fiscal 2015. The
                                     rate of new employee hires equaled 12 percent (9 percent in 2015). Of those hired, 44
                                     percent were hired in non-US offices, and 52 percent were female.
                                     In fiscal 2016, 1,920 staff left the Bank—at a turnover rate of 16.4 percent (of which, 3.8
                                     percent was voluntary), partly due to the phasing out of 1,029 extended-term
                                     consultant/temporary appointments. In fiscal 2015, 1,508 staff left the Bank—at a

                                    The World Bank is committed to providing benefits that respond to staff needs globally
                                    and are aligned with best practices. This includes life insurance, health care, disability
                                    and invalidity coverage, retirement provisions, parental leave, and opportunities for
                                    flexible work arrangements, as well as mobility, relocation, and resettlement benefits.
                                    These benefits vary with appointment type (whether open-ended or fixed-term staff or
                                    extended-term consultant/temporary) and whether the position is based at headquarters,

                                    include:
                                           Life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment coverage are offered to
                                            staff and eligible dependents. These benefits help protect the financial security of
                                            beneficiaries.

                                                                                                                                     59
   Medical plans are offered to staff and retirees and their dependents. These plans
    provide medical, dental, vision, and pharmacy benefits. The plans cover the staff
    member, one spouse or domestic partner, and dependent children or stepchildren
    under the age of 26. The staff member pays 25 percent of the premium costs,
    and the Bank pays 75 percent. Staff leaving the organization may elect to receive
    continuation of their medical, dental, vision, and pharmacy coverage for up to 36
    months at their own cost.
   Staff who are on sick leave for more than 20 consecutive days can apply for
    short-term disability, which pays 70 percent of salary for up to 24 months. Staff
    must first exhaust any accrued sick leave before disability pay starts. If a staff
    member remains disabled beyond the 24-month period, long-term disability
    benefits are provided at 70 percent of salary until the earliest of retirement, death,
    or recovery from disability. While on long-term disability, staff medical coverage
    and pension contributions are 100 percent paid by the Bank.
   Staff receive between 26 and 30 days of paid annual leave, depending on the
    length of service, and 15 days of sick leave per year, as well as paid leave for
    various specific circumstances such as adoption and paternity/maternity leave (10
    days and 70 days, respectively, with 100 percent pay).
   In 2015, the mandatory retirement age for staff on board and future staff
    increased from age 62 to age 67. The normal retirement age for staff on board on
    December 31, 2015, remains age 62, and it increased in fiscal 2016 for staff hired
    after December 31, 2015, to age 65. The Bank offers a variety of options to help
    staff save and plan for retirement. The Staff Retirement Net Plan (SRP) has two
    components: (1) Defined Benefit Component, which is Bank-funded and based
    on 1 percent of the highest average of three years’ net annual salary for each
    year of plan participation, not to exceed 35 years, and (2) Cash Balance
    Component, wherein the Bank contributes 10 percent of net annual salary, and
    the staff member contributes a mandatory 5 percent of net annual salary and can
    voluntary increase contributions to as high as 11 percent of net annual salary. In
    addition to the SRP, Washington-based staff can voluntary participate in a 401(k)
    plan. Effective January 1, 2015, Country Office staff can elect to participate in the
    Country Office Savings Plan.

                                             which provides assistance to staff, spouses, and domestic partners.
                                     The Bank’s benefits package also includes global mobility benefits, relocation, and
                                     resettlement policies.
                                     Short-term consultants and short-term temporaries, paid on a daily or hourly rate, are not
                                     eligible for leave, life insurance, or pension benefits. However, short-term consultants
                                     and short-term temporaries are covered under Worker’s Compensation, and have
                                     accidental death and dismemberment insurance of three times’ net annual salary, up to a
                                     maximum of $250,000, while on official Bank business travel. They are also eligible for
                                     limited medical expense coverage while on official Bank business for emergency medical
                                     care.



         The World Bank values the diversity, health, safety, and security of its staff members and consultants who work in Washington, DC, and in
         136 countries worldwide. Many employees travel throughout the world, thus the World Bank views appropriate and accessible health care
         through international vendors, regional health advisors, and onsite clinic facilities as an important service component.

         responsibilities while fully utilizing and developing their capacities. The Health Services (HS) Occupational Health Unit (OHU) is the lead
         unit in determining workplace accommodations for disability. Accommodations are applicable in the following situations:
               Accommodations related to the employment of a person who is employed with a pre-established disability or develops a disability

               Accommodations to reduce the impact of work-related health risks to an individual in the workplace;
               Accommodations requested in a return-to-work program after an absence from work due to medical causes; and
               Accommodations associated with the findings of a fitness-for-duty evaluation.
         Reimbursement of accommodation costs can be facilitated through the Disability Accommodation Fund (DAF) managed by HS.
         The World Bank Occupational Health and Safety Committee, which reports to the Senior Management Team, is tasked with developing,
         implementing, and monitoring an occupational health and safety management system that applies to Bank employees worldwide. The
         committee oversees a global occupational health and safety management system aimed at managing health and safety risks, thereby

          The World Bank values the diversity, health, safety, and security of its approximately 17,000 staff and consultants who work in Washington,
          DC, and in 136 countries worldwide.
          The aim of the Bank’s investment in staff learning is to ensure that learning is a strategic tool for the organization, so th at staff members,
          including from field offices, can learn continuously to remain cutting-edge to carry out the Bank’s mission. In January 2016, President Kim
G4-DMA    launched the Open Learning Campus (OLC) as a single destination to accelerate development solutions through learning for WBG staff,
          clients, and global partners. OLC offers a broad range of learning resources via Talks, Academy, and Connect. Funding support for
          external training or education is made possible based on annual discussions between staff and managers about individual yearly learning
          plans.
          For more information about OLC, see olc.worldbank.org.

                                 In fiscal 2016, the World Bank delivered 1,930 learning activities (1,847 in fiscal 2015) for
                                 a total of 4,760 sessions and 59,588 days of learning. Forty percent of the training days
                                 were delivered either in Country Offices or location-neutral formats such as e-learning
                                 and webinars in fiscal 2016, the same as in fiscal 2015 and 7 percentage points lower
                                 than in fiscal 2014.
                                 Eighty-six percent of the salaried workforce attended at least one learning event in fiscal
                                 2016, not including the corporate mandatory programs: 83 percent based in Country
                                 Offices and 88 percent at headquarters, in Washington, DC. These individuals attended
                                 the equivalent of 38.232 days of training, averaging 3.3 days per staff member, with 3.5
                                 in days taken by Country Office-based staff and 3.2 days taken by HQ-based staff. This
                                 was a 3 percent decrease from the fiscal 2015 training days of 3.4 days per staff
                                 member.
                                 Investment in staff learning increased by 12 percent from fiscal 2015 levels and by 14
         Average hours of        percent from fiscal 2014 levels. Through the end of fiscal 2016, the World Bank invested
         training per year per   $72.3 million in staff learning, of which 45 percent was spent on developing and
G4-LA9   employee by gender,     delivering learning activities, and 55 percent was spent to cover direct and indirect             Full
         and by employee         expenses for staff members to participate in learning (provided internally and/or from
         category                external providers), including staff time and other costs.

          The World Bank is committed to creating a workplace where everyone is valued, where differences are respected and celebrated, and
          where opportunity and equitable treatment is afforded to all. Ensuring diversity and inclusion are integrated into our daily work means
          creating a culture and practices that recognize, value, and harness what makes every individual unique in the broader sense, by
          acknowledging and respecting differences including nationality, gender, race, religion, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation/gender identity,

          disability, and educational background.
          Beyond the moral imperative, empowering others and respecting differences is much more than part of our institution’s core values: it
          makes good business sense. A diverse staff mirrors the diversity of the clients we serve and the partners we work alongside around the
          world, and that reflection is key to our credibility as an institution seeking equity and opportunity for all. In addition, it has been

demonstrated that a diverse staff stimulates the creativity and innovation our clients expect, drawn from the collective energy of individual
experience, knowledge, and perspectives.
World Bank staff are located in 136 countries and work in core finance, administrative, legal, economics, and technical specializations in
more than 20 sectors. Staff contribute an impressive breadth and depth of professional expertise, academic background, industry, and
international experience. The acknowledged diversity of our staff allows the Bank, the world’s leading development organization, to attract,
retain, and grow the finest talent from the broadest span of different backgrounds possible. When we leverage the diversity and
perspectives of all of our talent, the solutions that we offer—through our projects, programs, and assistance—are those that will meet our
clients' development goals.
The World Bank recognizes that meeting the demands and needs of its diverse client base more effectively means the Bank must consider
a range of ideas and perspectives to find the best solution to development challenges. Achieving shared prosperity in a sustainable way is,
by definition, about equal opportunity, empowerment, and economic and social inclusion. The Articles of Agreement for IBRD and IDA
emphasize the need to “pay due regard to the importance of recruiting personnel on as wide a geographical basis as possible” when
appointing Bank officers and staff, “subject to the paramount importance of securing the highest standards of efficiency and of technical
competence.” This directive was reiterated in the 1983 Principles of Staff Employment, approved by the Executive Directors, t o set forth the
broad policies according to which the President shall manage staff. In addition, the principles direct the Bank to “encourage diversity in
staffing consistent with the nature and objectives of the Organizations.” In addition to reflecting the World Bank’s global n ature, the
importance of staff diversity in enhancing the effectiveness and credibility of the Bank’s institutions has been underscored by ongoing
reforms to increase the voice and participation of emerging markets and developing countries at the Bank. The World Bank manages these
commitments and directives through an integrated approach that focuses on three pillars: advocacy (demonstrate leadership and build
partnerships), accountability (set goals and measure outcomes), and inclusion (embed diversity and inclusion into talent processes and
create an inclusive environment).
The World Bank measures the effectiveness through Diversity and Inclusion Compacts, which establish both diversity and inclusion targets
and identify specific actions to achieve the targets. The diversity targets include parity in management by gender and country part (Part I
versus Part II), as well as by gender among full-time staff at professional grades (grade GF+) in non-managerial roles. An additional
institutional target is 12.5 percent for Sub-Saharan African (SSA) and Caribbean (CR) nationals among full-time staff at professional grades
(grade GF+). Inclusion targets are derived from staff response on the annual engagement survey, which includes a set of questions that
comprise the indicators of the Inclusion Index. The World Bank Compact, which is signed by the President and the Senior Management
Team, is cascaded through all vice-presidential units. Progress against the Compact targets and actions are reported monthly and
reviewed quarterly. In addition to the Compacts, actions to improve staff perceptions on the engagement survey, including the Inclusion
Index, are developed and tracked at the World Bank and vice-presidential unit level.

                                      Since 1998, nationality, gender, and race have been the dimensions of diversity for which the
                                      Bank has set and monitored quantitative targets. Nationality has been measured in the
                                      aggregate by Part I and II contributing member status (roughly equivalent to developed and
           Breakdown of employees     developing countries, respectively), whereas SSA and CR nationality has served as the proxy
           per employee category      for race, specifically for Black staff.

          The World Bank Group considers the diversity of its staff a strategic business asset. Due to its privileges and immunities, the Bank Group
          provides staff comprehensive Internal Justice Services (IJS) to resolve and provide redress of workplace issues and grievances using
          informal and formal mechanisms. These services increase the level of collaboration among staff, provide spaces for the effective
          management of conflicts, and increase the Bank Group’s capacity to build and retain a globally representative workforce that has a voice
          and is valued by the organization.
          Most staff concerns are handled by one of the informal services of Internal Justice: Respectful Workplace Advisors (RWA) Program,
          Ombuds Services (OMB), and Mediation Services (MEF).
          Use of these mechanisms is voluntary, and staff also have direct access to the formal grievance mechanisms of Peer Review Services
G4-DMA
          (PRS), the Office of Ethics and Business Conduct (EBC) Vice Presidency, and the Integrity (INT) Vice Presidency. EBC investigates
          allegations of staff misconduct, and INT investigates allegations of fraud and corruption committed by individuals and companies involved
          in Bank Group-sponsored projects, as well as allegations against internal staff. PRS considers whether the Bank Group’s actions are
          consistent with the staff member’s contract of employment and/or terms of appointment, including the pertinent Bank Group rules and
          policies.
          Once the internal formal grievance mechanisms are exhausted, staff may access the World Bank Administrative Tribunal (WBAT), which is
          an independent judicial forum of last resort for the resolution of cases submitted by staff alleging non-observance of their contracts of
          employment or terms of appointment. WBAT decisions are final and binding.
