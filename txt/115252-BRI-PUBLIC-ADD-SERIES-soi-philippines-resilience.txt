CONTEXT:
The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of
2010 (Republic Act 10121) is a landmark legislation that shifted
the government of the Philippines’ long-standing focus from relief
to disaster risk reduction and prevention. To implement the new
requirements set by this legislation, the Philippine government
formulated a national disaster risk management (DRM) plan,
consistent with its commitments under the Hyogo Framework for
Action, as well as integrated risk reduction in the mid-term Philippine
Development Plan. Over the last five years, GFDRR and the World
Bank have provided the Philippines with technical support, including
comprehensive DRM planning, institutional capacity building, as well
as the formulation of a new risk financing policy strategy and action
plan to enable the government to implement related reforms.
At a municipal level, the Metro Manila Flood Master Plan has been
used as a template for the government of the Philippines to promote
a more comprehensive approach to flood risk management that
strikes a safe balance between engineering solutions and social
measures. The high caliber engineering work has also benefitted from
a wide range of multi-stakeholder consultations - for example with
informal settler families living along the waterways - to ensure that
