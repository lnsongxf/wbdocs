As an investor in emerging markets, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) strongly
believes that companies with diverse and inclusive supply chains are more in tune with
their consumer base, more innovative, perform better and are more competitive. As
such, we help firms improve performance, drive growth and profitability and manage
risks by strengthening and growing their supply chains in a sustainable and inclusive
way. That means that we place particular emphasis on helping our partner companies
enhance their capacity to build a supplier base that consists of firms with different
business and demographic profiles and that includes suppliers that may otherwise
be overlooked. We do that because we firmly believe that large and innovative
companies are a powerful conduit to reach smaller, often marginalized companies,
especially those run by women entrepreneurs. Bringing in and positioning these
smaller women-run businesses in the supply chains of larger companies allows these
women entrepreneurs to increase their profitability, find new markets and integrate
more effectively within existing markets. This holds particularly true for Turkey, where
women are not as integrated into business networks as their male counterparts. This
makes it more difficult for them to access market information, acquire new clients or
gain an edge by identifying and working with the most competitive vendors.


But gender-inclusive supply chains not only benefit women entrepreneurs, they
equally benefit corporates. Corporates tap into a larger pool of suppliers when
they seek to build a more diverse and inclusive supplier base. In addition, aligning
the gender-composition of their supplier base with that of their customer base can
help large companies strengthen their product offering. Overall, broadening and
diversifying the supplier base enhances product innovation. What that means for the
business of large companies cannot be overstated. A more relevant supplier base is
likely to produce more satisfactory products that better reflect consumer needs. This
means that new customers are cultivated and the loyalty of existing ones is increased.
‘Gender-inclusive’ producers also benefit from enlarging their consumer base by
appealing to socially responsible consumers. Overall, they benefit from an improved
brand perception.


As a development institution, we are equally keen to help companies increase their
social footprint through socially sustainable business models and practices. Gender-
inclusive producers create and improve economic opportunities for women and their
communities.


It is with great pleasure that I introduce to the readers the “Good for Business”
program, a joint project between the IFC and the Boyner Group and the first of its kind
for the IFC and in Turkey. I invite you to enjoy the insights and to learn from this case
study and to think of ways in which your organization can strengthen its business by
creating economic opportunities for women.

    DISCLAIMER
    IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, creates opportunity where it’s needed most and delivers lasting
    solutions for development, wherever IFC can achieve the greatest impact. This report was commissioned
    by IFC through its Manufacturing, Agribusiness and Services department (MAS) as well as its Cross-
    Cutting Advisory solutions department (CAS) and IFC’s Gender Secretariat. IFC’s MAS department invests
    in manufacturing to create opportunities across industry supply chains. It also supports investments in the
    retail sector because of its economic importance. IFC’s CAS department amongst others helps small and
    medium enterprises in the supply and distribution chains of large firms, particularly IFC clients to improve
    their performance by providing managerial training, and encouraging the participation. IFC Gender
    Secretariat in turn works with firms – including corporates - to reduce the gap between men and women as
    entrepreneurs, but also as employees, corporate leaders, suppliers, consumers, and community stakeholder.

    represent the views of, IFC or its Board of Directors or the World Bank or its Executive Directors, or the

women’s success in establishing their businesses               themselves
was helped by a set of common success drivers:
	 Support from family (husbands or parents)
   was crucial in the first stages of setting
   up a business. For example, some of the
   participating women could not produce
   collateral to access a bank loan as they did
   not have legal ownership of assets (car, an
   apartment or land), so male family members
   registered property in their names. When
   possible, the women tried to avoid bank
   loans and looked for private investors within
   extended family and friends networks.
	 Crossing gender boundaries to reconcile
   managing home and business meant calling
   upon their female support system to manage
   the home, asking women relatives or friends
   to baby sit or run personal errands. They used
   their male friends and relatives to manage the
   business, exploring business leads, identifying
   suppliers, resolving business issues.
	 Emphasizing being a manager over being
   a woman, was critically important to survive
   in the male-dominated textile sector, and
   included showing a good understanding
   of finance and monetary issues, besides
   projecting the image of a manager.



    WHAT DO THE PARTICIPATING WOMEN HAVE IN COMMON?

    Factors contributing to their success included:


    	 Support from family, particularly male family members

        DIVERSIFICATION:

        “I have learned during the Program that market demand for men’s and children’s knitwear is bigger than for
        women’s knitwear. I did not know that. So I asked one of the buyers, AyMarka, and they confirmed. And so I talked
        to my producer to also produce some men’s knitwear. And the next season we will sell it. This information was
        important to diversify my product portfolio. If not for the “Good for Business” Program I would not know that.”
