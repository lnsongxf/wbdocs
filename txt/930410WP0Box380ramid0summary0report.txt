      TEXT BOX 1: Incubator Case Study: MEST

      The Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) is based in Accra, Ghana. It is funded by the non-profit
      Meltwater Foundation, which in turn receives funds from the Meltwater Group. MEST is an educational institution
      with the objective of training young Africans to become software entrepreneurs. During the two-year program at
      MEST, entrepreneurs develop software applications targeted at the global marketplace.
      MEST received $20 million funding from the Meltwater Foundation as operational funding for the ten-year period
      from 2008 to 2018. All education and living expenses are covered for the first year for students enrolled at MEST.
      At the end of the third semester (18 months into the two-year program), students are required to form teams with
      the objective of creating a business. This first step is a selection process. Teams must consist of commercial and
      technical team members. Once teams are formed, each team is given three months to come up with a business
      concept and pitch for investment. If the investor decides to invest in the concept, MEST covers all expenses for
      another nine months. If the investor decides not to invest, then the team’s time at MEST is over.
      If MEST decides to invest in a project, it acquires between 20 percent and 40 percent equity in the business. The
      founders’ equity (the remaining equity after MEST has taken its share) is vested in a trust over a period of four
      years, each founder being allocated equity regularly over this period. If one of the founders quits after six months,
      they receive their percentage of equity allocated. If the concept is sold during the course of four years, MEST gets
      100 percent of the equity it was promised during the investor pitch, even if the full vesting period has not been
      completed.
