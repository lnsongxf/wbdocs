 1.    Major reforms and public sector efforts in recent years have focused on improving
 conditions for increased private sector financing. A stable macro-economic framework along
 with structural reforms to improve loan recovery, collateral use, and credit information have
 aimed at strengthening the foundation for a stronger financial sector, and to increase
 competition and penetration of financial services.

 2.    However, and despite numerous financial institutions operating in the market,
 financial services penetration remains low. Credit extended to the private sector is about half
 of what would be expected for the country’s level of income. The small and medium-sized
 enterprise (SME) segment remains underserved by the formal financial sector. In general, SMEs
 lack adequate credit products and creditors refer to obstacles to further reduce credit risk for
 expanding the offer of SME products. 2

 3.     While much progress has been made, challenges remain in terms of affordability
 and ease of access to finance. Credit conditions for SMEs with access to finance are relatively
 favorable, with relatively low interest rates and average long tenors of 24-36 months. However,
 among those that do not obtain finance, high interest rates and cumbersome credit procedures
 are cited as binding constraints. In particular, smaller SMEs (those with less employees and
 with lower overall debt levels) -and those in the initial stages of development, face significantly
 less favorable conditions than relatively larger SMEs 3. Prevailing high levels of informality in
 smaller companies further hinder access to finance.

 4.    Banks are a major source of funding to the private sector and SMEs in particular,
 with highly standardized credit products. SMEs receive nearly 13 percent of total credit by
 banks. Other financial institutions (OFIs) account for more than 10 million clients, and play an
 important role in less populated areas where they are the main (or even single) providers of
 SME finance.

 5.    The OFI sector, with only 1.1 percent of total assets of the financial sector,
 constitutes an important source of finance for the base of the pyramid. Credit unions and
 Multiple-purpose financial entities (SOFOMs) are the most active OFIs in credits to SMEs,
 although there is significant dispersion by size of the institution. Some credit unions offer

  This Technical Note was prepared in the context of a joint World Bank-IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program
mission in Mexico during May-June 2016 led by Alfonso Garcia Mora, World Bank and, Ghiath Shabsigh IMF, and
overseen by the Finance and Markets Global Practice, World Bank and the Monetary and Capital Markets
Department, IMF. The note was prepared by Leyla Castillo, Fredesvinda Montes, John Wilson, all World Bank
Group based, and José Rutman, external consultant WB. Eva Gutierrez, also WBG, provided key inputs to the
section on Public Sector commitment. The note relies on official and public data and interviews conducted during
the mission, and contains technical analysis and detailed information underpinning the FSAP assessment’s findings
and recommendations. Further information on the FSAP program can be found at www.worldbank.org/fsap

  Recognizing existing differences in the definitions of SMEs and for the purpose of this assessment, SMEs are
defined in accordance with the official definition provided by the Ministry of Economy (2009) by economic sector,
number of employees, and annual sales (MSME definition).

    leasing and a few have transformed to start offering factoring. Most of the credit is working
    capital and revolving credit for investment have a relatively share in the total portfolio
    (generally not more than 15 percent). Cooperatives (SOCAPs) are less active in the
    development of SME products, while SOFIPOs are more concentrated in the lower end of the
    SME segment.

    6.     OFIs face a number of growth and market development challenges to effectively
    serve the lower end of the SME segment, including funding difficulties and institutional
    capacity. The unregulated non-deposit taking SOFOMs –conceived as a mean to increase the
    offer of credit in the market– face funding difficulties with reduced access to wholesale funding
    through commercial and development banks, as well as through the capital market 4. Credit
    unions play a limited role in SME finance, due to regulatory compliance (which is challenging
    to comply for the smallest ones) and access to funding. The SOFIPOs are more concentrated in
    microcredit, consumer and small size commercial loans, and half of the sector suffers from
    limited activity and overall capacity. SOCAPs have reasonable levels of liquidity and capital,
    but have limited lending activity.

    7.     The government plays a critical role through the development banks in promoting
    credit to SMEs through guarantees and second tier finance programs. Half of the SME
    credit portfolio is originated through government support programs. Results have been
    significant in terms of credit volume directed to SMEs, as well as in reduced interest rates paid
    by borrowers. Guarantees have been found to improve financial conditions for participating
    firms and to support employment.

    8.     Effects on bringing new borrowers to the system have yet to be properly evaluated.
    While useful to facilitate banks involvement in SME lending, indefinite continuation of the
    program may reduce incentives to improve risk management systems. As there is no mandatory
    graduation from the program, it may disincentive banks to improve risk management systems
    and to use movable guarantees.

    9.     Improvements to the credit reporting systems (CRS) could further support SME
    finance. Services offered by credit bureaus are currently lacking comprehensive information
    and sophisticated products for the SME market, including scoring products. There is no credit
    registry, and information captured by regulatory and supervisory does not cover all entities that
    provide SME financing and needs more granularity.

    10. The legal framework for immovable collateral (real estate) is affected by high
    origination costs and lengthy enforcement procedures. Banks continue to use real estate
    collateral, in particular for long-term loans, but must account for the high origination costs and
    the risks associated with delays in enforcement, greatly reducing the value of the collateral.

    11. The legal framework for movable collateral (equipment, inventory, accounts
    receivables and cash) has been modernized. Challenges remain to unify the legal

4
  A potential difficulty in access to funding OFIs might be facing is related to domestic de-risking practices: in order
to comply with AML/CFT measures, banks might terminate or restrict business relationships with OFIs if it is
considered that there is insufficient or inadequate available information about OFIs clients.

    framework and address enforcement delays. Reforms introduced two modern legal
    instruments that significantly advanced the framework using movables as collateral: the
    guarantee trust and the non-possessory pledge. The system significantly benefited from the
    creation of a modern and functional collateral registry (Registro Único de Garantías
    Mobiliarias – RUG), though challenges remain in terms of on-line functionality, system
    capabilities, high-volume registrations, and user friendliness. The financial sector reform made
    significant improvements to the enforcement process, but the effectiveness of these measures
    are yet to be tested.

                                A.     OVERVIEW OF ACCESS TO FINANCE

    12. Major reforms and public sector efforts in recent years have focused on improving
    conditions for increased private sector financing. A stable macro-economic framework along
    with structural reforms to improve loan recovery, collateral use, and credit information have
    aimed at strengthening the foundation for a stronger financial sector, and to increase
    competition and penetration of financial services. However, and despite numerous financial
    institutions operating in the market, financial services penetration remains low, and credit
    extended to the non-financial private sector is about half of what would be expected for the
    country’s level of income. In addition to improving access to finance, unlocking alternative
    sources of finance for firms is fundamental. For instance, in Mexico, there are only 139 listed
    companies in the Mexican Stock Exchange, compared to over 200 listed companies in Peru and
    less than half compared to 359 and 311 in Brazil and Chile respectively.

    13. Despite significant increase in recent years, the small and medium-sized enterprise
    (SME) segment remains underserved by the formal financial sector. Banks are a major
    source of funding to the private sector, with SMEs receiving nearly 13 percent of total credit. As
    of December 2015, current lending to SMEs stood at MXN 234.6 billion (USD13.6 billion),
    However, according to the most recent economic census conducted by INEGI in 2014, only 37
    percent of SMEs have a loan, compared to 67 percent of large companies. In the past ten years,
    larger enterprises and financial institutions have increasingly accessed capital markets helping
    free up resources in the banking sector for smaller enterprises. This trend has changed in the
    last two years, with credit growth of large enterprises being significantly above credit growth of
    SMEs. In terms of volume and number of loans, SME lending has remained largely unchanged.
    The OFI 6 sector, with only 1.1 percent of total assets of the financial sector, constitutes an
    important source of finance for the base of the pyramid (with more than 10 million clients),
    particularly in less populated areas where they are the main (or even single) providers of SME
    finance. 7

    14. While much progress has been observed, challenges remain in terms of affordability
    and ease of access to finance. According to the Doing Business (DB) 2016 report, Mexico
    stands in 5th place in the ranking of 189 economies on the ease of getting credit and advanced
    seven places since 2015. By contrast, the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness
    Index for 2015-2016 8, reported access to financing as the sixth most problematic factor for
    doing business after corruption, inefficiencies of government bureaucracy, and crime and theft.
    Areas of opportunity according to the Global Competitiveness Index remain affordability of
    financial services and ease of access to loans 9. While the former largely measures the credit

  Excluding the regulated SOFOMs, which are controlled by a bank or other regulated OFIs, and the ones issuing
debt in the capital market or being voluntarily regulated.
7
  A forthcoming study “Developing SME Credit Markets through Non-Bank Financial Institutions” on the provision
of SMEs loans, shows that although banks represent 96.5% of the volume of credit, supervised OFIs are the main
source of SME credit in 536 municipalities (22 percent of the total), and are the only source of funding in 247
municipalities (10 percent of total) based on the latest available municipal level data
8
  The Global Competitiveness Report 2015-2016 assesses the competitiveness landscape of 140 economies,
providing insight into the drivers of their productivity and prosperity.
9
  México scores 3.7 and 2.4 in a scale of 1-7, seven being best. México ranks 71 and 105 place in availability and
affordability of financial services respectively, and 106 in ease of access to loans.

 infrastructure in place for doing business in Mexico, the latter measures financing that is taking
 place and the perceptions of the credit users. The disconnect between these two studies
 highlights the need to take advantage of the recent reforms to incentivize access to finance.

 15. Structural issues affecting credit supply reflect in low financial access among SMEs
 as compared to regional peers. Credit conditions for SMEs with access to finance are
 relatively favorable, with relatively low interest rates and average long tenors of 24-36 months.
 However, among those that do not obtain finance, high interest rates and cumbersome credit
 procedures are cited as binding constraints. In particular, smaller SMEs (those with less
 employees and with lower overall debt levels) -and those in the initial stages of development,
 face significantly less favorable conditions than relatively larger SMEs 10. Prevailing high levels
 of informality in smaller companies further hinder access to finance. Only around 1.2 million of
 companies are formal and nearly 34 percent have been less than two years in business. Thirty
 six percent of firms have been in operation between 3 to 10 years, while only 30 percent are
 well established business with more than 10 years. Scarcity of finance is particularly notable for
 younger firms and startup activities that also face hurdles in providing the required information
 to the lenders and in establishing a commercial relationship. This could well reflect concerns by
 the banking institutions in extending credit to borrowers with little existing information in credit
 bureaus. In these cases, credit by suppliers is prevalent in the sector as their position allows
 them for better information on the borrowers’ financial condition.

                         B.      PROVIDER REACH, DIVERSITY AND SUSTAINABILITY

 16. Challenges remain in terms of expanding the offer of existing SME products and
 services by a larger number of financial institutions. There are 47 private commercial banks,
 6 development banks, 4 development agencies, around 1,400 SOFOMs 11, 143 Savings and loans
 associations, 98 credit unions and 44 microfinance institutions 12 (MFIs) operating in Mexico. A
 wide array of instruments and sophisticated products suitable for SMEs are already being used
 in the market, and enabling legal conditions have been developed to strengthen the use of some
 others. Factoring plays a major role, and discussions with Nacional Financiera (NAFIN)
 suggest the estimated size of the market to exceed 3,000,000 transactions annually. Value chain
 financing has produced significant economic benefits to SMEs under the NAFIN system for
 suppliers, reaching almost 700 large firms (buyers) and approximately 100,000
 SMEs (suppliers). However, the use of other alternative non-credit products is well below its
 market potential. Financial leasing works effectively, although the number of transactions is still
 low (9,184 registered in 2015). More recently, warehouse receipt financing has been
 significantly amended by the financial sector reform to boost its usage.

 17. Banks are the major players in the SME business with highly standardized credit
 products. Well behind, a large number of other financial institutions (regulated and non-
 regulated) of all sizes cater to some SME segments. Credit unions and SOFOM are the most
 active institutions in credits to SMEs, although there is significant dispersion by size of the
 institution. Some credit unions offer leasing and 7 have transformed into level 2 to start offering
 factoring. Most of the credit is working capital and revolving credit for investment have a
 relatively share in the total portfolio (generally not more than 15 percent). Cooperatives are less

active in the development of SME products, while SOFIPO are more concentrated in the lower
end of the SME segment.

18. OFIs face a number of growth and market development challenges to effectively
serve the lower end of the SME segment, including funding difficulties and institutional
capacity. The unregulated non deposit taking SOFOMs –conceived as a mean to provide credit
to the informal sector under more flexible conditions– face funding difficulties. With more than
1,400 entities and $273 bn in assets, many SOFOM lack proper credit processes and adequate
corporate governance and risk management practices because they are unregulated by the
CNBV. Access to wholesale funding through commercial and development banks, as well as
through the capital market, is reduced, limiting the expansion of the sector.

19. The role of credit unions in the provision of credits to SMEs is limited. These
institutions can only operate with their members, which necessarily have to be registered with
an economic activity as identified by their tax registration. The 98 credit unions authorized by
CNBV –with total assets of MXN 48,8 billion and only 70 thousand members– cover different
type of economic activities. There is an important dispersion in size of the institutions; the
smaller ones face more difficulties in complying with the regulatory requirements (especially
regarding corporate governance) and in getting funding. Credit unions have access to NAFIN
support programs (through credit and/or guarantee lines), albeit only the big ones (the minimum
capital of a credit union required by the NAFIN´s credit policies is MXN 40 million, compared
with the MXN 14 million included in the regulation of CNBV).

20. The SOFIPO are more concentrated in microcredit, consumer and small size
commercial loans. These entities are comprised by limited liability companies offering both
lending and deposit services. The 44 authorized institutions have only MXN 25 billion of assets
and more than 3.2 million clients. Almost half of these institutions have very limited activity
and capacity, and should consolidate in the near term to remain viable. The SOFIPOs have
similar activity as banks, with laxer general regulatory requirements but very strict
concentration limits. On average, the great majority (85 percent) of the commercial loans are
directed to working capital, while the rest is allocated to investment financing. Despite being
long in operation, the sector faces difficulties to mature the business and to generate profit in a
systematic way. In some cases, a financial group might have combination of different OFIs, and
clients are directed to operate in one or other institution depending on the transaction involved.
The regulatory arbitrage is limited by the requirement to apply the regulation corresponding to
the regulated institutions with more assets in their balance sheet.

21. The SOCAPs, which have reasonable levels of liquidity and capital, are not much
active in lending. This conservative attitude is reflected by the limited development of new
financial products in line with the potential needs of their members, and their concern in terms
of the eventual difficulties to inject new capital (due to the cooperative structure) in case there is
need derived from a rapid increase in their risk weight assets. Additionally, many of these
institutions have only been recently authorized by the CNBV, and are in the process of
complying with the regulatory requirements.




                                                 5
 22. The venture capital market industry appears to have taken off and is quickly
 developing, leading to significant progress in closing the early stage funding gap. The
 launch of new programs to develop equity finance 13 and increased budget allocation for seed
 capital funds is particularly relevant for SMEs as venture capital offers an alternative source of
 finance which allows them to invest and grow. According to data from the Latin American
 Private Equity & Venture Capital Association (LAVCA), Mexico has the second most active
 industry in Latin America behind Brazil -Mexico saw a record US$2.3b invested through 88
 transactions in 2015, up 80 percent in number of deals and 72 percent in amount invested year-
 on-year. 14 According to an OECD study, Mexico is the country that has made the most progress
 in promoting start-ups between 2012 and 2016.

 23. Angel investment remains scarce, with very few participants. Angel investing can
 also help push entrepreneurship in Mexico by attracting equity for SMEs, which despite the
 progress achieved, typically face funding constraints in early stages related to, for example,
 financial institutions requiring that clients have two years of operating experience prior to
 applying for a loan. Given the size and the relevance of the market, it also represents an
 attractive opportunity for investors.

                                           Box 1. FinTech in Mexico

  As stated in a recent report by the World Economic Forum, FinTech has the potential to become a game
  changer for SMEs. Financial Technology has provided core innovations with potential to enhance SMEs
  access to finance. Marketplace (peer-to-peer lending), Merchant and e-commerce finance, invoice
  finance, supply chain finance, and trade finance are five key credit products for funding small
  businesses 15.

  Developing at a fast pace, Mexico´s FinTech Ecosystem is becoming a powerful trend. More players are
  coming together including collaborations between Mexican financial institutions and FinTech startups,
  which are growing in number and expanding their services portfolio, offering financing solutions, and
  producing credit scores using non-traditional data sources for fast and cost-effective risk assessments.

  Moreover, the National Policy on Financial Inclusion, released in June, 2016, benefits Mexican FinTech
  Ecosystem. The Policy aims to leverage the use of technological innovations to increase the use of
  financial products and services. Relevant elements considered in the National Policy include: a)
  Permanent revision of the regulatory framework to allow entrance of technological innovations; b)
  Establishment of coordination mechanisms to develop a regulatory framework that fosters financial
  inclusion; c) Open platform that allows for interconnectivity; d) Developing programs with
  development banks to support financial intermediaries in the adoption of new technologies; e)
  Coordination with Telcos and the Ministry of communications to expand the supply of mobile services;
  and f) Analysis on the convenience to allow the entrance of new business models that seek to reduce the
  use of cash. There is a critical need for an adequate financial regulation that offers security for all and
  allows to steady growth in the current FinTech Industry.

13
   The creation of the National Institute of Entrepreneurship (INADEM) in 2013 has strengthened the institutional
framework for start-ups in the country, it has supported over 390,000 projects, and has contributed to the creation of
35 new funds through its different programs.

Recommendations

•      The possibility of the SOFOMs of being voluntarily regulated by CNBV could help
       solving its funding constrains. The model of originating, packaging and securitizing
       loans originated by SOFOMs presents the challenge of negative past experiences, and
       requires institutional capacity on the requirements and processes to follow, as well as a
       need to get the initial funds to start loan origination. The financial gap, as well as
       enhancements for increasing the appetite of the capital market or commercial banks for
       these instruments, could be addressed through financial assistance from the development
       banks.

•      The Federations, as well as BANSEFI, could play a key role in helping the
       development of new credit products for SOCAPs and SOFIPOs, as well as
       strengthening risk management practices and internal systems and procedures. BANSEFI
       has programs in place to provide technical assistance to both SOCAPs and SOFIPOs, as
       well as to the federations. In order to attract and keep the SOCAPs federated, the
       federations and confederations need to provide services with real value added. In the case
       of the SOFIPOs, the federations perform auxiliary supervision duties and offer other
       services to the institutions, such as technical, legal and financial advice, as well as
       training services.

•      The diversification limits for SOFIPO should be revised to facilitate the
       development and placement of credit products for SMEs. The maximum credit
       exposure to natural persons of 7%, 5% and 3% of capital for SOFIPOs level 1, 2 and 3-4
       respectively, and 7% of capital for legal persons -for any level of SOFIPO- should be
       reconsidered upwards, with the aim to evaluate the potential impact on the grant of loans
       to SME by these institutions. Although the diversification is a sound prudential practice,
       especially for institutions that are deposit taking, very strict limits could be
       counterproductive for the reasonable development of business and attendance of financial
       needs of SMEs (specially for the institutions that are growing in their business while they
       are increasing their level of operations).

                 C.     PRODUCT DIVERSITY & APPROPRIATENESS FOR SMES

24. The three financing products most used by SMEs are (i) corporate credit card, (ii)
revolving credit and (iii) factoring and leasing. In addition some entities offer term credit but
still it is limited to short term credit. In general MSMEs do not have at their disposal adequate
credit products and creditors claim that they do not have sufficient and affordable information to
offer other types of products to SMEs.
Collateralized Credit

25. Credit to SMEs is usually accompanied by an alternate source of repayment in case
of default, which may take the form of public guarantees, real guarantees (secured credit),
or personal guarantees (unsecured credit). Public guarantees are generally development

                                                7
 bank guarantees under the various programs and entities within the National Guarantee System.
 Real guarantees are any type of transaction in which the lender takes a real (in rem) right over
 immovable or movable property collateral. Personal guarantees are transactions that rely on the
 person (rather than the property) as the source of repayment, but which are typically
 accompanied by signed IOUs and formal promissory notes (pagarés) considered executive
 instruments that provide payment privileges and procedural advantages in case of default.
 Credit transactions in Mexico frequently take a combination of two or all three types of
 guarantees.
 a.    Public Guarantees

 26. Public guarantees are the most commonly used, alternate source of repayment for
 SMEs. State banks and government programs have created several programs to incentivize
 lending to SMEs (described more in detail in the next section). These include reciprocal and
 partial credit guarantees, as well as direct and second tier loans, within programs of Bancomext,
 Banobras, Nafin, Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal (SHF) and and Fideicomisos Instituidos en
 Relación con la Agricultura (FIRA). The total budget of these programs, however, is
 approximately US$10 billion, while the total credit gap for SME financing is estimated at over
 US$60 billion. 16 In order to close the credit gap, substantial SME lending from the private
 sector is necessary.
 b.     Real Guarantees: Immovable and Movable Collateral

 27. Real guarantees, also known as rights in rem, are rights that attach to specific
 property and are enforceable against all parties. In credit transactions, real guarantees are
 covered to collateral, which can be either immovable or movable.

 28. The real estate mortgage works well in Mexico, however SMEs have very limited
 access to immovable (real estate) collateral. When available, lenders commonly extend credit
 using immovable collateral (real estate). High origination costs and lengthy enforcement
 delays, however, may adversely impact their use. To avoid delays in the realization process, for
 example, lenders often combine real estate mortgages with a public guarantee. The financial
 sector reforms made numerous improvements in the operation of real estate mortgages,
 primarily to incentivize refinancing when terms are favorable to the borrower and to limit the
 practice of taking double guarantees.

 29. In contrast, while SME assets are greatly concentrated in movable goods, they
 continue to be extremely underused as collateral. Despite reforms —which added modern
 legal forms for taking security in movables, created a centralized and modern collateral registry
 and provided substantial extra judicial remedies in case of default— use of land continues to
 outpace use of movables as collateral, at a ratio of over 10 to 1. Almost in direct contrast,
 however, the assets of SMEs are concentrated in movables at a ratio of almost 5 to 1. That is to
 say, while only 20 percent of SME assets are movables, lenders require real estate as collateral
 90 percent of the time.

30. Movables are currently used as security in less than 3 percent of transactions, but
could increase significantly given proper incentives and capacity building. Challenges
remain to improve the current legal framework, but lenders should consider using movables as
collateral to a much greater extent. Lenders, however, have little incentives to test reforms,
relying instead on public guarantees or real estate when available. Public guarantees could be
structured to provide said incentives. In addition, awareness raising and capacity building could
help lenders develop the financial products and knowhow necessary to take advantage of the
SME market and movable collateral.

c.     Personal Guarantees

31. Personal guarantees also play an important role in SME financing, with owners or
shareholders frequently asked to sign personal promissory notes for business debts.
Unlike real guarantees which attach to property, personal guarantees are rights in personam,
which are enforceable only against the person(s) obligated under the loan. Lenders frequently
complement real guarantees with personal guarantees, not to protect against default, necessarily,
but to protect against potential delay tactics by the borrower. Alternative measures should be
considered to ensure timely payment, rather than combining personal debts with business
purposes.

Non-Credit Products

32. In addition to using its movable property for secured credit, SMEs can also use its
movables in other operations to obtain capital, through alternative sources of financing or
liquidity mechanisms. Other financing products that use movables for liquidity or credit,
include: financial leasing, factoring (with recourse and without recourse), and warehouse receipt
financing. Each has different degrees of use and some have been recently updated in structure
or legal features to increase the effectiveness of each.

a.     Financial Leases

33. Financial leasing works quite effectively, although the number of contracts
registered in the RUG in 2015 reached only 9,184. Under a financial lease contract, a leasing
company acquires equipment and grant their use, for a fixed term, to a lessee. In return, the lessee
is obligated to remit partial payments in an amount necessary to cover the acquisition price of the
goods, finance charges and other accessories. Leases are typically granted by SOFOMEs under the
General Law of Auxiliary Credit Associations. However, other financial institutions may issue
leases under the specific leasing law, while other institutions may do so as well without being
subject to regulation. In general, a lease requires setting up one of three term-end options.
Financial leases must be in writing and are now required to be registered in the RUG. As the law
and practice currently stand, financial leases work effectively and provide a legally certain and
enforceable manner in which to finance the purchase of equipment.




                                                9
b.    Factoring/Invoice Discounting

34. Factoring involves the purchase and transfer of accounts, generally electronic invoices,
typically payable within 30 to 90 days. Technically, factoring transactions involve the outright
sale of the instruments and do not entail the granting of any type of security interest. In other
words, the factor is not lending money to the manufacturer and securing the loan with the accounts,
but instead is simply buying the manufacturer's accounts for cash, in much the same way any other
assets would be bought.

35. Legal reforms in 2014 included a requirement that all factoring transactions must
be registered in the collateral registry. The registration of factoring transactions helps
eliminate secret liens and brings Mexico in line with international best practices. There is some
evidence, however, that registration of factoring agreements is not universally taking place.
Discussions with NAFIN suggest the estimated size of the factoring market to exceed 3,000,000
transactions annually. In 2015, however, only 524,547 factoring transactions were registered in
the RUG. On reason for this large discrepancy can be simple lack of awareness with recent legal
requirements to register. Another reason includes difficulties with bulk registrations in the
RUG, cited by financial institutions during the mission. In either case, steps must be taken to
ensure compliance with this legal requirement. Doing so will provide certainty to secured
creditors and to factoring companies that the accounts receivable that they are acquiring an
interest in have not been previously encumbered.

c.    Value Chain Financing

36. Value chain financing has produced significant economic benefits to SMEs in
Mexico under the NAFIN system. The system by which NAFIN extends financing to banks,
which in turn extend financing to SMEs via the eventual discounting of invoices presents a
highly successful model, which has begun to be used in other markets in the region and around
the world. The program currently reaches 680 firms and approximately 100,000 SME suppliers
of those firms.

37. Large numbers of factoring transactions that take place on the NAFIN platform,
however, do not currently comply with the registration requirement. The sheer volume of
transactions that have to be registered may be a problem, especially considering that there is
currently no system in the RUG to interface with factoring platforms. In addition, the capacity
of RUG to accept large-number bulk registrations has been cited as a concern by some financial
institutions. Recent system (software and hardware) updates cited by the RUG, however,
should correct these problems.

d.    Warehouse Receipts Financing

38. Warehouse receipt financing in Mexico has historically been very beneficial to the
agricultural sector, but is affected by an inconsistent duality between the certificate of
deposit and the pledge coupon. When movable goods are warehoused, the Ley General de
Organizaciones y Actividades Auxiliares del Crédito requires both the issuance of a certificate of
deposit and pledge bond whenever applicable. The former evidences the ownership of the
warehoused goods, while the latter evidences a security interest therein. Typically these
                                               10
 documents are issued jointly, but can be separated. Given that under the legal system, the
 holder of the certificate of deposit can endorse the title to a third party, the creditor that takes a
 security interest in the certificate via one or more pledge bonds will also require the delivery of
 the certificate –to avoid ownership being assigned from under him/her. This creates a strange
 legal fiction where a bank will be lender over and owner of the same piece of collateral. The
 Ministry of Economy has begun to explore the elimination of this duality by requiring the
 issuance of a single document, and requiring registration of security interests in a warehouse
 receipts registry.

 39. Warehouse receipt financing has also been significantly amended by the financial
 sector reforms, which have added governance requirements and by creating a new
 Federal Warehouse Registry –Registro Único de Certificados, Almacenes y Mercancías,
 ‘RUCAM’. The new registry is operated by the Ministry of Economy and allows for a federal,
 centralized and unitary registration location. The registry is completely electronic and
 accessible anywhere online. Third parties can now consult the existence of a deposit and of the
 warehouse receipt, to receive certification that the goods represented by the certificate of
 deposit are actually stored in the mentioned warehouse.

 40. The Ministry of Economy is also considering potential further reforms, including
 the needed migration from the paper-based warehouse receipt system, to an electronic
 warehouse receipt system that would work in unison with the RUCAM. Together, the
 creation of the registry, the creation of the electronic receipt, and the elimination of the potential
 conflict between the certificate of deposit and the pledge bond, will add significant certainty in
 the use of warehouse receipts as collateral for agricultural SMEs

                                   D.     PUBLIC SECTOR COMMITMENT

 41. The government plays a critical role through the development banks (e.g. NAFIN
 and Bancomext) in promoting credit to SMEs through guarantees and second tier finance
 programs. The government has played an active role in supporting the real economy through
 the creation and support of multiple state funds and programs. Half of the SME credit portfolio
 is originated through government support programs. Banks have developed and adapted their
 SME business models to fit to the design of the government schemes. Results have been
 significant in terms of credit volume directed to SMEs, as well as in reduced interest rates paid
 by borrowers.

 42. Guarantees have been found to improve financial conditions for participating firms
 and to support employment. A CNBV study found guarantees reduced interest rates by about
 100 bp. (on average) and that increased coverage in pari-passu guarantees was associated to
 larger loan amounts but not in the case of first loss guaranteed loans 17. A study from UNAM
 found that the main effect of the guarantee was that recipient firms were able to maintain jobs.
 However it found no widespread effects on productivity, employment generated or installed
 capacity.

43. Meanwhile, effects on bringing new borrowers to the system have yet to be properly
evaluated. Development Banks do not monitor the number of new borrowers supported by the
guarantee program and there is no provision preventing eligibility for firms that already have
long credit histories. While useful to facilitate banks involvement in SME lending, indefinite
continuation of the program may reduce incentives to improve risk management systems.
Overtime the guarantee program (established more than a decade ago) has been successful in
inducing banks to provide SME loans and currently most universal commercial banks
participate in the program. However, as there is no mandatory graduation from the program, it
may disincentive banks to improve risk management systems and to use movable guarantees.


               Box 2. Mexico: Development Bank Support Programs for SME Finance

    NAFIN and Bancomext operate several MSME programs with well-defined target segments. NAFIN
    attends MSMEs in services, manufacturing and commercial construction. Bancomext targets export and
    import oriented SMEs (larger on average that NAFIN target population) and SMEs in tourism mainly
    for construction or rehabilitation of facilities. All NAFIN operations in the SME space are second-tier;
    either credit lines to financial intermediaries servicing MSMEs or guarantees. Bancomext provides
    mostly direct loans as well as guarantees for firms providing dollar loans to exporting SMEs. In
    addition, FIRA and FND offer products for MSEMs in agricultural sector and rural areas.

    Guarantee schemes in Mexico are portfolio schemes in which the lender request the guarantee, analyses
    the credit risk of the borrower and assume credit risk jointly with the DB. NAFIN manages both pari-
    passu and first-loss guarantees, while all Bancomext schemes (administer by NAFIN as well) are pari-
    passu. Coverage ratios depend on the program1. Banks are only allowed to require additional real estate
    guarantees on top of the guarantee for larger sized loans. The fact that SMEs do not know their credit is
    guaranteed, mitigates moral hazard behavior on the part of the borrower. To mitigate moral hazard on
    the part of the lender, price of the guarantee is risk-adjusted. NAFIN allocates its guarantees through an
    auction to the banks requesting the lowest coverage level. Interest rates in the biggest program is caped
    at TIEE+ 7. Two years ago the coverage rate was fixed and banks would bid on the interest rate. This
    change was expected to reduce the final coverage rate demanded by banks, increasing the multiplier
    effect of the guarantee on total SME portfolio. However, more granular data on final recipients together
    with stronger monitoring and evaluation of the schemes are needed to assess the impact of the program.


    1/ Coverage ratios depend on the program, with a final auctioned coverage ratio in the case of the global massive
    programs, and going up to 80% in the case of sectoral directed credit programs –with the exception of disaster support
    programs that have a coverage of 100 percent.



Recommendations

•         Guarantee programs should be phased out for firms with long credit histories. This
          could be done gradually, by progressively reducing the coverage ratio on loan portfolios
          for these type of firms. Considerations should be given to increase the cost of the
          guarantee to bring it closer to market rates.


                                                               12
•       A pilot guarantee product to stimulate the use of movable collateral by banks could
        be designed. DBs could design a second-loss guarantee on a portfolio of SME credits
        with movable collateral. In event of default, the lender should attempt to execute
        collateral and in case of recovery levels below a certain threshold, the government
        guarantee could be called upon. The design of this product would facilitate exit from the
        previous scheme, as lending rates should remain relatively similar to those of the current
        guarantee program. As banks and supervisors increasingly become familiar with the
        management of movable collateral, banks will have less incentives to rely on government
        guarantees.

•       Develop a strong monitoring and evaluation framework for state support schemes.
        Careful evaluation of the impact on access conditions to SME loans should be conducted.
        New SME programs should also include a sunset clause for benefits received under the
        program. To mitigate risks is important to anchor public expectations about the duration
        of a particular program from inception. This would be particularly appropriate in
        programs designed to address information asymmetries.

•       Development banks should play a key role in providing liquidity and guarantee to
        OFIs for expanding SME finance. As most of the loans to SMEs are for working
        capital, programs could be designed to support the provision of medium/long term
        investment facilities to SMEs, enabling them to increase their productivity and
        competitiveness. In terms of supporting the improvement (amount, financial conditions,
        etc.) of working capital loans, the programs could also be oriented to certain financial
        products (factoring, leasing) that have the capacity to reduce risks in an efficient way and
        seems to be underdeveloped within the OFIs.

 Credit Reporting Systems

 44. Well-functioning credit reporting systems are critical to support credit origination,
 particularly through the assessment of credit-worthiness. Credit reporting systems should be
 able to collect in-depth data (e.g. including both positive and negative data) from all relevant
 credit providers (including non-financial credit providers) to support the evaluation of
 creditworthiness of individuals and SMEs. Constraints to increasing the reach of credit
 reporting systems (i.e. to a more complete range of providers) and improving the scope and
 quality of data provided (e.g. that related to credit repayment behavior) should be addressed. If
 relevant to the particular market, the analysis can also discuss challenges related to the inclusion
 of additional sources of credit data, including companies registries, utility companies, rental,
 tuition, and others 18.

  Key references for an access to finance analysis of credit reporting systems are the World Bank General Principles
for Credit Reporting (in particular GP1, GP4 and GP5) 2011 and the ICCR Facilitating SME Finance Through
Improved Credit Reporting Systems, 2014 and Credit Reporting Systems as an Enabler to Responsible Access to
Finance (forthcoming 2016).

 45. The number of MSMEs registered at the Registrar of Commerce and Property as of
 May 2016 is of 662,863 although there are many other informal companies operating in
 the country 19. In the context of Mexico MSMEs are companies with less than 250 employees
 or 100 for the case of commerce and services sectors. Annual sales should not be higher than
 250 million pesos or have debt above 3 million UDIS. The largest portion of companies are
 those with less than 10 employees although there are no statistics on the number of sole
 proprietors out of those.

 46. Regulated financial institutions are mandated to report to the CRS. Mainly four
 types of creditors provide credit or finance MSMEs; (i) banks with large branch networks (ii)
 niche banks or regional banks (ii) other financial intermediaries and (iv) non-financial
 institutions financing MSMEs. The first three first types of institutions listed are subject to
 creditworthiness evaluation, credit reports and capital requirements. However as of 2012 20, 64
 percent of MSMEs still relied on credit from relatives or friends to finance their business needs.
 This type of financing is not recorded in the CRS. The vast majority of MSMEs are served by
 OFIs.




19
   According to the Confederación de Cámaras de Servicios, Comercio y Turismo, 58% of existing MSMEs in
México are informal and not registered with the Tax authority Servicio de Administracion Tributaria (SAT)in 2015.

 47. The CRS is composed by two consumer credit bureaus 21 and one commercial credit
 bureau. There is not credit registry 22 or commercial credit reporting company 23. There is
 also the Sistema Electrónico de Publicaciones Mercantiles where the companies can publish
 their financial statements. Buró de Crédito and Círculo de Crédito serve the consumer credit
 market with comprehensive credit information and sophisticated value added services. However
 the MSME credit market still lacks useful products to effectively evaluate the creditworthiness
 of MSMEs. There is no credit registry and while the CNBV captures information through the
 supervisory reporting file R04, and Banxico captures information from the regulated entities
 through the Portfolio Responsibilities Relationship Report (previously SENICREB), the
 information is not granular enough and does not cover all entities that provide some type of
 finance to MSMEs. Finally, despite the existence of a commercial credit bureau, there is no
 commercial credit reporting company in the country and credit rating agencies are not yet
 developing any specific product for MSMEs.

 48. There are a large number of credit providers submitting data to the credit bureaus,
 however the credit bureau industry is mostly based on consumer credit and very little
 attention has been paid to the MSME market. It is relevant mentioning that along the years a
 number of international credit bureaus have tried to enter the Mexican market with no success

21
   Credit bureau is defined as network exchange of credit information and other related information supplied by both
regulated and non-regulated entities and other sources. This network facilitates the exchange of credit information
among banks and financial institutions but can also include other entities participating in transactions involving
deferred payments. The primary role of a credit bureau is to collect and distribute credit data from different sources,
synthesize it and distribute it back to the network participants, typically for a fee as well as their value added
services.
22
   Credit Registry is defined as a defined as a network exchange of credit information typically operated by the
Central Bank or other financial supervisory body. These registries are usually operated on a not-for-profit basis, and
collect information on creditworthiness of firms and individuals generally supplied by regulated entities on a
systematic and typically compulsory basis. Credit registries are frequently set up to facilitate banking supervision
and typically collect information only above a certain threshold.
23
   Commercial Credit Reporting Companies or Credit Reporting Agencies are entities that collect information on
trade credit from business to business lending and bank lending. Information collected refers to businesses,
including sole proprietorships, partnerships and corporations for the purpose of credit risk assessment, credit scoring
or for other business purposes such as the extension of trade credit. They usually collect data directly from
businesses not from the banks.
                                                          15
 and currently are developing value added services to the different creditors. In 2015 there were
 154,242,881 individuals and 3,764,454 firms 24currently included in both Buró de Crédito and
 Círculo de Crédito.

 49. Typically credit information for SMEs is developed by a number of different types
 of Credit Reporting Service Providers (CRSPs) which sometimes overlap depending on
 the size and level of development of the company. Credit rating agencies develop credit
 information services for corporates and public trading companies, commercial credit reporting
 companies cover information from bank loans, but also from trade credit collected directly from
 the companies and credit bureaus cover information on sole proprietor or microenterprises as
 regards to their loan repayment history with banks and other financial institutions as well as
 retailers and telecommunication companies. Finally, credit registries tend to capture
 information from credit provided by regulated entities and typically focus on large exposure. In
 addition some countries have also developed a balance sheet database created with information
 self-reported by companies on a voluntary basis.

 a.     Data Quality

 50. Credit information for SMEs is incomplete and does not reflect the repayment
 behavior of companies in a comprehensive manner. Creditors offering credit products to
 SMEs tend to use transactional proprietary information to offer credit related products to their
 own clients. For new clients, most of them reported 25 to use internal scoring models and limited
 credit bureau reports to assess new SMEs. For instance, the information on companies that
 creditors would find useful (e. g. cash flow, related parties, age and latest activity of the
 company, supply credit) is not available in the reports and there are no scoring products within
 the credit bureau on SMEs. There are ongoing developments to have in place a credit score for
 SMEs by both Buró de Crédito and Círculo de Crédito but none of them have included
 additional information related to; (i) age of the company, (ii) value and date of last valuation,
 (iii) supply finance information (iv) new forms of financing for MSMEs including peer to peer
 lending and (v) transactional data. In addition, there are still a large number of SOFOMEs and
 other credit companied providing credit to MSMEs not reporting to the credit bureaus.
 According to a study developed by Banco de Mexico in 2015, only 16 percent of the SOFOMEs
 report data to the credit bureaus. Finally, data formats differ significantly from one CRSP to
 another and compliance regarding data submission is still uneven across all participants (e.g.
 delays in data submission, free riders).

 b.     CRSPS and Data Providers/Users Governance

 51. The current governance arrangements in some credit bureaus impede the
 development of value added services tailored to MSMEs. Currently the Board of Buró de
 Crédito is composed by representatives of entities that are also technology service providers to
 the bureau. Thus, the adoption of some decisions which could be beneficial for the bureau and
 its users might conflict with interest of the service provider. While Buró de Crédito has

24
   Please note that SAT only has 662, 863 companies registered as per 2015. It could be a supplication of number of
companies as the figure provided consolidates data from both credit bureaus but also take into consideration the lack
of information regarding status of the companies (active/non active).

 introduced some measures to mitigate those risks such as requesting proposals from different
 service providers, incentives are still strong in avoiding decisions which could not benefit the
 technological service providers. In addition, some users of the CRS –namely the largest banks–
 are also shareholders of Buró de Crédito. This also limits incentives from users to develop
 products that would allow competition for certain clients 26. This situation in both CRSPs,
 together with the fact that the number of reports continues to increase, does not provide any
 incentives to the CRSPs to develop value added services which require certain investment.
 c.     Legal and Regulatory Framework 27

 52. The current oversight function regarding CRS in Mexico is charged to the CNBV,
 the Banxico, the SHCP and the Consumer Protection Agencies –Condusef and
 Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor (Profeco). The SHCP authorizes the constitution of
 credit bureaus as financial entities. The CNBV is charged with the supervision of credit bureaus
 and conducts examinations as well as monitors legal compliance of regulated participating
 entities. The Banco de Mexico regulates data provision, quality of data, requirements for the
 issuing of credit reports and information retention periods (for credits under certain amount).
 The Condusef acts as an arbitrator in disputes between clients and financial services providers.
 It also supervises and regulates financial institutions to guarantee the protection of client’s
 interest. The Profeco has the power to impose sanctions on commercial companies that provide
 and require data to Credit Bureaus. It has power over data protection when commercial firms
 require data to Credit Bureaus without the proper authorization from the client. It could also act
 as an arbitrator between clients and data providers over a credit information dispute. The
 Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica (COFECE) Commission guarantees competition
 amongst economic agents and prevents monopolies, monopolistic practices, concentration and
 other restrictions to the efficient functioning of markets.

 53. Legal and regulatory reforms introduced by the authorities have resulted in an
 increase of data providers to the credit bureaus. Since 2005, authorities have been leading
 extraordinary efforts towards the sharing of comprehensive credit information. The different
 reforms in 2005, 2007, 2010 and more recently in 2014, have led to an increased number of data
 providers submitting data to the credit bureaus. The recent financial sector reform impacted
 also the credit reporting systems in the following aspects:

 •      Ley General de Organizaciones y Actividades Auxiliares del Crédito (LGOAAC)
        includes mandatory provisions for SOFOMES (regulated and non-regulated) to report


26
   At least 69 percent of the shares of Buró de Crédito consumer and commercial is owned by the largest banks,
while the rest is owned by technological partners (Trans union and Dun & Bradstreet). In the case of Círculo de
Crédito, 54 percent of the shares are owned by commercial banks while the rest is owned by individuals which are
also owners of some of the institutions owning Círculo de Crédito.
27
   The main laws covering CRS aspects include: Law on Credit Information Companies (Ley para Regular las
Sociedades de Información Crediticia, 2002), Law on Transparency (Ley para la Transparencia y Ordenamiento de
los Servicios Financieros, 2007), Law on Credit Organizations and Ancillary Activities (Ley General de
Organizaciones y Actividades Auxiliares del Crédito, 1985), Banking Law (Ley de Instituciones de Crédito, 1990)
the Competition Law (Ley Federal de Competencia Económica, 2014), and la Ley del Banco de México issued in
1993 and Ley de la Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores, 1995. Regulation issued by the CNBV and the Banco
de Mexico27 are also part of the legal and regulatory framework for CRS.
                                                      17
             data to at least one of the existing credit bureaus and to access credit reports for each
             credit granted 28.
 •           Additional power is provided to the Banco de México regarding data submission to credit
             bureaus 29.
 •           The Federal Government can establish a credit registry. 30

 54. Credit bureaus exchange credit information to a certain degree. Since 2007, credit
 bureaus have been exchanging negative credit information from their respective databases. The
 exchange of positive credit information has taken more time. It started in 2008, was made
 mandatory in 2010 every time that a credit report was issued and in 2013 this measure was
 finally implemented. Article 36 of the Law on credit information companies provides for the
 exchange of credit information between credit bureaus.

55. There is no clear legal provision regarding the property of the data included in the
credit bureau databases, however such information is considered unique and a relevant
input for credit and financing decision making. There are several technological companies
offering scoring products and other value added services to banks and other financial
institutions, however the reciprocity criteria impedes them to access the information included in
the credit bureaus. Information is collected from consumers regarding their relation with other
institutions, but also additional information is added from other sources. The credit bureaus
have invested in the development of the necessary infrastructure to collect and organize the data
from the different sources. The users of information are typically those that have been feeding
the credit bureaus.

Recommendations

•      Authorities should continue to encourage participation of relevant data providers to
       the existing credit reporting providers. The latest regulatory reform fostered the
       participation of additional data providers to the credit bureaus including Infonavit and
       Fovisste. Nonetheless, there are still other relevant sources such as: (i) Registro Público
       de la Propiedad y de Comercio, (ii) RUG, and (iii) Sistema Electronico de Publicaciones
       de Sociedades Mercantiles and (iv)identification of companies. Box 3 below shows
       minimum data items for a comprehensive report on SMEs.

 •      Identification of individuals and companies could be improved by adopting a unique
        identification number for individuals and companies. The efforts led internationally
        by Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) could help the authorities in México to develop a
        common identifier which is also broadly used in financial sector globally.

 •      Credit reporting service providers should develop value added services tailored to
        SMEs and include additional relevant data into the credit reports for SMEs. This
        information should include, among others, age of the company, latest date of activity, and
        information from supplier financing arrangements. In developing value added services,
        CRSPs could consider the possibility of integrating information from consumer reports
        into commercial, enhancing the overall credit information, particularly when it relates to
        microenterprises. The recommendation is consistent with previous study conducted by
        Banxico in 2015, “Reporte sobre las condiciones de competencia en el otorgamiento de
        crédito a las pequeñas y medianas empresas (PYME)”. The development of value added
        services such as scoring models should be based on specific data that reflects better the
        nature of risk in the SMEs lending as opposed to the risk embedded in consumer
        lending 31. Annex 1 includes the UK example, where authorities concentrated efforts to
        improve SME credit information.

 •      Authorities are encouraged to explore the option of allowing third parties 32 to access
        credit bureau data and further exploit such data. Authorities should conduct a study
        to identify potential further use of the information included in the databases by third
        parties.

 •      Collaboration and cooperation among authorities should be strengthened. A large
        number of authorities are involved in the oversight of credit bureaus, yet there is no
        primary overseer or common strategy to further develop credit reporting systems in the
        country. The adoption of a credit reporting council could serve as a useful instrument for
        authorities to identify areas of improvement, set up a clear long term objective and work
        together towards achieving such objective. In defining objectives public policies related
        to financial stability, financial inclusion and competition should be taken into
        consideration. The oversight should aim at reliable, safe and efficient credit bureaus
        beyond legal compliance and develop instruments and tools to effectively conduct such
        oversight including collaboration and cooperation between authorities. Main aspects that
        remain to be solved include; (i) data quality, (ii) convergence of reporting between
        CRSPs 33, (iii) development of adequate products and services meeting the needs of the
        users, (iv) data access by third parties, (v) monitoring data submission by all relevant
        participants to the CRSPs, (v) improving the credit reporting for SMEs.

 •      Authorities should continue working on the implementation of article 7 Bis of the
        Ley para Regular las Sociedades de Información Crediticia which enables them to
        create a credit registry. This registry would be used for financial regulation and

information services to banks and other financial institutions.

      supervision, allowing for a better monitoring of the credit market, and would not require
      consumers’ consent. Creating and maintaining a central database will facilitate having a
      unified diagnosis of the credit information within the country. This will be done through:
      (i) incorporating information about all financial entities that grant credit, (ii) improving
      the quality of the database through centralizing the information in a specialized unit for
      its exploitation and (iii) giving access to the database to other financial authorities.

Secured Transactions

56. The effective use of collateral greatly improves the availability and cost of credit in
an economy, particularly for SMEs that do not count with long standing businesses and
credit histories. Although enforcement delays reduce the value of real estate as collateral,
Mexico’s legal framework has fostered common use of real property as collateral for a loan. It is
estimated that up to 80 percent of SME’s assets are concentrated in movables (e.g. equipment,
inventory, accounts receivable and deposit accounts) and that 99 percent of SMEs do not own
real estate. However, Mexican banks require real property as collateral for approximately 87
percent of secured loans, and only take movable collateral in approximately 13 percent of the
time. In addition, banks require public guarantees approximately 50 percent of the time, as well
as personal guarantees, on top of the real and movable property collateral.

a.    Immovable Assets

57. In the case of real estate collateral, the substantive rules are clear and use of land
mortgages commonplace, but loan origination fees and enforcement costs can be
significant. Real estate mortgages are commonplace and rules are clear and predictable.
However, the process involves significant formalities and costs for creation and filing of
mortgages. Documentation requires intervention of notaries and recording in the public registry
for the state in which the land is located. Both steps add to the price of a loan, calculated on a
percentage of the loan amount. Although these costs vary state to state, they frequently add
around 3 percentage points or more to the cost of the loan.

58. High costs have historically made it difficult for borrowers to switch from one credit
provider to another, even when more favorable terms are offered. When refinancing,
                                               21
 borrowers must again pay the loan origination, notary and registration fees. This repeat payment
 is required even though there is no added service or benefit obtained from the second payment –
 the notary already verified the existence and transferability of the title, and the registry already
 notified the existence of a loan. Furthermore, some states require an additional fee to remove
 the previous mortgage from the record. As a result, borrowers are unlikely to refinance, given
 the required double payment.

 59. The financial sector reform incentivizes mortgage refinancing when favorable to
 borrowers, by amending subrogation rules and creating a new federal registration. To
 incentivize competition among lenders, and to allow borrowers to take advantage of lower
 interest rates, the financial sector reform reduced registry and notary costs for mortgage
 refinance. To accomplish this objective, the reform allows registration of the new mortgage in
 the Registro Público de la Propiedad y de Comercio, which is free of charge. 34 To be valid,
 however, this federal registration must be mirrored in the State registry systems for the
 jurisdiction in which the property is located. To date, however, only three states accept the new
 filings. As a result, these reforms have not allowed SMEs with real estate loans to take
 advantage of more favorable lending terms.

60.     The financial sector reform limits the enhancement of real estate mortgages with
public sector guarantees, incentivizing a market-based risk analysis for real estate loans.
The financial sector reform prohibits banks that take some public guarantees, from also taking a
real estate mortgage. These requirements have already been incorporated into the lending
practices of some universal banks. However, significant government efforts must also be
directed at reducing enforcement delays, including those caused by court backlogs, judicial
activism and procedural abuses by debtors.
 b.     Movable Assets

61.     Significant progress has been made through multiple legal reforms to facilitate
credit transactions using movable property, but some challenges remain. In 2000 the
Congress added two new modern legal figures, to the number of previously existing legal
figures: the non-possessory pledge and the guarantee trust. 35 In 2009 the law created the
Registro Único de Garantías (RUG, a federal, on-line collateral registry. And, in 2000, 2003 and
2014, México enacted procedural reforms to facilitate recovery in case of default. Since these
reforms, the system has recorded 1,619,265 transactions over movables. 36 Prior to that time, the
combined total volume of registrations for all 32 states, averaged less than 14,000 transactions
per year. Collectively, the legal and institutional framework is moving towards best practices
and international standards, but work remains to be done in key areas.




34
   The federal commercial registry (Registro Público de la Propiedad y de Comercio) is the centralized companies
registry. The principle focus of this entity is the registration of businesses
35
   In 2002 Mexico reformed the Ley General de Títulos y Operaciones de Crédito, adding two modern security
devices: the guarantee trust (fideicomiso en garantía) and the non-possessory pledge (prenda sin transmisión de la
posesión).
36
   Of this amount, nearly one million are factoring transactions, the filing of which has been required since 2014.
                                                        22

 c.      Legal and Regulatory Framework

 62. México has played a leadership role in the development of secured transactions
 systems globally. The legal standards adopted across Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)
 derive from international instruments developed at the United Nations and the Organization of
 American States. These instruments (model laws and legislative guides) provide the structure
 and best practices on secured transactions globally. Mexico has been very active in the
 development and adoption of these instruments and standards. This is also reflected in the
 Doing Business indicator, in which the country ranks prominently on secured transactions. The
 Legal Rights Index measures 12 specific sets of issues, in which Mexico obtains a score of 10
 positive answers out a possible 12 -- well above the regional average in Latin America (5.3/12)
 and OECD countries (6.0/12). 37

 (i)     Uniformity

 63. The Ministry of Economy is currently undertaking a potential reform to combine all
 existing mechanisms into a single, uniform scheme. This will include pledges, chattel
 mortgages, title retention devices, trusts, banking mechanisms, and production guarantees,
 among others. Despite improvements on the DB indicators, reforms failed to consolidate the
 long list of existing security mechanisms into a single uniform law. An over-arching goal of
 modern secured financing systems is to incorporate all types of secured transactions into a
 single security figure 38. Instead, Mexico added two new figures, the guarantee trust
 (fideicomiso en garantía) and the non-possessory pledge (prenda sin transmisión de la
 posesión), into a framework already characterized by multiple offerings. The multiplicity of
 security interests with different characteristics leads to the inability to create a rational and coherent


37
   For a secured transactions system to function effectively, it must have several essential characteristics. The World
Bank Group’s Doing Business Report captures these within its “getting credit” indicator, specifically with respect to
the strength of the legal rights index, which covers ten aspects of laws on security interests and two aspects of
bankruptcy laws. See: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IC.LGL.CRED.XQ.

priority system to handle different interests, and affecting the rights of third party purchasers of
collateral. 39 Annex 2 presents a complete list of the currently existing legal figures.

(ii)   Collateral and Obligation

64.     A modern secured transactions law requires that security interest in an encumbered
asset must extent automatically to its identifiable proceeds. Some, but not all legal figures
incorporate this rule. In general, the guarantee trust allows the automatic extension to both what
is produced with the original collateral as well as what is received on their sale or other
disposition. 40 Likewise, the non-possessory pledge permits an automatic extension to proceeds,
but there is discussion among some lenders whether this right can extend to invoices. Some
lenders expressed doubts, however, whether the original security interest can extend
automatically to future invoices. This is particularly true given that invoices, once they are
issues, have specific date, exact amounts and tax generated identification numbers that (by
definition) cannot be reflected a registration covering future goods. Authorities should consider
whether further clarifications are necessary in the legislation, or whether registry practices (to
allow future amendments once the invoice numbers are issued) could help clarify this issue and
give lender’s confidence that prior interests in future invoices will be protected under the
system.

65.     Likewise, a modern law must provide that a security right may secure any type of
obligation, whether present or future, determined or determinable, conditional or
unconditional, fixed or fluctuating. 41 The law satisfies this recommendation and future
obligations may be secured to a maximum sum. If credit extended by the secured creditor
exceeds this maximum, a new registration is required.




39
   Recommendation 8 of the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide states that a Secured Transactions law “should adopt a
functional approach, under which it covers all rights in movable assets that are created by agreement and secure the
payment or other performance of an obligation, regardless of the form of the transaction or the terminology used by
the parties (including rights of transferees under a transfer of title to tangible assets for security purposes, rights of
an assignee under an assignment of receivables for security purposes, as well as rights of sellers or financial lessors
under various forms of retention-of-title agreements and financial leases, respectively). Except with respect to
acquisition financing, the functional approach should be implemented in a way that classifies all rights securing the
performance of an obligation as security rights and subjects them to a common set of rules.”

                   Box 4: Analysis of Current Security Mechanisms in Mexico

The guarantee trust is a very flexible mechanism easily adopted for numerous transactions,
with fluctuating collateral and revolving obligations. However, associated costs make it difficult
to work for SME loans. The guarantee trust provides dependable priority against third parties
(subsequent lenders and buyers of the collateral), which is also valid in insolvency. The trust transfers
all ownership of the trust assets to the trustee, allowing for immediate extrajudicial enforcement
remedies in case of default. The principal drawback of the trust, however, is that it is expensive to
operate given the need to hire a financial institution to act as fiduciary and to monitor and evaluate
the operation and collateral. Thus, the guarantee trust is very seldom used for SME loans. In 2015
only 5,713 trusts were filed in the RUG.

The non-possessory pledge is also a flexible mechanism for taking security in all types of
movables, without the dispossession of characteristic of traditional pledges. The pledge allows
for the taking of a security interest in generic or revolving collateral, as well as securing fluctuating
loans, it does however retain certain formalities at the creation stage, including the need for notary
intervention in cases where the loan amount exceeds 250,000 UDIS. The pledge also allows for the
extension of the security interest to the proceeds of the originally encumbered collateral. In addition,
the non-possessory pledge does not require the hiring of a trustee to oversee its operation, making it
much more economical than the trust and accessible for SME financing. The biggest disadvantage of
this pledge, however, has been the difficulties in enforcement. Reforms in 2000 and 2003 added
speedier remedies over most types of goods, while 2014 reforms added a new federal jurisdiction in
commercial cases, as well as extrajudicial enforcement remedies over deposit accounts. In 2015,
178,689 non-possessory pledges were filed.

The trust and non-possessory pledge also allow the secured obligation to fluctuate, permitting
the creation of a floating lien, where a pool of transforming collateral can secure a fluctuating
line of credit. To allow this practice, the law allows a security interests to extend to future advances
–loans in the future that are covered by the collateral. Together these practices allow the most
flexible manner in which lenders can structure commercial lines of credit for SMEs.

Of the previously existing figures, the most flexible are the production (refaccionario) and
agricultural (avío) pledges. These mechanisms allow for a security interest to extend to future
goods in the manufacturing or agricultural process, but not to sale proceeds. They also do not
provide extrajudicial remedies. In 2015, 23,329 refaccionarios and 63,185 avíos were recorded. In
addition, Industrial Mortgages provide a flexible mechanism for encumbering the totality of all
business assets. However, this mechanism is used principally to encumber the real estate and, as a
result, very few were recorded in 2015, a total of only 339. Mexico also requires the registration of
all functional equivalents, including financial leases, factoring agreements and conditional sales. In
2015, 524,547 factoring transactions, 9,184 financial leases, and 1004 reservations of title were
recorded.

66. Mexican law requires that the parties execute a written security agreement,
satisfying formalization requirements.       Once the secured party and the secured debtor
execute the security agreement, the security interest is valid between the parties. The parties
may choose to subscribe the contract in a private instrument –without a notary’s involvement.

                                                    25
However, pledges without dispossession and a guarantee trusts that exceed 250,000 UDIS
require some notary participation, which add significant costs at creation Moreover, given that
(a) notary involvement is not necessary in the examination of the contract document, (b)
electronic signatures provide for an effective and secure manner to ensure the veracity of
contracting parties, and (c) that lenders are allowed to register security interests in the RUG
directly (i.e. without notary involvement), this requirement should be eliminated.

(iii) Registration and Priority

67.     The creation of the RUG represents a significant advance in Mexico’s secured
transactions system. All modern secured financing laws require that a creditor “give publicity”
of security interests created pursuant to that law. The main method for publicity is registration
in the RUG, although Mexican law provides alternate methods when the nature of the collateral
so requires. These include perfection 42 by possession and/or endorsement (e.g. for credit
instruments and documents) and perfection by control (e.g. for cash on deposit). Under the
existing legal framework, the first lender to give proper notice to third parties will have valid
and enforceable priority over the collateral. 43 . The RUG has brought uniformity to the
registration of security interest in movables, replacing a system that previously required
registration in over 269 local registries in 32 states. The RUG largely follows international best
practices and is available for filing and consultation online, is organized according to debtor
name, and is free of charge.

68.    The RUG is the only collateral registry in the world that provides its registry
services without charge. While this latter characteristic is viewed positively, it does have one

42
   The purpose of perfection is to provide notice to third parties that collateral they may be considering purchasing or
lending against is already encumbered by a previous lender.
43
   The UNCITRAL LEGISLATIVE GUIDE provides a similar rule, whereby security interest that were made effective
against third parties by registration, priority is determined by the order of registration, regardless of the order of
creation of the security interest.
                                                          26
 negative effect: the RUG is a subsidized public registry that is dependent on a yearly budgetary
 allocation through the Ministry of Economy. Although the government’s financial commitment
 has been strong, the on-line functionality, IT system, and user friendliness had been criticized
 by borrowers. Challenges remain in terms of easing current difficulties in filing and consulting
 the RUG –in particular with regard to mass consultations and registrations. It is worthwhile
 examining whether a small charge for services would allow the RUG to invest in updates and
 improvements. As registration volumes continue to increase, the RUG could also greatly benefit
 from an injection of capital to update its procedures and systems to avoid becoming a bottleneck
 in secured financing moving forward

 69. Mexico incorporates a functional approach to security devices, requiring the
 registration of all financial leases and factoring arrangements. Requirements under
 Mexican reforms includes the registration of all rights in movable assets that are created by
 agreement and secure the payment or other performance of an obligation. Recent reforms added
 a registration requirement for all factoring transactions, thereby eliminating potential secret
 liens over accounts receivable.

 (iv)    Enforcement

 70. There are significant deficiencies in the system of commercial enforcement that
 hamper the recovery of secured loans. The market perception is that the individual
 enforcement of loans is complex, formal, slow and subject to numerous delaying maneuvers
 from debtors. Obtaining a final decision is difficult due to the variety of procedural actions
 available to the debtor (motions, nullities, third-party actions, dismissal, appeal, constitutional
 protection action, revision, etc.), which are frequently used simply to delay enforcement. In
 addition, even a favorable decision can be of little use to the creditor due to the difficulties in
 effectively obtaining payment of claims and the likely depreciation of tangible assets before
 disposition.

 71. While reforms have strengthened repossession mechanisms, including the creation
 of a new federal jurisdiction in specialized commercial matters, procedures have been
 scarcely tested. Lenders are still generally wary to generate SME lending using movables, as
 they perceive procedures as lengthy and ineffective. There is a general expectation that an
 enforcement process for security over movables will almost always outlast the value of
 collateral. As a consequence, financial institutions prefer the use of real estate or public
 guarantees as collateral, or simply avoid lending to clients that are not able to fulfill the
 requirements. To consider using movables, lenders are better served to use the guarantee trust 44
 or a reservation of title or ownership, which provide significant procedural advantages.
 Unfortunately, as mentioned previously, these mechanisms are too expensive for most SME
 loans. In contrast, the non-possessory pledge has not historically allowed for speedy and
 effective enforcement procedures. The primary innovation non-possessory pledge is that allows

   The guarantee trust allows for immediate out-of-court enforcement upon default. The trust device transfers all
ownership of the trust assets to the trustee. The trustee, not the debtor, is considered the legal owner of all collateral
for all intents and purposes, even if the debtor is in actual possession and making use of the property in its day-to-
day business. In case of default, the trustee may immediately and extrajudicial change beneficiary of the trust.

the debtor to retain possession and use of the collateral. However, the law and the court system
must allow the creditor to seize the collateral in case of default. Unfortunately, the possibility
of out-of-court enforcement has encountered the obstacle of a strict interpretation of the
Constitution.45 Admittedly, non-possessory pledges can be submitted to out-of-court
enforcement but only “provided there are no controversies with respect to the enforceability of
credits, amount claimed and delivery of the said assets.” For this reason, although the procedure
is theoretically simple, the debtor can easily judicialize it.

72.     The ineffective enforcement system has been one of the main reasons that movable
collateral has been of little importance to SME lending. With numerous procedural actions
available, courts represent a seeming pro-debtor sentiment, but are often unaware of the
constitutionality of speedy enforcement measures already existing in many types of movable
goods (including intermediated securities and most types of payment instruments).

(v)        Prudential Lending Regulations

73.    Prudential lending standards must measure and strictly reflect the risks inherent to
the use of different types of guarantees and collateral. Hence, prudential regulation
recognizes and reflects the importance of development bank guarantees in credit risk reduction,
contributing to the use and success of this system in access to finance for SMEs. Likewise,
despite lengthy enforcement procedures, prudential regulation recognizes the use of real
property as collateral when SMEs or their owners have land available to mortgage.

74.     When it comes to movable property, and in line with international standards,
regulation differentiates between types. As in other financial systems that use a standardized
approach for prudential lending standards, Mexico broadly allows for the taking of security in
cash, commodities and instruments, but restricts lending with tangible movable collateral,
including equipment, raw materials, and finished products. When lenders take security in
tangible collateral, they must place cash in reserves to make up for potential transactional and
enforcement risks. As a result, lenders who decide to take the risk by lending on tangible
movable goods are required by regulation to place an amount equal to the loan value in reserve,
in case the loan goes into default and the lender is unable to enforce

75.      Given that little lending has taken place with tangible movable property, it is
unlikely that a large enough sample size exists to accurately measure the associated risks
within the revamped legal framework. Authorities could explore a mechanism to test the
system and allow lenders to take that initial step, without causing excessive risk to the financial
institution in question, or to the financial system as a whole.

Recommendations

76.    There are additional steps necessary to remove disincentives and obstacles to
secured lending in support of SME finance. Policies and reforms should focus on:

•   Creation of a uniform system that eliminates inconsistencies in the use of existing
    security mechanisms.

•   Improvements to the technological capabilities of the RUG to match increasing
    transaction volumes and sophistication.

•   Full recognition of extrajudicial remedies and speedy enforcement procedures.

•   Explore alternatives to facilitate the use of tangible movable goods as collateral, in order
    to accurately measure credit risk. One possibility would be to structure a second loss
    guarantee system, whereby lenders would be encouraged to use the secured transactions
    framework, but would be protected by a public guarantee if after remedies available
    under the of reformed secured transactions system prove inadequate.

•   In addition, the development of a new SME lending product could also be explored –one
    which can reduce reliance on public guarantees, on one hand, and can help absorb SMEs
    that graduate from the national guarantee system, on the other. Such product could be
    based on Asset-Based Financing Models common in other jurisdictions. This product
    should be designed to provide financing for the entire business cycle of the SME, by
    allowing the lender to effectively take a security interest in all tangible and intangible
    movable assets produced by that business cycle, namely: 1) raw materials and
    equipment), 2) finished products and inventory, 3) invoices and accounts receivables, and
    4) cash on deposit.

•   Finally, policy actions must be accompanied by an awareness campaign to educate the
    financial sector on the importance and economic feasibility of true asset based lending,
    along with training to courts and judges on the existence and operation of judicial sector
    reforms and extrajudicial remedies.

             ANNEX 1. ENHANCING SME CREDIT INFORMATION – THE UK EXAMPLE



    1. Legislation on SME data sharing

The UK Government has taken legislation (the small business, enterprise and employment bill 2014–15) through the
House of Commons and House of Lords. It will require banks to share (with permission) data on their SME customers
with designated private credit bureaus. The legislation will also require those bureaus to provide access to that data to any
finance provider that has the SMEs permission. The data will be set out in legislation but they will mainly cover payment
performance (positive and negative), default data on loans, business current accounts and credit cards. It will also cover
business current account turnover data.

2. Bank of England consultation on a central credit register
The Bank of England (BoE) is consulted on the benefits from a UK central credit register. They launched the discussion
paper ‘Should the availability of UK credit data be improved’ in May 2014. Three key incremental benefits are highlighted
in the paper: securitization, trade credit and access to public data. The paper also asks how, if a credit register were seen
as desirable, it could be best delivered through, for example, the existing infrastructure provided through private credit
registers. On 28 November 2014, supported the improvement of the existing reporting infrastructure versus developing
new infrastructure. It should be noted that credit bureaus in UK are considered matured and have been effectively
collecting credit information on SMEs and individuals since 1970’s while there is no credit registry in the market.

3. BoE is currently working on the following initiatives;
(i) Improving access to credit data for trade credit providers
BoE agrees with respondents that substantial benefits could be delivered for financing of SMEs through business-to-
business lending or trade credit (delayed payment for goods and services provided). Currently trade creditor’s access is
prohibited by the principles of reciprocity which govern access to data shared by mainstream credit providers (banks,
telecommunication and utility companies).

(ii) Using credit data to calculate the credit scores and credit limits offered to trade credit providers.
BoE will work with the British business banks and industry to draft a list of information requirements that would help
investors to improve their understanding of the SME asset class and consider investment opportunities

(iii) Use credit data to support market-based financing (securitization) for SMEs
BoE will work with the British business banks and industry to draft a list of information requirements that would help
investors to improve their understanding of the SME asset class and consider investment opportunities. In a second step,
BoE will work with the banks and the credit bureaus to explore whether this information can be made available through
the existing credit reporting infrastructure

(iv) Improving access to information from publicly owned sources
BoE supports the replies which recommended investigating further with HMRC the latter’s VAT register initiative
(releasing basic information from the VAT register by creating a public beneficial owners database for companies,
containing information on the ultimate owners of companies, and sharing and publishing export data, relating to
exporters and the goods they export. Other sources of information mentioned were: HMRC’s tax registers (business tax
liability / payment performance) and business rates information.
