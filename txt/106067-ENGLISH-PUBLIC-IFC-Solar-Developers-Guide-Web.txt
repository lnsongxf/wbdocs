This Guide was developed as part of the IFC Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Renewable Energy
Development Support Advisory program, funded by AusAid, Japan, and The Netherlands for activities in
Pakistan. The overall goal of this multi-year program is to enhance the scale up and development of renewable
and clean energy in MENA by supporting developers and investors in MENA markets, increasing overall market
awareness and understanding, and facilitating public-private dialogue.

The Guide was prepared under the overall guidance of Bryanne Tait, IFC’s Regional Lead for Energy and
Resource Efficiency Advisory, Middle East and North Africa. We acknowledge the significant contributions of
Sohail Alam, IFC Energy Specialist and Alice Cowman, Renewable Energy Specialist, who has been commissioned
by IFC to carry out the desk research, drafting and interviews.

We would like to thank the Pakistan Alternative Energy Development Board, National Electric Power Regulatory
Authority, National Transmission and Distribution Company, the Province of Punjab and the Province of Sindh,
who contributed greatly to the research and study for this guide through interviews and provision of information
and documents. IFC would also like to express its sincere appreciation to RIAA Barker Gillette, Ernst & Young,
and Eversheds, who contributed to the drafting of the guide. Solar resource maps and GIS expertise were kindly
provided by AWS Truepower and colleagues from the World Bank respectively, including support from the Energy
Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP). Certain mapping data was obtained from OpenStreetMap,

This Guide provides background for investors* who are implementing or intending to implement solar generating
plants in Pakistan. The Guide includes an overview of how a solar project could be developed in Pakistan and the legal
and regulatory support mechanisms for that project. It also describes legal, regulatory and other issues concerning the
preparation, agreement, approval and implementation of projects up to financial close.

*In this Guide the general term “Investor” is used to mean “Contractor” or “Developer”, i.e. persons who intend to
implement or who are already implementing a project to construct a solar plant in Pakistan.

cases are based on visual identification of transmission lines. As a result, the mapping data is not complete, mainly
as a result of poor quality satellite imagery in certain areas of the country, especially for lower voltage transmission
lines. The information presented is therefore not a complete or accurate representation and should therefore be used

Introduction and Outline
This document is intended as a guide for international developers and solar investors who are considering
investing in Pakistan. The document is laid out as follows:
•	Sections 1 to 3 give an overview of Pakistan and its electricity market, the solar potential and progress in the
  solar market to date.
	 These sections indicate that Pakistan has tremendous solar energy potential based on irradiance figures 	
  throughout the country. Additionally, it has a long history of IPPs and bankable project documents and an
  improving fiscal situation which is attractive for investors. Solar project development has been slow but it is
  hoped will gain momentum as recent determinations of solar tariffs have attracted interest from local and
  international developers.


•	Sections 4 to 7 set out the process for developing a solar project in Pakistan and the main institutions both
  provincial and federal that will be involved in the process.
	 These sections set out the main policy documents for renewables and describe the three stages for development
  of a project of a solar project in Pakistan. In summary these are as follows:
  -	 Stage 1: Letter of Intent
  -	 Stage 2: Letter of Intent to Letter of Support
  -	 Stage 3: Letter of Support to Financial Close


•	Section 8 sets out some key tax considerations for developers.


•	Section 9 concludes with some of the remaining challenges in the solar market in Pakistan currently and some
  recommendations for developers. The three main considerations for international project developers are:
  -	 Timeline and Policy Uncertainty
  -	 Land Identification
  -	 Transmission and Distribution

1. Country Profile
Pakistan is a federal parliamentary republic. It has four provinces
(Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Punjab, and Sindh), one capital
territory (Islamabad Capital Territory), two autonomous and disputed
territories (Azad Jammu & Kashmir and Gilgit Balistan) and the Federally
Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). It is the sixth most populous country
in the world with a rapidly growing population of over 190 million.

Recent economic developments in Pakistan have largely been positive. In 2015, inflation declined to 4.5% and GDP
growth was 4.2%, up from 4% in 2014. Growth is expected to continue on an upward trajectory to reach 4.5% in
2016 and 5.2% from 2018 onwards. Country risk perception has improved dramatically and the Emerging Markets
Bond Index Plus risk spread for Pakistan declined from 1011bps in March 2013, to 461 bps in April 2015. Additionally,
Pakistan’s S&P credit rating changed from stable to positive in May 2015 and is currently rated at B-. See Annex 2 for
more fiscal information on Pakistan.

Pakistan’s energy sector has also undergone a number of structural reforms in the last two decades. In 1998, in an effort
to promote increased private sector participation in the market, the Pakistan Electric Power Company was formed to
unbundle the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA). Prior to unbundling, WAPDA together with the
Karachi Electricity Supply Company (KESC - covering only the Karachi area) generated, transmitted and distributed
all of the power in the country. In 2007, WAPDA‘s power function was unbundled into 10 public sector Distribution
Companies, 4 Generation Companies and the National Transmission & Distribution Company (NTDC). Following

unbundling, WAPA’s remaining mandate is development of water and hydropower services in an efficient manner.1 KESC
was privatized in 2005 and is now known as K-Electric.

For the last decade or so, Pakistan has been facing a severe energy crisis. With installed generation capacity of about
23,600 MW, the country is facing a power shortage of approximately 3,000 MW to 6,000 MW during peak hours (see
Figure 2). The crisis worsens during summer months, leading to prolonged load shedding of 8 to 18 hours that varies
significantly between urban and rural areas. 37% of Pakistan’s fuel mix is based on fuel oil which means the cost of
generation is expensive and highly dependent on oil price changes leading to cost vulnerability. Renewables (other than
large hydro), which could lessen this cost vulnerability, contribute less than 1% of the current renewable energy mix.

For international investors, Pakistan has had a long history of successful completion of IPPs over 20 years. There are
36 IPPs with an installed capacity of 9GW in operation, and an additional 18 IPPs with an installed capacity of 5GW
are under construction. There are clear and consistent policies and regulations for IPP development and a strong and
independent regulator. There are fiscal incentives, standardized government support documents and long-term offtake
contracts on tariffs based on a cost-plus approach and feed-in-tariffs (FITs) with indexations. The contractual framework
has been stress tested over the last 20 years by events and situations including the foreign exchange crisis in 1998,
periods of political instability, contract renegotiations, persistent circular debt issues at the federal level, significant
increases in oil prices and recent sector liquidity issues. Within the renewables space, IPPs have reached financial close
in both hydro and wind and gas. International investors such as Engie, GE Capital, Oman Oil, AES Corporation, DEG
Germany and International Power UK have already successfully invested in IPPs in Pakistan financed by the IFC, Asian
Development Bank, and OPIC, among others.

2. Solar PV Potential in Pakistan
Pakistan has tremendous potential to meet its power demand needs from
renewable energy sources and, in particular, solar.

Solar irradiance levels in parts of Pakistan, particularly in the southwest,
are on par with the best in the world with global horizontal irradiance
(GHI) values over 1500 kWh/m² in over 90% of the country’s land area 2.
The annual mean value of GHI for whole Pakistan, based on preliminary
analysis by The World Bank, is 2071 kWh/m².

The mean values for the individual provinces are listed in Figure 3. The highest values of GHI can be found in Sindh,
Balochistan and Punjab provinces, while lowest sums have been estimated for the Northern Regions (including Azad
Kashmir) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

A comprehensive resource assessment and mapping project covering biomass, solar and wind is currently ongoing, with
a final Solar Atlas expected in early 2017. The project is being implemented by The World Bank in cooperation with the
Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB), with funding from the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program
(ESMAP) and the Asia Sustainable and Alternative Energy Program (ASTAE). Preliminary outputs, including the Solar
Modeling Report from which the resource data above was obtained, can be found on the ESMAP website3 . The solar
mapping component includes up to two years of high quality, ground-based solar measurements taken from nine sites
across Pakistan (see Figure 4 for details of site locations). The measurement data is being published on The World Bank’s
Energy & Extractives Open Data Platform4 , and can be freely downloaded.

3. Solar Sector Development to Date
in Pakistan
The Government of Pakistan’s (GOP) first steps towards firm support of
renewables in its energy mix came in 2006 when it released its Policy for
Development of Renewable Energy Generation (the 2006 RE Policy)6. The
2006 RE Policy dealt with wind, solar and small hydro (<50 MW), and
set out an initial plan for development of renewables within the country.
However, since 2006, progress has been slow and it is only in the last five
years that investor interest has gained momentum, particularly in the wind
and hydro sector and more recently in solar. The 2006 RE Policy was
developed as a short-term policy with a view to developing a medium- and
long-term policy as the market developed. However, the 2006 RE Policy
remains today the only policy that has been implemented and is currently
applicable.

To date, the only grid connected utility scale solar project in Pakistan to reach its Commercial Operation Date (COD) is
a publically-sponsored 100 MW project commissioned by the Government of Punjab in May 20157. A surge of investor
interest since 2014 and recent tariff determinations by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) mean
that more projects are expected shortly. The Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) reports that 35 projects with
a capacity of 1111.4 MW are under development within the framework of the AEDB policies and procedures.8 FITs (or
upfront tariffs as they are known in Pakistan) have been approved for 10 developers, and of those, three projects of 100
MW each have signed a power purchase agreement with the public off-taker. The FITs for a 25-year Solar PPA granted
by NEPRA in 2016 are set out in Table 1 below (the 2016 Tariff). Developers must apply for this FIT by 30th June 2016.
Further detail on the process by developers/investors to apply for this FIT is found in Section 6, and the basis upon which
the tariffs are determined are set out in Section 5 below.

 Southern Pakistan- Levelized Tariff (US Cents/kWh)                                                  10.8920                 10.8101                    10.7251

In the distributed solar space, the market has also been developing. With the rising costs of electricity in Pakistan and
unreliable grid supply, more industries and commercial organizations are turning to captive solar solutions. There has
been a strong surge in domestic installation of rooftop PV panels in large cities of the country. Pakistan’s private sector
imported 350 MW of solar panels in 20139.
For projects under 1 MW, net metering regulations 10 came into effect on 1 September, 2015. This sector is expected
to see significant growth in the coming years, and Pakistan is targeting at least 1 million customers and adding
approximately 3000 MW of solar power through net metering.11
Under the 2006 RE Policy, solar power project developers may also enter into direct bilateral sales contracts with end-use
customers to sell part of the power generated by them to their direct customers and the rest to the utility company for
general distribution. For direct sales, they are required to pay wheeling charges for the use of the transmission/and or
distribution grid network used to transport the power from the plant to the purchaser. Until now, there are no known
solar projects in Pakistan that are selling power on a bilateral basis.

4. Power Sector Institutions

4.1. Executive and Regulatory Agencies
The 2006 RE Policy sets out the key regulatory agencies with which
developers will need to engage. Depending on the approach taken by
the developer, these agencies will include most of the following, and
interactions with them are further explained in Section 6:



4.1.1. NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER REGULATORY AUTHORITY (NEPRA)

Under the Regulation of Generation, Transmission and Distribution of Electric Power Act, 1997, NEPRA has been
appointed as the sole regulator in the power sector. NEPRA was established to ensure a transparent, competitive and
commercially-oriented power market in Pakistan. NEPRA issues generation licenses, establishes and enforces standards,
approves investment and power acquisition programs of the utility companies, and determines investment tariffs for bulk
generation and transmission and retail distribution of electric power.

4.1.2. THE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT BOARD (AEDB)

The AEDB was established as an autonomous body with the aim of promoting and facilitating the exploitation of
renewable energy projects in Pakistan. It has been designated as a ‘one-window’ facilitator at the federal level for
processing solar projects of all sizes. The AEDB can issue a Letter of Intent (LOI), which is the first contract that a solar
developer enters into with the AEDB. The AEDB also has developed the standard power purchase agreement (known as
the Energy Purchase Agreement (EPA)) and the government support agreement (the Implementation Agreement (IA)).
Both of these are available on its website.12

4.1.3. PROVINCIAL AND AJK AGENCIES

Provincial and Azad, Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) governments support the development of renewable energy projects
within their geographical jurisdiction either on their own or in collaboration with the AEDB. Most provincial agencies
have also set up their own ‘one-window’ facilities to process solar projects at the provincial level. In the Northwest
Frontier Province (now called KPK), the Sarhad Hydro Development Organization (SHYDO) is the government agency
that issues the LOI. In Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan, their ‘one-window’ facility for processing solar applications is
located within the Irrigation and Power departments. These provincial agencies also support renewables by expediting
or facilitating allocation of land, permitting, and creating awareness of renewable energy.


4.2. Off-takers/Power Purchasers
Under the 2006 RE Policy, once the developer has secured all requisite approvals in the development process and signed
an EPA, it is mandatory for the distribution utilities to purchase all of the electricity offered to them by renewable energy
projects. A solar developer has essentially the following choices of power purchaser in Pakistan:

4.2.1. CENTRAL POWER PURCHASING AUTHORITY (CPPA)

The CPPA is the publically owned central off-taker. It is a department within the National Transmission and Despatch
Company and is authorized under its license to purchase power at any voltage from renewable energy companies,
including at 11 kV and above.

5. Tariff Determination

5.1. Tariff Process Overview
The 2006 RE Policy sets out three methods for tariff determination for
grid connected utility scale renewables:

   • Competitive bidding (solicited proposals)

   • Direct negotiations for a cost-plus tariff (unsolicited proposals)

   • FIT setting (known in Pakistan as an upfront tariff)

Unless it is a solicited competitive bid, NEPRA determines the level of tariff. The upfront tariff determination is a fixed
tariff price determined by NEPRA with terms and conditions attached. Essentially, it is what is known internationally as
a FIT and is referred to as such in this document. The FIT process is in the focus of this document. Although the other
two methods are theoretically possible, they have not yet been used for the purposes of grid-connected, utility scale solar
power projects.

FIT PROCESS
NEPRA will publish a notice of a FIT determination and any interested stakeholder may file a notice to intervene. The
notice is usually accompanied by a draft FIT proposal. Interested parties may attend the hearing and submit amendments
or proposals in relation to the suggested FIT. NEPRA will listen to the proposals and arguments at the hearing and will
determine a FIT after taking these arguments into account. There have been three FIT determinations for solar so far,
with the latest in December 2016. NEPRA determines the FIT on the basis of a number of principles, which are set out in
the NEPRA Tariff Standards and Procedures Rules 1998.

In general, NEPRA assigns value to the project costs that developers would incur e.g. capex, opex, depreciation, finance
costs (including interest and principal) and insurance, etc., and incorporates an assumption on a rate of return to the
developer. The FIT is calculated on that basis and although the financial model NEPRA uses is not publically available,
the component figures upon which its assumptions are based for calculation of the FIT are provided publicly in NEPRA’s
determination. Once the FIT final order is determined by NEPRA, parties may file motions for recalculation and review.
NEPRA may review the FIT at its discretion.

Once the FIT is determined/approved, developers may apply for that FIT within 6 months of the date of publication of
the tariff in the government official gazette 25 and financial close must be achieved by the developer within a period of
time of acceptance as determined by NEPRA and further described in Section 6. Decisions on tariffs are also published
by NEPRA on its website.26

As has been the case in many other renewable energy programs, the Pakistan FIT for solar power projects has been
declining since it was first announced in 2014, in line with international trends. This is to be expected (see Figure 6). A
FIT that is set too high can be unsustainable in the long term.

5.2. FIT Assumptions, Adjustments and Indexations
As set out above, NEPRA, in determining the FIT, assigns certain values to the project costs that the developers could
incur in developing a solar project. There are certain assumptions, adjustments and indexations that are taken into
account and allowed for these values and parts of the resulting tariff components, which need to be understood. A
description of these is set out below:


NORTH/SOUTH TARIFF DIVISION

Pakistan has been divided into two zones based on solar irradiance levels. A higher tariff is applied for northern Pakistan
where solar irradiance levels are lower, and a lower tariff is given for Southern Pakistan where it is hot and dry for most
of the year, thus providing a higher yield than the north. This division has been accepted in all determinations to date and
the areas covered are set out in the table below.



TABLE 2: NORTH/SOUTH IRRADIANCE DIVIDE – LOCATIONS COVERED
                                                          • Northern Punjab
                                                          • Federally Administered Tribal Areas

                                                          • Azad Kahsmir & Jammu, Gilgit-Baltistan)
                                                          • Balochistan
                   Southern Pakistan                      • Sindh
                                                          • Southern Punjab (including Cholistan)




                                                                                                                                   | 19
BENCHMARK CAPACITY FACTORS.
In calculating the tariff and how much energy would be generated by a solar power plant, NEPRA has used benchmark
plant capacity factors. In the 2016 tariff, these are 17% for northern Pakistan and 18% for southern Pakistan (the
Benchmark Capacity Factors).


PROJECT COSTS AND INDEXATION
NEPRA assigns assumed figures to certain project costs broken down into CAPEX and financing. The 2016 assumed
figures are set out in Table 3 below.

NEPRA recognizes that a large amount of the project will be contracted from abroad. The reference exchange rate is
PKR 105/US$. Since the exact timing of payment to the EPC contractor is not known at the time of tariff determination
by NEPRA, under the 2016 Tariff, an adjustment for relevant foreign currency fluctuation for 90% of the foreign
component of the EPC contract price will be allowed against the reference exchange rate on the basis of monthly average
exchange rates prevailing on 1st day of each month during the construction period . The developer is required to provide
all the necessary relevant details along with documentary evidence. The adjustment shall be made only for the currency
fluctuation against the reference exchange rate. See Annex 3 for more details on the indexation mechanism.


OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE
As with project costs, NEPRA assumes a certain cost for Operations and Maintenance (O&M). In the 2016 tariff
calculation, an O&M component of US $ 26, 541/MW was assumed.

NEPRA allows a foreign and local operations and maintenance (O&M) tariff component. In the 2016 tariff, the local
component is 70% of the O&M tariff component (set out in Table 5) and the foreign component is 30%. The O&M
component of the tariff will be adjusted on account of local inflation (based on the consumer price index, or CPI),
foreign inflation (US CPI), and the quarterly exchange rate on 1st July, 1st October, 1st January and 1st April based on
the latest available information with respect to CPI notified by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the US CPI issued
by US Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the National Bank of Pakistan. The mechanism for this indexation is set out in
Annex 3.




20 |
DEBT
In calculating the tariff, NEPRA allows different premiums depending on whether the solar developer uses foreign
or local debt. Under the 2016 Tariff, the foreign debt allowed is London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), 0.31%,
plus a premium of 4.5% for foreign loans. The local debt is Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (KIBOR), which as of
28th December 2015 was 7..32% , plus 3% on quarterly basis, as shown in Table 4. If there are any savings in the
premium, these will be shared between the developer and the purchaser (60:40). The interest on the fixed loan will
remain unchanged unless there is a variation in the 3-month LIBOR. Each quarter, if there is a variation in LIBOR,
an adjustment to the interest portion of the tariff may be made. This adjustment can be positive or negative. The
mechanism for this indexation is set out in Annex 3.
The tariff assumes a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25, a loan tenor of 10 years, and quarterly repayments.

CONSTRUCTION PERIODS
NEPRA determined that the targeted maximum construction period after financial close is 8 months, 10 months and
12 months for >1MW≤20MW, >20MW≤50MW and >50MW≤100MW projects respectively. No adjustment will be
allowed in this tariff to account for the financial impact of any delay in project construction. However, the failure of the
developer to complete construction within the stipulated time will not invalidate the tariff granted to it. See Section 6.3.1
for more discussion on construction periods in the context of the project documents.

The return on equity has been set at 17% before taxes for every tariff determination by NEPRA. After Commercial
Operations Dated (COD), the Return on Equity (ROE) component of the tariff may be quarterly indexed on account of
variations in the PKR/US $ exchange rate. The formula for this is set out in Annex 3.

INSURANCE AND SINOSURE FEE
A portion of the EPC costs is allowed for insurance during construction as set out in Table 3 above. Insurance during
construction will be re-established on the basis of actual project financing and weighted average quarterly LIBOR/
KIBOR and applicable premiums, 4.5% and 3% respectively. Any savings in premium must be shared in the ration of
60:40 between the power purchaser and the developer.

During the operation period, an actual insurance cost of a maximum of 1% of the EPC cost may be charged to the
power purchaser. The actual insurance cost for the minimum coverage required under contractual obligations with the
off-taker not exceeding 1% of the EPC cost is be treated as a pass-through 28. The insurance component of reference
tariff shall be adjusted annually as per actual upon production of authentic documentary evidence. The formula for
calculation of this insurance adjustment is set out in Annex 3.




27 Note that the KIBOR figure here is an assumed figure from December 2016. This may be adjusted to the actual KIBOR.
28 Pass- through items are discussed in more detail in Section 6.3.1 below.


                                                                                                                                     | 21
A number of large-scale projects are seeking funding from Chinese financial institutions and a condition for financing
these projects is that financial institutions are required to obtain coverage from the China Export Credit & Insurance
Corporation (Sinosure) for specific risks. NEPRA has decided to allow the Sinosure fee for the solar power projects
under the upfront tariff. A Sinosure fee of 7% of the total debt servicing may been included in the project cost. Project
cost will be adjusted at the time of COD on the basis of the actual Sinosure fee subject to a maximum of 7% of total
debt servicing may be passed through as a cost to the power purchaser under the tariff.


TAXES
Up to 2016, there was an allowed taxes and duties rate in the EPC component. This was US$ 47,365/MW and could be
adjusted as per the actual rate at the time of COD stage adjustment of the tariff on the basis of verifiable documentary
evidence. This was not mentioned in the 2016 tariff and the adjustment would not seem to apply any longer.

The 2016 determination does state that if the Project Company is obligated to pay any tax on its income from generation
of electricity or any duties and/or taxes, not being of a refundable nature, are imposed upon the company, the exact
amount will be reimbursed by CPPA/DISCO on production of original receipts. See Section 8 below for more details on
taxes.


5.3. 2016 Tariff
Based on the assumptions set out in Section 5.2, the 2016 Tariff and its components were determined as set out in Table
5 below. The reference tariffs set out in Table 5 are based on 100% foreign financing and if local financing is used, a
KIBOR + 3% premium will apply as discussed in Section 5.2. Developers should note that tariffs are paid on a step-
down basis, with a higher tariff for the first 10 years of the project.

REVENUE SHARING FOR EXCESS GENERATION
NEPRA has structured each FIT such that any benefit from excess generation (over the assumed Benchmark Capacity
Factors) is shared with the power purchaser and, by extension, the consumers. Under the 2016 tariff, Table 6 sets out the
adjustments to payments to developers for generation in excess of the Benchmark Capacity Factors:



TABLE 6: 2016 EXCESS GENERATION TARIFFS

The sharing is subject to a maximum of 19% (North) 20% (South). This maximum is set to encourage developers to use
the most efficient equipment possible. These payment adjustments are calculated on a yearly basis. For further, discussion
on this and shortfall energy below benchmark capacity factors in any given year, see Section 6.3.1 below.

 6. Development Process under FIT.

 This section sets out the process in Pakistan for development of a
 project under the Feed-in-Tariff (FIT).

 The 2006 RE Policy lists the key steps and requirements from
 registration through to financial close for renewable energy projects in
 Pakistan if they wish to opt for the FIT.




 Stages and Indicative Timelines
 There are three key stages for developing an unsolicited solar power project in Pakistan, as follows:


 • STAGE 1: LETTER OF INTENT (LOI)
 Obtaining the LOI takes about one to two months according to the AEDB and the provincial agencies. Identification
 of land may delay the process for the developer.


 • STAGE 2: LOI TO LETTER OF SUPPORT (LOS)
 The LOI from the AEDB is 18 months in duration. This can be shorter if the LOI is issued by the provincial agencies.


 • STAGE 3: LETTER OF SUPPORT TO FINANCIAL CLOSE
 The Letter of Support is issued for 12 months from the date that NEPRA approves the tariff. The developer must
 achieve financial close within that time unless an extension is obtained.

 This section sets out the processes, procedures and costs for each of these stages in detail.

       29 This process map only applies to developers working through AEDB from the LOI stage. If a developer obtains an LOI from a provincial agency, there may be differences in
       processes and timelines up to the issuance of the LOS.

6.1. Stage 1: Letter of Intent
The first step in developing a solar tariff under the solar FIT/upfront
tariff scheme is to secure a Letter of Intent (LOI) from the AEDB or
other relevant provincial agencies.


6.1.1. AEDB OR PROVINCIAL AGENCY
Although the majority of international and local RE project sponsors
apply for the LOI through the AEDB, provincial and territorial
agencies have the power to issue LOIs essentially on the same terms
for projects in their respective jurisdictions. The relevant provincial
agencies are:

• Punjab Power Development Board (PPDB) / Energy Department of
  Punjab

• Directorate of Alternate Energy / Energy Department of Sindh

• Balochistan Power Development Board (BPDB) / Department of
  Energy, Balochistan

• Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization (PEDO) / Energy
   & Power Department, KPK

• AJK Private Power Cell (PPC) / Azad Jammu & Kashmir Region

Developers may decide which pathway to LOI they would like
to pursue. However, the AEDB has the advantage of extensive
experience of executing most of the renewable energy projects
in Pakistan. If developers go through the AEDB, they will still be
required to interact with the provincial agencies if they intend to
procure public lands. If they decide to work through the provincial
agencies, the Government Guarantee (under the Implementation
Agreement) will only be provided to projects initiated under
provincial LOIs, provided they obtain a tripartite LOS (AEDB, Prov.
Govt. and IPP). 30

Provincial governments vary with regard to the timelines and
procedures for obtaining the LOI. For example, if a developer wishes
to obtain the LOI from the Punjab Power Development Board,
the timelines are more aggressive and the costs and procedures are
different. See figure 8 below.

In Sindh, the government follows the AEDB procedures and
timelines and utilizes the AEDB standard LOI. However, if the
solar power project developer is obtaining public land, the energy
department in Sindh will include a provision in the LOI that states
that it will assist in procuring the land.

Unless otherwise indicated, process details in this document refer to
an application through the AEDB for an LOI.

31 There is some ambiguity as to whether the LOS issued by Punjab can be different to the standard document issued by AEDB. The PPDB has suggested that their timelines are more aggressive and
that 6 months is required for financial close. AEDB is clear that once there is a tripartite LOS (i.e. where a government guarantee is required) their standard LOS is used and the guarantee is issued in
favour of AEDB and not the provincial government.

                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 29
6.1.2. IDENTIFICATION OF LAND
Although land title is not required for issuance of the LOI and indeed the developer may, once the LOI is issued, apply to
change the site location, the developer must identify lands in its application to the AEDB for an LOI. Identifying land is
not straightforward. It is advised to start the process of identification of lands as early as possible.

Solar project developers interested in developing solar power in Pakistan have two options to secure land: through direct
negotiations with landowners or with the support of provincial governments.


PUBLIC LANDS
Public lands lie solely within the remit of the Provincial Governments. The conditions for the lease of lands vary
depending on the provincial government. Although the resource in other parts of Pakistan is much more robust, the
majority of activity in relation to solar power projects is in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh, where the vast majority
of the load exists. Both of these governments have issued notifications of the procedures for lease of government land for
solar projects in those provinces discussed in Section 6.2.1 below.

One of the key differences between Punjab and Sindh is that Punjab must advertise the property before allocating it to
any developer and Sindh gives land that it has identified on a first come, first served basis. Both provinces have identified
‘one-window facilities’ for developers. Sindh, in particular, has identified a number of solar park areas that it intends to
develop and will include a provision in the LOI to support the developer to obtain that public land. The developer may
also identify its own land and inquire into obtaining it with the Government of Sindh.

Developers may also partner with companies/sponsors that have already been allocated public lands. Both the
Government of Sindh and Pakistan have begun digitalizing public lands, which may help developers. See Figures 9 and
10 for maps of Punjab and Sindh. 32 Also, see Annex 8 which contains a transmission map of the land corridor in Sindh
where land for solar projects has also been allocated. Further details on land acquisition are in Section 6.2.1 below.

If developers intend to lease public lands, they are advised to contact the provincial agencies as soon as possible. The
contact details for the ‘one-window facilities’ in Punjab and Sindh are set out below:

PRIVATE LANDS
Developers may also negotiate directly with landowners for private lands. Developers may find these lands themselves or
approach the AEDB. As the AEDB has no jurisdiction over provincial lands, it encourages developers to purchase lands
through private treaty. The AEDB has worked with NTDC to identify a number of sites or areas near to substations that
could be developed. The AEDB has identified private sites close to transmission lines in Balochistan, KPK, Sindh and
Punjab. Each of these sites can take a maximum of 200-300 MW. The AEDB is encouraging projects to stay below 50
MW so that they can utilize the 132 kV network and that NTDC will not need to build large transmission lines purely
for the evacuation of solar power as it was required to for the 1000 MW QA Solar Park in Punjab. The estimated market
rate for private lands is between $1000 and $4000 an acre. Approximately 10 developers have been able to purchase
lands under this procedure.

6.1.3. THE AEDB LOI APPLICATION PROCESS
It takes approximately two months to secure an LOI. The AEDB will begin processing the LOI even if exact lands have
not been identified. To obtain an LOI, a set of documents referred as the “proposal” in the 2006 RE Policy must be
submitted by the sponsor. The proposal package should include the following, at a minimum:

i. A Statement of Qualification of the project sponsors along with relevant corporate and sponsor profiles, plus proof of
    financial capacity to undertake the project.

ii. List of relevant corporate experience of the project sponsor(s).

iii. Proposed project location with GPS coordinates. The project site has to be located in an area with no adverse
    environmental effects. This site location can be changed at a later stage.

iv. Proposed net installed capacity (MW) and expected annual energy output (MWh) based on solar resource available at
    the site

v. Proposed basic outline of plant and structures

vi. A brief summary of the project implementation plan covering proposed milestones for project preparation,
   implementation and completion date. This plan may include aspects in relation to technology, human resource and
   project financing options.

vii. Estimated distance of the grid from the proposed site and the estimated distance from the nearest 132 kV or 11 kV
   line and the grid station.

viii. An indication of land availability/acquisition for the proposed project, which will be secured before the expiry of the
   LOI.

The soft copy of the complete proposal can be emailed to the AEDB at: solarsection@gmail.com or it may be provided
directly to Solar Section, Alternate Energy Development Board, 2nd Floor, OPF Building, Shahrah-e-Jamhuriat, G-5/2,
Islamabad, Pakistan. Tel: +92 051 9222360 - 61.




34 |
The submitted proposals shall be examined by a Project Committee
appointed by the AEDB. After careful review of the proposal, the
designated committee will inform the concerned part of the approval
(or other required follow-up actions, as required) within 30 days.

Upon approval of the LOI by the Committee, the sponsor shall pay the
AEDB a registration fee of US$ 100 and project facilitation/processing
fees, depending on the size of the project, as follows:

• US$ 1,000 for up to 5 MW

• US$ 5,000 for up to 20 MW

• US$ 10,000 for up to 50 MW

• US$ 20,000 for above 50 MW

Payment should be made by bank draft or payment order made out to
the AEDB.

A bank guarantee of US $500/MW shall be posted to the AEDB within
15 days after obtaining approval from the AEDB. Once the processing
fees and bank guarantee are received, the final LOI will be issued within
seven days.



TERMS OF AEDB LOI
The LOI is signed by the sponsors of the project and the AEDB. The
AEDB LOI is a publically available document.33

The term of the standard LOI is 18 months while the validity of the
bank guarantee must be for 24 months (6 months beyond the LOI
duration). Within the standard LOI, there is a one-time provision for
an extension to the LOI for an additional six months by doubling
the amount of the bank guarantee, i.e. US$ 1,000/MW. However, in
practice, it is not uncommon to secure repeated extensions due to
various factors that delay the approvals and development process that
may be beyond the sponsors’ control.

If the award of the tariff is delayed beyond the initial validity of the
LOI, the Project Company shall extend the bank guarantee and the
expiry date of the LOI will be extended. The aforementioned extension
process may be repeated if the tariff is not announced (including on any
review petition filed by the Project Company). Such review (if any) is to
be filed within the period prescribed in the NEPRA (Tariff Procedures
and Standards) rules up to 15 days before the then prevailing expiry
date.

6.2. Stage 2: LOI to LOS
The milestones that must be reached before an LOS can be issued are set out in a schedule to the LOI. These milestones
and the timelines within which they are required to be met as set out in the LOI are in Table 7 below.

In case the developer fails to meet the LOI Milestones or perform any other obligations set forth in the Policy and this
LOI, including the extension of the date of expiry of the bank guarantee as provided herein, the AEDB will terminate this
LOI and encash the bank guarantee.

Provided the developer meets the LOI Milestones on the stated dates, the Expiry Date of the LOI shall be extended on
a day-for-day basis for the number of days of delay by which the approval or review by the relevant public sector entity
listed in the LOI Milestones is delayed beyond the corresponding period stated in the LOI Milestones.


6.2.1. LAND ACQUISITION
Developers are encouraged to have started the land identification and land acquisition process prior to the LOI stage.
However, at the LOI stage, a process of acquisition of the exact plot will need to have begun. At the very least, developers
must have acquired access to the land order to carry out the feasibility study required pursuant to the LOI. As mentioned
above, solar project developers interested in developing solar power in Pakistan have two options to secure land: through
direct negotiations with landowners or through the support of provincial governments and as the majority of activity for
solar developers is in Punjab and Sindh, their procedures for land acquisition are dealt with in detail in this section.



Support of provincial governments to obtain public lands

PUNJAB
In the early stages of development of the solar power market in Pakistan, the Government of Punjab allocated a large
parcel of land for the 1000 MW Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park, located in the Bahawalpur region of Punjab province.
Quaid-e-Azam Solar Power Private Limited, a company wholly owned by the Government of Punjab, developed and
commissioned a 100 MW power plant. A Chinese company called Zonergy Ltd. is developing the remaining 900 MW
and has signed a power purchase agreement for 300 MW under the 2015 tariff.

GRID INTERCONNECTION STUDY
In order to apply for the Solar FIT from NEPRA, approval from NTDC or the DISCO is required for the grid
interconnection of the project. In order to obtain this approval, a grid interconnection study is required. This will
need to be prepared by local consultants. Various local consultants are available to assist and will support the entire
grid connection approval process. The study must include simulation studies to the effect that solar-based power
will be evacuated to the grid in accordance with the project timeline and must include that the power injected to the
grid will not have any adverse effect on the national grid as required under the Grid Code. After submitting a Grid
Interconnection Study, the developer must obtain approval by NTDC or the relevant DISCO for grid connectivity. Such
approval must also conclude that the power injected to the grid by the project will not have any adverse effect on the
national grid as required under the Grid Code (timeframe estimated to secure approval of grid interconnection from
NTDC is estimated to be two weeks however in practice this may take two to three months following an iterative
process of reviews of the interconnection proposal and related studies). Contact information for NTDC and seeking
approval of the Grid Interconnection Study:


National Transmission & Despatch Company Limited
Room # 414, WAPDA House Shahrah-e-Quaid-e-Azam, Lahore – Pakistan.
Tel: 92 (042) 9202229
Fax:92 (042) 9200894


The fee for application for grid connection approval is a flat fee of US $1,746 regardless of project size and payable to
NTDC upon submission. Under the 2006 RE Policy, NTDC is required to provide grid interconnection but approvals
can take time as grid interconnection is complex and costly especially in remote areas. It is recommended that NTDC
is approached as soon as possible and that developers work with them to identify areas that are most suitable for
evacuation of power.


6.2.3. NEPRA FIT APPLICATION AND GENERATION LICENSE APPLICATION
Within four months of the approval of the Feasibility Study by the AEDB, the developers must have opted (or officially
applied) for the FIT. The purpose of this application process is to secure approval of the FIT for the project and grid
connectivity from NEPRA and the relevant off-taker: i) NTDC; or ii) the relevant local distribution company (DISCO).

The suggested time period of approval/grant of the tariff is 10 working days as per the NEPRA Upfront Tariff
Regulations 2011. However, delays may occur especially if inadequate project-related information is available, and
developers are encouraged to start the overall process as early as possible.

6.3. Stage 3: LOS to Financial Close
Once the FIT is granted to a project, the developers have to achieve the financial close within one year unless an
extension is granted by the AEDB under the LOS as described in Section 6.2.5 above.


6.3.1. ENERGY PURCHASE AGREEMENT
The key project documents and agreements under the FIT regime are the Energy Purchase Agreement and the
Implementation Agreement, which can be found on the AEDB website.50 It is important to note that the basic terms
of these project documents have been used in Pakistan for IPP projects for the last 20 years. The security package and
sovereign guarantee offered has been banked by international investors and lenders numerous times in the past.

• Energy Purchase Agreement (EPA)51 52

              Term                                                              25 years (unless extended by a Force Majeure Event)
 Parties                             The EPA is signed by the Project Company (the Seller) and the Power Purchaser (DISCO or CPPA). The EPA is
                                     directly negotiated with the Power Purchaser, which could be the CPPA as a central off-taker, or a DISCO, which
                                     is a distribution company in the respective geography of project location.
 Take or Pay                         The EPA is a take or pay agreement. The Seller is paid for all net electrical output delivered, as measured by
                                     the meter. Payments are made for net electrical output that would have been delivered but for curtailment or
                                     specific dispatch instructions (i.e. deemed output).
 Contract Capacity                   The Seller must state its Contract Capacity in MWp DC. The Seller may, where necessitated by unforeseen
                                     circumstances, reduce the installed capacity before the Commercial Operations Date by a maximum margin of
                                     %10 of the Contract Capacity.
 Required Commercial                 This is negotiated by the Seller with the AEDB with the following limitations: 8 to 12 months for 1 to 20 MW, 10 to
 Operations Date                     18 months for +20 to 50 MW, 12 to 18 months for +50 to 100 MW. 52
 Letter of Credit                    A Letter of Credit (LOC) in the amount of US 35$ per kW of the Contract Capacity must be delivered to the
                                     Power Purchaser prior to Financial Close. The LOC must be maintained in full force and effect and will not
                                     be returned to the Power Purchaser until COD (unless terminated prior to COD, in which case the LOC must
                                     be maintained until 30 days after such termination). The LOC may be drawn on if the Seller has not paid the
                                     liquidated damages prior to COD, as set out in the Liquidated Damages (LD) section below.
                                     The LOC may also be encashed in full if there is a Seller Event of Default prior to COD.
 Liquidated Damages                  Liquid Damages (LDs) apply if:
                                     • Contract Capacity is reduced by between %5 and %10. LDs are payable in an amount equal to 350,000$
                                         multiplied by the number of MW (prorated for any fraction thereof) if the Contract Capacity is reduced by
                                         between %5 and %10.
                                     • Failure to achieve COD by Required COD. Here, the Seller shall pay the Purchaser as LDs an amount equal to
                                         US 2.50$ per kW of the Contract Capacity for each Month (prorated Daily) thereafter until the COD is actually
                                         achieved.
                                     • EPA is terminated prior to COD for a Seller Event of Default. In this scenario, the Seller shall reimburse the
                                         Purchaser for all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating to the Project incurred by
                                         the Purchaser prior to such termination, which amount in any event shall not exceed the Rupee equivalent of
                                         one hundred and fifty thousand Dollars (US 150,000$).
                                     • Liquidated Damages for Shortfall Energy. The Seller is required to pay LDs to the Purchaser if their annual
                                         electrical output falls below the benchmark annual electrical output (based on the benchmark capacity factors
                                         provided in the tariff). This is known as Shortfall Energy. To calculate Shortfall Energy, the Seller may take into
                                         account any surplus energy produced in previous years as credit energy. The LDs are calculated as the kilowatt
                                         hours representing the positive balance of the Shortfall Energy and the then-prevailing use of system charge
                                         per kWh allowed by NEPRA to the Purchaser for interconnection to and use of its grid system.

52 NEPRA had previously determined that the construction period was 8, 10 and 12 months fro projects of 1-20 MW, 20 to 50 MW and 50 to 100 MW respectively. However, these longer periods are
provided in the EPA to accommodate NTDC’s concern regarding the proximity and availability of the Grid, given the requirement for it to complete the project interconnection works 60-90 Days before
the Commissioning Tests That would have left only 5-9 months if the construction period stipulated in NEPRA’s Tariff Determination is strictly followed (which was not the intent of NEPRA).

                                     date of each Energy Payment receipt, one thirty-sixth (36/1th) of the annual O&M budget for the Complex will be
                                     deposited into the Reserve Fund until a reserve equal to nine such deposits has been established.

                                     The Reserve Fund is to ensure that the developer has sufficient funds available for major maintenance expenses.
                                     “Major Maintenance Expenses” means expenses for an item of maintenance or repair of the Complex which
                                     would require substantial expenditure and which is anticipated to be performed in accordance with the
                                     manufacturers’ determinations, sound engineering practices or Prudent Utility Practices, but which is not
                                     expected to be performed on a recurring basis. The developer can draw on the Reserve Fund only to the extent
                                     it lacks other funds available for paying maintenance and associated operating expenses with respect to the

 Termination                          In the event of a termination of this Agreement prior to the Commercial Operations Date for any reason other
 Payments                             than a Seller Event of Default, the Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller for all costs and expense (including
                                      reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating to the Project incurred by the Seller prior to such termination, which amount
                                      in any event shall not exceed the Rupee equivalent of one hundred and fifty thousand Dollars (150,000$).
                                      For termination payments that may arise under the EPA in favor of the Purchaser prior to COD, please see the
                                      LOC section above.
                                      All other termination payments are provided for in the IA.
 Excess Energy                        On a yearly basis, the annual electrical output of the generator is calculated based on the benchmark capacity
                                      factors (%17 for North and %18 for the South in 2016 tariff). If annual electrical output is in excess of this, a
                                      reduced tariff may apply as per the relevant NEPRA tariff determination. See Section 5.3 for more details on this
                                      in relation to 2016 tariff.



6.3.2. IMPLEMENTATION AGREEMENT (IA)

 Title Protection                     If the Seller has leased land from the provincial government, GOP indemnifies the Seller from any losses arising in
                                      connection with or relating to any defect in title that impedes or delays the project.

                                      Section 15.1 (Compensation upon Termination). Any change in this shall not give rise to a breach or default of
                                      the GOP so long as such change results in a Change in Tax and can be treated as a Pass-Through Item under the
                                      EPA.
 Taxation of the                      Local investors will be taxed according to the laws of Pakistan and Foreign Investors will be taxed according
 Investor                             to the Bilateral Tax Treaty with their country. If no tax treaty exists, they are taxed according to the laws of

                                      maintenance of the solar plant56 and any other item or items of plant, equipment or machinery that are
                                      incorporated into the solar plant or whose use is dedicated to the operation and/or maintenance of the solar
                                      plant approved by the AEDB and concurred to by the Federal Board of Revenue. Any charge in excess of that
                                      which is law at the time of signing can be treated as a Pass-Through Item under the tariff.

                                      Provided customs Duties and Sales Taxes are paid, all imported items will be cleared for release from customs
                                      within 15 business days of arrival at the port of entry.

                                      The agreement guarantees full currency convertibility provided the request is made 15 days in advance of

                                      provisions on free transfer and repatriation of certain funds including equity.


55 Any capitalized terms in this section not defined in this document will be defined in the standard IA available on the AEDB website.
56 As provided in the Finance Act, 2014, the Fifth Schedule to the Customs Act, 1969 and the Sixth Schedule to the Sales Tax Act, 1990. See Section 8 for more details on taxes that apply.

        Term                                           25 years (unless extended by a Force Majeure Event)
Payment Guarantee       Schedule 3 of the IA contains the unconditional and irrevocable payment guarantee from the Government for
                        the payment obligations of the Purchaser under the EPA, which is entered into as a separate document.
Force Majeure           There is compensation on termination for Force Majeure. The affected party is under an obligation to incur
                        reasonable sums of money to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure. However, GOP will not be allowed to
                        claim relief of its obligations under the IA or the Payment Guarantee if there is a Political Force Majeure or a
                        Change in Law Force Majeure.
Restrictions on Share   Under the IA, there are a number of lock-in periods for investors. The initial shareholder cannot reduce its
Transfer                shareholding below %51 prior to COD. The lead investor cannot reduce its shareholding below %20 prior to COD.
                        Post COD, AEDB consent is required for any share transfer. However, the IA states that this will be granted
                        unless AEDB determines that such transfer is contrary to national security interest.
Consents                The Implementation Agreement requires a number of consents from various government agencies, which must
                        be procured by the Seller prior to Financial Close. These include:

                        • State Bank of Pakistan consent to conduct transactions in foreign exchange;

                        • State Bank of Pakistan commitment to make available foreign currency if required;

                        • NEPRA consent to the Power Purchaser to off-take the electricity (required under the generations license); and

                        • Ministry of Commerce/Federal Board of Revenue import permits.

                        These consents are relatively straightforward to obtain. If there is a delay in obtaining these consents through no
                        fault of the Purchaser, an automatic extension of the LOS is given by the AEDB.
Compensation on         The IA contains compensation on termination of the EPA. The compensation varies depending on the
Termination             termination event. The key termination events and the compensation applied is outlined in the table below. Note
                        that the amount of debt, equity and ROE payable in any of the termination events reduces throughout the Term
                        and debt includes the interest owed to the Lenders. The mechanism for calculating each of these is detailed in
                        the EPA.

                         Termination Event                                        Compensation

6.3.3. GRID INTERCONNECTION

There is no grid connection agreement in Pakistan. The information obtained for the grid connection study needed
to obtain the LOS detailed in Section 6.2.2. and any conditions attached to its approval is inserted into the technical
schedules of the EPA.

In the standard EPA available on the AEDB website, the off-taker has to design, construct, finance and commission the
purchaser interconnection facilities. NTDC has a number of applications for solar projects and there has been some delay
in processing them. Additionally, it is NTDC’s preference to place a number of small clusters of renewables throughout
the grid where there is capacity so that high voltage transmission lines do not need to be exclusively built for solar power
projects.

To expedite the construction of transmission lines and the interconnection facility by NTDC or DISCOs, a Project
Company may opt to construct and finance these facilities on mutually agreed basis. This has been done by few
developers recently. This agreement is outside of the concession documents, and is agreed on a one-on-one basis with
NTDC. At the date of publication and to IFC knowledge, no solar or wind developer had agreed to do this.

7. Key Risks in FIT and Mitigants
The following are the key types of risks along with possible mitigants
available under the FIT regime in Pakistan.


7.1. Security Risks
Pakistan’s security situation has improved substantially in recent years.
Country risk perception in financial markets has improved. The Emerging
Markets Bond Index Plus risk spread declined from 1011 bps in March,
2013 to 461 bps in April, 2015. Nevertheless, some security concerns remain, particularly in certain parts of the country,
and developers should be cognizant of this when deciding on the location and construction of their plant. In public
lands designated as solar parks by the provincial governments, some security guarantees may be provided in the lease
agreement.

Under the IA, some further protection is provided as follows. In general, the Seller is required to provide security
personnel, adequately secured facilities and equipment, and protection for the solar project. However, the GOP ensures
that the relevant law and order enforcement agencies shall extend security enforcement on a “non-discriminatory” basis
to the Project Company at no cost or expense to the Project Company. From time to time, the Project Company may
request additional security forces from the GOP to meet unusual security requirements. All such additional security
forces shall remain under the exclusive control and direction of the GOP. All reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by the GOP in providing such security forces requested by the developer shall be reimbursed to the GOP. There is cap on
such expenditure which is currently US $10,000 for 1 to 5 MW, US $50,000 for 5 to 20 MW, US $ 100,000 for 20 to
50 MW and US $150,000 for 50 to 100 MW. 57


7.2. Political Risks
The IA does provide some risk coverage and compensation payments in case of Pakistan Political Force Majeure
and Change in Law. However, it is also advisable to obtain credit enhancement from third parties such as the World
Banks’ Partial Risk Guarantees, associated Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) guarantees, or similar
instruments available from the Asian Development Bank. Certain export credit agencies have associated insurance
offerings, such as Chinese Sinosure, which provides risk coverage if the Chinese Export Credit Agency is involved. The
Sinosure fee can be passed through under the tariff, which is unique to Sinosure only.


7.3. Currency Projection and Currency Convertibility
Currency risks include those in relation to macroeconomic shocks, such as currency devaluation, inflation, and
indexation of various tariff cost components. The mitigants available under the Project Documents are through
indexation of foreign currency denominated components under the EPA pursuant to the consent of the State Bank
of Pakistan and convertibility of local currency to acceptable international currency under the IA. The currency
exchange rate is calculated on the date the payment is due and investors have not reported any problems with currency
convertibility under EPAs in Pakistan. Also, developers should consider a currency hedge or and insurance document
such as the MIGA guarantee detailed in Section 7.4.

7.4. Active Risk Mitigating Institutions
In addition to the mitigants discussed above, there are additional risk-mitigating financial instruments available from
various institutions, which the developer can investigate. The developer may be required to purchase some of these by
international lenders. The following risk mitigation institutions are active in the Pakistani power sector:


7.4.1. MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY (MIGA)
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) is a member of the World Bank Group. Established in 1988,
MIGA’s role is to promote cross-border investment and lending. It does this by providing risk insurance (guarantees)
against certain noncommercial risks to cross-border investments, and by providing dispute resolution services for
guaranteed investments. Its clients are debt and equity investors in its 181 member countries. MIGA insures foreign
direct investments against the following risks:

 a. Currency inconvertibility and transfer restrictions. This is the inability to convert or transfer dividends or loan
    payments due to foreign exchange restrictions;

 b. Expropriation. This is when a government nationalizes or otherwise makes it impossible to operate the project
    through discriminatory measures;

 c. War, civil disturbance, terrorism, and sabotage. This includes the destruction or interruption of business due to
    political violence;

 d. Breach of contract. This is the failure of government to honor obligations under contractual agreements and
    subsequent failure to honor arbitral awards; and

 e. Non-honoring of sovereign financial obligations.

The following are the basic requirements or eligibility criteria for MIGA’s coverage:

  • Cross-border investments made by investors in a MIGA member country into a developing member country;

  • New investments as well as existing investments meeting certain criteria;

  • Equity investments, shareholder loans, shareholder loan guarantees, and non-shareholder loans; and

  • Investment projects that are financially and economically viable and meet MIGA’s social and environmental
    performance standards (see Section 6.2.4 on EIA, Licenses and Permits).

Investors can go to MIGA’s website at www.miga.org and fill out an online application. The MIGA team will review the
standard information in confidence. After initial screening, MIGA will contact the investor.

An example of a MIGA guaranteed investment, is the 147 MW Star Hydropower Project being developed by Korea’s
K-Water and Daewoo E&C. MIGA issued a guarantee of US $148.5 million to cover an equity investment in the
Patrind Hydropower project being constructed on a ‘build, own, operate and transfer’ (BOOT) basis, which is a common
concessional arrangement in the power sector of Pakistan. The coverage is for the risk of breach of contract for a period
up to 20 years. The debt financing is being provided by IFC, ADB, IsDB and the Exim Bank of Korea.

7.4.2. WORLD BANK (IBRD/IDA)
The World Bank’s risk guarantee program primarily deals with governments and covers risks associated with different
kinds of public- and private-sector projects mostly in infrastructure and concessional financing. The following are the
guarantees provided by World Bank in order to protect investors:

Partial Risk Guarantees (PRG): PRGs cover commercial lenders for a private sector project against defaults arising
from a government-owned entity failing to perform its obligations. PRGs can cover changes in law, failure to meet
contractual payment obligations, expropriation and nationalization, currency transfer and convertibility, nonpayment
of a termination amount, failure to issue licenses in a timely manner, other risks to the extent they are covered by a
contractual obligation of a government entity, and noncompliance with an agreed dispute resolution clause. PRGs can be
provided in both IBRD and IDA countries and require a government counter-guarantee.

PRG’s can be structured to protect lenders of limited-recourse project finance debt, or to protect the Project Company
(“Letter of Credit” or “Deemed Loan” PRGs).58

• Eligible projects: Projects with private participation dependent on certain government contractual undertaking, such as:
  Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) and concession projects; Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects; and privatizations.
  The projects can be both greenfield or existing projects.

• Eligible debt: PRGs can be used for any commercial debt instruments (loans, bonds) provided by any private
  institution, including debt provided by sponsors in the form of shareholder loans. PRGs can cover both foreign
  currency and local currency debt.

• Risk coverage: PRGs can cover a range of risks relating to government performance including changes in law, failure to
  meet contractual payment obligations, obstruction of an arbitration process, expropriation and nationalization, foreign
  currency availability and convertibility, nonpayment of a termination amount or an arbitration award following a
  covered default, and failure to issue licenses, approvals, and consents in a timely manner.

In Pakistan, the World Bank has provided two PRGs so far. One is for the landmark IPP Hubco Power Project of 1,292
MW provided in 1995. The coverage was US $240 million against the total project cost of US $1.5 billion. Another
project was the 560 MW Uch Power project in 1996, which received a PRG for US $67 million.


7.4.3. ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)
The ADB has been actively involved in supporting the power and energy sector of Pakistan in both the private and public
domains. Along with the World Bank Group, the ADB remains one of Pakistan’s largest development partners, having
provided more than US $25 billion in loans, as well as more than US $200 million in grants, as of 31 December,
2014.59

The ADB is considered to be one of Pakistan’s largest partners in the energy sector, with energy projects comprising more
than half of the ADB portfolio for the country. The ADB has committed US $5.1 billion in ongoing operational funding
to develop Pakistan’s energy security, transportation infrastructure, irrigation networks, urban services, social protection
services, and reforms. Like other multilaterals, the ADB also offers guarantee products designed to mitigate risk exposure
of the financing partners/sponsors. The two primary guarantees are:


59 http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27786/pak.pdf


52 |
Political Risk Guarantees (PRGs): To cover political risk, the ADB offers a PRG designed to facilitate co-financing by
providing financing partners with coverage against specifically defined political or sovereign risks. Investors are covered
through Political Risk Guarantee for the following events:

a.Transfer restriction;

b. Expropriation;

c. Political violence;

d. Contract disputes; and

e. Non-honoring of a sovereign obligation or guarantee.

Like MIGA, the ADB’s PRG is designed to facilitate private sector development, either through public or private sector
projects. PRGs are well suited where commercial lenders are prepared to accept the commercial (or credit) risks of a
project, but not the political risks. The amount that the ADB will guarantee in relation to any one project or transaction
will vary depending on a wide variety of factors, including the ADB’s assessment of risk and applicable country exposure
limitations. At the upper limit, however, the ADB may guarantee up to 40% of the total project cost (in case of project
finance transactions) or US $400 million, whichever is lower. These upper limits will not apply if the ADB is protected
in the relevant transaction by a counter-guarantee given by the member country’s government. Limits lower than those
set out above will apply where the ADB has exposure to the project or transaction through direct financing instruments
e.g., loan, equity, or credit guarantee.

Partial Credit Guarantees (PCGs): The ADB provides partial credit guarantees (PCGs) to lenders of most forms of debt.
These include commercial bank loans, loans made by shareholders, loans guaranteed by shareholders or third parties,
capital market debt instruments, bonds, financial leases, LOCs, promissory notes, and bills of exchange.

PCGs cover nonpayment by the borrower or issuer on the guaranteed portion of the principal and interest due. This
guarantee product is principally applied to financial services and capital markets (e.g., banking, leasing, insurance, and
funds); and infrastructure (e.g., power, transportation, water supply and waste treatment, and telecommunications).
Partial credit guarantees can be applied to loans or other debt instruments issued by private and public sector projects
(limited recourse financings), PPPs, corporates, and (sub) sovereign entities.


7.4.4. OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
There are other international institutions investing and providing certain coverages in the power sector of Pakistan.
These include France’s PROPARCO (de Promotion et de Participation pour la Coopération Economique), EXIM Bank
of Korea, EXIM Bank of China, FMO (Netherlands Development Finance Company), Chinese Sinosure, OPOC and the
Islamic Development Bank.

8. Fiscal Regime and Taxation on
Renewables


8.1. Income Tax
INCOME TAX ON SALE OF ELECTRICITY

There is no tax on income derived from generation of electricity since renewable energy and all power projects are
exempted from income tax in Pakistan.60

A further exemption is provided in respect of turnover tax (minimum tax).61 Turnover tax or minimum tax is applicable
in situations where the taxpayer has no corporate tax liability, is exempt from tax or corporate tax liability is less than
1% of turnover.62 Normally, persons exempt from corporate tax are still liable to pay turnover tax or minimum tax
on the basis on their gross turnover (which has been defined above). However, taxpayers engaged in the generation of
electricity are also exempt from turnover tax.


INCOME TAX ON OTHER SOURCES OF INCOME
Income from sources other than the generation of electricity, including interest income, is taxable at the corporate
tax rate of 32% for tax year 2016. Income, including interest income, received by a corporate person in a tax year is
chargeable to tax on the rates applicable to the relevant year. As of now, the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (the 2001
Ordinance) provides specific tax rates for 5 years up to TY18, as shown in Table 10 below:

TABLE 10: PAKISTAN CORPORATE TAX RATES
 Tax Year                                Rate
 TY16                                    32%
 TY17                                    31%
 TY18                                    30%
Source: 2001 Ordinance

Although the 2001 Ordinance states that from tax year 2019 onwards, the tax rate would revert back to 35% (the
income tax rate prior to TY14), it may be noted that the gradual reduction in corporate tax rates was in line with a
government policy initiated at the request of the corporate sector. Accordingly, the tax should at minimum remain static
at 30%. However, this cannot be authoritatively confirmed.

The tax rates for individuals are based on progressive slabs. For salaried individuals, the tax rates vary from 0% to 30%,
whereas for non-salaried individuals, the rates vary from 0% to 35%. The rates of tax to be applied to each progressive
slab are set out in Annex 5.


8.2. Withholding Tax
WITHHOLDING TAX ON DIVIDENDS
As per Section 152 of the 2001 Ordinance, every person making a payment to a non-resident is required to withhold tax
at the specified rate. Withholding tax on dividends is not permitted as a Pass-Through Item under the tariff for wind and
solar power projects. The withholding tax rate on dividends for wind and solar power projects is 7.5%.

9. Challenges and
Recommendations

The major issues identified with the input of various developers,
observations from FIT determination in addition to industry norms are as
per below:




9.1. Timeline and Policy Uncertainty
No privately financed solar IPP has reached financial close in Pakistan. It is understood that projects awarded tariffs
under the 2014 and 2015 FIT determinations have been stalled as the Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) has been
waiting for a lower tariff. This has impacted investor confidence. NEPRA is clear that the CPPA must honor those tariffs
and has been consistent in granting extensions for developers to the timelines for financial close where government
organizations have not been cooperative. However, at the time of printing, this situation has yet to be resolved.

In addition, the issuance of LOIs by AEDB and provincial agencies had stalled in 2015 on the basis that a new tariff was
expected. It is hoped that this will resolve itself on publication of the 2016 tariff.


9.2. Land Identification
Land identification is one of the main hurdles for international developers looking to enter the Pakistani market. If a
local partner is not found who already has land access, it may take some time to identify lands that are suitable for
development. This is further hampered by a lack of public access to good digitalized maps.

The AEDB and the Government of Sindh are trying to make the process more investor friendly by identifying lands for
development.


9.3. Transmission Issues
NTDC has a number of applications pending for solar projects and due to the regulatory uncertainty has not been
processing applications as quickly as the timelines require.

The Grid Interconnection approval process takes time in Pakistan. Under the 2006 RE Policy, NTDC is required to
provide grid interconnection but this can take time and funding. It is recommended that NTDC is approached as soon as
possible and that developers work with them and local consultants to identify areas that are most suitable for evacuation
of power and that do not require substantial construction of transmission lines.

Pakistan Macroeconomic Update
World Bank Presentation 13 October 2015
Pakistan Macroeconomic Update


IMPROVED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

• Inflation declined to 4.5% in FY15

• Fiscal deficit contained at 5.3% of GDP due to high non-tax revenues and restricted expenditures, compared to 5.6%
  in FY14

• State Bank of Pakistan cut its key policy rate by 300 bps in FY15, owing to a decline in inflation (global oil price de-
  cline a factor)


GROWTH

•	Growth of 4.2% in FY15 compared to 4% in FY14, driven by services and agriculture, weaker than expected manu-
  facturing performance

•	Growth maintains upward momentum, but remains below required levels to accelerate job creation


BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

•	Foreign exchange reserves reached US $13.6 billion on 30th June 2015

•	Current Account deficit modest at 0.8% of GDP

•	Less risk of a Balance of Payments crisis, as foreign exchange reserves supported by increased remittances of US $18.5
  billion, decline in oil price and inflows from IFIs/donors


PRIVATE SECTOR CREDIT

•	Private sector credit growth has slowed, 5.6% increase in borrowing from commercial banks in FY15, lower than
  FY14

•	Increased budgetary borrowings continue to crowd out the private sector

Country Risk

•	Country risk perception has improved, Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus risk spread declined from 1011bps in
  March 2013 to 461 bps in April 2015

•	S&P credit rating changed from stable to positive in May 2015, rating at B-

•	IMF Program on track: 36 month EFF with IMF, received US $4.77 billion after eight successful quarterly program
  reviews

The outlook from FY15 to FY19 is for moderately higher economic growth, based on following conditions:




60 |
GROWTH

•	If the Government’s medium-term program to remove constraints to growth shows steady progress, i.e., electricity
  load-shedding, loss-prone SOEs, low access to finance, and poor revenue mobilization

•	Political and security risks are well managed

•	GDP growth reaches 4.5% in FY16 (the Government aims for 6%), and rises to 5.2% from FY18 onwards


BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

•	The Current Account deficit increases to 1% of GDP in FY17, slightly up from 0.8% of GDP in FY15

•	Foreign exchange reserves reach 3.9 months of import coverage by FY16, compared to 3.3 months by the end of FY15

•	Slightly higher foreign investment inflows under CPEC and initial privatizations, multilateral financial net inflows de-
  cline

•	Gross financing requirements reach US $7.7 billion by FY17


FISCAL DEFICIT

Consolidated fiscal deficit is cut in half, from 5.3% of GDP in FY 15 to 2.8% in FY19


PRIVATE SECTOR CREDIT

Fiscal consolidation reduces government borrowing needs, and a positive external sector improves financing conditions
for the private sector


PUBLIC DEBT

Public Debt to GDP ratio declines to 62.9% in FY17, from 64.6% in FY15

Indexation Mechanism for Foreign and Local O&M Cost
The O&M component of the tariff will be adjusted on account of local Inflation (CPI) and foreign inflation (US CPI) and
exchange rate quarterly on 1st July, 1st October, 1st January and 1st April based on the latest available information with
respect to CPI notified by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), US CPI issued by US Bureau of Labor Statistics and
revised TT & OD selling rate of US Dollar notified by the National Bank of Pakistan as per the following mechanism for
the 2016 Tariff:

 L O&M(Rev)         =   70% O&M(Ref)* CPI (Rev)/CPI (Ref)
 F O&M(Rev)         =   30 % O&M(Ref)* US CPI(Rev)/US CPI(Ref)*ER(Rev)/ER(Ref)
 Where
 L O&M(Rev)         =   The revised applicable O&M Local Component of Tariff
 F O&M(Rev)         =   The revised applicable O&M Foreign Component of tariff
 O&M(Ref)           =   The reverence O&M component of tariff for North Region Rs. 1.8715/kWh and for South Region Rs. 1.7674/kWh
 CPI(Rev)           =   The revised Consumer Price Index (General) published by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics
 CPI(Ref)           =   The reference Consumer Price Index (General) of 201.620 for the month of July 2015
 US CPI(Rev)        =   The revised US CPI (All Urban Consumers) published by US Bureau of Labor Statistics
 US CPI(Ref)        =   The reference US CPI (All Urban Consumers of 238.654 for the month of July 2015
 ER(Rev)            =   The revised TT & OD selling rate of US dollar published by the National Bank of Pakistan
 ER(Ref)            =   The reference TT & OD selling rate of PKR 105/US $



Indexation for LIBOR
 ΔI                =    P(Rev)*(LIBOR(Rev)-0.31%)/4
 Where
 ΔI                =    The variation in interest charges applicable corresponding to variation in 3 months LIBOR. Δ I can be positive or
                        negative depending upon whether LIBOR(Rev) is >or<0.31%. The interest payment obligation will be enhanced
                        or reduced to the extent of Δ I for each quarter under adjustment applicable on quarterly basis.
 P(Rev)            =    The outstanding principal (as indicated in the attached debt service to the NEPRA tariff determination) on a
                        quarterly basis on the relevant quarterly calculation date. Period 1 shall commence on the date on which the
                        first installment is due after availing of the grace period.



Indexation of Return on Equity
After COD, the ROE component of the tariff will be quarterly indexed on account of variation in PKR/US $ parity ac-
cording to the following formula:

 ROE(Rev)           =    ROE(Ref)*ER(Rev/ER(Ref)
 Where
 ROE(Rev)           =    Revised ROE Component of Tariff
 ROE(Ref)           =    ROE Component of Tariff established at the time of COD
 ER(Rev)            =    The revised TT & OD selling rate of US dollar as notified by the National Bank of Pakistan
 ER(Ref)            =    Reference Exchange Rate at the time of COD




62 |
Insurance Adjustment for Actual Insurance Cost
The actual insurance cost for the minimum cover required under contractual obligations with the power purchaser not
exceeding 1% of the EPC cost will be treated as a pass-through. Insurance component of the reference tariff shall be
adjusted annually as per actual upon production of authentic documentary evidence according to the following formula.

    AIC            =     Ins(Ref)/P(Ref)*P(Act)
    Where
    AIC            =    Adjusted Insurance Component of Tariff
    Ins(Ref)       =    Reference Insurance Component of Tariff
    P(Ref)         =    Reference Premium 1% of EPC cost at PKR 105/US $
    P(Act)         =    Actual Premium or 1% of the EPC cost in PKR on exchange rate prevailing on first day of the insurance cover-
                        age period whichever is lower

Main Sponsor

Subject:	LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A [•] POWER GENERATION FACILITY HAVING
INSTALLED CAPACITY OF [•]MW (LOCATED AT [•], PROVINCE OF ____________, PAKISTAN



Dear Sir,
A. REFERENCE

[•], a company incorporated under the Companies Ordinance, 1984, under certificate of incorporation no. [•] dated [•],
    (the “Project Company”):

(i)	 having received the Letter of Intent dated January 30 ,2014 from Alternative Energy Development Board (“AEDB”)
     whereby AEDB has confirmed its interest in the Project, as defined herein and, where applicable, the successful sub-
     mission of a feasibility study; and

 (ii) having received from NEPRA a Tariff Determination No [•] dated [•] on the terms and conditions set out therein as
   amended from time to time (the “Tariff Determination” and the tariff determined pursuant thereto, the “Tariff”); and

(iii) having received from NEPRA a electricity generation license no. [•], dated [•] (the “Generation Licence”) for the
     generation of electric power on the terms and conditions set out therein,



is now issued this Letter of Support (the “LOS”), on the terms and conditions set out herein, by AEDB for the develop-
ment, design, engineering, manufacture, procurement, financing, construction, completion, testing and commissioning,
insurance, ownership, operation and maintenance of an approximately [•]MW ( ISO gross installed capacity) power gen-
eration facility (the “Complex”) to be located near [•], Province of [•] and all activities incidental thereto (the “Project”).

The Complex shall be a renewable electricity generation facility utilizing [•] as the renewable energy resource for genera-
tion of electricity.

The Project Company has posted in favor of AEDB an irrevocable, unconditional, on demand, without recourse, bank
guarantee on terms acceptable to AEDB dated [•] issued by (name of issuing bank ) (the “Performance Guarantee”) in
the amount of US Dollars [•]. The Performance Guarantee secures the Project Company’s obligations to execute the
Project Agreements (reference paragraph B(1)), to achieve Financial Closing (reference paragraph B(2)) and to pay the
Termination Amount (reference paragraph B(6)) under and in accordance with the terms of this LOS. The Performance
Guarantee shall remain valid and in full force till the expiry of three (3) months beyond the Required Financial Closing
Date (as specified in paragraph B(2)) provided however, in the event the Financial Closing is achieved on or prior to the
Required Financial Closing Date, the Performance Guarantee shall be returned to the Project Company on the date of its
achievement of Financial Closing,. The Performance Guarantee shall be encashable in accordance with the terms of this
LOS at any time prior to Financial Closing, on call at any time during the period of its validity by AEDB. The Project
Company hereby agrees that it shall have no claim against AEDB, the Government of Pakistan (the “GOP”), the Govern-
ment of [•] (the “GO[•]”) or any agency or instrumentality or component thereof on any grounds whatsoever if AEDB
acting in its sole discretion shall make any call upon or encash the Performance Guarantee; provided that such call or

64 |
encashment is made in accordance with the terms of this LOS, and the Project Company hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permissible by law, any such claim. It is agreed that the amounts encashed under the Performance Guarantee in
accordance with the terms of this LOS are reasonable and constitute liquidated damages to the GOP and AEDB for the
Project Company’s failure to (as applicable) (a) execute the Project Agreements (reference paragraph B(1)), (b) timely
achieve Financial Closing (reference paragraph B(2)) and (c) pay the Termination Amount (reference paragraph B(6)), in
each case, in accordance with the terms of this LOS, and it is understood and agreed that the encashment in full of the
Performance Guarantee by the AEDB is in lieu of actual damages for such occurrence and the collection of such sums
pursuant to such Performance Guarantee pursuant to this LOS is the sole remedy of the GOP and AEDB for such events.

Until Financial Closing (as defined hereinafter), this LOS and the provisions of the Project Agreements (as defined here-
under) that become effective immediately upon signing of the Project Agreements shall govern the implementation of the
Project and shall supersede all other documents and agreements. In the event of any conflict between this LOS and the
provisions of the Project Agreements that become effective upon signing, this LOS shall govern and prevail. Effective on
the date Financial Closing is achieved by the Project Company, the Project Agreements shall supersede the LOS. AEDB
shall cancel and return the Performance Guarantee to the Project Company on the date Financial Closing is achieved.


B. AUTHORIZATION

AEDB hereby conveys its permission to the Project Company to implement the Project in accordance with the terms of
this LOS and, when the Project Agreements become effective, in accordance with the Project Agreements. Electricity pro-
duced by the Complex shall be sold to the National Transmission and Despatch Company Limited (through its Central
Power Purchasing Agency) on behalf of ex-WAPDA distribution companies (the “Purchaser”) in accordance with the
Generation License, Tariff Determination and the provisions of the Energy Purchase Agreement (“EPA”) to be entered
into between the Project Company and the Purchaser. The Project Company shall be responsible for performing and
causing the performance of all activities necessary and incidental to its obligations under this LOS, including the follow-
ing:


1. The Project Company shall, on or prior to the Required Financial Closing Date or (if applicable in terms of this LOS)
    the Extended Required Financial Closing Date, negotiate and sign an Implementation Agreement (“IA”) with the Pres-
    ident of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and an EPA with the Purchaser, failing which the Performance Guarantee
    shall be encashed for the full amount thereof by AEDB provided that if the delay is caused by the actions of the GOP,
    AEDB or the Purchaser, then, the Project Company shall not be penalized.

The IA and EPA are collectively referred to in this LOS as the “Project Agreements”.


2. Unless Financial Closing is delayed or not achieved on account of any Consents (as defined in the IA) not being issued
   to the Project Company despite its compliance with its obligations under the IA relating thereto by the Required
   Financial Closing Date or the Extended Financial Closing Date, the Project Company shall achieve Financial Closing
   no later than [insert date] (the “Required Financial Closing Date”), failing which the Performance Guarantee shall
   be encashed in the full amount thereof by AEDB, provided that if the delay is caused by actions of the GOP, AEDB
   or the Purchaser, then, the Project Company shall not be penalized. In addition to any other consequences set out in
   the Project Agreements, if AEDB determines that any delay by the Project Company in achieving Financial Closing by
   the Required Financial Closing Date is due to events beyond the reasonable control of the Project Company or that
   Financial Closing can be achieved shortly, AEDB shall be entitled (acting on an application in writing made to it by
   the Project Company at least thirty (30) days before the Required Financial Closing Date to grant in writing to the
   Project Company a one time extension of up to a maximum period of six (6) months beyond the Required Financial
   Closing Date (such extended date being hereinafter referred to as the “Extended Required Financial Closing Date”
   and this LOS shall stand correspondingly extended on the same terms and conditions for such additional period. No
   claim for an extension to the Required Financial Closing Date and the period of validity of this LOS shall be accom-


                                                                                                                        | 65
    modated or considered by AEDB unless the following actions are taken by the Project Company to the satisfaction of
    AEDB (i) the Project Company extends the period of validity of the Performance Guarantee so that the Performance
    Guarantee is valid on the same terms and conditions up till three (3) months beyond the Extended Required Financial
    Closing Date; and (ii) the maximum amount in which the Performance Guarantee can be called is doubled. Follow-
    ing any extension as aforesaid, the Project Company shall submit monthly reports that set out in adequate detail the
    additional efforts made by the Project Company to achieve Financial Closing no later than the Extended Required
    Financial Closing Date and the progress achieved in that regard. In the event the Performance Guarantee is extended
    in accordance with the terms of this LOS up till three (3) months beyond the Extended Required Financial Closing
    Date, such Performance Guarantee shall expire and shall be returned to the Project Company on the date falling on
    the earlier of: (i) the date on which Financial Closing is achieved by the Project Company; (b) the date falling three (3)
    months after the Extended Required Financial Closing Date.


3. For the purposes of this LOS, “Financial Closing” means (a) the execution and delivery of the Financing Documents
   (as defined in the IA) that together with equity commitments evidence sufficient financing for the construction, testing,
   completion, and commissioning of the Complex (following the resolution of any objections raised by AEDB to a term
   sheet or debt repayment schedule that sets out a principal repayment schedule and the other principal terms of the
   transaction between the Project Company and the Lenders (as defined in the IA)) and the evidence of commitments
   for such equity as is required by the Project Company to satisfy the requirements of the Lenders and this LOS and
   the satisfaction, waiver or deferral of all conditions precedent for the initial availability of funds under the Financing
   Documents, and (b) the delivery of the Seller Letter of Credit (as defined in the EPA) to the Purchaser.


4. In no event shall Financial Closing be deemed to have occurred unless the Project Company has paid all amounts then
   due and owing to AEDB under this LOS.

	   The Project Company shall pay AEDB the processing fee of US $100,000 within one (01) month of issuance of this

    all) of the Project Agreements executed by the counterparties thereto at any time before the Required Financial
    Closing Date. Such termination option may only be exercised upon payment by the Project Company to AEDB of
    an amount (“Termination Amount”) equal to (i) the maximum amount in which the Performance Guarantee can
    be encashed multiplied by the number of months from the date of issuance of this LOS to the date of receipt by
    AEDB of the Termination Amount (rounded up to the next whole number) divided by the total number of months
    from the date of issuance of the LOS to the Required Financial Closing Date, and (ii) the receipt by AEDB in full of
    the processing fee. In the event of termination of this LOS and/or the Project Agreements by the Project Company
    without payment of the Termination Amount, AEDB shall be entitled to encash the Performance Guarantee. For the
    avoidance of any doubt, in the event that the Project Company exercises the termination option during the additional
    period provided for achieving Financial Closing, the entire doubled amount of the Performance Guarantee shall be
    encashable on call by AEDB and the “Termination Amount” shall be construed accordingly.

Annex 6

Environmental and Social considerations for renewable energy projects and financing
The development of all solar and wind projects will have both environmental and social implications with the scale and
nature of impacts dependent on a number of factors including, among others, plant size, location, nearest settlements and
proximity to environmental designations. Some of the key factors are discussed further in the following sections.


APPLICABLE STANDARDS

In order to deliver a project acceptable to international lending institutions (i.e. to enable finance to be provided), work
should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the key standards and principles set out in the following
sections.


EQUATOR PRINCIPLES

The Equator Principles (EPs) (www.equator-principles.com) consists of ten principles relating to environmental and so-
cial assessment and management. In addition, they include reporting and monitoring requirements for Equator Principles
Financial Institutions (EPFIs). The EPs set a financial industry benchmark, adopted by financial institutions, for determin-
ing, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in projects.

There are currently 78 EPFIs in 34 countries that have officially adopted the EP standards. The institutions listed will
not provide finance to clients who do not, or are unable to, comply with the EPs. Some of these lenders such as the Eu-
ropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) or other international or local financial institutions may have
additional standards to be adhered to.

The EPs apply globally and to all industry sectors and hence are relevant to the solar and wind industries.

The ten EPs relate to the following topics:

        • EP1 - Review and Categorization.

        • EP2 - Environment and Social Assessment.

        • EP3 - Applicable Environmental and Social Standards.

        • EP4 - Environmental and Social Management System and Equator Principles Action Plan.

        • EP5 - Stakeholder Engagement.

        • EP6 - Grievance mechanism.

        • EP7 - Independent Review.

        • EP8 - Covenants.

        • EP9 - Independent Monitoring and Reporting.

        • EP10 - Reporting and Transparency.

	
IFC PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ON SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

As set out in EP3, countries not designated as High Income OECD countries should apply the social and environmental
sustainability standards laid down by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). These standards have been developed
for the IFC’s own investment projects but have set an example for private companies and financial institutions world-
wide.

                                                                                                                          | 71
The IFC Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability (www.ifc.org/performancestandards) relate
to the following key topics:

	       Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts.

	       Performance Standard 2: Labor and Working Conditions.

	       Performance Standard 3: Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention

	       Performance Standard 4: Community Health, Safety and Security.

	       Performance Standard 5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement.

	       Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources.

	       Performance Standard 7: Indigenous Peoples.

	       Performance Standard 8: Cultural Heritage.



Compliance with the IFC Performance Standards will not only facilitate a socially and environmentally sustainable proj-
ect but will also facilitate the sourcing of finance for the project. In addition, a set of Guidance Notes, corresponding to
the Performance Standards, was developed by IFC to offer helpful guidance on the requirements contained in the Perfor-
mance Standards, including reference materials, and on good sustainability practices to improve project performance.

In addition to EP1 on impact assessment, where there are multiple projects located within close vicinity, the cumulative
nature of impacts must be considered for both wind and solar projects. Please refer to the IFC Good Practice Handbook
on Cumulative Impacts Assessment for further information (http://www.ifc.org/sustainabilitypublications).


WORLD BANK GROUP ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (EHS) GUIDELINES

The World Bank Group EHS Guidelines (www.ifc.org/ehsguidelines) are a set of technical reference documents contain-
ing general and industry specific examples of good international industry practice. The General EHS Guidelines contain
guidance relating to environmental, health, and safety issues, which are applicable across all industry sectors. The in-
dustry sector EHS guidelines contain the performance levels and measures that are generally considered to be achievable
in new facilities by existing technology at reasonable costs and are designed to be used together with the General EHS
Guidelines document. Specific EHS Guidelines, which are recommended for reference, include the EHS Guideline for
Wind Energy and the EHS Guideline on Electric Power, Transmission and Distribution.


LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS

Environmental and social legislation and regulations vary between countries and specific regions; however, the EP and
IFC Performance Standards set the minimum acceptable standard for developments worldwide.

A large number of countries have national legislative requirements that are on a par with or higher than the EP / IFC
standards and guidelines. In this instance, the more stringent national requirements should be reviewed and adhered to.

In countries where environmental and social legislation requirements are less demanding, a project seeking financing by
the IFC / EPFI must be developed in accordance with these requirements but must also commit to comply with the EP /
IFC standards.
