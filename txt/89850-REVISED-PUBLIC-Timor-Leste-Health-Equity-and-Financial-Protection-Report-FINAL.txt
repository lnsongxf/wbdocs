EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

  This report analyses equity and financial protection in the health sector of Timor-Leste. In particular, it examines
  inequalities in health outcomes, health behavior and health care utilization; benefit incidence analysis; financial
  protection; and the progressivity of health care financing. Data are drawn from the 2009/2010 Demographic and Health
  Survey, the 2001-2002 and 2007-2008 Living Standards and Measurement Surveys as well as 2011-2012 Household
  Income Expenditure Survey, and the Ministry of Finance. All analyses are conducted using original data and performed
  using the health modules of the ADePT software.

    	 This indicates that external resources are channeled through both the public and private revenue sources.

    	 Out-of-Pocket payments are typically direct spending after deducting third party payments such as insurance (WHO 2006) available at http://www.who.
      int/nha/methods/estimating_OOPs_ravi_final.pdf. The TLSMS includes payments for health care services and medicines as part of health spending.
10
   	 WHO National Health Accounts estimates (2013)
11
   	 According to Lewis (2010), the frequency of informal payments to public health care workers among users of health services vary widely from 3 percent
      in Peru to 96 percent in Pakistan. Informal payment in this study is defined as “payments to individual and institutional providers, in kind or in cash that
      are made outside official payment channels or are purchases meant to be covered by the health care system including value of medical supplies purchased by
      patients and drugs obtained from private pharmacies but intended to be part of government-financed health care services,”
12
    	 Nearly half of patients who went to private providers reported to pay nothing. This might be due to the fact that patients paid in-kind (e.g., chicken), and
      that the survey didn’t capture that.

    Most policymakers regard large inequalities in health outcomes between the poor and rich as undesirable. This section
    reports inequalities in child and adult health outcomes, as well as health behaviors.

A Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) was fielded in Timor-                  income measures, but one can construct an “asset index” using

Table 2.2 shows certain risk factors such as smoking are more concentrated among the poor for both men and women: Smoking rates
among men are high at 70 percent, with higher prevalence of smoking concentrated among the poor. Smoking is not very prevalent
among Timorese women, but higher among poor women. Less than one percent of non-pregnant women are obese. The prevalence
of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among men is worse among the wealthy.

3.      INEQUALITIES IN HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION


  In many countries, for a variety of possible reasons, the pattern of health care utilization tends to be distributed unequally
  across income groups, even after taking into account differences in medical needs. This section reports on inequalities in
  utilization of health care in Timor-Leste for different types of care, and for different types of health care providers.


3.1.	 Data availability
As stated previously, a DHS was fielded in Timor-Leste from                  and income measures, but one can construct an “asset index”
2009 to 2010. The DHS has data on utilization of maternal                    using principal components analysis to rank households from
and child health interventions. The DHS lacks consumption                    poorest to richest (see Filmer and Pritchett 2001).

across consumption or asset quintiles. The tables show the                   poor, while a positive index indicates that the indicator takes
mean values of the indicator for each quintile, as well as for the           high values among the better-off. The larger the index in

4.        BENEFIT INCIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING


     Policymakers typically take the view that government health expenditure (GHE) ought not to disproportionately benefit
     the better-off, and if anything ought to favor the poor more than the better-off. Benefit-incidence analysis (BIA) shows
     whether and how far GHE disproportionately benefits the poor. This section reports BIA results for Timor-Leste, using
     three methods for allocating GHE to households, namely (i) the constant unit cost assumption, (ii) the constant unit
     subsidy assumption, and (iii) the proportional unit cost assumption. The first is arguably the least plausible of the three,
     since it implies that higher fees are not a reflection of more costly care (see Table 4.2). However, it does have the attraction
     of not needing to be modified if part of (general) GHE goes on demand-side subsidies through, for example, a conditional
     cash transfer for health.
     In Timor-Leste, recurrent spending on services is allocated to two major areas: district health services and hospitals.
     Generally, spending on hospitals is pro-rich whereas spending on district health services is pro-poor. Overall total
     government spending on health favors the rich. The results presented below were obtained using the constant-unit-
     subsidy and proportional-unit-cost assumptions; it is assumed implicitly that supply- and demand-side subsidies have
     the same distributional impact.

     	 It would be preferable to categorize the level of services as inpatient and outpatient services. However, the financial data from the MoH is reported
       as hospital and district services. Districts are expected to be responsible for primary care services while hospitals are responsible for inpatient services.
       However, it is possible that, without an effective gatekeeper system, care provided at hospitals may include outpatient services. Or, because of limitations
       in transport, districts may be providing inpatient services.

5.      FINANCIAL PROTECTION IN HEALTH


  Countries finance their health care through a mix of OOPs, private and social insurance, general revenues, and international
  development assistance. Therefore, the goal of health systems is not just to improve health but also to ensure that people
  are protected from the financial consequences of illness and death, or at least from the financial consequences of having
  to obtain medical care. This section presents data on two alternative measures of financial protection, one that considers
  whether OOPs is ‘catastrophic’, and the other that considers if it is ‘impoverishing’. Neither captures the income losses
  associated with illness, and both therefore underestimate the full financial impact of ill health on households. The section
  also explains the institutional arrangements used in Timor-Leste to provide financial protection in the health sector, and
  presents data on levels of inequalities in coverage.

  	 This could be a function of many possible factors, but the existing data do not provide concrete answers on why catastrophic payments are found to be
    concentrated among the wealthy. For example, a health financing system provides good financial protection for the poor, the utilization rates of the health
    system by the poor are low, or the wealthy are using more expensive services. The 2007/08 utilization data show that the wealthy do use (potentially more
    expensive) hospital services more frequently.

6.      PROGRESSIVITY OF HEALTH FINANCING
                                        Health Equity and Financial Protection Report




       There is a general consensus that payments for health care ought to be at least proportional to households’ ability to pay,
       if not progressive (meaning a poor household contributes a smaller share of its resources than a rich one). The overall
       progressivity of a health financing system depends on the progressivity of each source of finance, and the share of health
       spending financed through each source. A system that relies exclusively on OOPs is likely to be regressive, since OOPs
       often absorbs a larger share of a poor household’s resources than of a rich household’s resources.
       This is not always the case, as it is likely that the poor are under-using health care, something that can be assessed by the
       distribution of health utilization.

     provide data on household consumption, OOPs and tax                   contributions at the national level are proportional to the taxes
     payments by tax type. The MoF provides data on revenues               for the health sector.
     for general government financing. There is no dedicated tax


     6.2.	 Progressivity of health care financing
     The first five rows of Table 6.1 show each quintile’s average         high degree of inequality with a Gini coefficient of 0.292 in
     consumption and financing share with households ranked                2011/12, which is comparable to 0.297 in 2007/08, and an
     in ascending order of gross consumption (i.e. consumption             improvement from 0.403 in 2001/02. This indicates that the
     including health care payments). Health care payments are             wealthy consume a large share of all the goods and services. For
     considered progressive if the poorest quintile’s share in total       example, the wealthiest quintile consumes 38.7 percent of all
     household consumption exceeds its share in total payments,            goods and services, almost as much as the poorest 60 percent
     while the opposite is true of the richest quintile. Payments are      who consume 39.1 percent of all goods and services in 2011/12.
     regressive if the poorest quintile’s share in total consumption is
                                                                           For the health system to be progressive, the wealthy should be
     less than its share in total payments. Again, the opposite is true
                                                                           paying more than their share of total consumption in taxes and
     of the richest quintile. This exercise can be done for total health
                                                                           OOPs. In 2011, the Kakwani index was 0.385 indicating a

Section 4: Benefit-incidence analysis
The section on benefit incidence analysis uses three different
methods for allocating government health expenditure
to households, invoking three different assumptions that
are described in detail in Wagstaff (2011). The first, the
constant unit cost assumption, treats the sum of individual
fees and government subsidies as constant, and thus any
fees paid when using public services results in a reduction in
the government subsidy received. The second, the constant
unit subsidy assumption, allocates the same subsidy to each
unit of service used, irrespective of the fees paid. Finally, the
third, the proportional unit cost assumption, makes the cost
of care proportional to the fees paid, which implies that the
government subsidy received increases as the fees paid increases.
In calculating the distribution of fees, service utilization and
government subsidies, households are ranked by per capita
consumption. The quintile data sources for this section include
multipurpose household surveys that are used to obtain
information on service utilization at difference levels of care
and fees paid by patients. Data on government subsidies at
each level of service are obtained from government reports on
budgets and health expenditures.
Section 5: Financial protection
This section examines catastrophic health care payments and
impoverishment due to OOPs. In this section, households are
ranked by consumption. The analysis of catastrophic health
care payments follows the popular approach elaborated upon
O’Donnell et al. (2008) which defines health spending as
“catastrophic” if it exceeds some fraction or threshold of total
expenditure, or of total nonfood expenditure, in a given period.
As O’Donnell et al. (2008) note, the threshold of 10% for total
expenditure and 40% for nonfood expenditure are commonly
used in the literature. In addition to measures of incidence,
distribution-sensitive measures of catastrophic payments are
calculated, specifically the concentration index, and statistical
significance is reported. The analysis of impoverishing
expenditure uses the national poverty lines.
Section 6: Progressivity of health care finance
This section examines the progressivity of different sources
of healthcare financing/payments, including OOPs, health
insurance contributions, direct taxation and indirect taxation.
The Kakwani index, defined as the concentration index minus
the Gini coefficient, indicates whether payments are more/less
concentrated among the better off than consumption is and,
thus, is a sign of whether payments are progressive/regressive.
The main data source needed for the analysis of progressivity
of health care financing is a multipurpose household survey,
preferably with a very detailed consumption module.
