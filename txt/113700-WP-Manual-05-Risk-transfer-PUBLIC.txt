4             RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
Preface and Acknowledgements
Five manuals were prepared by IFC for the development of agri-insurance markets where the public and
private sectors work together in a partnership (PPP). The manuals are designed to strengthen the capacity
of the government and market players to effectively design agri-insurance products, both traditional
indemnity and index, introduce them to the market, and build sales. The manuals are designed to be
succinct yet at the same time sufficient to create the technical and administrative foundation for a modern
agri-insurance system, and to allow programs in early stages of development to properly plan the required
system. Finally the manuals are designed to train practitioners, to build local capacity for skills that are
required to start the program, and to enable the program to grow over time.

The principle author of the manuals is Professor Myles Watts, University Professor, Lead Actuary at Watts
& Associates, Member of the Board at the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, and 5th Generation
Montana Farmer. Watts and Associates designed and launched numerable agri-insurance products in
North America, frequently consults for the major reinsurers, and supports insurance programs around the
world. They have established their own index insurance company, eWeatherRisk. The manuals incorporate
practical lessons learned over the past 40 years.

The development of the manuals was a joint activity of the Ukraine Agri-Insurance Project (2007-2015),
IFC’s Global Agri-Finance Team, and the Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF) (2009 to present). Dr. Gary
Reusche led the Ukrainian project, served as a technical specialist on the global agri-ﬁnance team, and as
a member of the GIIF technical committee and core management team. Agri-insurance development is

The manuals result from training workshops developed by the agri-insurance project in Ukraine and globally

6        RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
1.0.       Introduction
Agricultural production is inherently subject to a variety of risks because
management decisions or states-of-nature often generate future
outcomes (either favorable or unfavorable) that cannot be predicted
with certainty. The variability of these outcomes represents risk. Some
risks are managed through production and ﬁnancial decision-making,
while others are simply accepted as business expenses. In addition, some
risks can be managed through a variety of contractual and insurance-
related products.

On average, ﬁnancial activities with low levels of risk are associated with
lower potential returns. Low-risk investment actions tend to generate
very small returns. Conversely, high levels of ﬁnancial risk are generally
associated with high expected returns. However, the risk/return trade-
off does not mean that accepting high levels of risk guarantees higher
returns. Rather, high levels of risk provide the possibility of high returns
and vice versa. Individuals and ﬁrms must be compensated for accepting
higher levels of risk with at least the potential to receive higher returns.
An individual’s willingness to accept risk depends primarily on the
willingness and ability of that individual to bear risk. The degree of
risk aversion (or risk acceptance) depends on many factors, including
personality traits, experience, ﬁnancial reserves, and relationships among
business partners.

Risks associated with agricultural production ultimately impact the
ﬁnancial viability and sustainability of farms and ranches. Agricultural
production is often coincident with high short-term credit risk because
of a combination of high ﬁxed costs, weather variability, disease, and
variations in cash receipts. In an average year, annual net farm revenues
may be sufficient for agricultural producers to make principal and interest
payments on debt and realize proﬁts, but across-year revenue variability
may cause farm businesses to fail because of periodic inabilities to service
debt obligations. Hence, whether an agricultural producer self-insures or
uses formal mechanisms for transferring risk to others, risk is a cost that
must be effectively managed.

Agricultural production risks also impact the viability of businesses that
supply agricultural credit and insurance services to agricultural producers.
Agricultural ﬁnance companies must account for potential reductions in
debt repayment as a result of agricultural production risks. Hence, they
must either maintain adequate capital reserves or pay fees to transfer this
risk to other entities. The term “capital” refers to the equity available to
cover unexpected losses (e.g., a revenue shortfall or cash outﬂ ow) so that
all counterparty liabilities can be fully reimbursed. Likewise, agricultural
insurance providers must retain adequate capital levels for servicing
potential indemnity payments that result from agricultural production
risks. Alternatively, ﬁrms may participate in a variety of risk-sharing
arrangements with other companies or with governments.

All ﬁrms must evaluate the relative merits of three general risk-
management strategies: (1) avoidance, (2) absorption, and (3) transfer.
First, a ﬁrm can opt to avoid risk, reducing or eliminating risky
opportunities. For example, a lending agency can choose to not offer
credit to high-risk producers. Of course, insurance ﬁrms exist to accept
risk from others, but they can choose to provide insurance to less-risky
enterprises or in less-risky regions. Second, a ﬁrm can decide to absorb or
accept risk that has been incurred. In these cases, capital adequacy is an


                                                                               MANUAL 5   7
important aspect of risk management. Third, a ﬁrm can decide to transfer risk to others. This is essentially what
happens when an agricultural producer cedes risk to an insurance company in exchange for paying an insurance
premium. Likewise, credit or primary insurers can transfer risk to other companies in exchange for a fee. This
process is generally termed “reinsurance.”

1.1.       Credit and Insurance Relationships
Although a variety of approaches exist to manage risk, each involves transaction costs and risk premiums paid by
those seeking to mitigate risk to those willing to accept additional risk. Transaction costs and risk premiums can be
incorporated into: (1) interest rates, (2) insurance, and (3) other instruments. These approaches can be viewed as
“options.” Options are ﬁnancial instruments that contractually specify the events that trigger offsetting payments.

Loan default risk can be incorporated into operating, intermediate, and real estate loan interest rates. The
advantage of incorporating risk premiums into interest rates (rather than other instruments) is that transaction
costs are reduced because only two entities (a borrower and a lender) are involved. That is, the costs of risk
transfer increase as additional entities are included. For example, a third party (e.g., an insurance company
brokerage ﬁrm) requires substantial information about borrower risks, increasing total transaction costs.

Nonetheless, incorporating risk premiums into interest rates is also
problematic. For example, higher interest rates increase the probability
of loan default and—often —the discontinuation of a farm business.
This results in the repossession of collateral, which is costly and highly
disruptive to both individuals and communities. Furthermore, using
interest rates to compensate lenders for high credit risk increases interest
payments, reduces farm proﬁtability and repayment capacities, and
hampers investment in production-expanding technologies. In addition,
the potential for crop failures increases credit risk, resulting in higher
interest rates on agricultural operating, intermediate, and real-estate
loans.

The availability and use of agricultural insurance reduces credit risk,
lowers interest rates, improves repayment capacities, increases credit
availability, and reduces ﬁnancial and business risk. Crop insurance costs,
however, can also be substantial. Crop insurance is subject to relatively
high monitoring costs, requires large amounts of high-quality data to
establish actuarially sound premium rates, and is inherently subject to
moral hazard and adverse selection problems.

The pure risk premium component of interest rates in the absence of
insurance is exactly equal to an insurance pure risk premium if the policies
perfectly insure against loan default perils. As a result, insurance increases
business costs only in the sense that it increases transaction costs.
Insurance premiums are not separate, risk-related costs. In the absence
of transaction costs, insurance premiums and the risk component
incorporated into risk-adjusted interest rates would be identical. Risk is a
cost of business activity, regardless of how it is managed.

1.2.       Risk Management by Credit and Insurance
           Firms
Agricultural credit and insurance ﬁrms acquire risk through lending and
insurance business practices. However, they must also balance the risk
of loan defaults and insurance indemnities while maintaining adequate
capital reserves. That is, above-average loan defaults or unexpectedly
large indemnity payments require sufficient equity capital to maintain
business integrity. As with any business ﬁrm, credit and insurance
companies must have sufficient capital to manage unexpected cash
outﬂows. Consequently, credit and insurance ﬁrms must decide how to
manage this risk.

8       RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
2.0.        Agricultural Risk Management
Agriculture production is subject to many risks. For example, crop yields
are highly inﬂuenced by unpredictable weather and climatic factors.
In addition, crop and input prices vary with world, regional, and local
factors that often cannot be accurately predicted. Investments in
many technologies also have uncertain outcomes. Finally, changes in
government domestic and trade policies can inﬂuence the proﬁtability
and repayment capacities of agricultural operations.

2.1.       Agricultural Risks
Agricultural risks refer to events that negatively impact agricultural
production or proﬁtability. Risks can be characterized as:
  1.   Production risks, including extreme weather conditions, disease,
       pest infestations, and technology failures;
  2. Market risks, including changes in output prices, market access, and
     input availability and prices;
  3. Financial risks, including insufficient funds for debt repayment or
     family living expenses, a lack of credit availability, increased interest
     rates, and low returns from investments in new technologies;
  4. Political and policy changes resulting in market distortions,
     unfavorable changes in exchange rates, and credit availability;
  5. Legal risks, including ambiguous contract law, inconsistent judicial
     decisions and bankruptcy rulings, and other legal uncertainties;
  6. Personal and human resource risks, including the deterioration of
     personal relationships and uncertainty regarding the health, safety,
     and lives of owners, managers, and employees.

2.2.       Risk-Management Strategies
Managing agricultural (and other business) risks usually involves using
more than a single approach. Risks can be avoided, absorbed, or
transferred. The least sustainable management practices occur when
risks are ignored.

2.2.1. Risk Avoidance. Avoiding risk is a common approach to risk
management. That is, agricultural producers, ﬁnancial entities, and other
ﬁrms frequently make rational decisions that mitigate risk by deciding
a priori to not incur it. For example, agricultural producers realize that
their profession is relatively risky because of their use of machinery and
the management of livestock. Hence, managers and employees often
use a variety of safety measures when using machinery and during
animal husbandry activities. In the case of machinery, shields and
guards protect operators from moving parts, and operators often adopt
safety practices such as turning off engines and setting parking brakes
before dismounting. In the case of livestock husbandry, operators often
use livestock restraining devices while administering animal health
products. Other ﬁrms avoid risk by deciding against investing in various
opportunities. Firms also institute a variety of safety policies to protect
employees from injury and plan for management successors in the event
of illness or death.




                                                                                 MANUAL 5   9
In terms of ﬁnancial risks, agricultural producers and other ﬁrms often refrain from increasing debt
commitments, purchasing untested technology, investing in high-risk investments, and aligning themselves with
single-source input suppliers and output purchasers. In addition, producers often experiment with new seeds
and chemicals before completely adopting either.

Although avoiding risks seems to be a reasonable approach to risk management, these strategies are not
likely to maximize expected proﬁts. That is, higher-risk enterprises are associated with the potential for higher
returns on average. Consequently, the process of avoiding risk also produces lower average returns. Producers
continually evaluate these risk/return trade-offs.

2.2.2. Risk Absorption. For some risks, agricultural producers and other business managers simply decide
to absorb or accept the potential for adverse outcomes. However, business ﬁrms often employ a variety
of strategies to self-insure against losses. For example, producers may engage in enterprise or regional
diversiﬁcation.

In terms of ﬁnancial risk management, producers often retain excess cash reserves, debt-carrying capacities,
and equity to obviate production and price risk. In many cases, producers augment farm income with off-farm
income sources that diversify their income stream. Leasing or sharing of land, equipment, and livestock provides
additional risk-management opportunities.

2.2.3. Risk Transfer. In addition to avoiding or absorbing risk, agricultural producers (and other businesses)
often employ formal risk-transfer strategies as a means for managing risk. Formal risk-transfer mechanisms
are not costless, however, as those who accept risk from others must be compensated. In terms of input and
output prices, common mechanisms include forward contracting, futures contracts, and commodity options.
Risk associated with life, health, and property is often transferred using formal insurance markets. Insurance
products that transfer agricultural yield or revenue risks are widely available in developed economies.

Some risks are common across broad ﬁnancial spectrums. For example, the recent global economic recession
affected most economic sectors around the world. These types of risks are often referred to as “market” or
“aggregate” risks. Aggregate risks are not diversiﬁable because they affect broad economic sectors. These
risks are also commonly referred to as “systemic” or “systematic risk,” but are probably best thought of as
“nondiversiﬁable” risks.

Conversely, many risks are unique to a speciﬁc sector or region. Furthermore, even if risks are not unique—but
simply uncorrelated with those occurring in other sectors or regions—then such risks are termed “unsystematic”
or “diversiﬁable.” Diversiﬁable risks are those that can be reduced by combining them in a portfolio, which
provides the basis for value creation by ﬁnancial, credit, and insurance companies. Developing portfolios that
contain risks with low correlations among them is the basis of all insurance activity.

2.3.          Agricultural Insurance
Agricultural insurance transfers insurable risk from a producer (the insured) to another party (the insurer) by
means of a formal contract (an insurance policy). Insurance premiums are paid by the insured to an insurer to
compensate the latter for the acceptance of risk and for other business costs.

Insurance policies are pooled to obtain diversiﬁcation beneﬁts and reduce average risk levels. Pooling often
needs to occur across industries, regions, and time.

2.3.1.     Insurable Agricultural Risks. Ideally, insurable risks are those that meet speciﬁc criteria:
     1.   The probability of an adverse event is calculable. A long time series of high-quality data is frequently
          needed to calculate probabilities;
     2. The cause-and-effect relationships between risk and loss occurrence are identiﬁable;
     3. The risk and size of an adverse event are beyond the control of the insured and the insurer;
     4. The risk of an adverse event for one insured producer should not be perfectly correlated with the risk for
        others.

If any of these criteria are violated, additional strategies must be developed to account for these deﬁ ciencies.
These criteria are seldom met, and insurance programs must account for these “imperfections.”


10         RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
2.3.2. Noninsurable Agricultural Risks. Often, one or more of the above criteria are not met by agricultural
insurance situations. Such situations are then only insurable through reinsurance mechanisms with private
companies or governments.

2.3.2.1. Risks are not Calculable. A lack of high quality data is the primary cause of some agricultural
risks being uncalculable. Lengthy time series of high-quality yield and price data provide the best means for
calculating future risk. Data are often unavailable for individual producers, especially in developing economies.
Consequently, insurance rating must often resort to using parametric rather than empirical approaches. These
approaches usually result in higher premium rates because of commensurately higher loading factors.

2.3.2.2. Relationship between Losses and Cause of Loss. Much of the process of underwriting involves
identifying cause-and-effect relationships between an insured loss and a noninsured loss. For example, yields
that fail to meet expectations could be caused by an insured peril such as hail or by an uninsured peril such as
the use of poor-quality seed. Observationally, however, the results of these two events are equivalent and the
monitoring costs of avoiding this problem are often quite large for agricultural insurance products.

2.3.2.3. Moral Hazard. Moral hazard refers to situations in which an insured can behave in a manner that
inﬂuences the likelihood or size of an indemnity payment (i.e., a loss). The complexity, speciﬁcity, and high
monitoring costs of production agriculture create considerable opportunity for moral hazard activity.

2.3.2.4. Nonindependent, Systemic Risk. The nature of agricultural risk often causes risks to be correlated
across counterparties. That is, an adverse weather event often inﬂuences an entire region rather than a single
producer. Such risks require pooling or diversiﬁcation across regions and, often, across industries. If primary
ﬁnancial institutions retain risk, their capital reserve levels must be higher relative to less-correlated risks.




                                                                                               MANUAL 5             11
3.0. Risk Transfer and Reinsurance
Agricultural production and revenue risks are somewhat diversiﬁable
across production sectors and regions. However, monitoring costs
increase rapidly across both dimensions. In addition, crop yields within
and across regions are often highly correlated. For example, widespread
weather events (e.g., drought) usually affect many crops and production
regions. The same can be true for crop diseases and pests. Additionally,
agricultural commodity prices are often highly correlated with each other.
However, some risks are uncorrelated with other regional and world
economic sectors. Hence, primary agricultural insurers often cede risk
to reinsurers who compile diversiﬁed risk portfolios. In addition, primary
insurers often do not possess enough capital to provide indemnity
payments if widespread yield losses do occur.

3.1.       Reinsurance
Reinsurance refers to the transfer of risk from a primary insurer (i.e.,
an issuing agency) to another insurance company (reinsurer) or a
government. This process allows insurers to develop risk portfolios that
help manage overall risk. Individual issuing agencies often do not have
the capacity to develop their own risk portfolios because they specialize
in crop insurance. These specialized companies are often located in
regions where their speciﬁc knowledge helps reduce transaction and
monitoring costs but also results in limited opportunities for risk-portfolio
diversiﬁcation.

Primary insurers often transfer agricultural insurance portfolios to
(usually) large reinsurers, which use these risks to diversify their own risk
portfolios. These companies develop risk portfolios across sectors and
countries while maintaining sufficient capital adequacy levels. Reinsurers
charge fees to primary insurers for accepting and transferring risk.

Reinsurers are usually large, international companies that are well
diversiﬁed across regions, countries, and economic sectors. Many
governments also provide reinsurance opportunities. In many cases,
governments provide stop-loss reinsurance services that support both
primary insurers and reinsurers.

Various arrangements among primary insurers, reinsurers, and
governments are used to share risk. For example, primary insurance
companies commonly retain the ﬁrst 5–10% of liability. In some cases,
governments accept some or all of the liability for speciﬁc agricultural
producers who would not normally be insurable by primary insurers.
In the United States, for example, this may represent 5–15% of liability.
Reinsurers accept (for a fee) 75–90% of the remaining indemnity
payments. However, governments often provide stop-loss activities
for liabilities that exceed 400% of premiums generated by agricultural
insurance sales in any given year. Stop-loss programs protect primary
insurers and reinsurers against widespread catastrophic losses.

3.2.       Reinsurance Mechanisms
Primary insurers sell insurance contracts to agricultural producers. In
exchange for insurance premiums (fees), the primary insurers agree to
offset yield losses that exceed a speciﬁc trigger level. Essentially, insurance
premiums represent the costs of transferring risk from a producer to the
primary insurer. Over the long run, actuarially sound premium rates will
cause the sum of indemnity payments plus transaction costs to equal

12      RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
collected premiums. However, while premium collections may be stable over time, annual indemnity payments
can vary greatly based on weather, disease, pests, and market events. As a result, primary insurers often transfer
at least some of their indemnity exposure to reinsurers.

Multiple mechanisms exist for transferring risk from primary insurers to one or more reinsurers. Each involves
differences in risk exposure and indemnity payment responsibility. In every case, primary insurers pay fees to
reinsurers for accepting ceded risk.

3.3.      Reinsurance Agreements
Reinsurance agreements provide the terms of risk transfer between insurance companies. Two general types of
reinsurance agreements exist depending on the manner in which risk transfer occurs from an organizational and
legal perspective: treaty and facultative cover.

3.3.1. Treaty. Treaty forms of reinsurance agreements obligate reinsurers to accept the entire liability stated
in the reinsurance agreement. That is, the terms and conditions for the contract are speciﬁed and agreed to
prior to the transfer of risks. These contracts are usually continuing agreements between a primary insurer and
a reinsurer. Either party can terminate the arrangement at speciﬁed points in time, but the exact nature and
quantity of risk transferred is subject to negotiation whenever a new set of risks are considered.

Treaty agreements have several advantages, including:
   • Increased volume of reinsurance operations;
   • Uniform distribution of risks among parties;
   • Lower transaction costs;
   • Longer-term relationships between parties;
   • Added ﬂexibility for reinsurers.
The main disadvantage of treaty agreements is that some risks may be outside the scope of the agreement or so
large that they require large capital reserves. Additional agreements are often necessary in these cases.




                                                                                              MANUAL 5           13
3.3.2. Facultative Cover. Facultative cover agreements are noncontinuing arrangements in which parties
negotiate risk transfer details whenever new liabilities are incurred. Facultative agreements have several
advantages, including:
     • Providing primary insurers with a larger set of reinsurance options, as they can negotiate with more than
       one reinsurer;
     • Allowing speciﬁc risks to be transferred to reinsurers with expertise in speciﬁc areas.
Disadvantages of facultative agreements include:
     • Higher transaction costs, as these agreements are usually complex and time consuming;
     • Increased operational costs because of additional monitoring and reporting activities;
     • Additional reinsurance submissions for multiple reinsurers;
     • Increased uncertainty regarding long-term business relationships.
3.4.        Forms of Reinsurance
Multiple forms of reinsurance exist, and each is deﬁned by the manner in which risks are distributed between
a primary insurer and a reinsurer (or reinsurers). In general, these approaches are classiﬁed as “proportional” or
“nonproportional” agreements, although combinations of the two also exist.
Proportional reinsurance agreements distribute risk between a primary insurer and a reinsurer in a proportional
arrangement. That proportion also determines each party’s share of premiums as well as liabilities.
Nonproportional reinsurance, in contrast, implies that indemnities are determined exclusively by loss amounts,
and no proportionality between premiums and indemnities exists.
3.4.1. Proportional Agreements. A variety of terms are often used interchangeably to describe proportional
reinsurance agreements, including Co-Pay, Quota Share, and Percentage Participation. Dollar One arrangements
are usually co-pay arrangements in which the reinsurer shares indemnity payments without incurring a deductible.
All of these arrangements are similar in the sense that a reinsurer (or reinsurers) contractually agrees to accept
a ﬁxed share of insurance liability for speciﬁc risks that are transferred from a primary insurer. Reinsurance
premiums paid by a primary insurer to a reinsurer are proportional to the share of liability in addition to other
loads and fees. The same proportion applies to indemnity payments. In general, these arrangements start with
the ﬁrst monetary indemnity outlay (i.e., Dollar One).
Figure 1 illustrates an example in which a primary insurer transfers 50% of accepted risk to a reinsurer while
retaining the remaining 50%. In addition, the primary insurer also transfers 50% of insurance premiums to the
reinsurer, while the reinsurer is responsible for 50% of indemnity payments regardless of the size of losses.

14       RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
3.4.2. Nonproportional Agreements. Nonproportional reinsurance arrangements include a variety of
options involving reinsurance deductibles. A deductible is often applied to a loss for which the primary insurer
is responsible. Losses that exceed the deductible are then the responsibility of a reinsurer. Governments are
frequently also responsible for indemnities through stop-loss or high-risk producer pools.

Nonproportional insurance agreements are generally used for two purposes. First, using deductibles
provides incentives for primary insurers to make appropriate business decisions in terms of insurance sales
and monitoring. Consequently, reinsurance loading fees are often smaller for nonproportional agreements.
Deductibles are often between 5% and 10% of total liability or approximately equal to the pure risk premium.
Second, private sector would likely not provide crop insurance products in cases where large, severe losses
could potentially occur. So, the nonproportionality of government stop-loss or high-risk pools are often used to
encourage insurance market development.

A variety of nonproportional reinsurance agreements exist, including:
  1.   Excess of Loss as a Cover per Risk, which provides protection for a portfolio against a particular risk;
  2. Excess of Loss as a Cover per Catastrophic event, which provides protection against large losses;
  3. Stop-Loss, which provides protection against losses accumulated over a certain period of time in which all
     losses above a speciﬁed level become the responsibility of a single party.
  4. Layers or tranches.

The majority of nonproportional reinsurance agreements are layered or tranche arrangements, in which liability
is deﬁned by individual tranches or as percentage amounts. Tranches are hierarchical arrangements in which
one entity is responsible for a speciﬁc amount of indemnity in a speciﬁc order. If losses exceed the amount
speciﬁed in the ﬁrst tranche, then a second entity is responsible for the next amount (tranche). In many cases, a
primary insurer contracts with a reinsurer who then sells further tranches to others. As a result, many levels or
tranches may exist for a single set of liabilities.

3.4.2.1. A Fixed Amount Tranche Example. Although nonproportional insurance programs often have unique
layering aspects, the process of allocating liability among layers is similar across products. The following example
illustrates common themes among these programs.

Table 1 presents a reinsurance program for a 700 million UAH liability portfolio that includes four participants
– a primary insurer, a ﬁrst reinsurer, a second reinsurer, and a government. In this example, the primary insurer
retains the ﬁrst 50 million UAH of liability, the ﬁrst reinsurer is assigned the next 150 million UAH (the amount
between 50 and 200 million UAH), and the second reinsurer accepts 100 million UAH (the amount between 200
and 300 million UAH). The government entity then provides a stop loss for liabilities that exceed 300 million UAH.

                    B              50                 50
                    C              125                50              75

If indemnities are less than or equal to 50 million UAH (i.e., Scenarios A and B in Table 1), the primary insurer
provides the entire amount of indemnity payments. Scenario C presents outcomes for a case in which 125 million
UAH of indemnities has been generated. In this case, the primary insurer is responsible for 50 million UAH and
the ﬁrst reinsurer pays the remaining 75 million UAH. In scenario D (indemnities totaling 250 million UAH), the
primary insurer provides 50 million UAH of indemnity payments, the ﬁrst reinsurer provides 150 million UAH, and
the second reinsurer provides 50 million UAH.

3.4.2.2. A Percentage Tranche Example. Layered reinsurance may be deﬁned either as ﬁxed tranches (as
presented in Table 1) or in terms of percent of loss, as illustrated in Figure 2. Percent of loss is calculated by
dividing indemnities by total liability. In this case, a primary insurer is responsible for indemnities up to the ﬁrst
10% of loss (a 10% deductible). After this point, the reinsurer is responsible for the Percent of Loss.

3.4.3. Combinations of Proportional and Nonproportional Reinsurance. Reinsurance programs can also
include elements of proportional and nonproportional liability assignments. Figure 3 illustrates a case in which
8.5% of liability is assigned to the primary insurer as a deductible. However, liabilities that exceed this deductible
level are shared proportionally between the primary insurer and the reinsurer. Speciﬁcally, the primary insurer
retains 15% of indemnity payments for liabilities exceeding 8.5% of the total, and the reinsurer accepts the
remaining 85%.

3.5.      Ukrainian Example
Substantial differences exist in terms of sources of indemnity payments depending on the structure of
reinsurance agreements. Consider the following Ukrainian example, for which annual yield data are obtained
from 1987 through 2012 and trigger yields are set at 70% of the average yield. Figure 4 presents the yield data and
trigger yield for each year. Indemnity responsibilities are determined by a proportional 50% co-pay arrangement
between a primary insurer and a reinsurer. In each year for which an indemnity is triggered, the two entities
share payment of indemnity amounts equally. Over the entire period, both the primary insurer and reinsurer
payments average 4% of total liability per year.

makes it responsible for the remaining 90% of liability. Over the entire period, the primary insurer’s indemnity
payments average 2% of total liability per year, while the reinsurer’s indemnity payments average 6% per year.

Figure 6 presents a third scenario. In this case, a tranche/co-pay arrangement makes the primary insurer
responsible for the ﬁrst 8.5% of liability, which represents a deductible. Beyond this amount, the primary insurer
is proportionally responsible for 15% of the remaining liability and the reinsurer pays the remaining 85%. Over the
entire period, the primary insurer’s indemnity payments average 1% of total liability per year, while the reinsurer’s
indemnity payments average 7% per year.

In summary, the primary insurer has larger indemnity responsibilities under co-pay arrangements in years of
large losses.

3.6.       Reinsurance Costs
The costs of obtaining reinsurance depend on pure risk premium rates as well as many other factors, including
the number and depth of tranches, monitoring costs, and liability amounts. In addition, loads charged by
reinsurers account for other elements such as servicing costs, program design, program integrity, underwriting
issues, political, judicial and legal risks, personnel competency, reputation of involved parties, and the costs of
capital. High loads are applied to countries without stable, equitable, and well-developed judicial systems. In
addition, many of these situations are also coincident with poorly constructed contractual law and property
rights. Reinsurance rating is discussed in the Actuarial Manual.

3.7.       Document Package for Reinsurance
Primary insurers develop reinsurance submissions are as business proposals for consideration by reinsurers.
Reinsurers use these submissions to evaluate their willingness to offer reinsurance and to determine appropriate
risk transfers, costs, and loads. Some reinsurance companies have standardized forms for reinsurance
submissions. Others simply provide a general outline. In all cases, reinsurers require similar information to make
sound business judgments.
Reinsurance brokers are sometimes employed to facilitate a reinsurance submission. For example, the two
largest reinsurance brokers—Aon Re Global and Guy Carpenter—collectively broker 60% to 70% of reinsurance
contracts. Although reinsurance submissions often contain publically available data, each reinsurer uses
proprietary methods for calculating reinsurance rates.

Reinsurance submissions generally comprise the following sections:
     • Executive summary;
     • Introduction;
     • Actuarial documentation;
     • Product administration;
     • Underwriting;
     • Loss adjustment.
18       RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
3.7.1.    Executive Summary. The executive summary provides information regarding
   1.    Value of the insurance product;
   2. Competitive forces;
   3. Speciﬁc form of the insurance product;
   4. Description of key underwriting provisions.

Eventually, the rating portion of a reinsurance submission is submitted to a reinsurer’s actuary experts, who
evaluate the adequacy of suggested rates.

3.7.2.    Introduction. The introductory section provides the background for the insurance product, including:
   1.    Relevance of the insurance plan;
   2. Product need;
   3. Product development strategies;
   4. Field product design;
   5. Examples of protection offered;
   6. Insurance related parties and overall business model;
   7.    Background and market overview;
   8. Situation and outlook for the crop being insured;
   9. Pilot target market;
   10. Forecast of premiums, liability, and market penetration as product is introduced and matures.

3.7.3. Actuarial Documentation. Actuarial documentation represents a highly detailed discussion of
premium-rating procedures. The documentation must include:
   1.    Description and discussion of the data used to establish rates;
   2. Description of the rating method;
   3. Discussion of assumptions used in rate formulation;
   4. Rating example;
   5. Risk related rates and premiums;
   6. Simulated book-of-business based on simulated loss history;
   7.    Estimated probability distribution of aggregate indemnity payment and reinsurance payment at the 50th,
         20th, 5th and 1st percentile.
The primary insurance company must describe the data and procedures used to develop primary insurance
rates. Providing an assessment of expected median indemnity payments in addition to expected average
payments is also useful. Reinsurance companies use this information to evaluate the capital reserves needed for
insurance products.
3.7.4. Product Administration. This section describes various record-keeping strategies, accounting
processes, and operational administration for each product. The timing and processing of sales, marketing,
education, data collection, and indemnity payments must be clearly presented.
3.7.5. Underwriting. Underwriting procedures are critical for successful reinsurance submissions. The
technical details regarding policy provisions and farm-management practices must be clearly delineated. All
schedules, events, and deadlines must be written to avoid ambiguity. In addition, detailed legal and policy issues
must be developed.
3.7.6. Loss Adjustment. Reinsurance submissions must clearly explain loss-adjustment processes. All
standards and protocols surrounding loss-adjustment procedures must be presented. The practical aspects
of who, where, and how loss adjustment is to be undertaken is an important element of this section. Loss-
adjustment data requirements, documentation, and compliance activities must be deﬁned.
A major aspect of loss adjustment that directly affects reinsurance submissions involves a clear explanation of
quality control with respect to loss adjusters. Loss adjusting may be undertaken by contractual arrangements or
with salaried employees. Procedures must provide clear delineation between crop-insurance sales agents and
loss adjusters because blurring these activities can be a source of insurance fraud.

                                                                                               MANUAL 5          19
3.8.       Requirements for Data, Reporting, and Accounting
Reinsurance agreements require various data reporting and auditing procedures to be speciﬁed. These
requirements ensure that reinsurance premiums are paid accurately and clarify reinsurance indemnity
obligations. Total liabilities must be deﬁned in reinsurance agreements.

Reporting schedules must be delineated for several activities, including:
     • Expected total liability prior to reinsurance attachment;
     • Total liability incurred immediately after sales closing dates;
     • Forecasts of indemnity payments prior to due dates;
     • Crop and growing-condition reports and indemnity forecasts throughout the growing season;
     • Final indemnity reports due shortly after growing season and reinsurance payment notiﬁcation.
Accounting requirements must allow reinsurers to audit transactions to verify liability and indemnity payments.

3.9.       Participation
The level of producer participation in any given crop-insurance product is a major concern for reinsurers.
Reinsurers desire a sufficient volume of participation to spread transaction costs. Minimum target product size
is approximately $200 million of total liability. For pilot projects, the target liability is often between $5 million
and $20 million.

Producer participation in any crop insurance product is inﬂuenced by:
     • Risk-management needs;
     • Producer awareness and education;
     • Producer expectations of indemnity payments relative to insurance-premium costs;
     • Producer levels of risk aversion;
     • Relationship of crop-insurance products to credit availability, legal requirements, and cross compliance
       with other government programs;
     • Producer conﬁdence in program integrity.

20       RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
Reinsurers are also concerned about “adverse selection,” which occurs when high-risk producers in an area
realize that an insurance premium has been misrated for their particular situation. That is, some producers face
rates that are too high for their operations, while others face rates that are too low. In addition, producers are
likely to have more knowledge of their own production risks than insurers. Higher-risk farmers may therefore
exploit this knowledge and disproportionally enroll in underrated insurance products. This situation can result
in participation erosion if low-risk producers decide not to participate and high-risk producers decide to
disproportionally purchase a product.

Assume that a crop-insurance premium is initially based on expected losses across all farmers and that one-
half of the highest-risk producers purchase the product. Indemnity payments will be higher than expected,
and premium rates will eventually be adjusted upward to match this outcome. Higher rates will discourage
more low-risk producers from participating because their premiums are now higher than their expected
losses. Consequently, these producers will reduce their participation. If the process continues, fewer and fewer
producers will purchase the insurance product.

Various actions can be taken to mitigate participation erosion, including:
   • Risk pooling, which separates producers with similarly high- or low-risks into separate pools that allow
      for appropriate rating based on risk exposure;
   • Subsidizing premiums so that an insurance product is desirable to both high- and low-risk producers;
   • Providing products that are attractive to those with high levels of risk aversion;
   • Requiring participation in exchange for receiving other types of government support;
   • Developing proxy or area insurance products so that all farmers have equal likelihood of receiving
      indemnities which reduces adverse selection;
   • Engendering producer conﬁdence in product and program design.
Finally, reinsurance companies are also attracted to insurance products that are standardized across areas and
countries. These products allow for common program administration, loss adjustment, and accounting.

4.0.       Risk Absorption and Capital
           Adequacy
The safety and soundness of ﬁnancial institutions has become a leading
issue because of the recent global ﬁnancial crisis. Historically, ﬁnancial
crises have occurred approximately every twenty years. The worst
ﬁnancial crisis in the last seventy-ﬁve years occurred in 2008–2009.
Financial crises have a variety of causes and are manifest in various ways.
The impact on individuals ranges from minimal to severe depending on
whether or not economic recessions result in high unemployment, loss of
equity, or reductions in standards of living. Avoiding future ﬁnancial crises
has become a national and international priority, and ﬁnancial institutions
also have vested interests in avoiding ﬁnancial crises.

The trade-off between risks and rewards generates difficult decisions
about whether to take conservative versus aggressive ﬁnancial
management strategies. Firms must decide between sacriﬁcing long-term
economic growth versus ﬁnancial risks. Efforts to minimize the impact
of ﬁnancial risks (i.e., the elimination of all risk) are unacceptable because
these strategies diminish the potential for long-term growth.

4.1.       Financial Institution Regulation
The ﬁnancial sector is highly concentrated in most countries. For example,
in the United States, about 80% of all bank assets are owned by the
seven largest banks. Bank-related problems are usually contagious
due to ﬁnancially connected counterparty relationships. As a result,
ﬁnancial difficulties in a single, large banking institution can affect other
ﬁnancial institutions. In addition, many factors affect lending institutions
similarly. For example, increased unemployment or reductions in home
prices are likely to generate home mortgage defaults across all lenders.
Consequently, many governments regulate ﬁnancial institutions, including
banks, insurance, securities, thrift/credit unions, and futures markets.
Some countries also regulate secondary ﬁnancial markets and associated
service industries, such as accounting and auditing ﬁrms.

The goals of regulation (GAO-09-216 “Financial Regulation”) are to:

1. Ensure adequate consumer protections. The proﬁt maximizing
goals of ﬁnancial institutions often encourage the sale of unsuitable or
fraudulent ﬁnancial products and participation in unfair or deceptive acts
or practices. Government regulators attempt to address informational
disadvantages that consumers and investors may face by reporting
information about products and services and monitoring business conduct
and sales practices.

2. Ensure integrity and the fairness of markets. Because some
market participants may manipulate highly concentrated markets
to obtain unfair gains in ways that are not easily detectable by other
participants, regulators often establish rules and monitor market
behavior. Their actions help prevent fraud and market manipulation, limit
asset-pricing problems, and encourage efficient market activity.

3. Monitor the ﬁnancial safety and soundness of institutions.
Market opportunities can sometimes lead ﬁnancial institutions to
acquire excessive risks, which can have signiﬁcant negative impacts on
consumers, investors, and taxpayers. Regulators oversee risk-taking
activities that promote the safety and soundness of ﬁnancial institutions.


22      RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
4. Ensure the stability of the overall ﬁnancial system. Because shocks to a single ﬁnancial sector or
institution can destabilize entire ﬁnancial systems, regulators attempt to reduce systemic risk in various ways.
For example, governments often provide funding (liquidity) to troubled ﬁnancial institutions to avoid ﬁnancial
system contagion.

Most ﬁnancial regulation has historically focused on banking institutions, but regulation has recently spread to
other ﬁnancial entities. Although the focus of this manual is on insurance entities, understanding of banking
regulations provides key insights into the regulation of insurance providers. Insurance regulation is neither as
standardized nor as widespread as banking regulation, but the evolution of insurance regulation is guided by
banking regulation. Given the inherent linkages between credit and insurance (see the Credit and Insurance
Manual), understanding banking regulation is instructive when considering insurance regulation. Insurance
practitioners should have an intuitive understanding of banking regulation procedures. The following overview
of Basel Agreement banking regulation is intended to provide an introduction to capital-adequacy principles.

4.2.       Basel Agreements
Although banks and other ﬁnancial institutions have been regulated to varying degrees for centuries, the
modern era of bank regulation was initiated with the Basel Agreements, which originated in 1988 with the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision. The original Basel Agreements have been reﬁned and modiﬁed. Although
some nations have not fully adopted Basel principles, the Basel Agreements have become the guideline for
worldwide bank regulation.

Basel I and Basel II provide the current guiding requirements. Basel III is scheduled for full implementation in
2019. Current Basel requirements are structured around three pillars:

                                        Pillar 1: The measurement of credit, market, and operational risk;

                                        Pillar 2: Capital adequacy;

                                        Pillar 3: Market discipline through enhanced public disclosure or
                                        transparency.

                                        Pillars I and II are referred to as the safety and soundness requirements.
                                        These requirements are designed to protect “ﬁxed amount creditors”
                                        from the failure and insolvency of a ﬁnancial institution and resulting
                                        ﬁnancial system instability. Fixed amount creditors include bank
                                        depositors and potential insurance beneﬁciaries. The term “ﬁxed amount”
                                        indicates that creditor payouts are not dependent on market outcomes.
                                        Consequently, the primary regulatory mechanism involves capital
                                        adequacy.

                                        4.2.1. Capital Adequacy. Capital adequacy refers to ﬁnancial
                                        institutions maintaining speciﬁc levels of equity capital as a buffer against
                                        adverse outcomes. This buffer allows these institutions to meet the
                                        obligations of ﬁxed amount creditors. The required minimum amount of
                                        capital depends on the quantity and type of assets held by the institution
                                        and is calculated as:

                                                    Required Capital = 8% x Risk Weight x Asset Value

                                        The 8% of risk-weighted asset values is a regulatory requirement.
                                        Risk weights vary by asset type, as shown in Table 2. Asset values are
                                        obtained from an institution’s balance sheet. Off-balance-sheet items
                                        are also included in the Basel analysis. Table 2 also presents the capital
                                        required per dollar of asset value calculated as 8% of the risk weight.

                                        Total required capital is the sum of required capital across all balance
                                        sheet assets, including off-balance items. Some claims on assets often
                                        receive special consideration, but such considerations are not consistent
                                        across countries. Agricultural real-estate loans exhibit similar risk to
                                        residential housing loans and so are often treated accordingly.

                                                                                                 MANUAL 5            23
The Basel regulations not only address the quantity of required capital but also its quality. The regulations place
particular emphasis on Tier 1 capital, common stock equity, and retained earnings. The regulations restrict the
amount of Tier 2 capital that can be used to meet capital requirements. Tier 2 capital is considered to be of lower
quality and includes most preferred stock and other capital that is not easily available for absorbing risk.

                                          Note: The weights are usually minimum values.



The Basel approach to risk-weighted capital requirements is commonly used by banks but is less commonly used
by insurance companies. For banks, loans are assets and deposits are liabilities. For insurance ﬁrms, the cash
generated by insurance premiums is an asset and potential indemnity payments are potential liabilities. The
value of loans is more deterministic than the potential for indemnity payments. Furthermore, the frequency of
crop insurance indemnity payments is usually much higher than the probability of loan defaults.

Basel III was scheduled to be implemented in 2013 but has been partially delayed until 2019. It places more
emphasis on liquidity, capital quality, counterparty risk, cycle-based buffers, and a variety of other detailed
issues. Additional modiﬁcations to Basel III requirements will probably occur prior to its full implementation.

Basel I and II have been widely criticized as being unduly burdensome (particularly on small banks) and blamed
for increasing bank concentration. Some argue that increased concentration has caused a less stable ﬁnancial
system. From a ﬁnancial perspective, a major shortcoming of Basel I and II is that they provide little consideration
of diversiﬁcation and correlated risks. In the United States, some of the Basel III requirements conﬂict with
recently passed Dodd-Frank legislation. Similar internal regulatory conﬂicts are likely to occur in other countries
as well.

4.2.2. Value-at-Risk. The Basel Agreements recognize Internal Risk-Based modeling approaches to a limited
extent. Internal Risk-Based approaches, in general, encompass Value-at-Risk (VaR) methods. These approaches
involve estimating asset values that could be lost in extreme or low-probability situations. The question posed
is: What is the loss in value that can only be exceeded by a predetermined probability?




24      RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
For example, assume that a portfolio has a value of $1 million and at the end of a predetermined period there is
a 0.2% probability that the portfolio will have a value of $600,000 or less. The VaR0.2% would be $400,000 in
this case.

The terms “economic capital” and “capital-at-risk” are often synonymous with VaR. Furthermore, the notation
VaR% may use the % value as either the probability that a loss is equal to or greater than the stated percentage
(e.g., 0.2%) or it may denote the loss equal to or less than 1 minus that percentage (e.g., 99.8%). The high or low
value of the % value, which is referred to as the conﬁdence level, CL, usually affords an obvious interpretation.

Figure 7 illustrates the VaR concept in a banking or insurance context. The expected loss, E[L], or the expected
indemnity, E[I], is the amount imbedded in the interest rate for the risk of receiving less than a total loan
payment or the pure risk insurance premium. The VaR is the minimum amount of capital required to off set
unusually high loan losses or indemnity payments (deﬁned as loan losses or indemnities exceeding expectations).
UL and UI are unexpected losses or unexpected indemnities and are equal to the standard deviation of losses
or indemnities. The variance of losses is denoted as V[L] and the variance of indemnities is denoted as V[I]. The
standard deviations in both cases are the square roots of each. The use of the term “unexpected” is a misnomer
because it is easily misinterpreted as a measure similar to VaR. The loss or indemnity curve is recognized as the
probability density function of losses or indemnities. Required capital is directly related to a CL. The total area
under the curve presented in ﬁgure 7 sums to 1, and the area under the curve to the left of the required capital
level is the CL (i.e., 99.8%).

                                                     VaR                        a % of Exposure

                                      Figure 7. Portfolio Loss or Indemnity Distribution



The VaR approach uses statistical analyses speciﬁcally applicable to the portfolio of a ﬁnancial institution. VaR is
used to determine the level of required capital that is sufficient with conﬁdence level CL to be institutionally safe
and sound. When considering banking institutions, VaR focuses on loan portfolios, but in the case of insurance
companies VaR is speciﬁc to insurance contract portfolios. The required capital is the sum of E[L] and VaR or the
sum of E[I] and VaR.

The use of VaR in banking and insurance is similar from interpretive, analytic, and computational perspectives.
The following discussion will move between banking/credit and insurance terminology. The terms probability
of default (PD) in banking will be used interchangeably with frequency (Freq) in insurance as will loss-given-
default (LGD) with severity (Sev), loss (L) with indemnity payment (I), and expected loss (E[L]) with expected
indemnity(E[I]). Exposure refers to total liability or total loan volume. These terms are further discussed in
the “Actuarial Methods” and “Credit and Insurance” manuals. Losses and indemnities are often expressed as a
percentage of exposure, as presented in Figure 7.

In general, two approaches are used to calculate VaR for a given time horizon and probability: parametric
procedures and empirical Monte Carlo simulations. The time horizon is the period for which the analysis is
conducted. For example, the time horizon may be one year, which means that, say, $400,000 is adequate capital
at a conﬁdence level of 99.8%. Probability is often referred to as a conﬁdence level particularly if it is speciﬁed

                                                                                                         MANUAL 5     25
as losses or indemnities. The time horizon is a matter of convenience or determined by speciﬁc situations. For
securities, the time horizon may be as short as a day. For banking situations, it is usually a year. In the case of
crop insurance, the time horizon generally reﬂects a crop season.

4.2.3. Parametric Value-at-Risk Approach. The following parametric VaR approach generally follows
that described in Bluhm, Overbeck, and Wagner (Introduction to Credit and Risk Modeling, Second ed.,
Chapman & Hall, CRC Press, 2010). Bluhm, Overbeck, and Wagner (BOW) contain substantially more detail at a
mathematically sophisticated level. Nonetheless, a variety of parametric approaches can be used. The following
is an example of one of these approaches.

The steps in the parametric approach are:
  1.   Compute the individual loan or insurance contract statistics, E[L] or E[I] and UL or UI;
  2. Convert the above statistics to a portfolio level while recognizing correlations between loan losses or
     indemnity payments;
  3. Convert portfolio statistics into a probability density function;
  4. Calculate VaR and required capital.

4.2.3.1. Individual Statistics. During the actuarial rating process, E[L] or E[I] must be calculated. Recall that

                                                E[L]=(PD)(LGD) and
                                                  E[I]=(Freq)(Sev)
Developing UL and UI is more complicated. The following discussion will focus on UL, but these processes are
also relevant for calculating UI in insurance situations. Let LD be a Bernoulli variable where LD = 1 when a loan
defaults and LD=0 when a full loan payment is made. Therefore, E[LD]=PD. The variance of L (loan loss) is

                                                  V [L]=V [(LGD)(LD)].

                                            Recall that V[x]=E[x2]-E[x]2, so

Two special cases are discussed. If LGD and LD are independent, then

                                           V[L]=E[LGD2]E[LD2]-E[LGD]2E[LD]2.

                            However, because LD is Bernoulli LD2=LD and E[LD]=PD, then

                                             V[L]=E[LGD2]PD-E[LGD]2PD2.

                                 V[LGD]=E[LGD2]-E[LGD]2 so E[LGD2]=V[LGD]+E[LGD]2,

                                                                                     ,
where frequency and severity are assumed to be independent.

The assumption of independence is questionable. To illustrate, let y represent yield and t represent the insurance
yield trigger. Then, for the normal distribution,




                                                                                             ,

where g and G are the normal pdf and cdf. Figure 8 illustrates the tradeoff between frequency and severity for an
insurance example in which E[y] = 1 and V [y] = 0.282 with various triggers ranging from 0.50 to 0.85. Obviously,
the frequency and severity are positively correlated in this case, which violates the independence assumption.

Alternatively, consider a distribution for which frequency and severity are unrelated (e.g., the Laplace). The

Severity is a constant (b) which indicates that it is independent of frequency. Therefore, if y is distributed as a
Laplace, then



holds, since frequency and severity are independent and the square root of V [L] is UL.

Given that I is the indemnity payment (i.e., I = t - y) and f [y] and F [y] are the pdf and cdf, the variance of I is

The value of the integral containing y2 is dependent on the distribution of y.

4.2.3.2. Portfolio Statistics. The next step involves calculating statistics related to a portfolio. Let each individual
loan or counterparty be denoted as i with m loans and a loss associated with loan i as Li. The portfolio loss is




                                          and the expected portfolio loss is

                                                                         .

The general formula for the variance of the portfolio loss is


                                                                                              ,

where Cov is the covariance operator and          is the loss correlation. In some situations, it is useful to rewrite V [LP]
as


                                                                                      .

If LGD is deterministic, then


                                                                                          .

The variance of the Bernoulli variable, LD, is V[LD] = E[(LD-PD)2] = PD(1-PD)2+(1-PD)(-PD)2 = PD(1-PD), so that


                                                                                                      .

It is not uncommon for the above formula to be used to calculate V [LP]. However, a more general formula
is preferred and usually more accurate. If the loans or counterparties are homogeneous in PD and LGD and
                                    , then




                                                 or in the more general case

                                                                                                              .

                                   The insurance analog for the above equation is

                                                                                                              MANUAL 5     29
                                                                                             .

If the portfolio statistics are speciﬁed per dollar of exposure (i.e., where L or I has been rescaled by dividing by
individual exposure) and if the counterparties are homogeneous, then as the number of counterparties become
large                  , the above statistics for lending become




                                             and for insurance become


                                                                  .

The above statistics indicate that correlation plays a major role in the portfolio variance and is therefore a
primary element of the level of VaR. However, determining the correlation is challenging. The obvious approach
is to calculate the correlation of losses or indemnities from existing data. But even if such data are available,
they often have been collected in an inconsistent and/or unrepresentative manner. For example, if underwriting
standards on insurance policies or loans have changed, using indemnity payments or loan defaults may cause
inaccurate calculations of correlations. Furthermore, loan loss or indemnity payment data will contain many
zeros and only a few positive values. This causes the data to be particularly susceptible to sampling error.
However, if a large volume of consistent data is available, then calculating the correlation directly from loss or
indemnity payment data is the preferred approach.

An alternative to calculating loss or indemnity correlations is to use asset value correlations, which assumes that
indemnity payments are paid when asset values decline. For loans, the logical thought process is that the value
of assets decline as income declines and lower incomes lead to loan defaults. For crop insurance, the link
between the asset insured (e.g., crop yield) and “default” is more direct because low crop yields trigger indemnity
payments. The degree to which asset value correlations are aligned with loss or indemnity correlations varies
depending on the characteristics of the probability distribution and the degree to which loss/default is caused or
conjoined with low asset values. Consistent asset-value data are usually much more available than loss or
indemnity data. If a lending institution or insurance company is large and well diversiﬁed with respect to other
economic sectors, the correlation may be derived from publically available Beta coeffi cients.




30      RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
Individual expected values and variances are usually calculated from actual losses or indemnity payments,
while correlations are often calculated from underlying asset values. Correlation calculations require that both
variables have the same numbers of observations. An additional implicit assumption is that the variables have
some consistency between them. Whichever method or data is used to calculate individual expected values
and variances, the data must be representative of actual expected values or variances. For example, a loss
variance of one counterparty could be based on ﬁve years of data and the loss variance of another counterparty
could be based on eight years (which could differ from that of the ﬁrst counterparty) as long as the results
were deemed to be a sufficiently accurate representation of the actual variances. Because of the different time
periods considered, however, a correlation could not be calculated between the two sets of data. Asset value
correlations are widely used as proxies for loss or indemnity correlations because asset value data are much
more widely available and consistently gathered.

Proponents of asset correlations as a proxy for loss or indemnity correlations argue that loan defaults are
highly correlated with lower asset values. This is clearly the case for crop insurance because low asset values
(yields) trigger crop insurance indemnities. Furthermore, when indemnities or losses are associated with lower
asset values, then the loss or indemnity variable will be ranked consistently with asset values. Thus, the rank
correlation is the same between asset values and loss or indemnities. To the extent that rank correlation is
representative of the usual product moment correlation, asset values correlations are a reasonable estimate of
loss or indemnity correlations.

To illustrate the relationship between asset and indemnity correlations, consider a situation in which the asset
value outcome is either 0 or 2. If the outcome is 0, an indemnity of 1 is paid. If the outcome is 2, the indemnity
is not paid. Regardless of the correlation between the asset values of the two counterparties, the indemnity
correlation will be exactly the same as the asset value correlation. Conversely, if the asset values are normally
distributed, then the asset value correlations will not be the same as the indemnity correlations.

In the special case where severity equals 1 and is deterministic such that V[I]=Freq(1-Freq), it can be shown that

level. If Freq = 0.16, Sev = 0.21,    = 0.28, and CL = 0.999, then the economic capital is 0.129 and total required
capital is 0.163 (economic capital + EI where EI=Freq*Sev.)

Often, data are not in the form needed to develop desired correlations, but these correlations can sometimes be
developed using alternative approaches. For example, assume that correlations among individual farm yields are

                                                                                                    MANUAL 5          31
desired within a particular region for developing V [IP]. Furthermore, assume that historical regional yield data are
available along with either farm yield data or insurance rates for given coverage levels. Farm yields are assumed
to have identical expected yields and variances within a region. In this case, the average or expected yield can be
calculated from regional data. The variance of farm yields can be calculated directly from the farm data or from
insurance rates using an implied volatility approach. The correlation can be developed from the regional yield
variance and the farm yield variance.

Speciﬁcally, let county yield be c and farm yield be yi for farm i. The farm yields all have the same variance but are
not perfectly correlated. In each year, yi = c + di; the sum of all di is zero in every year and the di are uncorrelated
across counterparties. Let the farm yield standard deviation be sy and the regional yield standard deviation be sr.
The farm-to-regional yield correlation is given by:

                                                                                                  ,

where y and c have been reduced by their means before calculating the correlation. Consequently, the regional-
to-farm yield correlation is simply the ratio of the yield standard deviations. The across-farm yield correlations
can also be calculated as:




                                                                                              .




The between-farm correlation is simply the ratio of the regional and farm variance or the square of the regional
to farm correlation. These correlations only hold when there are a large number of farms (i.e., asymptotically).

4.2.3.3. Probability Density Functions. After calculating the portfolio statistics, the probability-density
function of portfolio losses or indemnities can be developed. The usual parametric practice is to choose a ﬂ exible
functional form—such as the Beta or Gamma distribution—for the density function. For example, the parameters
of the Beta function can be calculated with moment matching. If the Beta function is            , then

                                                                                  .




32      RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
Using          , the VaR can be calculated to determine capital adequacy levels.

To illustrate, consider the following example. Let E[y] =1, t = 0.70, V [y] = 0.282, and yields be normally distributed.
In this case, E[I] = 0.0203. Assuming identical farms and correlated yields, the E[I] per dollar of exposure is
2.03/70 = 0.029 and the variance of area yields is 0.202. Therefore, the between-farm correlation is

                                                                       .

E[I] is the portion of exposure equal to the rate—in this case,2.9%. The frequency is F [t]=0.142 and f [t]=0.803
which are both useful for calculating V [I]. Using an earlier equation based on the normal distribution, V [I] =
0.00462 which is rescaled as a proportion of exposure by dividing by the square of the trigger or 0.00462/(0.70)2
= 0.00943. The portfolio exposure is V[Ip]=0.00943*0.51=0.00481.

4.2.3.4. Conﬁdence Intervals. The parameter values for the               distribution are u = 0.141 and w = 4.717. If
a conﬁdence level of 0.998 is chosen, then the required capital is 52% of exposure from Table 3. The E[I] is 2.9%,
so VaR = 52% - 2.9% = 49.1%. There is no internal mode in this particular case, unlike in Figure 7.

4.2.4. Empirical Monte Carlo Approach. The Monte Carlo VaR approach is widely used by large banks and
is becoming more popular with insurance companies. The procedure can be illustrated using a crop insurance
example. These models often combine economy- or sector-wide data with individual data to develop empirical
probability distributions for insurance company indemnities. As with the parametric approach, the Monte Carlo
approach has both pros and cons. Individual counterparty data are often not available in sufficient quantity
or length to capture the extreme outcomes necessary to estimate required capital for the desired conﬁdence
level. Consequently, long-term area data are also used. For crop insurance situations, long-term data are more
likely available for regional yields rather than individual farm-yield data. However, shorter-term farm yields may
be available and can be used to estimate relationships between farm-level yield variations and regional-yield
variations. The correlation between farm yields can also be calculated using farm- and regional-level yields, as
discussed earlier.

                                                                                                   MANUAL 5           33
Although Monte Carlo approaches reduce demands for detailed historical data, the approach can be
complicated, difficult to comprehend, and time consuming to develop, maintain, review, and understand. Such
models are often viewed as “black boxes” with only the developer having a full understanding of the model.
Nonetheless, this approach may hold the most potential for accurately modeling ﬁnancial risk because it may
better capture idiosyncrasies of counterparty risk.

The following example is provided for illustration purposes only and is not intended to be a comprehensive
discussion of empirical VaR approaches. However, it presents an intuitive approach that should provide crop
insurance practioners with a working knowledge of empirical VaR modeling, which is often used to develop
rates in tranched reinsurance systems.

The major steps in the process include:
     1.   Generating simulated farm-yield vectors with the desired expected yields, yield standard deviations, and
          correlations.
     2. Calculating indemnities for each farm’s yield and aggregate those indemnities across farms to generate
        empirical indemnity loss probability distributions.
     3. Calculating capital adequacy if all risk is retained for a desired conﬁdence level.
     4. Calculating reinsurance premiums and capital adequacy.

Table 4 presents a simpliﬁed crop insurance example with a 70% coverage level. Assume a crop insurance
company operates in two regions (e.g., two counties in the United States or two oblasts in Ukraine), and each
region produces two crops. Four farms exist in region 1: two farms produce crop A and two produce crop B. In
region 2 there are seven farms: three farms produce crop A and four produce crop B. If a farm produces both
crops, then that farm is treated as two separate entities, each producing a single crop. This treatment presumes
that, for insurance purposes, the two crops are adjusted and indemnity payments are calculated separately for
each crop. Assume that these farms are large and all monetary values are in millions.

For simplicity, yields are assumed to be normally distributed, although other distributions could be used. All
farms within a region/crop combination are identically distributed (i.e., they have the same mean and standard
deviation) but are imperfectly correlated. The per unit price for each crop is 1. The farm yield standard deviation
could be calculated from crop insurance rates using implied volatility, directly from farm yield data, or as
adjustments from regional yield standard deviations (e.g., U.S. farm yield variance is often about twice county-
level yield variance). Regional data can be used to calculate expected yields, standard deviation of regional yields,
and the correlation between regional yields.

4.2.4.1. Generating Simulated Farm Data. Three steps are required to generate simulated farm yield data:
     1.   Generate between-farm correlations,
     2. Generate random samples
     3. Generate simulated farm yields.




34         RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
Each of the three steps is considered in detail below.

1. Generate between-farm correlations. Between-farm correlations can be calculated using regional yield
correlations. The farm correlation between regional/crop combinations, rij , is

                                                                        ,

where wij is the regional yield correlation between regional/crop combinations and rii is the yield correlation
between farms with same crop within a region. Recall that


                                                                   ,


where sir is the standard deviation of yields at the regional level and sif is the standard deviation at the farm level
with i the area/crop index. Therefore, when i=j, the correlation is calculated directly from standard deviations. To
calculate            the previously presented equation is used. For our example, assume that

                                                 1.0     0.3    0.2         0.1
                                                 0.3     1.0    0.05 0.15
                                             =
                                                 0.2     0.05 1.0           0.25
                                                 0.1     0.15   0.25        1.0

                                                         and so
                                             0.563     0.158    0.096 0.050
                                             0.158     0.490 0.023           0.070
                                         =
                                             0.096 0.023        0.413        0.107
                                             0.050 0.070 0.107               0.444


2. Generate random samples. The next step is to generate a random sample such that the number of variables is
equal to the number of farms plus the number of region/crop combinations. In this example, ﬁfteen independent
variables are generated and each is distributed as a standard normal. In most actual examples, the length of the
sample is usually between 2,000 and 10,000. For purposes of exposition, we will illustrate with a data set of
length 50.

Table 5 contains a random sample designated xik generated using Excel. The ﬁrst three variables are designated
x 10 through x 12, the next three are x 20 through x 22, the next four are x 30 through x 33 , and the last ﬁve are x 40
through x 44. The ﬁrst subscript designates the region/crop combination., and the second subscript designates the
farm if the subscript is greater than 0 and designates an “anchor” variable if the subscript is 0. Anchor variables
are used for computational convenience in the early portion of this step. Most spreadsheets (such as Excel), data
processing packages (such as R or SQL), and statistical packages (such as SAS) off er random-number generators.

3. Generate simulated farm yields. The ﬁnal step is to generate a data set of zik, that have the desired correlations but
remain distributed as a standard normal. Similar to a Cholesky decomposition, the z are generated from the x as

The values for are developed below. The variance of z and x is 1, which simpliﬁes the calculations. The squares
of must sum to 1 for each equation to maintain the variance of 1 for the z.




The process is continued for all of the region/crop combinations. A matrix of       presents this example’s four
region/crop combinations.




In the example, the     are calculated as

The zik are calculated using the xik and the      . The number of z variables is equal to the total number of farms
(eleven in this example). The zik are presented in Table 6.

The z variables are transformed to simulated yields using
                                                                    ,

where E[yi] is the expected yield for region/crop i and si is the standard deviation of yields for region/crop i. The y
values for the example are presented in Table 7. Yields y have the same expected yield and variance as in Table 4
as well as the desired correlations.

4.2.4.2. Calculating Simulated Indemnities. The next major step is to calculate simulated indemnities
for each of the eleven simulated farm yields. The indemnities are calculated as I = t – y, where t is the trigger
(calculated as expected yield multiplied by the 70% coverage level). If t - y is negative, then I = 0 because no
indemnities are paid when y > t. After indemnities are calculated, they are summed across “years” to calculate
annual total indemnities. Indemnities for the example are presented in Table 8. The annual indemnity will often
be divided by the total exposure or total liability to calculate the annual liability paid as a percent of exposure
(subsequently referred to as the percent liability or percent of exposure). In the example, total exposure is

                       (2) (20) (0.7) + (2) (35) (0.7) + (3)(40)(0.7) + (4)(50)(0.7) = 301 million

Therefore, 301 million would be divided into each year’s indemnity payment. Table 8 includes each year’s percent
liability and also the percent liability ranked according to size. The ranked percent liability makes it easier to
visualize the probability distribution of indemnities. A histogram is often useful. The percent liability in the
example is somewhat misleading because if the number of counterparties was increased to a more realistic
number, the number of cells containing zeros would decline. This is simply a pdf of indemnities as a percentage
of liability, which directly relates to Figure 7.

4.2.4.3. Calculating Capital Adequacy for Risk Retention. For demonstration purposes, the VaR plus E[I]
(or the required capital) at the 90% conﬁdence level equals 18.8% - 19% (Table 8). E[I] can be calculated either
by averaging the indemnities or from the pure risk insurance rates. In this example, E[I] = 5.3%, which results
in a VaR of 13.5% (18.8% - 5.3%). Consequently, required capital needed if all risk responsibility (i.e., indemnity
payments) is retained is 18.8% of the total liability or 56.9 million (0.188 * 301 million).

Some cautionary comments are appropriate. The example presented above is used to illustrate the Monte
Carlo process. In the example, no indemnity payments are made in several years. This would be unlikely in
situations where there are a large number of counterparties. The lack of indemnities in some years biases the
VaR calculation downward relative to an actual insurance situation. In addition, the number of years in this
illustration was limited to ﬁfty for ease of presentation. In practice, however, many more years of data must be
simulated. The conﬁdence level was set at 0.90 because of the limited number of years presented. In practice,
conﬁdence levels are often set at 0.992 or higher. Finally, the required capital calculations do not include
operations capital and other considerations.

4.2.4.4. Calculating Reinsurance Premiums and Capital Adequacy. Issuing insurance companies often
transfer part of their risk to reinsurance companies because they do not have adequate capital reserves. Issuing
companies pay reinsurers a premium to accept this risk. The structure of The transfer can be through a co-pay, a
tranche, or a combination of the two.

A co-pay arrangement occurs when liability and indemnity payments are split proportionally. Consider the
previous example, where the total liability was 301 million and the required capital was 56.9 million. If the
primary insurer has only 10 million of capital to dedicate to crop insurance, then the primary insurer only has
17.6% (10 million/56.9 million) of the required capital. Therefore, the primary insurer should retain(at most) 17.6%
of the risk (or 53 million of 301 million) and transfer the remainder (248 million) to another capable risk bearer,
usually a reinsurer, who would accept 82.4% of the risk. The premium paid to the reinsurer to absorb this risk
would be the pure risk rate of 5.3% plus a load multiplied by the reinsurer liability of 82.4% of 301: 248 million.
The pure risk rate is the mean indemnity (16.04 in Table 8) divided by total liability. Indemnities would then be
proportional to the risk incurred. In this case, the primary insurer would pay 17.6% of the indemnities and the
reinsurer would pay the remaining 82.4%.

In a tranche system, indemnity payment responsibility is hierarchical in that all indemnities are paid by one party
up to a speciﬁed amount. In many cases, the initial amount is paid by the primary insurer. Once the primary
insurer reaches a speciﬁc maximum, then a reinsurer is responsible for indemnities beyond that limit. Again,
assume that the primary insurer has 10 million in dedicated capital. The ﬁrst liability tranche is assumed by the
primary insurer up to 10 million. The remaining 291 million of liability (or the second tranche) is assumed by the
reinsurer. If indemnities total 8 million, then all of these will be paid by the primary insurer. If indemnities are
15 million, then the primary insurer pays the ﬁrst tranche of 10 million and the reinsurer pays the remaining 5
million. The total capital required is still 56.9 million, but the primary insurer would maintain only 10 million while
the reinsurer would be required to maintain 46.9 million.

In terms of capital adequacy, reinsurers are usually evaluated differently than primary insurers, primarily because
reinsurers are regulated similarly to publically traded corporations and are paid premiums to absorb this risk. In
Table 9, the indemnities for the primary insurer and the reinsurer are calculated for each of the ﬁfty simulated
years. The resulting E[I] as a proportion of total liability is 2.1% for the primary insurer (the ﬁrst tranche) and 3.2%
for the reinsurer (the second tranche). Table 9 shows that the reinsurer would make an indemnity payment in
twenty-three out of ﬁfty years. As more liability is retained by a primary insurer, the frequency and severity of
indemnity payments made by reinsurers declines, which reduces reinsurance costs and loads. However,
increasing the primary insurer’s liability requires increases in capital.

4.3.       Reinsurance Loads
In the example above, the pure risk premium equals 5.3% of the 301 million in total liabilities (Table 9). These
values are used with a primary insurer’s available equity capital to determine reinsurance costs. For example,
assume that three tranches are to be developed and each is loaded differently. The ﬁrst is the responsibility
of a primary insurer with 10 million in equity capital. To calculate loading factors, a premium multiple is ﬁrst
calculated by dividing the available equity by the product of the pure risk rate and total liability (i.e., 10 million/
[0.053 * 301 million]), which results in 0.623. Consequently, the available primary insurer capital is considered
adequate to cover indemnities up to 0.623 multiplied by the total premium collections in the ﬁrst tranche. Table
10 illustrates that the pure risk rate in the ﬁrst tranche equals 0.023.

Assume that the ﬁrst tranche of 0.623 premium multiple of liability is not retained by the primary insurer but
is ceded to a reinsurer. Reinsurers will usually assign a heavy load of, say, 50% to this ﬁrst tranche. Multiplying
the pure risk rate in the ﬁrst tranche by (1+0.50) yields a loaded rate of 0.035 (Table 11). The frequency of
indemnities in the ﬁrst tranche is obtained by dividing 39 by 50 (Table 10) to yield 0.78 (Table 11). The severity of
indemnities in the ﬁrst tranche is calculated by dividing the tranche pure risk rate by the frequency which yields
0.0301. This tranche is heavily loaded because the reinsurer will bear high transaction costs if it must accept the
risk associated with this frequency of indemnity payments. Only eleven farms are used in this example. If the
number of farms were much larger (and more realistic), then frequency would approach 100%.

Assume that two additional tranches are to be established. The second tranche is responsible for indemnities
that occur between 62.3% and 400% of risk premiums, while the third tranche pays indemnities that occur in
excess of four multiplied by risk premiums. This illustrates the case where one reinsurer may be responsible for
the second tranche, and a second reinsurer serves in a stop-loss capacity. Table 11 shows that the pure risk rate
for the second tranche is 0.0255. Such tranches often carry a lower load of, say, 20%. In this case, the loaded rate
is 0.0307 with a frequency of 0.26 and a severity of 0.098 (Table 11).

Table 10 indicates that the pure risk rate for the third tranche is small (0.0042) primarily because its frequency is
only 0.06 (Table 11). However, Table 11 also indicates that the severity in the third tranche is 0.07. Such tranches
are often heavily loaded (e.g., 80%) and result in a loaded rate for the third tranche of 0.0076 (Table 11). The
reason this last tranche is heavily loaded is illustrated in Figure 7. Distribution of indemnities has a long right-
hand tail. Hence, although the probability of indemnities exceeding 4 times the premiums is small, the potential
large but infrequent indemnities generate a risk that must be considered by reinsurers.

Table 12 also indicates that the total loaded rate is 0.0735 across the three tranches. The average loaded rate
for the three tranches is calculated by dividing the total loaded rate (0.0735) by the pure risk rate (0.053) and
subtracting one from the quotient (0.379). The average load for tranches 2 and 3 is calculated by summing the
loaded rates for each (0.0307 + 0.0076) and then dividing this by the sum of the pure risk rate for the two
tranches (0.0255 + 0.0042). Finally, one is subtracted from the quotient to yield an average load for tranche 2
and 3 of 0.284. The average loaded rate in tranche 2 and 3 is much smaller than the total loaded rate.

Table 11 provides the information needed to calculate the cost to a primary insurer of transferring risk to
reinsurers depending upon the form of reinsurance. For example, assume that a Dollar One co-pay is selected.
In this case, the primary insurer would retain 53 million in liability and transfer 248 million. The premium for
this transfer would be calculated by multiplying the total load rate (0.0735) by the liability being transferred
(248 million) which yields 18.235 million. This premium includes a load of 5.018 million, which is calculated by
multiplying the pure risk rate (0.053) by the liability being transferred (248 million) before subtracting from the
total premium of 18.235 million.

In a tranche situation, the primary insurer would retain 10 million in liability and transfer the remaining 291
million. The premium costs of this transaction are calculated by multiplying the sum of tranche two and three
loaded rates (0.0307 + 0.0076) by the total liability (301 million). In this case, the total premium is 11.53 million,
of which 2.85 million is the load. The premium for transferring 291 million is much lower for the tranche system
than transferring 248 million for a co-pay because the former includes a deductible while the latter does not.
In addition, the risk premiums are expected indemnity payouts while the loads are expected net added costs.
Therefore, the primary insurer’s cost reduction of the tranche system relative to a co-pay arrangement is the
difference between 5.01 million and 2.85 million (2.16 million). In effect, the cost reductions to the primary
insurer occur because of reductions in the frequency of reinsurance indemnity payments, which lowers reinsurer
transaction costs.

46   RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
5.0.       Insurance Company Pools
It is not uncommon for agricultural insurance companies to develop pools
among themselves to gain from scale economies and other beneﬁts of
large groups. Smaller insurance companies (those with less than several
billion dollars in liability) cannot sufficiently spread the cost of certain
activities to be efficient or effectively manage risk. To avoid confusion,
these actions are different from the risk rating pools where producers are
grouped into homogeneous risk groups for purposes of actuarial accuracy.
Insurance pools may provide insurance companies with a variety of
efficiencies, including:
  1.   Data management and accounting services;
  2. Development of standardized insurance products;
  3. Actuarial and underwriting services;
  4. Personnel training, including adjusters and agents;
  5. Standardized processes, procedures, and products;
  6. Joint risk absorption;
  7.   Reinsurance;
  8. Program education and advertisement;
  9. Regulation and interaction with government agencies;
  10. Facilitation of government subsidies and related monitoring.

Insurance company pools provide services desired by participating
insurance companies or, perhaps, mandated by governments. These
pools vary widely in the services provided. The power of insurance
company pools also varies widely, ranging from those functioning as
quasi-government agencies to those having little coercive power so
that they merely provide services to each company based on fee-for-
service business actions. Ultimately, insurance company pools can
provide beneﬁts through scale economies, standardization, reductions in
reinsurance transaction costs, and lower reinsurance loads.

5.1.       Pooling Arrangements
Insurance company pooling arrangements reduce average risk exposures
by maximizing the beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation and standardization. In
addition to gains from scale economies, improvements to self-regulation
interactions with regulatory agencies may be captured.

5.1.1. Beneﬁts and Costs of Insurance Company Pools. Insurance
pools have several advantages, including:
  1.   Gains from scale economies through reductions in development
       and administrative costs and increased standardization of insurance
       programs and products;
  2. Increased safety and soundness as a result of expansions in equity
     capital reserves;
  3. Improved customer trust and loyalty because of standardized loss
     adjustment procedures and product servicing;
  4. Lower insurance costs through reductions in reinsurance premiums
     resulting from standardization, scale, and diversiﬁcation;
  5. Better arrangements with governments that provide stop-loss and
     other risk-sharing activities.


                                                                               MANUAL 5   47
In addition, insurance companies that participate in pooling activities often create value in a variety of ways. For
example, such companies often have vested interests in providing functions related to:
  1.   Conducting risk analyses based on historical yield data and historical loss data;
  2. Developing insurance programs;
  3. Increasing product standardization;
  4. Improving underwriting activities, including the deﬁning insured risks, terms of insurance contracts, loss
     adjustment procedures, rating, reporting procedures, data security, and documentation;
  5. Managing networks of loss adjusters;
  6. Improving claims procedures and providing indemnity payments schedules;
  7.   Coordinating internal reinsurance among participating companies;
  8. Arranging government reinsurance activities and other forms of risk sharing;
  9. Coordinating interactions with government regulations;
  10. Providing centralized data-backup procedures;
  11. Organizing insurance program advocacy and producer education;
  12. Developing uniform procedures relative to policy sale closing dates, required inspections, timeliness of
      indemnity payments, and communications.

While insurance company pools can create value, they also increase the complexity of insurance programs and
generate additional costs. A variety of legal arrangements must be developed, including clear delineation of
risks being transferred, responsibility for indemnity payments, premium sharing, reinsurance costs, program
monitoring, and other operational costs.

5.1.2. Binding Agreements and Enforcement. Insurance pools require various agreements to be developed
and enforced. For example, one insurance company’s book-of-business could result in large indemnity payments
in a given year, while other pool companies’ book-of-businesses result in only minor indemnity obligations.
Pooling arrangements and agreements may be established so that those in the pool assist with providing
indemnity payments for pool members who have large indemnity obligations in any given year. One positive
aspect of these arrangements, however, is that capital adequacy for any single insurance company is reduced.

5.2.       Cash-Flow Model
Cash-ﬂow models are used to predict future cash-ﬂow needs and evaluate alternatives. As an example, a
cash-ﬂow model is developed to illustrate issues related to insurance company pools and their effect on capital
adequacy. The cash-ﬂow model highlights gains that can be realized from insurance company pools.

5.2.1. Model Development. Assume that two insurance companies (A and B) provide yield insurance in a
region. The average yield for producers in the region is 2 metric tons/hectare, and each produer selects 65%
coverage. The two insurers cover a total of 100 hectares. Primary Insurer A has 60% of the market (60 hectares)
and Primary Insurer B has 40% (40 hectares). Table 12 presents per ton prices, total liability, total premiums, and
total indemnities for the years 1992–2012 for the combined insurance activity of Primary Insurers A and B. Total
premiums are calculated from the data by summing the pure risk rate of 0.092 (average annual total indemnities
divided by average annual liability) and a load of 30%.

Table 13 presents the cash-ﬂow situation for Primary Insurer A, which has 60% of the market. Cash inﬂows are
represented by premiums and any reinsurance payments that may be forthcoming. The retained risk of Primary
Insurer is assumed to be one multiplied by the pure risk premium. Hence, reinsurance payments are received
when indemnities exceed retained risk.

Cash outﬂows are represented by indemnity payments and normal business operating costs. Operating costs
are assumed to be 15% of the pure risk rate multiplied by liability. The costs of belonging to insurance company
pools are also a component of cash outﬂow. Pool costs are assumed to be 1.5% of the pure risk rate multiplied
by liability. Reinsurance premiums are a cash outﬂow and are calculated by multiplying Primary Insurer A’s
reinsurance rate by its liability. The reinsurance rate is the quotient of Primary Insurer A’s pure risk rate of 0.042
after loading it by 18% and the combined average crop liability ($10,294) presented in Table 12. The pure risk rate

Table 15 presents the net cashﬂow for a primary insurance pool consisting of Primary Insurers A and B. Cash
inﬂows are simply the sum of the columns presented in Tables 13 and 14. Likewise, indemnity, operational cost,
and pool costs are also the sum of their respective columns in Tables 13 and 14. However, the pool’s reinsurance
premium is smaller than the sum of the premiums paid individually by Primary Insurers A and B because the
pool’s pure risk rate of 0.032 is lower than the individual pure risk reinsurance rate of 0.042. The pool rate is
lower because of the diversiﬁcation across Primary Insurers A and B book-of-business. The pool pure risk rate
is calculated by dividing the average annual pool reinsurance payment ($328) by the average annual combined
liability ($10,294). This results in an average annual net cash inﬂow of $69 for the pool, which is larger than the
sum of the average annual net cash inﬂow of the two insurers ($45 + $5 = $50). However, reinsurance at the pool
level requires pool participants to agree that they will each help those pool members who incur unusually large
indemnity obligations. Alternatively, each pool member must retain higher capital requirements.

In addition, these savings may be even larger, as a reinsurer may load the pure risk rate at a lower level in pooled
arrangements because of reductions in transaction costs and improved standardization.

5.2.2.    Reinsurance Designs

Reinsurance design issues for insurance pools are similar to those faced by individual insurance companies. The
central issue is how much risk, if any, an insurance pool desires to cede to a reinsurer versus the amount it is
willing to retain. If a pool assumes some indemnity risk, then arrangements must be made for the provision of
capital to support that risk. However, if the pool cedes all of the risk to a reinsurer, it can still perform important
services by facilitating reinsurance outcomes. Rating procedures for reinsurance with pool involvement follow
the same procedures discussed in the Actuarial Manual. The following examples illustrate these issues.

Consider a case in which a pool arranges and negotiates reinsurance with a reinsurance company. The
arrangement includes provisions for each primary insurance company to retain a part of the indemnity risk,
either as a co-pay or as a tranche. Each company’s reinsurance could be developed as a separate book-of-
business with reinsurance indemnities paid based on an individual company’s indemnity obligation. In this case,
the pool acts as a facilitator but bears none of the indemnity risk. However, the combined book-of-business for
the pool may be sufficiently large to be considered more valuable to reinsurance companies and could result in
lower reinsurance premiums relative to the book-of-business for smaller individual insurance companies.

A second scenario occurs if a pool is established so that the pool’s book-of-business is the combination of the
amount of risk each individual insurance company cedes to the pool. Each individual company could retain some
risk (e.g., one times premiums multiplied by the pure risk rate) with the remainder ceded to the pool. The pool
could then obtain reinsurance for aggregate indemnities that exceed one times premiums multiplied by the pure
risk premium for the pool’s share of the overall risk. In this situation, the pool faces some risk because a single
company’s indemnities could exceed one timies premiums multiplied by the pure risk premium, while aggregate
indemnities across all companies do not exceed the aggregate of one times premiums multiplied by the pure risk
premium. In this case, the indemnities would not trigger reinsurance payments. Therefore, the pool must have
sufficient capital available capital to make indemnity payments.

5.2.3. Capital Adequacy. The calculation of capital adequacy for pools that retain some indemnity risk
follows the procedures discussed earlier for primary insurance companies. These calculations are often more
complicated and depend on the speciﬁcs of reinsurance and risk bearing design of the pool. Parametric or Monte
Carlo approaches can be used to determine capital adequacy.

                                                                                                        MANUAL 5           51
5.3.       Ukraine Example
A cash-ﬂow simulation model is developed for Ukraine to illustrate the information that insurance pool
managers and reinsurers need. The model is used to estimate net cash ﬂows. The model is ﬂexible, allowing
a variety of scenarios to be simulated. In this section, the model is used to illustrate net cash ﬂows for two
insurance pool scenarios. In the ﬁrst, the pool is assumed to retain 100% of the pure risk premium. In the second,
the pool retains 200% of the pure risk premium.

5.3.1. Model Assumptions. The simulation model is based on actual historical winter wheat data for Ukraine
from 1992–2011 obtained from its multiple peril crop insurance (MPCI) program. The model is used to forecast
cash-ﬂow requirements for the eighteen years between 2012 and 2029.

Historical winter wheat production data include planted area (thousands of hectares) and average yield (tons/
hectare). The average annual price is assumed to be $100 UAH/ton.

The pure premium rate is also calculated from the historical data. The model assumes:
     • A pure risk premium load of 30%
     • Producer participation rates of 50%
     • Coverage level of 65%;
     • Primary insurer’s operational costs as 15% of premiums;
     • Insurance pool’s operational costs as 1.5% of premiums.
The model simulates the cash-ﬂow effects of risk distribution among four levels of participants: (1) a primary
insurance company, (2) an insurance company pool, (3) a private reinsurer, and (4) a government stop-loss
program. Indemnities are assumed to be paid in hierarchical tranches.

Annual insurance premium rates, premium collections, and liability are estimated based on the available data
and using the above assumptions. These values are used to obtain monthly premium cash inﬂows and cash
outﬂows (i.e., reinsurance premiums, operational costs and indemnities). The cash ﬂows are simulated on a
monthly basis and then aggregated to annual cash-ﬂow requirements.

Reinsurance premiums are calculated dynamically using simulations based on actual historical data. The total
reinsurance premium is a function of the magnitude of the liability transferred to the reinsurer. The amount of
the liability transferred is a function of the pool’s reserve-fund balance and can range from 50% to 90% of total
liability.

Operational costs represent the costs incurred by primary insurance companies and the reinsurance pool. These
costs are calculated using the assumptions noted above.

Indemnities may be provided by up to four sources in any given year: the primary insurance company,
reinsurance pool, private reinsurer, and government stop-loss program. Indemnity payments as a percent of the
total liability are calculated from the model for the period of 1992–2011.

Insurance companies must maintain sufficient capital reserves to cover potential indemnities. Indemnity
payments in any given year could exceed one or more years of premium cash inﬂow. Consequently, a substantial
portion of this liability is often transferred to a reinsurer. As larger amounts of liability are transferred to a
reinsurer, smaller reserves are needed by a primary insurer. However, reinsurance costs also increase with
increased levels of risk transfer.

5.3.2. Model Results. Figure 9 presents the pool fund’s net cash ﬂow using two scenarios: (1) the pool retains
100% of the pure risk premium and (2) the pool retains 200% of the pure risk premium. In both cases, the
remaining risk is ceded to a reinsurer. Annual net cash ﬂow is more variable when the pool retains a higher level
of the pure risk premium.

5.4.      Summary of Insurance Pools
Insurance company pooling arrangements reduce average risk exposure by maximizing diversiﬁcation and
standardization beneﬁts. In addition to gains from scale economies, self-regulatory improvements can create
better interactions with regulatory agencies. Pooling can also lower reinsurance costs and reduces capital
requirements.

Substantial cooperation among insurance companies within pools is required. While insurance company pools
can create value, they also increase the complexity of insurance programs and generate additional costs.
A variety of legal arrangements must be developed, including clear delineation of risks being transferred,
responsibility for indemnity payments, premium sharing, reinsurance costs, program monitoring, and other
operational costs.

6.0.       Summary
Agricultural production is inherently subject to a variety of risks because
management decisions or states-of-nature often generate future
outcomes (either favorable or unfavorable) that cannot be predicted
with certainty. Some risks are managed through production and ﬁnancial
decision-making while others are simply accepted as business expenses.
In addition, some risks can be managed through a variety of contractual
and insurance-related products.

On average, ﬁnancial activities with low levels of risk are associated
with lower potential returns. Conversely, high levels of ﬁnancial risk are
generally associated with high expected returns. However, the risk/return
trade-off does not mean that accepting high levels of risk guarantees
higher returns. Rather, high levels of risk provide the possibility of high
returns and vice versa. Individuals and ﬁrms must be compensated for
accepting higher levels of risk with at least the potential to receive higher
returns.

Risks associated with agricultural production ultimately impact the
ﬁnancial viability and sustainability of farms and ranches. Agricultural
production is often coincident with high short-term credit risk because
of a combination of high ﬁxed costs, weather variability, disease, and
variations in cash receipts. Whether an agricultural producer self-insures
or uses formal mechanisms for transferring risk to others, risk is a cost
that must be managed effectively.

Agricultural production risks also impact the viability of businesses that
supply agricultural credit and insurance services to agricultural producers.
Agricultural ﬁnance companies must account for potential reductions in
debt repayment as a result of agricultural production risks. Hence, they
must either maintain adequate capital reserves or pay fees to transfer this
risk to other entities.

Although a variety of approaches exist to manage risk, each involves
transaction costs and risk premiums paid by those seeking to mitigate
risk to those willing to accept additional risk. Transaction costs and risk
premiums can be incorporated into: (1) interest rates, (2) insurance, and (3)
other instruments.

Loan default risk can be incorporated into operating, intermediate,
and real estate loan interest rates. The advantage of incorporating risk
premiums into interest rates (rather than other instruments) is that
transaction costs are reduced because only two entities (a borrower
and a lender) are involved. That is, the costs of risk transfer increase as
additional entities are included. However, incorporating risk premiums
into interest rates is also problematic. For example, higher interest rates
increase the probability of loan default, reduce farm proﬁtability and
repayment capacity, and hamper investment in production-expanding
technologies.

The availability and use of agricultural insurance reduces credit risk,
lowers interest rates, improves repayment capacities, increases credit
availability, and reduces ﬁnancial and business risk. Crop insurance costs,
however, can also be substantial.




54      RISK TRANSFER AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY
The pure risk premium component of interest rates in the absence of insurance is exactly equal to an insurance
pure risk premium if the policies perfectly insure against loan default perils. As a result, insurance increases
business costs only in the sense that it increases transaction costs.

Agricultural credit and insurance ﬁrms acquire risk through lending and insurance business practices. However,
they must also balance the risk of loan defaults and insurance indemnities while maintaining adequate capital
reserves. That is, above-average loan defaults or unexpectedly large indemnity payments require sufficient
equity capital to maintain business integrity. As with any business ﬁrm, credit and insurance companies must
have sufficient capital to manage unexpected cash outﬂows. Consequently, credit and insurance ﬁrms must
decide how to manage such risk. Credit and primary insurers often transfer risk to other companies in exchange
for a fee. This process is generally termed “reinsurance.”

Agricultural production and revenue risks are only partially diversiﬁable across production sectors and regions.
Hence, primary agricultural insurers often cede risk to reinsurers who compile diversiﬁed risk portfolios.
Reinsurers charge fees to primary insurers in exchange for this risk transfer. Reinsurers are usually large,
international companies that are well diversiﬁed across regions, countries, and economic sectors. Many
governments also provide reinsurance opportunities. In many cases, governments provide stop-loss reinsurance
services that support both primary insurers and reinsurers.

Multiple forms of reinsurance exist, and each is deﬁned by the manner in which risks are distributed between
a primary insurer and a reinsurer (or reinsurers). In general, these approaches are classiﬁed as proportional,
nonproportional, or combination agreements. The costs of obtaining reinsurance depend upon pure risk
premium rates as well many other factors. In addition, loads charged by reinsurers account for other elements
such as servicing costs, program design, program integrity, underwriting issues, political, judicial and legal
risks, personnel competency, reputation of involved parties, and the costs of capital. High loads are applied to
countries without stable, equitable, and well-developed judicial systems. In addition, many of these situations
are also coincident with poorly constructed contractual law and property rights.

Primary insurers develop reinsurance submissions as business proposals for consideration by reinsurers.
Reinsurers use these submissions to evaluate their willingness to offer reinsurance and to determine appropriate
risk transfers, costs, and loads. Reinsurance companies are also attracted to insurance products that are
standardized across areas and countries. These products allow for common program administration, loss
adjustment, and accounting.

The safety and soundness of ﬁnancial institutions has become a leading issue because of the recent global
ﬁnancial crisis. The trade-off between risks and rewards generates difficult decisions regarding conservative
versus aggressive ﬁnancial management strategies. Firms must decide between sacriﬁcing long-term economic
growth versus ﬁnancial risks. Many governments regulate ﬁnancial institutions, including banks, insurance,
securities, thrift/credit unions, and futures markets. Some countries also regulate secondary ﬁnancial markets
and associated service industries such as accounting and auditing ﬁrms. Although most ﬁnancial regulation has
historically focused on banking institutions, it has recently spread to other ﬁnancial entities. The modern era of
bank regulation was initiated with the Basel Agreements, which measure credit, market, and operational risk
and capital adequacy. Parametric and Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate Value-at-Risk.

Insurance company pooling arrangements reduce average risk exposures by maximizing the beneﬁts of
diversiﬁcation and standardization. In addition to gains from scale economies, self-regulation improvements can
be developed as well as improved interactions with regulatory agencies. Such pooling can provide beneﬁts through
scale economies, standardization, reductions in reinsurance transaction costs, and lower reinsurance loads.
