Turning Finance into
Services for the Future
This report is the product of extensive collaboration and information sharing between many government agencies at national
and provincial level, and development partners in Vietnam. A core team drawn from the Ministry of Construction and Ministry
of Agriculture and Rural Development has been lead partners with the Water and Sanitation Program in this assessment
sector. The authors acknowledge their valuable contribution as well as the information sharing and contributions during
workshops by other sector stakeholders, including development partners.

The Task Team Leader for the Service Delivery Assessment (SDA) in East Asia and the Pacific is Susanna Smets. The fol-
lowing World Bank staff and consultants have provided valuable contributions to the service delivery assessment process
and report: Jeremy Colin, U-Prime Rodriguez, Vinh Quang Nguyen, Iain Menzies, Hang Diem Nguyen, Almud Weitz, Sandra
Giltner, Nguyen Trong Duong and Nguyen Danh Soan. The report was peer reviewed by the following World Bank staff and
sector colleagues: Parameswaran Iyer, Lead Water and Sanitation Specialist, Lilian Pena Pereira Weiss, Sr. Water and Sani-
tation Specialist, Sing Cho, Urban Specialist and Lalit Patra, Chief WASH section, UNICEF Vietnam.

The SDA was carried out under the guidance of the World Bank’s Wa­  ter and Sanitation Program and local partners. This re-
gional work, implemented through a country-led process, draws on the experience of water and sanitation SDAs conduct­ ed in
more than 40 countries in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia.

An SDA analysis has three main components: a review of past water and sanitation access, a costing model to as­       sess the ad-
equacy of future investments, and a scorecard that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the service de­   livery pathways. SDA’s
contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector targets for infrastructure
and hardware but also what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure that fi­   nance is effectively turned into accelerated
and sustainable water supply and sanitation service delivery.

The Water and Sanitation Program is a multi-donor partnership, part of the World Bank Group’s Water Global Practice, sup-
porting poor people in obtaining affordable, safe, and sustainable access to water and sanitation services. WSP’s donors
include Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Nor-
way, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and the World Bank.

     Sector-wide
     •	 Increase public funding for water supply and sanitation, especially for urban service provision outside of the major
        cities and for remote, underserved rural areas
     •	 Improve the management – especially cost recovery – for existing infrastructure and services provision, to reduce
        the financing gap for investment needed in infrastructure replacement
     •	 Conduct a public expenditure review for the water and sanitation sector, to identify critical obstacles to efficient
        resource utilization
     •	 Prioritize the needs of the poor in sector investments and operational strategies, such as by expanding results-
        based financing instruments and incentivize sustainable service delivery to poor and vulnerable communities
     •	 Streamline urban and rural access targets and monitoring frameworks, with greater attention to service functional-
        ity and use, and agree on common points of reference for all institutional stakeholders in the sector
     •	 Improve the policy and enabling environment, such as with respect to tariff reform and regulation, for private sector
        participation and develop capacities for private sector participation in both urban and rural services (on both public
        and private side)



     Rural Water Supply
     •	 Develop a capacity building strategy and implementation plan for National Target Programme for Rural Water Sup-
        ply and Sanitation phase 3 (NTP3), including developing a comprehensive technical support system to improve the

     •	 Allow tariffs to reach commercially viable levels whereby utilities can achieve full cost recovery, through indepen-
        dent economic regulation
     •	 Increase autonomy for utilities, allowing them to increase operation and maintenance budgets to levels that enable
        adequate maintenance to be provided and sustained
     •	 Introduce incentives and obligations for utilities to improve the quality and reliability of service provision, by estab-
        lishing an independent regulator
     •	 Enhance access to commercial finance for utilities by providing government guarantees for utilities

   Expedite the adoption of the Draft Unified Sanitation Sector Strategy and Investment Pan (U3SAP). As part of this initiative:
   •	 Adopt a subsector investment plan and develop an urban sanitation financing strategy
   •	 Support the implementation of existing policy directives on the autonomy and commercial orientation of service
      providers (including combined water and wastewater utilities)
   •	 Develop the capacity of service providers so that existing policy provisions – particularly on financial sustainability
      – can be implemented and services improved
   •	 For new wastewater treatment plants, revise technical standards to adopt cost-effective technology and introduce
      incentives to maximize direct household connections to network

2.	 Sector Overview: Coverage Trends


Coverage: Assessing Past Progress

With a population now in excess of 88 million4, Vietnam is
the world’s thirteenth most populous country. It has also
experienced one of the world’s highest economic growth
rates over the past two decades and recently graduated
from low- to middle-income country status. This growth
has been accompanied by a dramatic decline in the rate of
poverty, which fell from 58% in the early 1990s to 14.5%
by 2008.5 While living standards have improved for a large
portion of the population, not every group has benefited in
equal measure and by 2006, an average of 52% of ethnic
minority group members continued to live in poverty.

Data from the Joint Monitoring Programme6 (JMP) suggest
that Vietnam has taken great strides in terms of increasing
access to improved water supply and sanitation (see Figure
2.1). In the case of urban water supply, the 1990 access rate
to improved facilities was already high at 88%, and by 2011
had reached 99%, with 58% having a house connection.
Nevertheless, there are significant disparities in access and
service quality between big cities and smaller urban cen-
ters.7 Regarding sanitation, access to improved facilities in
urban areas rose from 64% to 93% over the same period,
with near–universal use of flush toilets, the majority of them
connected to a septic tank or pit with the overflow discharg-
ing into open drains. Less than 10% of urban wastewater                          In rural areas, access to improved water supply rose from

     Priority actions for institutional framework
     •	 Allow greater operational and financial autonomy for water and sanitation companies, within an effective regulatory
        framework including performance targets, incentives and sanctions.
     •	 Adopt and implement the draft Unified Sanitation Sector Strategy and Action Plan including, amongst other things,
        establishment of a national urban sanitation program and sector coordination and institutional framework.
     •	 Review the effectiveness of existing (and alternative) management models for rural water supply schemes and
        develop policy guidance for management strategy, extended regulation of rural piped schemes and mechanisms
        to encourage private sector participation.

 5.	 Financing and its Implementation


     Priority actions for financing and its implementation
     •	 Develop long-term subsector investment plans, as the basis to gradually increase public funding, especially for
        urban service provision outside the major cities and for remote, underserved rural areas.
     •	 Improve the monitoring of subsector investments expenditure, including investments at national and at provincial
        level and through utilities.
     •	 Carry out a Public Expenditure Review for the water and sanitation sector to improve efficiency of public spending
        (national and provincial).
     •	 Attracting private sector finance through facilitating access to (commercial) finance for utilities and addressing
        investment climate barriers.

   Priority actions for sector monitoring and evaluation
   •	 Streamline urban and rural access targets and monitoring frameworks, and agree on common points of reference
      for all institutional stakeholders in the sector.
   •	 Ensure that monitoring systems track not only access to facilities but also performance of service levels, functional-
      ity and sustainability, the effectiveness of implementation processes and equity in resource allocation.
   •	 Introduce annual urban water supply and sanitation sector reviews and joint annual sector review processes (as is
      the case for rural).
   •	 Consider modifications of the rural sanitation monitoring systems to reflect commune-level indicators for eliminat-
      ing open defecation and accessing universal access to hygienic sanitation.

      Priority actions for rural sanitation and hygiene
      •	 Identify effective operational strategies for sanitation and hygiene promotion that can be taken to scale under
         NTP3, including demand-led approaches for promotion to achieve community-wide usage of hygienic sanitation.
      •	 Increase “software” spending, including staffing and operational budgets for provincial and local health line imple-
         mentation agencies.
      •	 Facilitate increased private sector involvement in making desirable, low-cost toilets available for poor and under-
         served communities.
      •	 Setup a systematic national capacity building program for sanitation and hygiene for health sector staff and other
         participating organizations including the Vietnam Women’s Union.
      •	 Increase the use of performance-based incentives to reach poor households, achieve commune-wide sanitation
         outcomes and incentivize provinces to increase spending on sanitation.

      Priority actions for urban sanitation and hygiene
      Expedite the adoption of the Draft Unified Sanitation Sector Strategy and Investment Pan (U3SAP). As part of this
      initiative:
      •	 Adopt a subsector investment plan, develop an urban sanitation financing and establish a national urban sanitation
          program, with clear sector coordination and institutional framework.
      •	 Support the implementation of existing policy directives on the autonomy and commercial orientation of service
          providers (including combined water and wastewater utilities).
      •	 Develop the capacity of service providers so that existing policy provisions – particularly on financial sustainability
          – can be implemented and services improved.
      •	 For new wastewater treatment plants, revise technical standards to adopt cost-effective technology and introduce
          incentives to maximize direct household connections to network.
      •	 Develop and adopt viable strategies for the improved management and treatment of fecal sludge, inclusive of the
          private sector.

    Unit costs for water supply facilities estimated from a project document is about $113 per person (see World Bank, 2010, Project Paper on a Proposed
 Additional Financing Credit in the Amount of SDR 42 million to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam for the River Delta Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project,
 March). This was scaled to units comparable with those used in the current analysis using the consumer price index and exchange rate.
 43
    Feasibility studies conducted for the Vietnam Urban Water Supply Development Project indicate an investment budget of US$135 million and is expected
 to benefit 0.9 million persons (See Poyry Environment Oy, 2009, Vietnam Urban Water Supply Development Project: Sub-project of Phase 2 Competition
 Route in Bac Ninh Province, Feasibilty Study Report, September). The values suggest a unit cost of about $150 per person at 2008 prices. This was scaled to
 units comparable with those used in the current analysis using the consumer price index and exchange rate.
