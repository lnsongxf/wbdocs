               overview :
               The case for Regional Integration in sub-Saharan Africa


                        An interesting part of the World Bank’s work in Sub-Saharan Africa is the
                        Regional Integration Program. It allows countries to come together to address
                        challenges of small and fragmented markets, find regional solutions for
                        challenges facing multiple countries, and address global public goods.

                        This brochure puts a spotlight on the Bank’s Regional Integration work – on
                        the successes, challenges and lessons learnt over the past decade. During this
                        period, the Bank’s financial commitment for Regional Integration has grown,
                        and in 2016 it stood at $10 billion in IDA commitments 1 (one-fifth of the Bank’s
                        total commitments to Sub-Saharan Africa). It is a relatively young portfolio, but
                        one with tremendous promise and potential to deliver transformational impact.
                        Our country clients and partner regional institutions deliver these results. And
                        the World Bank is proud to help! We hope you like this little peek into the Bank’s
                        Regional Integration program.

entire region collectively to produce job-ready students
in more fields than would be possible if each country
had to do the whole job alone.

with Bank support, to develop the capacity to track and

The Bank is also supporting African efforts to address
deep-seated social issues. In the Sahel, a group of
countries are working to address persistently high birth
rates. The Bank-supported project is based in part on

In the Great Lakes Region, meanwhile, three countries
have joined forces to combat sexual and gender-

package of services to survivors but also by supporting
economic empowerment for women so they become
less vulnerable in the future. In a region with porous
