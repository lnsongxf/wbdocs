BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
With rice self-sufficiency secured, within the Government a consensus emerged that the country should more strategically diversify out of the relatively low value
food crops and move towards high-value agriculture and promote agricultural exports. This structural shift is critical to sustain income growth in the future, and
accelerate poverty reduction and re-reverse the trend of increasing inequality. While most fruits and vegetables not only generate higher income as compared to
rice, they demand more intensive labor input, higher levels of technology input, better crop management, and investments in post-harvest, marketing, and better
organized value chains overall; there is also significant potential for employment growth with such diversification. A structural shift towards to a more high-value
production structure, agro-processing and value addition activities, and increased competitiveness would also be needed. Moreover, there is a need to review existing
trade policies to ensure that they support high-value export agriculture; realign public sector support away from general fertilizer subsidies to better target support
and greater attention to R&D; revisit and relax the rice self-sufficiency policy and allow for more demand-driven and market oriented production; and overcome long-
standing structural constraints, such as low organizational levels of farmers, land fragmentation, and poor price information systems
The objective of the project is to support increasing agriculture productivity, improving market access, and enhancing value addition of smallholder farmers and
agribusinesses in the project areas. The project aims to: (i) improve agriculture value chain development; and (ii) promote productivity enhancement and
diversification demonstrations. Through the proposed project, the Bank is reengaging in the agriculture sector after many years of absence. The project is planned as a
first intervention of a longer term engagement, and this first project would primarily focus on agriculture diversification, pro-poor value-chain development for higher
value-added production, and agriculture income generation. The proposed project would not address the structural reform issues in the irrigated rice sector and the
plantation estate sector at this point. In these important agriculture sub-sectors, the Bank would first engage through analytical and technical assistance support with
the purpose to develop a better understanding and consensus for downstream policy and institutional reforms as well as investments.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
Key results expected includes reaching 110,000 direct beneficiaries (40,000 women); 80,000 clients adopting improved agriculture technology (24,000 women); 25
percent increase in average value of sales of products; and 12,500 new jobs generated through investments.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Transforming the School Education System as the Foundation of a Knowledge Hub Project is a $100 million initiative helping the government to strengthen the
     country’s education system at multiple levels, including national and provincial educational agencies, but especially schools. Several innovative reforms are being
     supported, including the establishment of a system for conducting national assessments of learning outcomes, school-based management, and school-based teacher
     development.
     The Project aims to enhance equitable access and quality of primary and secondary education to provide a foundation for the knowledge-based economic and
     social development of the country. It is organized under three components: (i) promoting access to primary and secondary education; (ii) improving the quality of
     education; and (iii) strengthening governance and delivery of education services. These are aligned with the themes of the government of Sri Lanka’s Education Sector
     Development Framework and Program for 2012-2016.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     The overall progress of the project has been satisfactory. All outcome and disbursement linked indicators have been achieved to date.
     ■■     About 3.5 million students and 199,000 teachers have benefited so far
     ■■     The survival rate of students through grade 11 is 86 percent (88 percent for girls and 83 percent for boys).
     ■■     The National Assessment of Learning Outcomes, in Mathematics, English, Sinhalese and Tamil for students in Grade 4, was carried out in December 2015. The
            overall findings suggest an increase in Grade 4 students’ achievement levels compared to 2013 baseline.
     ■■     7,745 schools in 73 percent of zones have completed the Program for School Improvement (PSI) annual cycle.
     ■■     7,745 schools in 73 percent of zones have implemented the School-Based Teacher Development (SBTD) programs.
     ■■     A modernized quality assurance program is being implemented in all nine provinces, linked to the rolled out of the PSI program.
     ■■     The Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) framework for Bilingual Education has been introduced in approximately 1,000 secondary schools in all
            nine provinces. The program covers about 74,000 students and around 6,200 teachers.
     ■■     Approximately 87 percent of education zones and divisions have been strengthened through human resource development of staff, the construction of physical
            facilities and the provision of equipment and technology.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Sri Lanka has around 17,000 early childhood development (ECD) centers serving approximately 513,000 children, 3-5 years. A national survey of ECD centers indicates
that less than half of them meet basic requirements for instructional quality. The coverage of ECD services is also low, with only 65 percent of the children in the 3-5
age group enrolled in ECD centers. ECD provision in Sri Lanka largely depends on non-state sector. Public expenditure on ECD is significantly lower than expenditures
in other MICs. .

The project has two components: (i) expand and strength the delivery of ECD services, and (ii) support project management, and monitoring and evaluation. While
ECD services are provided primarily by non-state ECD centers, the project provides support to both state- and non-state managed ECD centers. The key project activities
focus on improving the quality of ECD provision, expanding equitable access to ECD services, and improving the quality of ECD services in the plantation sector. To
enhance the quality of ECD provision, the project supports quality management, facility improvement of ECD centers, training of ECD teachers and teacher assistants,
and the training of trainers and government staff working in the ECD sector. It supports both supply- and demand-side interventions to enhance access to ECD services
Such interventions include awareness programs, fee waivers to ECD center students from poor households, and establishment or extension of facilities in un-served
and underserved areas. The design of the components and activities under the project draws upon the findings and recommendations from an ECD study conducted
by the World Bank in FY2013/14..

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
The project became effective in December 2015. Project implementation is on track to achieve the first year targets. Data collection for a Census of ECD centers is
expected to be complete by October 2016. Child development assessments have been prepared and piloted. The procurement process to deliver packages of teaching
and learning materials to ECD centers has commenced. By end-2016, at least 200 ECD centers will receive the packages. Modules for short-term training of master
trainers, teachers and teacher assistants are being developed. The first round of training is expected to completed by end-2016. PHDT has commenced the ECD
Diploma program for 76 participants.

KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:
Implementing Agency: Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, Provincial Councils, Plantation Human Development Trust
Key Partners: The World Bank, the United National Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) are active development partners in
the ECD sector in Sri Lanka. Additionally, several international and national NGOs are supporting the sector.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project aims to expand the supply of skilled and employable workers by increasing access to quality and labor market–relevant training programs. It supports
     implementation of the government’s Skills Sector Development Program (SSDP) for 2014-2020. The project is comprised of two components:
     ■■   Under Component 1, the result–based funding component, the project supports three closely related types of interventions: (i) strengthening governance and
          management; (ii) enhancing the quality and relevance of training; and (iii) increasing access to training opportunities. Several innovative reforms are being
          supported under the project, including establishment of Industry Sector Skills Councils, introduction of performance-based funding for public training provides,
          introduction of employment-linked training programs to increase employer involvement in design and delivery of training programs, strengthening the monitor-
          ing and evaluation system of the skills sector, and improving labor-market information systems.
     ■■   Under Component 2, an innovation, results monitoring, and capacity development component, the project will help to strengthen implementation, coordination,
          and the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development, an implementing ministry.
     The IDA credit will be complemented by a $100 million loan from the ADB (through parallel financing). The ADB operation uses a Performance for Results lending
     instrument to finance the implementation of the government’s program. Both operations will rely on common institutional and implementation arrangements,
     including a set of similar disbursement-linked indicators and M&E arrangements, to ensure close harmonization.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     The project, which became effective in October 2014, is expected to achieve the following key results:
     ■■   Increase the number of trainees enrolled in public and private training institutions;
     ■■   Improve the completion rate of trainees enrolled in public training institutions;
     ■■   Improve the average earnings of graduates in skills development programs relative to earnings of GCE-O level graduates;
     ■■   Increase employer satisfaction with graduates from training institutions.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Sri Lanka is seeing the effects of demographic and epidemiological transitions -- an aging population, increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases, both
chronic (diabetes, cancers, cardio-vascular diseases, mental health issues etc.) and acute (mainly injuries). The country continues to face emerging and re-emerging
communicable diseases like tuberculosis, leptospirosis, dengue, and influenza. Furthermore, malnutrition among mothers and children has not improved adequately,
with 17.9 percent of babies delivered each year born at a low birth-weight, and 18 percent of children under-five stunted. Fifty percent of outpatient, 95 percent of
in-patient, and 99 percent of preventive-care needs of the country are provided by the public health system. The private health sector mainly provides outpatient care
services, with expanding roles in in-patient, investigative, and laboratory services, largely in urban and semi-urban areas. The Ministry of Health finalized the National
Health Development Plan (NHDP) under the guidance of the government’s national development strategy to improve the health sector to meet middle-income country
standards.
The Second Health Sector Development Project supports the implementation of the government’s NHDP. It aims to upgrade the standards of performance of the
public health system and enable it to better respond to the challenges of malnutrition and non-communicable disease. More specifically, the project supports the
implementation of interventions prioritized under the NHDP for: (i) addressing malnutrition: (ii) improving prevention and control of non-communicable diseases: and
(iii) improving health systems. Funds are disbursed as budget support linked to agreed results achieved over the given period. The project also supports innovation,
results monitoring, and capacity building in the health sector. A core team is involved with monitoring and support, training, workshops, testing of innovative ideas,
operational research, demographic and health surveys, base-line and end-line surveys and disbursement linked indicators’ results reporting.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
This project supports the implementation of 20 results (a subset of the National Health Development Plan results). In the second year of implementation, 6 project

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Climate Resilience Improvement Project (CRIP) aims to reduce the vulnerability of exposed people and assets to climate risk and to improve the government’s capacity
     to respond effectively to disasters. These objectives will be achieved through evidence-based investment planning and urgent risk mitigation measures.
     The project, comprised of an original credit of $110 million and additional financing of $42 million, has two main components. The first component ($13 million) will
     provide for analytical work to build a climate risk-related knowledge base in eleven selected river basins and to identifying over $ 1 billion of long term investments
     that will improve physical resilience to extreme hydro-meteorological events. The second component ($130 million) supports implementation of urgent climate
     risk mitigation interventions to increase the country’s resilience to climate risks, including rehabilitation works and risk mitigation investments necessitated by the
     December 2014 floods. The project also has two additional components: $7 million to support project implementation and $2 million to provide flexible funding to
     help the country to recover from a flood event that occurs over the course of project implementation.

     CRIP was approved alongside a $102 million Development Policy Loan (DPL) with Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT DDO) designed to increase fiscal
     resilience in the short term through a line of credit to be used in case of a disaster, and with associated technical assistance.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     A total of approximately 11.5 million people living and working in districts where these projects will be implemented are considered to be the indirect beneficiaries
     of this investment. The total direct beneficiaries from all the components of the project are estimated to be 450,000 spread out among 15 districts. Approximately 48
     percent of the beneficiaries will be women. The key results are expected to include:
     ■■   The development of eleven basin investment plans that are based on an integrated understanding of climate risk are currently ongoing, with results beginning
          to be delivered at the end of 2016.
     ■■   Decrease in expected annual flood loss across 149,000 hectares (approximately 12 percent of the arable land).
     ■■   Some 1,220,000 fewer people at high risk to climate-related transport interruptions.
     ■■   Reduced landslide risk at 18 schools, serving 29,000 students.

 *As of August 31, 2016

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The CAT DDO aims to strengthen the government’s fiscal resilience to natural disasters. This will be achieved by providing immediate liquidity to the government in
the event of a disaster within a policy framework designed to improve the government’s overall capacity to implement its disaster risk management program. The
government will be able to access funds from the facility upon declaring a state of emergency following an adverse natural event. The funds may be drawn down
over a three-year period, which may be renewed up to four times for a total of 15 years. The signing of the CAT DDO was contingent upon Sri Lanka developing a
comprehensive disaster management program.

The overarching goal of this project is to provide an entry point for longer-term, larger-scale investment and policy dialogue on climate and disaster resilience. While
the CAT DDO will help to manage contingent fiscal risk in the short-term, technical assistance will be provided to the government to develop a series of financial
instruments to manage the long term liabilities associated with disaster risk. Parallel to the risk-financing instruments, physical investments will be financed under
CRIP to address both short-term system weaknesses and to increase the long-term resilience.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
This DPL with a CAT DDO will facilitate three key prior actions needed to operationalize the Sri Lanka Disaster Management Policy and National Disaster Management
Plan (NDMP), and will, in addition, foster improved data sharing within and outside government as a key tool for better disaster risk management. The prior actions are:
■■     Improved Institutional Capacity for Disaster Risk Management and Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI). This is being achieved by
       the first prior action: the adoption of a national policy and program on the management of disasters. This will be measured through the: (i) completion of fiscal
       disaster risk assessment; (ii) development of a national DRFI strategy; and (iii) issuance of a government circular on use of policies and guidelines on physical
       planning, resettlements, and local governance for disaster risk management.
■■      Increased capacity to ensure climate resilient development. This will be achieved by the second prior action: the approval of the National Disaster Man-
       agement Plan. This will be measured through: (i) nine basin-wide risk mitigation investment plans; (ii) guidelines issued on slope angles in new road construc-
       tion; and (iii) approval of a national monitoring framework to measure implementation of the Comprehensive Disaster Management Plan.
■■     Improved application of disaster information in policy making and development planning. This will be achieved by the third prior action: approval
       of the proposal to establish a steering committee to monitor the national program for the common use and sharing of spatial data and information. This will be
       measured through: (i) a geospatial-data-sharing platform established to share disaster risk information among relevant stakeholders; (ii) disaster risk profiles
       available at a national level and shared; and (iii) line ministries and agencies accessing the data-sharing platform.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     ■■     Sri Lanka exhibits a wide array of ecosystems with a diversity of species considered to be the richest per unit area in the Asian region. About 14 percent of Sri
            Lanka’s land area is under legal protection. Despite conservation efforts, deforestation, forest degradation and biodiversity loss continue. HEC is a noteworthy
            issue in the context of Sri Lanka’s development. Sri Lanka has the highest density of elephants among the Asian elephant range states. With accelerating develop-
            ment and fragmentation of habitats, innovative landscape management approaches are needed to address the human-elephant conflict. Such approaches would
            balance competing objectives of creating new opportunities for rural poverty reduction and employment and sustaining Sri Lanka’s unique elephant population
            over much of the Dry Zone. Sri Lanka’s biodiversity and natural resources endowments are important assets for future sustainable development. Many communi-
            ties living in the vicinity of natural forests are directly and indirectly dependent on the natural ecosystems.
     ■■     Nature-based tourism is a fast growing segment of the global tourism industry creating opportunities for growth and to develop a successful rural development
            growth strategy. Due to the ease of wildlife sighting, Sri Lanka has the potential of being the best nature-based tourism destination outside Africa. Yet nature-
            based tourism remains underexploited. Less than 30 percent of foreign tourists visit the country’s national parks due to poor visitor experience as a result of
            inadequate management. Much of the sector operates as an enclave industry, generating little employment and growth benefits. Only limited portion of the
            monetary benefits from nature-based tourism flow to local communities.
     ■■     The country’s development framework commits Sri Lanka to a path of sustainable development and identifies the country’s biodiversity as part of its natural heri-
            tage and a high conservation priority. It has been recognized that the long-term sustainability of the environment and natural resources depends on their ability
            to provide benefits to people and the country. This includes the need to mobilize financing and revenue generation from sustainable use of the natural resources,
            such as nature-based tourism, payment for ecosystem services, and others.
     ■■     The project objective is to improve the management of ecosystems in selected locations in Sri Lanka for conservation and community benefits Therefore, the
            project will also contribute to the Government’s policies of: increasing forest cover; harnessing of ecosystem benefits; including the protection of watersheds
            for agricultural productivity; developing mechanisms for human-elephant co-existence; improving the revenue generating capability of wildlife and forest re-
            sources; and developing the capacity for delivering institutional mandates of key natural resources management agencies. The project contributes to the higher
            level objective of long-term environmental sustainability and inclusiveness of growth and development in and around ecologically sensitive areas in Sri Lanka.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     The project was signed on September 5, 2016
     The following are among the key results expected to be achieved by the project:
     ■■     Direct benefits to at least 15,000 people from communities living adjacent to Protected Areas due to sustainable use and management of natural resources
     ■■     At least 10,000 people from communities living adjacent to Protected Areas with improved access income generating activities
     ■■     At least 75 villages and agriculture plots protected as a result of human-elephant co-existence activities
     ■■     200,000ha of land (and water) brought under enhanced biodiversity protection
     ■■     10% increase in visitor revenue of selected Protected Areas as a result of project interventions

     KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:
     Implementing Agency: The project is led by the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment with the participation of Ministry of Sustainable Development
     and Wildlife, Forest Department and Department of Wildlife Conservation
     Key Partners: Project is closely collaborating with the Forest Department led strategy development for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation
     (REDD+) supported by UNDP and FAO and Community Forestry Project financed by the Government of Australia through UNDP. The project is expected to build
     collaboration and complementarity with UNDP/GEF financed Enhancing Biodiversity Conservation and Sustenance of Ecosystem Services in Environmentally Sensitive
     Areas and GTZ financed support to Department of wildlife Conservation in the bufferzones of Wilpattu National Park.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The destruction to village level infrastructure facilities and services due to the conflict in the Northern and Eastern Provinces were considerable. Rural roads that provide
inter-connectivity and village level infrastructure such as drainage systems, primary health clinics, schools and markets were severely damaged. Most urban, peri-urban
and rural drinking water schemes were in severe disrepair and needed a full reconstruction. A large number of public services such as street lighting, solid waste
collection and library facilities were also completely damaged.

The project was designed to improve the delivery of local infrastructure services by local authorities in the Northern and Eastern Provinces in an accountable and
responsive manner. More specifically, the project aims to: (i) improve the quantity and quality of public goods delivered and maintained by local authorities; (ii) ensure
that local authorities undertake public expenditures and deliver local services in a transparent and accountable manner; (iii) strengthen service delivery systems and
build the capacity of local authorities to deliver their mandated services, as well as strengthen the monitoring capacities of the provincial and national level institutions;
(iv) establish a comprehensive monitoring system, evaluate technical and social audits and prepare citizen scorecards and other needed analysis; and (v) support the
key agencies at the central, provincial and local levels that are involved in the day-to-day management of the project to procure necessary consultant, equipment and
operational support for the smooth implementation of the project.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
■■   684km of inter-connective rural roads, 53 km of flood storm drainages, four rural water supply schemes, 477 common assets (such as markets, parks, playgrounds
     and cemeteries), and 50 km nine rural electrification have been completed.
■■   70 percent of capital grants released against allocations.
■■   87 percent increased satisfaction of local people regarding local authorities.
■■   90 percent of local authorities preparing annual financial statements within three months of closure, and 75 percent acceptable financial audits of accounts.
■■   100 percent of local authorities with budgets prepared in a participatory manner, and 100 percent of local authorities whose revenues, expenditures and procure-
     ment decisions are publically disclosed.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     ■■   Sri Lanka needs to tap into the competitive advantages of the Colombo Metropolitan Region (CMR) to accelerate growth. The CMR will continue to generate much
          of the capital, human resources, technology and services needed for growth in the rest of the country. While the CMR covers only about 6 percent of the country’s
          total land area and is home to 28 percent of its population, it accounts for about 45 percent of national GDP and 80 percent of industrial value added. It is the
          country’s major urban agglomeration and is growing faster than any other metropolitan region in Sri Lanka.
     ■■   A number of obstacles are preventing the CMR from realizing its full economic potential. These include: inadequate infrastructure and services; significant
          vulnerability to flooding, the impacts of which are being exacerbated by climate change and sea-level rise; and poorly design and maintained drainage. In addi-
          tion, limited financial and human resources available to local authorities, combined with their lack of coordination, hinder effective delivery and operations and
          maintenance of local infrastructure services. Integrated planning, management and coordination at the metropolitan level are virtually nonexistent.
     ■■   The project aims to support the government in reducing flooding in the catchment of the Colombo Water Basin and strengthen the capacity of local authorities in
          the CMR to rehabilitate, improve and maintain local infrastructure and services through selected demonstration investments.
     ■■   The following results are anticipated from the project: (i) reduction in the area under risk of flooding (25-28-year return period) in the project area; and (ii) a 20
          percent increase in the total urban roads maintained by the project’s local authorities that are in good and fair condition (indicating improved capacity of local
          authorities in operation and maintenance of critical municipal infrastructure).
     ■■   These infrastructure and quality of life improvements means that CMR will be better prepared for the future and will help protect the region’s increasing popula-
          tion, natural environment and infrastructure..

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   Early intermediary results achieved included improved coordination between central agencies and local authorities and among local authorities within the metro-
          politan area, and institutionalization of metropolitan-level coordination agencies, such as the Metropolitan Wetland Management Department and the Colombo
          Metropolitan Unit of the Urban Development Authority.
     ■■   	Component 2 (municipal infrastructure) has been completed and contributed to on-the-job capacities of local authorities in CMR, particularly in the areas of procure-
           ment, contract management for municipal roads, coordination with utilities, use of high quality design, and quality and safety standards of municipal roads.
     ■■    Key achievements to date include: the 3 km of primary canals have been completed, 2 micro-drainage subprojects have been implemented, and 29 km of roads
           	
           that have been built or rehabilitated based on prescribed standards. The newly opened Beddegana Wetlands Park aids in flood control and allows the public to
           experience the city’s unique urban wetlands. In addition, the project rehabilitated the Town Square and Viharamahadevi Parks, which included the creation of
           playgrounds, bicycle paths and public facilities.
     ■■    	Up to date, the project has increased the city’s walkability, safety and quality of life for both pedestrians and motorists as the road redesigns have included pedestrian
            crossings, disabled friendly access as well as flood mitigation measures such as sloping road profiles and side drainage.
     ■■     	The largest and most complex flood-reduction works (both from an engineering and safeguard point of view) are currently under way. This work will include build-
             ing and maintaining a system of drainage, tunnels, canal construction and rehabilitation, flood gates, pumping stations and water diversion. It will also support a
             flood management system to maintain the drainage network. The major technical assistance and feasibility studies have been completed. The status of civil works
             contracts varies but all are expected to be awarded by the end of FY17.

 *As of August 31, 2016

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Government of Sri Lanka, through Bank Technical Assistance (TA) support, initiated its national secondary cities development program in 2012, to tackle key
development constraints in its secondary cities nationwide. Among various donors, the Bank was the first to take up the initiative through the preparation and delivery
of the Sri Lanka Strategic Cities Development Project (SCDP), which was approved in May, 2014 with a $147 million IDA credit. The SCDP focused on improving
integrated urban services and public spaces in two key secondary cities in Sri Lanka- Kandy in the central part of the country and Galle, in the Southwest of the country.

The AF of the SCDP was discussed and agreed upon with the Government of Sri Lanka in order to expand the SCDP to a major city center in the Northern part of the
country- Jaffna. Jaffna has severely suffered from the three-decade civil conflict in the country and is in great need of improvement of its municipal services and
infrastructure assets. The AF is a US$55 million IDA credit and includes four sub-components: Drainage and water retention ponds improvement, culture heritage and
public spaces improvement, road connectivity improvement, and capacity building of Jaffna Municipal Council and support of strategic TAs.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
Key results expected to be achieved include improved urban services in Kandy, with 320,000 people expected to benefit from improved basic services by the end of the
project, improved urban services in Galle, and a reduction in area at risk of flood inundation within the designated project area in Galle (10-year return period flood for
major canals and 5-year return period for local drainage; and access to enhanced public urban spaces in Kandy and Galle, through new or rehabilitated urban public
spaces and pedestrian sidewalks and pathways. Under the AF, key results expected include direct beneficiaries of Jaffna Municipal Council area residents benefiting
from improved basic services, new or rehabilitated urban public spaces (including culture heritage assets), roads rehabilitated, cycle lanes and pedestrian paths
rehabilitated or constructed, and storm water drainage and water retention ponds reinstated or rehabilitated.

KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:
Implementing Agency: Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development and Jaffna Municipal Council (as partner agency)

Key Partners: To realize the vision of a system of cities, Sri Lanka has initiated a national-level program – the Strategic Cities Program – to manage the development
of strategic cities and ensure a consistent and coherent approach. The Bank and government have embarked on the first and second phase initaitives to support
this program – the original SCDP focuses on Kandy and Galle, and the recently approved AF on Jaffna. The ADB is preparing for integrated urban development for
Trincomalee, and AFD is finalizing their support for Anuradhapura..

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
■■   Dams are part of essential infrastructure to store water for Sri Lanka’s irrigation, hydropower, and domestic and industrial water supply needs, as well as to provide
     flood control. At present, about 85 percent of the developed water resources are used for irrigation in the dry zone, which covers nearly two-thirds of the country.
     The dam network in Sri Lanka comprises over 270 medium and 80 large dams. Due to lack of maintenance over time, the dams pose an escalating public safety
     threat. Many large dams are ageing and suffer from various structural deficiencies and shortcomings in operation and monitoring facilities, requiring urgent
     attention.
■■   The project development objectives of the project are to: (i) establish long-term sustainable arrangements for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of large
     dams; and (ii) improve water resources planning

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
■■   The original credit of the project was fully disbursed and closed at the end of June 2015.
■■   Remedial works in thirty dams have been completed. Of the remaining 33 dams to be rehabilitated, work is in progress in 21 (as of July 31, 2016). Procurement
     is scheduled for completion for the remaining 12 dams by September 2016, and all works are projected to be completed by December 2017.
■■   The institutional arrangements for a National Dam Safety Program has been approved by government. Staffing requirement has also been approved, but transfer
     of staff to the secretariat and recruitment is yet to happen. Office space has been identified to house the Secretariat. Scanning of all important documents and
     drawings related to the large and medium dams continues as part of the development of an e-library. It is expected that the Center will be operational by Janu-
     ary 2017.
■■   A total of 120 stations have been completed and are transmitting data to the two centers. 41 additional hydro-meteorological stations are being installed. Data
     validation is ongoing, and work is underway for utilizing the data gathered.
■■   Three plans namely, the National Water Use Master Plan, Mahaweli Water Development Plan (updated), and the Mundeni Aru River Basin Plan were prepared
     under the project. They have been submitted to the Cabinet for obtaining necessary approvals

 *As of June 30, 2016

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Since 2000 the Government has set out a range of policies covering all aspects of the water and sanitation sector which, taken together, provide a sound framework
within which the sector operates. The Government’s vision for the water sector is to provide access to safe drinking water for all citizens over the medium term (by
2020) with a particular emphasis on increasing the quality of service (increasing the proportion of people served through piped water connections to 60 percent and
tripling coverage by sewerage systems to 7 percent). The government also envisages a sector with improved institutional performance where tariffs are set to ensure
cost recovery, and regulatory reforms are introduced, so that there can be greater self-financing of capital works through innovative financing structures. In rural areas
there will be a continued focus on community involvement in water supply and greater collaboration between the various actors in the sector including the National
Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) and the local authorities.

The development objectives of the project are to increase access to piped water services and improved sanitation in selected districts; and to strengthen the capacity
of associated institutions.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The project, which became effective in December 2015, is expected to deliver the following key results:
■■   Urban water and sanitation – 6 water supply schemes + 7 septage treatment facilities
■■   Rural water supply and sanitation – approx. 320 new water schemes
■■   Estates sector water supply and sanitation – approx. 130 schemes + 7,500 latrines
■■   Institutional support to: strengthen capacity/operationalise Department of National Community Water Supply; enhance CBO performance; strengthen other
     institutions
■■   Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) system development to monitor CBO performance
■■   Strategic investment program for NWSDB
■■   Water quality mapping + CKDu (Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology) support
