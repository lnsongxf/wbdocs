Ending Poverty
and Hunger
by 2030
An Agenda for the
global food system


MAY 2015
Second Edition
Foreword

The food system is fundamental for human life. It provides the energy and nutrition that people
need as a basis for economic and social advance. It provides an income source for billions of
people, many of whom are poor, and it is the largest user of the world’s natural resources. Yet
about 800 million people still go to bed hungry every night, and many more suffer from the
“hidden hunger” of malnutrition.

That’s why the world needs a food system that can feed every person, every day, everywhere with
a nutritious and affordable diet, delivered in a sustainable way.

The food system operates across many sectors and touches upon many aspects of society—
agriculture, health and nutrition, the environment, business, equity and culture, to name a few.
As a result, improvements in its operations that help end hunger can also contribute to ending
extreme poverty.

To achieve these goals, however, we need action. For this reason, the World Bank Group is
pleased to present “Ending Poverty and Hunger by 2030: An Agenda for the Global Food
System.”

This report is a guide for change, identifying key issues where the global food system should
improve. The food system must become more sustainable. It must also raise the agricultural
productivity of poor farmers, improve nutritional outcomes, and broadly adopt climate-smart
agriculture that can withstand and mitigate climate change. (A digital version of the report is
available at www.worldbank.org/agriculture.)

Later this year, we expect that the Sustainable Development Goals will endorse ending extreme
poverty and hunger by 2030. Achieving these goals depends on what we do next because, as
this report shows, we have the knowledge we need. The World Bank Group is committed to
using that knowledge and strengthening partnerships to build a global food system that creates
a healthier and more prosperous world.
