         Bank, evaluates the business models of infoDev’s Mobile Application Laboratories
         (mLabs) and Mobile Social Networking Hubs (mHubs). mLabs and mHubs were
    implemented under the Creating Sustainable Businesses in the Knowledge Economy
    (CSBKE) program, funded by the government of Finland, in partnership with Nokia.

    for infoDev. The task team leaders were Ellen Olafsen and Tim Kelly. The team is indebted
    to the more than 200 stakeholders that provided input and feedback for the analysis through
    interviews and focus groups. Special thanks are due to mLab and mHub managers, who
    helped with extensive results reporting and interviews, local facilitation during country
    visits, as well as reviewing. Several infoDev staff gave detailed comments during an
    internal review: Angela Bekkers, Brett Dickstein, Rick Doerr, Diletta Doretti, Carolyn
    Florey, and Zoe Lu. Colin Blackman copy-edited the report and Jean Manuel Wegimont
    designed the layout.

            Executive Summary


     Part I: Rationale for a Business Model Evaluation of mLabs and mHubs



     I
       n 2010, infoDev, the government of Finland, and Nokia launched the Creating
       Sustainable Businesses in the Knowledge Economy (CSBKE) program to derive and
       test new approaches to advancing innovation and entrepreneurship in developing
     countries. Based on the vast growth of mobile content and access technology, a
     large part of the program focused on support for innovation in mobile applications
     and software (or “apps”).1

     Through CSBKE, the concept of “mobile entrepreneurship enablers” was devel-
     oped, of which two forms were tested: Mobile Application Laboratories (mLabs)
     and Mobile Social Networking Hubs (mHubs). mLabs are specialized mobile app
     business incubation and acceleration service providers; mHubs focus on mobile
     tech community building by convening stakeholder groups at informal gatherings.
     mLabs were intended to reach a region comprising several countries, whereas
     mHubs serve only a single city. Underpinning the mLab and mHub models was the
     conviction that the enhancement of local innovation ecosystems—characterized
     by effective partnerships and coordination amongst stakeholders—would improve
     the enabling environment for mobile entrepreneurship. infoDev also ran a number
     of global projects (such as innovation competitions) and training sessions, com-
     plemented by analytical products, such as qualitative evaluations, a major report
     on user and app ecosystems in developing countries, and a generic business
     model for mLabs.

     The total funding for Mobile Innovation programming under CSBKE was about
     $4.2 million, with about $2.4 million used for grants to local mLab and mHub
     implementers, $1.5 million for technical assistance for mLabs and mHubs, and
     $254,000 for research. Four mLabs and eight mHubs were implemented in eleven
     countries across East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia,
     and the Caucasus (ECA). An additional mLab was intended for South Asia, but
     it never became operational because of governance and leadership issues. As
     of November 2013, periods of operation ranged from over two and half years for
     mLab East Africa to just over one year for mLab East Asia.

     As an important step in learning from the mLab and mHub pilot projects, this report
     analyzes the business models that mLabs and mHubs have implemented, that is,
     how they generated value for stakeholders and income for themselves. The study
     derives its findings mainly from in-depth case studies of mLabs and mHubs that
     were based on almost 150 interviews and 13 focus groups with 240 stakeholders
2
10   held between April and July 2013. The findings will be useful primarily for current
and future managers, consortium organizations, and funders of mLabs and mHubs.
The report is also relevant for other stakeholders partnering with infoDev in the
implementation of mLabs and mHubs, namely private-sector technology partners,
investors, and World Bank units, as well as for external practitioners and research-
ers interested in technology innovation hubs.

The report also lists data for early results of mLabs and mHubs to illustrate their
promise. The aggregate data for all mLabs and mHubs as of June 2013 show:
	
	 •		About 2,500 individuals were trained in mobile technology and entrepreneur-			
			ship topics.
     Over 500 apps were brought to market; more than 200 generated revenue.
	 •	 	
			      million app downloads and more than 5,700 organizational app customers 	
     2.6 		
			were reported.
	 •		Nearly 100 startups were created.
	 •		About $2.6 million in investments has been raised by the supported startups; 	
			  together they generated over $1.1 million in revenue and created about 280 			
			direct jobs.
The evaluation is complementary to additional analytical products on mLabs and
mHubs examining their holistic effects beyond descriptive results, as well as en-
trepreneurial success stories. In particular, an outcome assessment of mLab ECA,
mLab East Africa, and mLab Southern Africa—to be released in March 2014—finds a
significant positive impact of mLabs on the mobile innovation and entrepreneurship
ecosystems in which they exist, including improved linkages between ecosystem
stakeholders and an overall enhancement of the enabling environment for startup
creation. In addition, the outcome assessment documents the development impact
of mobile apps developed by mLab-supported entrepreneurs in areas such as ed-
ucation, healthcare, financial inclusion, environment, transport, and governance.

Part II: Lessons Learned, Discussion, and Future Directions of mLab and mHub
Business Models
The second part of the report includes the lessons learned and important open
questions about the business models of mLabs and mHubs. The lessons learned,
as the core contribution of the report, are grouped into four areas: value proposition
and services; strategic decisions; financial sustainability; and governance, leader-
ship, and consortia.

mLabs’ and mHubs’ value proposition and services:
	 •		mLabs and mHubs tend to focus on three main areas of activity: startup
			  creation and support, skills development, and community building.
	 •		Although mLabs have elements of startup accelerators, they have assumed 		
			  a broader function as ecosystem builders, focusing on activities that contrib-			
			  ute	to the enabling environment for mobile entrepreneurs at large, which 			
                                                                                          2
                                                                                         11
			  sometimes results in more limited direct effects on startup creation.
     	 •		 Startups see one-on-one mentoring as the key value proposition of mLabs, 			
     			   and they request that it be given stronger emphasis.
           An mLab or mHub generates the most value when it offers a portfolio of 			
        •			

           services that mutually reinforce each other.
          		
        •		Innovation competitions lead to better results for startup creation if they are
           embedded in continuous support, including follow-up mentoring and contact
           brokering with potential partners and investors.
        •	 Training programs are likely to have positive effects on the local ecosystem

           in the long run, but they do not appear as the most efficient means for direct
           startup creation.
        •	 mLabs and mHubs add substantial value for entrepreneurs and startups

           through brokering relationships with clients, funders, and partners.

     mLabs’ and mHubs’ strategic decisions:
       •	 Prioritizing value-maximizing activities has been a major challenge for mLab
          and mHub managers as they have faced heavy resource and time constraints.
       •	 It is important for mLab and mHub managers to engage with the developer

          and startup community, but mLabs need to evaluate the effectiveness of
          community building for startup creation and mitigate the risk of distraction.
       •	 An mLab’s location must be readily accessible, and colocation with other sup-

          port organizations can provide the most value for developers an entrepreneurs.
       •	 mLabs and mHubs benefit from building partnerships with a wide variety of

          stakeholders that have a partially overlapping interest in entrepreneurship
       		 and startup support.
       •	 Events and competitions can be useful tools to build partnerships and select

          incubatees.
       •	 mLab managers are aware that selection of incubatees and tracking them

          after they leave the program is crucial, but they have sometimes fallen short
          of doing this adequately.
       •	 mLabs have struggled to achieve a strong regional footprint beyond their

       		 base country and city.

     mLabs’ and mHubs’ financial sustainability:
         mLabs
       •		        and mHubs have followed different strategies to work towards finan-			
          cial sustainability; activity-specific funding from tech partners and, for mLab 	
           Southern Africa and mLab ECA, funding from provincial and national govern-
          		
          ments have been the main sources of income.
       •	 mLabs and mHubs were successful in securing financial contributions from pri-

          vate-sector partners primarily for events, competitions, and training, while mLab
          East Africa has also been successful in seeking sponsorship for its core program.
       •	 Only in few cases were mLabs able to attract core funding that would cover

          the costs of overhead, infrastructure, and incubation from the private sector
          (for mLab East Africa); major contributions instead came from government
2
12
          agencies (for mLab Southern Africa and mLab ECA).
  •	 Startups and entrepreneurs are usually open to paying for services or sharing
     success with mLabs, but they expect a high-value service and are uncertain
     about the appropriate procedure for far-reaching contractual agreements.
  •	 At the end of the infoDev grant period in June 2013, several mHubs and most

     mLabs, despite progress in attracting revenue from services to private-sector
     partners and entrepreneurs, project financing gaps over the coming months
     and years.
  •	 Based on the experience of the past two years, infoDev estimates that, with

     mLabs’ current focus on ecosystem building and support for idea stage
     enterprises, initial donor financing should extend at least over six to ten years.




mLab and mHub governance, leadership, and consortia:
  •	 Identifying the right mLab or mHub manager is critical for success.
  •	 An mLab consortium should be led by a purpose-driven organization that has

     an inherent interest in supporting the innovation ecosystem.
  •	 Consortia that are led by government-linked entities or universities often

     suffer from bureaucratic requirements that can conflict with the mission and
     mode of operation required for an effective mLab.
  •	 Consortia leaders need to have sufficient institutional capacity and set clear

     expectations and roles for consortia partners.
  •	 Each consortium organization needs to ensure internal stability and long-

     term backing of the mLab and its vision; risks of internal challenges and
     bottlenecks have to be mitigated early on.
  •	 Consortium member organizations are important channels for resources and

     partnerships for an mLab; the organizations ought to complement each other
     in this respect.
  •	 If consortium organizations directly contribute to the implementation of

     the mLab’s activities, the consortium needs to be able to manage potential
                                                                                           2
                                                                                          13
     conflicts of interest.
     Beyond findings, the report also highlights several unresolved questions about
     mLab business models. For example, should mLabs focus more on ecosystem
     building or startup acceleration? At which innovation and startup stage can mLabs
     add the most value? Should mLabs be purely market-oriented or also accommo-
     date social enterprises? Which areas of expertise should mLabs emphasize as
     their unique value proposition in innovation ecosystems? Should mLabs build
     a portfolio of incubatees with complementary assets? And should mLabs make
     direct equity investments or rather broker investor contacts for client startups?

     The report also discusses lessons learned and future directions for infoDev. In par-
     ticular, it describes how enhanced scoping assessments and ecosystem mapping
     will enable the design of appropriate mobile entrepreneurship enabler models in
     future programs, and how improvements can be made with regard to infoDev’s
     future programs’ timeline and grant administration. Further suggestions concern
     infoDev’s increasing role as a knowledge and analytics provider for mLabs and
     mHubs, as well as improved ways for global network facilitation. Finally, important
     knowledge gaps are highlighted that could be addressed through future research
     by infoDev or other organizations working in the area of innovation ecosystems of
     developing countries.

     Part II of the report concludes that the mLab and mHub pilots have established
     proof for the viability of the mobile entrepreneurship enabler concept: mLabs
     and mHubs are capable of creating and supporting growth-oriented startups and
     filling gaps in innovation ecosystems of developing countries. At the same time,
     continuous learning will be needed for mLabs, mHubs, and infoDev to maximize
2
14   their effectiveness. Depending on the local context and strategic choices, mLabs
and mHubs can implement a variety of business models, and experimentation
and adaptation will remain necessary. In particular mLabs’ revenue and financial
sustainability models require further testing and adjustment.

The lessons drawn from the CSBKE pilots will not only help infoDev to deepen its
continuous value proposition for its key stakeholders, but they will also guide the
design of future activities included in the infoDev work program, such as infoDev’s
upcoming regional Mobile Innovation Project in the Caribbean or its inclusion-ori-
ented activities planned for Africa. Within the broader World Bank context, these
findings will also be valuable to several projects that encompass models inspired
by the mHubs and mLabs.

Part III: Case Studies of mLab and mHub Business Models
Case studies, as Part III of the report, provide additional information for stake-
holders in the countries and regions of implementation. They should also give
useful pointers and ideas for improved business model design of mLabs and
mHubs as well as similar technology innovation hubs. The Business Model Can-
vas serves as the principal analytical framework. In seven in-depth case studies,
the report derives rich illustrations and descriptions of the business models of
mLabs and mHubs and considers the challenges they face, the results achieved,
as well as their longer-term financial sustainability.

The report covers mLab East Africa (Kenya), mLab Southern Africa (South Afri-
ca), mLab ECA (Armenia), mLab East Asia (Vietnam), Mobile Nepal (mHub Nepal),
TOPICA MSN (mHub Vietnam), and Akirachix (mHub Kenya). Essays on mLab South
Asia (Pakistan) and Mobile Monday Kampala (mHub Uganda), which were based on
interviews only with key implementers and decision makers, are included in addi-
tion to the in-depth studies, for a total of nine case studies. For reference, mHubs
in Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and Tanzania were not covered as case studies.

    Why infoDev?
    “infoDev is privileged to work with a range of donors and partners who value
    our grassroots innovation communities and our cutting-edge approach to
    piloting new ideas and seeking new knowledge. […]

    infoDev has the necessary agility to pilot new concepts at the grassroots, and to
    ensure that workable solutions are scaled and mainstreamed into larger projects.
    It supports the World Bank Group’s commitment to innovation and entrepreneur-
    ship through these approaches. It also bridges operations and knowledge through
    best-practice assessments, research, and publications, and through a regular
    and rigorous evaluation of its activities. infoDev supports the World Bank Group’s
    commitment to the growth of a strong private sector in developing countries in
    a manner that leverages technology and innovation and feeds overall growth,
    competitiveness and inclusion.

    Our work extends around the world, allowing us to leverage the ideas and lessons
    generated in one country for the benefit of other countries. Our stakeholders
    in developing countries create and design practical solutions with infoDev and
    work with us as partners in ensuring success on the ground. These stakeholders
    and our networks also request reliable and rigorous research and participate
    in infoDev’s research and knowledge agenda. This research, which draws upon
    grassroots voices, in turn informs effective operations. […]

    Over the past few years, infoDev has built on its success in incubating technol-
    ogy-enabled businesses to launch specialized programs aimed at promoting
    the growth of new ventures in the mobile, climate and agribusiness sectors.
    Supporting these strategic sectors contributes to broader growth and compet-
    itiveness, and leads to the development of value-adding jobs suited to the new
    knowledge economy.”

                              most vibrant areas for entrepreneurship are mobile applications and software,
                             or simply “apps.” The growth of “app economies” is forecast to further increase
                             over the coming years, implying enormous potential for app entrepreneurs and
                             developers. Mobile apps also enhance opportunities in areas such as healthcare,
                             government, empowerment, and entertainment.

                             App entrepreneurs face substantial challenges in fledgling innovation ecosys-
                             tems of developing countries. They might have unique insights into local cir-
                             cumstances and abundant creativity but they often lack professional networks,
                             favorable policy environments, information access, business skills, mentors,
                             spaces for exchange, and access to investors. In most cases, ecosystems also
                             have to integrate policy makers, mobile network operators, investors, donors,
                             and so on, for mobile app entrepreneurs to thrive.

       Startup acceleration is distinct from business incubation through a greater emphasis on investment-readiness,
      		
     mentoring and coaching, peer learning within badges of entrepreneurs, as well as pitching and demos. In contrast to
     incubation, acceleration de-emphasizes physical work and office space, provision of business support functions such as
     accounting and legal, and other physical infrastructure such as app testing facilities.

           For instance, together with Nokia, infoDev facilitated a partnership between AppCampus and the mLabs, according to
     which mLab startups applying for the program would have privileged access to earmarked funds, see http://infodev.org/

     pact accelerators was also highlighted in a recent report by the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (see Baird,
     Bowles, and Lall, 2013). The study gives the following advice to impact accelerators: “Tracking & Measurability: [1.] Invest
     in platforms and systems to encourage and enable quality data collection from the enterprises you support. (Check out
     the free PULSE platform on Salesforce.) [2.] Collect data from all enterprises that apply to your programs, even the ones
     that are not accepted or do not receive services, to more comprehensively assess performance against a control group. [3.]
     Collect data from participating enterprises for at least five years post-program years to track progress and growth over
     the long-term. Partner with academic institutions and industry associations to develop stronger data collection systems.”
     15
           An upcoming outcome assessment of mLabs and mHubs implemented under CSBKE will evaluate additional qualitative
     and quantitative evidence. infoDev commissioned the assessment from the global private sector development evaluation
     and research agency, CAD (http://cad.globalcad.org/en/que-es-cad/).

                          The role of innovation competitions
                          Innovation competitions for mobile app and ICT entrepreneurs have gained
                          in popularity in recent years. They aim to provide opportunities especially for
                          young innovators and technologists, for instance, offering cash, device, or
                          incubation prizes.

                          However, in places where ad hoc innovation competitions proliferated, they
                          sometimes led to only temporary or no effects on innovative and entrepreneurial
                          activity. For instance, competition fatigue and competition hopping are two worrying
                          phenomena that have led those technologists to self-select for participation that
                          are not able or willing to take forward and scale their products.

                          Yet, with the right incentive structures in place, innovation competitions have
                          shown to be useful to identify talent, become lightweight tools for startup
                          acceleration, and extend tech innovation hubs’ reach beyond their physical
                          space. In the experience of mLabs, mHubs, and infoDev, innovation competitions

Room for Debate: Open
Questions for mLabs
All existing mLabs and mHubs were pilot
projects. infoDev selected a varied group
of implementation partners across a
diverse set of countries and cultures.
Each manager was given only a basic
idea of what an mHub or mLab could
look like, and deliverables were kept rel-
atively open-ended. infoDev encouraged
managers to try out new approaches and
push the boundaries of common incuba-
tion and acceleration methods.

adaptations to the basic model were

     have a lower risk of failing and higher

     that mLabs become more akin to the

     As a case in point, mLab East Africa’s Pivot East competition has so far attracted the most significant contributions from
the private sector, fueled by the competition’s high brand value and the rapidly growing East African innovation ecosystem.
24

25
     This also underscores that results cannot be compared directly across mLabs: in part due to selection of more seasoned
entrepreneurs, mLab East Africa dwarfs mLab ECA with regard to investments raised, revenues generated, and jobs created
by its startups (see the respective case studies for mLab East Africa and mLab ECA).
26
     In this context, social enterprises are defined as startups that are profit-oriented, but ultimately see profit as a means to
the end of rolling out an app or a mobile software product that has positive social impact. Typical sectors of interest include
mobile health, agriculture, education, and government.

adaptation, see http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/opinion/let-the-poor-have-fun.html.
29
     Of course, the capital required varies from market to market and depends on the startups’ capital intensity. In the mobile
app space of developing countries, typical preseed financing gaps start as low as $5,000 and reach up to $50,000.
30
     Recently, significant advances have been made towards coherent methodologies and frameworks for the assessment of en-
trepreneurial ecosystems that have helped infoDev to fine-tune its assessments. Notably, the World Economic Forum (2013)
together with Stanford University and others suggested a framework of entrepreneurial ecosystem pillars and entrepreneurs’
perceptions of their relative importance. The study found that, globally, entrepreneurs perceive accessible markets, human
capital and the local workforce, as well as funding and access to finance as the most important ecosystem pillars. Also
GSMA’s Mobile for Development unit as part of its M4D Network program will publish a mapping of Kenya’s entrepreneurial

                         iHub’s Influence, from mLab East Africa’s perspective

                         The iHub has become one of the most widely known innovation hubs in
                         Africa. In recent years, not only has the number of iHub community members
                         grown far beyond 10,000, the innovation space has also attracted interest
                         from many high-level tech executives and thought leaders from across the
                         globe. Companies and organizations that look for channels to engage with
                         developers and the tech community in Kenya often see the iHub as a
                         powerful one-stop shop.

                         The iHub’s mission is to strengthen the ICT ecosystem of Kenya and East
                         Africa. As the consortium leader, the iHub sees mLab East Africa’s niche
                         focus on startup creation as one important component among its several
                         other work streams. The iHub’s clout has undoubtedly been instrumental in
                         increasing the mLab’s reach, securing contributions from large tech partners
                         (for instance, Intel, Microsoft, Samsung, Nokia, and Qualcomm), and engaging
                         a greater number and variety of stakeholders in mLab projects and activities.
                         Occasionally, the iHub and its subsidiaries have also assisted the mLab’s
                         startups directly with contact brokerage, accounting support, or workshops
                         on market research.

multiyear contributions from both pro-

in terms of sustainability and potential
longevity, with a projected surplus for
each year from 2013 to 2016. However,
currently funded activities will large-

virtual support outside the province.
Successful contracts with new pro-
vincial governments will have similar
limitations. Additional donor funding
could help the mLab to achieve a more
flexible and truly regional reach, for
instance, by establishing satellite sites
as part of the “vertical model,” or by
running regional innovation events and
competitions.

startup support still has wide gaps, and
that the available talent cannot fully un-
fold its potential with the help of MoMo
and fledgling innovation hubs alone.
At the same time, MoMo Kampala has
neither the means nor the mission to
provide the support mechanisms that
are urgently needed, such as access to
finance, incubation and acceleration,
structured mentorship brokering, poli-
cy reforms. It does expect, however, to
facilitate a more structured collabora-
tion between Uganda’s innovation hubs,
which could lead to more efficient use
of existing resources and to attracting
new ones.

           A helpful discussion on the difficulties of categorizing stakeholders as partners or customer segments can be found at
      http://businessmodelhub.com/forum/topics/confusion-in-business-model-canvas-customers-or-partners. Moreover, a more
      analytically sound method to include donors and impact investors as distinct types of customer segments is the double-sided
      Business Model Canvas for NGOs (see http://www.innovativenonprofit.com/2012/08/the-nonprofit-business-model-can-

           The competition’s first edition in 2011 was dubbed “Pivot 25” but, for the sake of simplicity, this report will refer to all three
      editions in the series as “Pivot East.”

           The first waves of trainees were trained for six months before the schedule was tightened and aligned to university calendars.

           The coaches had at least monthly meetings with startups to discuss their business and fundraising strategy and how
      startups could conduct and measure market experiments most effectively. A few incubatees continued to contract Viktoria
      Solutions at their own expense once mLab’s subsidy ended. Additionally, the startups also received in-kind mentoring services
      from other mentors that were brokered by the mLab.

           Starting in October 2013, the mLab is running a virtual incubation program for startups spread across the region, recruited
      from among the 25 finalists of Pivot East 2013. The project is funded through a $30,000 contribution from AfriLabs, as a
      tranche from an infoDev grant. http://www.infodev.org/articles/east-african-virtual-incubation-pilot-launch-nairobi-kenya.

           Nokia also played an important role in the setup phase of the mLab, including brokering linkages to DST.
      66
           This implies that DST is not represented as a customer segment in the mLab’s business model canvas. For a more detailed
      explanation, see the section on Applying the Business Model Canvas to mLabs and mHubs.

Appendix C. Collection and Analysis of Results (Radar Charts)

All data were collected through self-reporting and interviews with mLab and mHub managers (and in mLab East
Asia’s case, the local infoDev consultant). All data need to be seen in the context of attributes of local ecosystems and
the challenges and opportunities that any given mLab or mHub faced (see section Why Evaluate Business Models of
mLabs and mHubs?). Several—if not most—of the measured indicators are difficult to standardize and track reliably.
This report makes the case that mLabs and mHubs are embedded in complex startup and innovation ecosystems, and
that their holistic impact is notoriously difficult to quantify. Attribution of impact is a key problem in startup ecosys-
tems where actors are intertwined in various and complex ways and effects often take time to become apparent.
Hence, the results should only be seen as indicative, until feasible, more sophisticated evaluation and impact
assessment methods become available for ecosystem-oriented interventions such as innovation hubs.


The percentage values in the radar charts in the section on Results for mLabs and mHubs, as well as in the case
studies represent values standardized across data for the four mLabs, with the mLab that had the highest result
receiving 100%. Several indicators are composed of weighted subindicators. The weights were determined based on
the relative relevance of the subindicators towards the goal of sustainable startup creation (see table C.1).

                       The study draws from 148 semi-structured face-to-face interviews and 13 focus groups with 240
                       stakeholders of seven mLabs and mHubs in five countries (Armenia, Kenya, Nepal, South Africa,
                       and Vietnam). Interviewees were asked about their perceptions on elements of the Business Model
                       Canvas applied to the mHub or mLab in question. Interviewed stakeholder groups included develop-
                       ers, entrepreneurs, and startups; mLab and mHub managers; partners and sponsors; policy makers;
                       and other members of local ecosystems. Interview participants form a convenient sample; they were
                       chosen based on the perceived relevance for the evaluation’s goals and in coordination with mLab
                       and mHub managers. Biases in the participants’ answers cannot be ruled out, as the interviewer was
                       clearly identified to them as an infoDev and World Bank consultant.


                       Secondary sources included a comprehensive database of program and project documentation,
                       including reporting material and project scorecards. The study was also informed by the findings of an
                       independent evaluation of the CSBKE program conducted by the consulting agency Universalia.123
