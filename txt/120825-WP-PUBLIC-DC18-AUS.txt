About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        This procedure is required under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and
        the New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act of 1999.


        Depending on the company's circumstances and location, it must comply
        with di erent taxation requirements:


        - If the annual company turnover is AUD$75,000 or more, the company must
        register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) by obtaining an 11-digit Australian
        Business Number (ABN). The annual company turnover represents its gross
        business income (not its pro t). Companies with lower annual turnover may
        also choose to register for the Goods and Services Tax.


        - The application to ABN can be submitted electronically at the Business
        Entry Point, www.abr.gov.au. If the electronic submission is successful, the
        applicant will be provided with an ABN at the end of the Internet session.
        Alternatively, a hard copy application may be submitted to the ATO. The ATO
        will then mail the ABN within 28 days of receiving the application.


        -The company must deduct taxes from employee pay, provide payment
        summaries, contribute to employee superannuation and report and issue
        payments to the ATO. Companies may also register for Pay As You Go (PAYG)

        This procedure is required under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and
        the New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act of 1999.


        Depending on the company's circumstances and location, it must comply
        with di erent taxation requirements:


        - If the annual company turnover is AUD$75,000 or more, the company must
        register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) by obtaining an 11-digit Australian
        Business Number (ABN). The annual company turnover represents its gross
        business income (not its pro t). Companies with lower annual turnover may
        also choose to register for the Goods and Services Tax.

        Entry Point, www.abr.gov.au. If the electronic submission is successful, the
        applicant will be provided with an ABN at the end of the Internet session.
        Alternatively, a hard copy application may be submitted to the ATO. The ATO
        will then mail the ABN within 28 days of receiving the application.


        -The company must deduct taxes from employee pay, provide payment
        summaries, contribute to employee superannuation and report and issue
        payments to the ATO. Companies may also register for Pay As You Go (PAYG)
        at www.abr.gov.au. Otherwise, they may register with the ATO by postal mail
        or phone or through a tax agent. State and territory taxes (e.g., stamp duty,
        payroll tax, and land tax) may also be imposed, with requirements di ering
        according to company location.


        - Companies with annual turnover of AUD$75,000 or more must register for
        an ABN. Failure to do so will result in GST being levied on all company sales
        since the required date of registration even if the sale price of any goods or
        services has not been grossed up to include the tax. Furthermore, the
        company may incur penalties and interest charges for any overdue
        payments.


        - Further information in connection with ABN, GST and PAYG registration
        may be found on the ATO website (www.ato.gov.au).

      BuildCo should ensure that the relevant planning controls have been
      identi ed and satis ed.

      There are a range of planning instruments that apply to various types of
      development and locations within Sydney.


      Most environmental and planning law in Australia varies from one Australian
      state to another. In Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, development
      will generally be assessed under one of the regimes in the Environmental
      Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (Planning Act).


      The warehouse to be constructed by BuildCo is most likely to fall under Part
      4 of the Planning Act and will most likely require development consent from
      the relevant local council. The Planning Act provides that, for certain types of
      development, the concurrence of an authority other than the consent
      authority must be obtained. The conditions for approval of development
      assessed under Part 4 may also require the developer to obtain further
      certi cates or approvals. These will add cost and time.

      The council's local environment plan (LEP) usually identi es whether
      development consent is required. The LEP categorizes development as
      requiring consent, not requiring consent, or prohibited. In most cases, the
      zoning of the site determines the types of development permitted on the
      land. Note that the construction of a warehouse is a type of development
      that almost always requires consent. If the development requires
      development consent, the local council will usually be the consent authority.
      However, in some cases, another authority (such as a State minister) may be
      the consent authority.

      cross sections • landscape plan • shadow diagrams (two storey development
      and as otherwise speci ed), and a Statement of Environmental E ects (SEE).
      The SEE must be submitted with the development application. Details must
      include: - • description of the site; • description of the proposed development
      including all proposed works; • details of compliance with the relevant
      environmental planning instruments i.e. Baulkham Hills Local Environmental
      Plan 2005 and Baulkham Hills Development Control Plan (BHDCP); • written
      justi cation to vary any development standard contained within a Section of
      BHDCP; • Details of how the development satis es the provisions of Section
      79C of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979.


      If the assessment is satisfactory, the consent authority will grant BuildCo
      development consent, which may be subject to conditions. The Development
      Application will be advertised for approximately 21 days to give the
      surrounding neighbors the opportunity to contest the planned development
      in that area. Once the advertising period is over, it will typically take 6 weeks
      for the development certi cate to be issued.

      After a Development Consent has been issued by the Local Council and
      before any building work is carried out, the owner must apply for a
      Construction Certi cate. This certi cate shows that the proposed
      development satis es the Environmental Planning and Assessment
      Regulation 2000.

      This includes:
      • The construction plans and speci cations must comply with the relevant
      standards (ie Building Code of Australia).
      • The construction plans and speci cations are consistent with the
      development consent; and
      • All conditions of the development consent requiring compliance prior to
      the issuance of a construction certi cate are nalized (i.e., payment of the
      long service levy has been made, the re protection and structural capacity
      of the development is adequate, etc.).

      The Principal Certifying Authority (PCA) can be a Council or a private
      accredited building surveyor. If BuildCo chooses the Council as the PCA, an
      appointment form must be completed after the Construction Certi cate is
      obtained. BuildCo must con rm with the PCA what work will be done, the fee,
      and any other requirements.


      When the Hill Shire City Council is the PCA, the developer submits a Notice of
      Commencement of Work 2 days before work begins (Under Sections 81 A(2)

      Agency : Hill Shire City Council

      Once a PCA is appointed, it is his responsibility to provide to the applicant a
      list of the mandatory critical stage inspections (in accordance to Clause 162A
      of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2000) and any
      other inspections (determined by the PCA) that will be required during
      construction of the building. The builder needs to be aware of these
      inspections as they need to be carried out at the appropriate time. It is the
      responsibility of the builder to contact the PCA at least 48 hours before an
      inspection is required.


      Inspections during construction ensure that the construction is consistent
      with what has been approved in the development consent and construction
      certi cate, and that the building will meet acceptable standards of health,
      safety and amenity.


      Mandatory critical stage inspections are set according to the building class.
      For the case study of Doing Business, the warehouse is a class 7 building.

      In the case of a class 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 building, the building work on the
      development site must be inspected:
      • At the commencement of building work
      • Prior to covering any storm water drainage connections
      • After the building work has been completed and prior to any occupation
      certi cate can be issued in relation to the building


      The cost of inspection when Sydney City Council is the PCA is AUD 309.00 per
      inspection including 10% GST. However, Doing Business does not include
      GST in its calculation.

      the coordinator within 10 days of application receipt (or longer if the
      development is complex). The notice speci es charges to be paid and the
      project to be built. If construction is required, certi cation will depend on the
      time required for the project to be built and taken over by Sydney Water.
      BuildCo pays the fees, builds the project, and receives the certi cate.


      Fee schedule for water and sewage connection:

      The authority that has approved the development may monitor the nished
      development to ensure compliance with laws and local planning policies. If
      the development does not comply with the development consent, the
      applicant can be ned (with a penalty notice), ordered to make changes to
      the development, or taken to the Land and Environment Court of New South
      Wales. The court may issue orders to remedy or restrain breaches of the
      development consent (e.g. orders to carry out works, cease certain uses of
      the premises, or remove the development). In addition, breaches of planning
      laws may be criminal o ences.

      New South Wales planning legislation allows any person to bring an action to
      remedy or restrain a breach of development consent. Thus, in theory, any
      person may commence proceedings to enforce compliance with the law (a) if
      a relevant approval (such as a development consent or construction
      certi cate) has not been obtained where required; or (b) if there has been
      non-compliance with the conditions of a relevant approval.

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

      The connection application can be obtained and submitted via website,
      email or fax. The majority of interaction by contractors and service providers
      is undertaken via email or the website. Premises Connection Requirements
      are detailed in the "ES1" document. This document also includes an
      application for CT metering for use where required.

      There is a range of information required on the connection application form
      relating to details of the connection customer, the intended load to be
      connected, the intended point of connection and details of the electrical
      contractor / customer's representative.

      Ausgrid will assess the electrical load to be connected. In this instance, a load
      above 100Amps per phase connected directly to the street network, Ausgrid
      will issue a "Basic Connection O er - over 100Amps" (a connection contract)
      within 10 business days which details the conditions under which Ausgrid will
      permit the connection and the range of Ausgrid fees that are likely to apply
      associated with making the connection. The connection applicant has 45
      business days to accept the connection o er.

      Once the connection o er is accepted (includes acceptance of Ausgrid gees),
      Ausgrid will provided a "Job Number" which enables the Accredited Service
      Provider (ASP) to obtain an energy meter from Ausgrid. An NMI number
      (National Market Identi er) will also be provided for use by the applicant
      when entering into a contract with an energy retailer for the supply of
      electricity. It is not normally advisable to commence work until the
      connection o er has been issued / accepted and job number / NMI issued.

      Agency : Accredited Service Provider

      The customer engages a private Accredited Service Provider (ASP). The ASP
      does all the connection works from the network to the point of attachment
      to the premises (consumer's terminals), including installing the energy
      meter. Once completed, the ASP submits a Noti cation of Service Work
      (NOSW) detailing the connection works undertaken.

      Agency : Ausgrid

      Service requiring metering of supplies above 100amps needs to submit the
      CT Metering Application form prior to energizing any new services.
      The form is used to capture data that is unique to the CT installation site
      such as
      • the retailer
      • customer’s details
      • electrical contractor
      • metering provider
      • ALL existing metering to be removed
      As the information must be con rmed prior to the energisation of the site
      and may take up to ten days to process, to avoid delay, it is suggested that                                                  Page 24  
      the details in CT Metering Application form be submitted as soon as

       Agency : Ausgrid

       The Electrical Contractor undertaking the electrical installation work
       associated with the premises submits a Certi cate of Compliance Electrical
       Work (CCEW) to the electricity utility once the work is completed. The utility
       will undertake an audit inspection of electrical installation.

       The customer requests Ausgrid (or an Accredited Service Provider) to install
       the meter. Meter may be installed at the same time than the
       internal/external installation inspection (but not necessarily). At the
       completion of the installation inspection the service is energized and
       electricity starts owing.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                                           - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                           - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                           - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                           The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                           loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                           of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                           to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                           where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                           property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator           Answer           Explanation

Proceeding          receivership     BizBank is likely to move aggressively to enforce its security right and sell the assets. BizBank
                                     will likely be authorized under the loan agreement to ask the court to appoint a receiver, who
                                     will then take control of the pledged assets. As Mirage will have no other assets left, this will
                                     results in the appointment of a liquidator to the company, and the receiver and the
                                     liquidator will proceed concurrently.

Outcome             going concern    The receiver will take the maximum efforts to sell the hotel as a going concern, because that
                                     is the best way to maximize the proceeds of the sale. If the hotel is sold, this will allow the
                                     business to continue trading under different ownership.

Time (in years)     1.0              It takes 12 months to complete the receivership procedure in Australia. As a first step,
                                     BizBank will ask the court to appoint a receiver, who will take control of the business/assets.
                                     The receiver will evaluate the company's financials to determine whether continuous
                                     operations are possible or whether Mirage's business should be terminated. Most likely, it
                                     will be possible to keep Mirage operating, so the receiver will make arrangement to continue
                                     and possibly improve the performance of the business. In the meantime, the receiver will
                                     look for a buyer willing to purchase the hotel as a going concern. After the sale of the
                                     business, the receiver will remit the payment to the secured creditor.

Cost (% of          8.0              The cost of the procedure will amount to approximately 8% of the value of the hotel. Major
estate)                              expenses will include attorneys' fees (around 2.5%), remuneration of the receiver (around
                                     4.5%), and other fees (around 1%), including court fees, real estate agents' fees and
                                     marketing costs.
