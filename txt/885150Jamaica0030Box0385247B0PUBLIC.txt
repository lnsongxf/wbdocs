I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Jamaica
        perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Jamaica regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Jamaica;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Jamaica;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               work and activities, and communication and information sharing in Jamaica; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Jamaica.
       Use data to help inform Jamaica country team’s strategy.


II. Methodology
In April and May 2013, 160 stakeholders of the World Bank in Jamaica were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the Prime Minister; the office of
a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial department, or
implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-supported
projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based
organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based
groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 108
stakeholders participated in the country survey (68% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier or email and returned it accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Jamaica; their overall attitudes toward the
World Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the World Bank’s knowledge work and
activities; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Jamaica; and the Bank’s
communication and information sharing in Jamaica.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing Jamaica: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Jamaica is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Jamaica, and how to best achieve “shared prosperity”.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with and the effectiveness of various organizations working in Jamaica, including the World
   Bank. Respondents were asked to rate Bank staff preparedness to help Jamaica solve its
   development challenges, the extent to which the Bank should seek to influence the global
   development agenda, their agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, the
   extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner, and the Bank’s services meet
   the national development needs of Jamaica. Respondents were also asked to indicate the
   sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the
   Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in
   helping to reduce poverty in Jamaica, with which stakeholder groups the Bank should
   collaborate more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Jamaica, the extent to which the Bank
   meets Jamaica’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s
   level of effectiveness across twenty-five development areas, such as social protection.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to indicate
   how frequently they consult Bank knowledge work and activities, the areas on which the
   Bank should focus its knowledge work and activities, and to rate the effectiveness and
   quality of the Bank’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality. Respondents were also
   asked if they consulted the most recent LAC Flagship Report and if so, to evaluate it.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as working with the World
   Bank increasing Jamaica’s institutional capacity.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Jamaica: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Jamaica’s development in the near future and to
   what extent they believe the Bank has moved in the right direction. Respondents were also
   asked to indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Jamaica and
   which services the Bank should offer more of in Jamaica.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their Internet access, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website and PICs. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s
   Access to Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of
   agreement that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data
   policy. Respondents were also asked about their level of agreement that they know how to
   find information from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Jamaica, and geographic location.
In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 73 respondents (59% response rate) who completed the
survey in FY 2010. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, respondents from the office of a Minister were combined with those
        from the office of the Prime Minister; respondents from PMUs were combined with
        consultants working on Bank-supported projects; respondents from bilateral agencies and
        multilateral agencies were combined; respondents from the financial sector/private banks
        were combined with those from the private sector; and the few respondents from local
        government, the media, independent government institutions, and trade unions were
        included in the “Other” category.

Geographic Location

       Because of the small number of respondents from Western Jamaica and the South Coast,
        these respondents were combined into an “Other Areas” category for all further analyses.
        Responses across geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found in
        Appendix C (see page 88). Only significant differences between geographic locations in
        response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)

Familiarity with the World Bank

       Familiarity with the World Bank in Jamaica received a mean rating of 8.2 across all
        respondents, significantly higher than the mean level of familiarity received in the FY ’10
        country survey (6.6).
       Familiarity with the World Bank and the IMF was significantly higher than the levels of
        familiarity indicated for the other organizations.
       Respondents from Kingston and urban St. Catherine had significantly higher levels of
        familiarity (8.4) than respondents from other areas (6.8). Respondents across stakeholder
        groups had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the Bank.
       Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were significantly, moderately
        correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Jamaica and the
        Bank’s relevance to Jamaica’s development and a significant, but smaller correlation with
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Jamaica.

        Parliamentarian and the private sector/financial sector/private banks were significantly
        more likely to indicate that the World Bank’s greatest weakness was not enough public
        disclosure of its work compared to respondents from other stakeholder groups.
       Respondents from academia/research institutes were significantly more likely to indicate
        that the World Bank’s staff being too inaccessible was one of its greatest weaknesses
        compared to respondents from other stakeholder groups.

       There were just three instances in which there were statistically significant stakeholder
        group differences across these twenty-five areas of development.
             Respondents from the office of a Parliamentarian gave the highest ratings for the
              Bank’s effectiveness at “Public health management and access” whereas
              respondents from academia/research institutes gave significantly lower
              effectiveness ratings.
             Respondents from bilateral or multilateral agencies gave the highest ratings for
              the Bank’s effectiveness at “Education and skills development” whereas
              consultants on Bank-supported programs/PMUs gave significantly lower
              effectiveness ratings.

             Respondents from the office of the Prime Minister/Minister gave the highest
              ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness at “Environmental sustainability and climate
              change” whereas respondents from academia/research institutes gave significantly
              lower effectiveness ratings.

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)
       Respondents in this year’s country survey gave higher ratings for the Bank’s
        effectiveness across many areas that could be compared to respondents in the FY ’10
        country survey; however, there was one notable instance in which ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness significantly declined in the current country survey. Statistically significant
        comparisons are noted in the graph below.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Jamaica, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-five specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Jamaica. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at global/regional integration;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at agriculture, rural development and food security; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at public infrastructure.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Jamaica, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at global/regional integration;

The World Bank is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Jamaica or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey is meant to give the World Bank’s team that works in Jamaica, greater insight into how the Bank’s work is
perceived. This is one tool the World Bank uses to assess the views of its critical stakeholders. With this
understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies, outreach and programs that support
development in Jamaica. The World Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this
effort in Jamaica. This ensures anonymity and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the survey,
please circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer a
question, please leave it blank.
