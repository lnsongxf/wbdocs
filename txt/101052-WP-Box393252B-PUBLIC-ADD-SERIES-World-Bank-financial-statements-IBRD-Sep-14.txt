2   IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2014
I.        Introduction
This document should be read together with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s (IBRD)
Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014
(FY14). IBRD undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements. Box 1 provides IBRD’s selected
financial data as of, and for the three months ended, September 30, 2014 and 2013, as well as for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2014. Certain reclassifications of prior year’s information have been made to conform with the
current year’s presentation. (For further details see Note A: Summary of Significant Accounting and Related
Policies in the Notes to the Condensed Quarterly Financial Statements.)
Business Model
IBRD, an international organization owned by its 188 member countries, is the largest multilateral development
bank in the world. The World Bank Group’s1 (WBG), two main goals are to end extreme poverty and promote
shared prosperity. To meet these goals, IBRD provides loans, guarantees, and technical assistance (including
through reimbursable advisory services) for economic reform projects and programs. In addition, IBRD provides or
facilitates financing through trust fund partnerships with bilateral and multilateral donors. IBRD’s ability to
intermediate the funds it raises in international capital markets to its developing member countries is important in
helping it achieve its development goals. IBRD’s financial goal is not to maximize profits, but to earn adequate
income to ensure its financial strength and sustain its development activities.
IBRD derives its financial strength from its capital base, through the support of its shareholders as well as, its
financial and risk management policies and practices. Shareholder support takes the form of capital subscriptions
from members and their strong record in servicing their debt to IBRD. IBRD’s sound financial policies and practices
have enabled it to maintain its capital adequacy, diversify its funding sources, hold a portfolio of liquid investments
to meet its financial commitments, and limit its risks – including credit and market risks.
Basis of Reporting
Audited Financial Statements
IBRD’s financial statements conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(U.S. GAAP), referred to in this document as the “reported basis.” All instruments in the investment and borrowing
portfolios and all other derivatives, are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in the income
statement. IBRD’s loans are reported at amortized cost, except for loans with embedded derivatives, which are
reported at fair value. Management uses the financial statements to derive allocable income and analyze fair value
results.
Fair Value
IBRD makes extensive use of financial instruments, including derivatives, in its operations. The fair value of these
instruments is affected by changes in market variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, and credit risk.
Management uses fair value to assess the performance of the investment-trading portfolio; to monitor the results of
the Equity Management Framework (EMF), where IBRD mainly uses derivatives to stabilize its allocable income;
and to manage certain market risks, including interest rate risk and commercial counterparty credit risk.
Allocable Income
Management uses allocable income as a basis for making distributions out of net income. All unrealized mark-to-
market gains and losses, with the exception of those relating to the investment portfolio, are excluded from reported
net income to arrive at allocable income. Allocable income also reflects adjustments to exclude items such as
pension and Board of Governors-approved transfers from reported net income (Table 1).

    The other institutions of the World Bank Group are the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance
    Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
    Disputes (ICSID).

II.        Summary of Allocable Income and Income Allocation
Reported Net Income
For the first three months ended September 30, 2014 (FY15), IBRD had a net loss of $417 million, versus net
income of $80 million during the same period in FY14. The major variance between the periods related to
unrealized losses incurred on the non-trading portfolios.

a. Equity contribution consists of interest cost saved by deploying equity instead of debt to fund loans; revenue generated by the
   equity management framework; and realized gains/losses on the borrowing portfolio.
b. Primarily comprised of administrative expenses and reimbursable income.
c. See Table 11.

Allocable Income/Income Allocation
The primary drivers of IBRD’s allocable income are interest earned on the loan and investment portfolios (net of
funding costs), revenue generated from IBRD’s equity, net non-interest expenses, and changes in the provision for
losses on loans and other exposures2 (Table 1 summarizes IBRD’s net income and provides a reconciliation to
allocable income).
Allocable income was $556 million for the first three months of FY15, 16% lower than the same period in FY14.
The major variances between the periods are explained below:
Provision for losses on loans and other exposures:
For the first three months of FY15, there was a charge of $40                    Figure 1: Net Interest Revenue for the first

during the period. This is in contrast to a release of $17 million in             1.2
the same period in FY14, reflecting the impact of loans to Iran
being restored to accrual status.                                                 0.9

the first three months of FY15 as compared to the same period in
FY14.
Allocable income for FY14 was $769 million. Of this amount, on August 7, 2014, the Executive Directors,
recommended to IBRD’s Board of Governors the transfer of $635 million to the IDA and $134 million to Surplus.

    Other exposures include loans with a deferred drawdown option (DDO), irrevocable commitments, exposures to member
    countries’ derivatives, and guarantees.

These transfers were approved by IBRD’s Board of Governors on October 10, 2014, and the transfer to IDA was
made on October 14, 2014. In addition, IBRD’s Board of Governors approved a transfer of $15 million to the
Global Infrastructure Facility from Surplus, by way of grant.

As of September 30, 2014, IBRD’s net loans outstanding were $152 billion, an increase of $0.5 billion from June
30, 2014. The increase was mainly due to $3.3 billion in net loan disbursements made in the first three months of
FY15, partially offset by currency translation losses of $2.8 billion, consistent with the 7.7% depreciation of the euro
against the U.S. dollar.

Investment Highlights
As of September 30, 2014, IBRD’s net investment portfolio totaled $40.9 billion, of
                                                                                           Figure 4: Liquidity Asset
which $39.8 billion represents the liquid asset portfolio (see Note C: Investments in
                                                                                           Portfolio

portfolio was lower by $1.8 billion than on June 30, 2014, reflecting the impact of        50
loan disbursements made during the first three months of FY15.
                                                                                           40
The objective of the liquid asset portfolio is to ensure the availability of sufficient    30
cash flows, as reflected in the prudential minimum liquidity level, to meet all IBRD’s
                                                                                           20
financial commitments. The prudential minimum liquidity level has been set at $26
billion for FY15, and the liquid asset portfolio was at 153% as of September 30,           10

2014, slightly above the targeted range of 100%-150%.                                       0
                                                                                                    Jun-13   Jun-14   Sep-14

The maturity profile of IBRD’s liquid asset portfolio reflects a high degree of
liquidity, with $23.8 billion (or 60% of total volume) maturing within six months, of which $16.0 billion is expected
to mature within one month.

IBRD issues debt securities to both institutional and retail investors in a variety of     160
currencies. During the first three months of FY15, IBRD raised medium and long-            155
term debt of $19.8 billion in 16 currencies.                                               150
                                                                                           145
As of September 30, 2014, the borrowing portfolio totaled $157.2 billion, an increase       140
of $4.5 billion from June 30, 2014 (see Note E: Borrowings in the Notes to the              135
Condensed Quarterly Financial Statements). This increase was mainly due to net              130
new issuances of $6.2 billion to support the increase in loan disbursements. Of the         125
                                                                                                Jun-13 Jun-14 Sep-14
new issuances, $5.7 billion remained unsettled as of September 30, 2014 and a
receivable for the proceeds was recorded under Other Assets on the Condensed
Balance Sheet. This was partly offset by currency translation gains of $2.2 billion, consistent with the depreciation
of the euro against the U.S. dollar.

Capital Highlights
As a result of the General and Selective Capital Increase resolutions in fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, subscribed
capital is expected to increase by $87 billion over a five-year period, of which $5.1 billion will be paid-in. As of
September 30, 2014, $46.1 billion was subscribed (including shares subscribed under the Voice Reform for which
no paid-in capital was required), resulting in additional paid-in capital of $2.7 billion, of which $209 million was
received during the first three months of FY15.




6    IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2014
IV.       Financial Risk Management
In an effort to maximize IBRD’s capacity to lend to member countries for development purposes, IBRD limits its
exposure to market and counterparty credit risks. In addition, to ensure that the financial risks associated with its
loans and other exposures do not exceed its risk-bearing capacity, IBRD uses a strategic capital adequacy framework
as a key medium-term capital planning tool.
Capital Adequacy
IBRD’s capital adequacy is the degree to which its capital is sufficient to withstand                               Figure 6: Equity-to-
unexpected shocks. IBRD’s Executive Directors monitor IBRD’s capital adequacy within                                Loans Ratio (%)
a strategic capital adequacy framework and use the equity-to-loans ratio as a key indicator                              35

of capital adequacy.                                                                                                     30

IBRD’s equity-to-loans ratio decreased to 25.3% at September 30, 2014 from 25.7% on                                      25
June 30, 2014, and was above the minimum ratio of 20% (Table 5). The decrease in the
ratio during the quarter was mainly driven by the $3.3 billion in net loan disbursements.                                20

                                                                                                                                                                            Sep-14
Since IBRD minimizes the exchange rate sensitivity of its balance sheet, the depreciation
of the euro against the U.S. Dollar in the first three months of FY15 has not had an impact
on the equity-to-loans ratio.

Management of Credit and Market Risks
Interest rate risk is the most significant risk faced by IBRD among the various types of market risks. IBRD’s
exposure to currency and liquidity risks is minimal as a result of its risk management policies. In addition, IBRD
faces two types of credit risk: country credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
Country Credit Risk
Country credit risk reflects potential losses arising from protracted arrears on payments from borrowers on loans and
other exposures. IBRD manages this risk by applying individual country exposure limits. These limits take into
account creditworthiness and performance of borrowers.

Portfolio Concentration Risk
Portfolio concentration risk, which arises when a               Figure 7: Country Exposures as of September 30, 2014
small group of borrowers account for a large share              In billions of U.S. dollars
of loans outstanding, is a key concern for IBRD. It                                    Top Eight Country Exposure

The eight countries with the highest exposures accounted for about 60% of IBRD’s total exposure. As of September
30, 2014, all exposures for these individual borrowers were below the SBL (Figure 7). IBRD’s largest exposure to a
single borrowing country as of September 30, 2014 was Mexico at $15.1 billion. In FY14, a surcharge of 50 basis
points was introduced on balances above $17.5 billion for India and $16.5 billion for the other four SBL borrowing
countries. As of September 30, 2014, no surcharge was applicable to any of the five countries.
Accumulated Provision on Loans and Other Exposure
As of September 30, 2014, only 0.3% of IBRD’s loans were in nonaccrual status and all were related to Zimbabwe.
IBRD’s total provision for losses on accrual and nonaccrual loans accounted for 1.06% of the total loan portfolio
(see Note D: Loans and Other Exposures in the Notes to the Condensed Quarterly Financial Statements).
Counterparty Credit Risk
Commercial Counterparty Credit Risk
Commercial counterparty credit risk is managed by applying eligibility criteria, volume limits for transactions with
individual counterparties, and using mark-to-market collateral arrangements for swap transactions (Table 6). The
effective management of this risk is vital to the success of IBRD’s funding, investment, and asset/liability
management. The monitoring and managing of this risk is continuous, given the changing market environment.
IBRD’s overall commercial credit exposure decreased during the first three months of FY15, in line with the lower
liquidity levels. The credit quality of IBRD’s portfolio remains concentrated in the upper end of the credit spectrum,
with 80% of the portfolio rated AA or above, reflecting IBRD’s continued preference for highly rated securities and
counterparties across all categories of financial instruments. Total commercial counterparty credit exposure, net of
collateral held, was $42 billion as of September 30, 2014.

8    IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2014
Non-Commercial Counterparty Credit Risk
In addition to the derivative transactions with commercial counterparties, IBRD also offers derivative-intermediation
services to borrowing member countries, as well as affiliated and non-affiliated organizations, to help meet their
development needs or to carry out their development mandates.
        Borrowing Member Countries: Currency and interest rate swap transactions are executed between IBRD
         and its borrowers under master derivative agreements. As of September 30, 2014, the notional amounts
         and net fair value exposures under these agreements were $10.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.
         Probable losses inherent in these exposures due to country credit risk are incorporated in the fair value of
         these instruments.
        Affiliated Organizations: Derivative contracts are executed between IBRD and IDA, under an agreement
         allowing IBRD to intermediate derivative contracts on behalf of IDA. As of September 30, 2014, the
         notional amount under this agreement was $11.8 billion and IBRD has no net fair value exposure to IDA.
         Under its derivative agreement with IBRD, IDA is not required to post collateral as long as it maintains
         liquidity holdings at pre-determined levels that are a proxy for an AAA credit rating. As of September 30,
         2014, IDA had not posted any collateral with IBRD.
        Non-Affiliated Organizations: IBRD has a master derivatives agreement with the International Finance
         Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm), under which several transactions have been executed. As of September
         30, 2014, the notional amounts and net fair value exposures under this agreement were $6.5 billion and
         $1.1 billion, respectively. IBRD has the right to call for collateral above an agreed specified threshold. As
         of September 30, 2014, IBRD had not exercised this right, but it reserves the right under the existing terms
         of the agreement. Rather than calling for collateral, IBRD and IFFIm have agreed to manage IBRD’s
         exposure to its derivative transactions with IFFIm by applying a risk management buffer to the gearing
         ratio limit. The gearing ratio limit represents the maximum amount of net financial obligations of IFFIm
         less cash and liquid assets, as a percent of the net present value of IFFIm’s financial assets.
Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA)
IBRD calculates a CVA that represents the fair value of its commercial counterparty credit risk and non-commercial
counterparty credit risks from IFFIm and IDA in connection with derivative-intermediation activities. As credit risk
is an essential component of fair value, IBRD includes a CVA in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty
credit risk. The CVA is a function of exposure, which is calculated by using the fair value of the derivative
contracts, net of collateral received under credit support agreements, and the probability of counterparty default
based on the Credit Default Swaps (CDS) spread and, where applicable, proxy CDS spreads. The CVA on IBRD’s
balance sheet was $29 million as of September 30, 2014, and $34 million as of June 30, 2014.
Interest Rate Risk
Equity Management Framework
Under its current interest rate risk management strategy, IBRD seeks to match the interest rate sensitivity of its
assets (loan and investment trading portfolios) with those of its liabilities (borrowing portfolio) by using derivatives
such as interest rate swaps. These derivatives effectively convert IBRD’s financial assets and liabilities into
variable-rate instruments. This strategy helps manage IBRD’s interest margin on the proportion of loans funded by
debt, against interest rate volatility. The interest revenue on the remaining proportion of loans funded by equity, if
left unmanaged, would be highly sensitive to fluctuations in short-term interest rates. To manage this exposure,
IBRD uses an EMF, which seeks to manage the sensitivity of IBRD’s income from loans funded by equity to
fluctuations in short-term interest rates. In particular, the EMF allows the flexibility of managing the duration of
IBRD’s invested equity within a range of zero to five years based on market and macroeconomic conditions. During
the three months ended September 30, 2014, certain long dated derivatives were liquidated resulting in a decline in
the duration of IBRD’s equity to approximately 2 years compared with approximately 3 years as of June 30, 2014.

V.         Summary of Fair Value Results
Fair Value Adjustments
An important element in achieving IBRD’s financial goals is its ability to minimize the cost of borrowing from
capital markets for lending to member countries by using financial instruments, including derivatives. The fair value
of these financial instruments is affected by changes in the market environment such as interest rates, exchange rates
and credit risk.
Given IBRD’s intention to hold its primary assets and related funding to maturity (in its loan and borrowing
portfolios), Management does not use fair value to reach decisions on income allocation. Rather, fair value is used
mainly to assess the performance of the investment trading portfolio, to monitor the results of the EMF, and to
manage certain market risks, including interest rate and commercial credit risk for derivative counterparties.
IBRD uses derivatives in its loan and borrowing portfolios to arrive at LIBOR-based floating rate instruments, as
part of its risk management strategies. The sensitivity of these portfolios to interest rate movements, after the effect
of derivatives is therefore low, resulting in relatively small unrealized gains/losses in income (Figure 8).
The following tables and figure reflects the sensitivity of IBRD’s fair value income to interest rates, with Table 7
also showing the sensitivity to credit. As shown in Table 7, on a fair value basis, if interest rates increase by one
basis point, IBRD would experience a net unrealized loss of approximately $10 million on its non-trading portfolios
as of September 30, 2014.

Figure 8 below provides a further breakdown of how the use of derivatives affects the overall sensitivity of the loan
and borrowing portfolios. For example, for the borrowing portfolio, a one basis point increase in interest rates would
result in net unrealized gains of $46 million on the bonds. These would be significantly offset by the $41 million of
net unrealized losses on the related swaps, resulting in net unrealized gains of $5 million for the portfolio.

10     IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2014
For the first three months of FY15, IBRD experienced net unrealized losses on a fair value basis of $1,532 million
on its non-trading portfolios. See Table 8 below for details.

In millions of U.S. dollars
For the three months ended September 30,                                                            2014                 2013

a. See Table 11 for reconciliation to the fair value comprehensive basis net income.

Effect of Interest Rates
During the three months ended September 30, 2014, IBRD terminated certain derivatives in the EMF portfolio and
realized net gains of $581 million. The reclassification of these net gains to equity contribution on the statement of
income (Table 1) resulted in net unrealized losses of $723 million. Excluding these net realized gains, there were net
unrealized losses of $142 million, primarily due to the increase in interest rates during the period. As a result of the
termination of the trades, the dollar change in fair value of the EMF portfolio corresponding to a one- basis-point
upward shift in interest rates decreased from $11 million at June 30, 2014, to $8 million at September 30, 2014
(Figure 8).
Effect of Credit
The net unrealized losses on the borrowing and loan portfolios mainly reflect changes in credit. For the first three
months of FY15, IBRD experienced $243 million of unrealized losses on the borrowing portfolio, of which $153
million was due to the tightening of its credit spreads. In addition, IBRD experienced $566 million of unrealized
losses on the loan portfolio, of which $505 million was due to the net widening of CDS spreads for several of its
borrowing member countries during the same period (see the June 30, 2014, MD&A for a detailed discussion on
how the credit risk of each portfolio is managed).
Fair Value Results
As non-financial assets and liabilities are not reflected at fair value, IBRD’s equity is not intended to reflect fair
value. Under the fair value basis, in addition to the instruments in the investment and borrowing portfolios, and all
other derivatives, loans are reported at fair value and all changes in AOCI are also included in fair value net income.
Tables 9 and 10 provide a reconciliation from the reported basis to the fair value basis for both the balance sheet and
income statement.

Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
In addition to the unrealized gains/losses on the non-trading portfolios, IBRD’s fair value net income also reflects
changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). The $613 million decrease in AOCI primarily
relates to net negative currency-translation adjustments resulting from the 7.7% depreciation of the euro against the
U.S. dollar during the period.

18           IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 (UNAUDITED)
NOTES TO CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE A—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES
Basis of Preparation
These unaudited condensed quarterly financial statements should be read in conjunction with the June 30, 2014,
audited financial statements and notes included therein. The condensed comparative information that has been
derived from the June 30, 2014, audited financial statements has not been audited. In the opinion of management,
the condensed quarterly financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of IBRD’s
financial position and results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP).
Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed quarterly financial statements and the
reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in
making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas in which significant estimates have
been made include, but are not limited to, the provision for losses on loans and other exposures, valuation of certain
instruments carried at fair value, and valuation of pension and other postretirement plan-related liabilities. The
results of operations for the first three months of the current fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of results that
may be expected for the full year.
Certain reclassifications of the prior year’s information have been made to conform with the current year’s
presentation. In particular, effective July 1, 2014, derivative assets and liabilities relating to the Loan portfolio,
which were previously included in the line items Borrowing derivative assets, Borrowing derivative liabilities and
Other derivative liabilities on IBRD’s Condensed Balance Sheet, are now shown separately under derivative assets
and derivative liabilities. As a result, Borrowing derivative assets, Borrowing derivative liabilities and Other
derivative liabilities as of June 30, 2014 have decreased by $2,784 million, $4,933 million and $199 million,
respectively. Derivative assets and derivative liabilities relating to loans increased by $2,784 million and $5,132
million, respectively.
Furthermore, for the Condensed Statement of Income, interest, net and unrealized gains and losses associated with
these derivatives, which were previously shown under Borrowings, net are now included under Loans, net. As a
result, for the three months ended September 30, 2013, total revenue decreased by $76 million, with the offset
reported as a decrease in total expenses.
For the Condensed Statement of Cash Flows, the impact of these derivative instruments, which were previously
shown under the Net derivatives-borrowings line item, under financing activities, is now shown as a separate line
item under investing activities. As a result, for the three months ended September 30, 2013, Net derivatives-
borrowings increased by $1 million while Net derivatives-loans decreased by $1 million.
There was no effect on IBRD’s total assets, total liabilities, equity, reported net income or unrestricted cash balances
from these reclassifications.
Accounting and Reporting Developments
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) became law. The Act
seeks to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system by introducing new regulators and extending regulation over
new markets, entities, and activities. The implementation of the Act is dependent on the development of various
rules to clarify and interpret its requirements. As the rules are being developed, IBRD continues to assess the impact
on its business. As of September 30, 2014, IBRD believes that the Act has not had any significant effect on its
business.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The ASU
provides a common framework for revenue recognition for U.S. GAAP, and supersedes most of the existing revenue
recognition guidance in US GAAP. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity recognizes revenue when it
transfers control of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects consideration to which the
entity expects to be entitled. The ASU also requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures to enable
financial statement users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from contracts with customers. For IBRD, the ASU will be effective from the quarter ending September 30, 2017.
IBRD is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Repurchase-to-Maturity
Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures. The ASU requires repurchase-to-maturity transactions and
some repurchase financing arrangements to be accounted for as secured borrowings. It also requires additional
disclosures about certain transactions accounted for as sales and about the nature of collateral pledged for

transactions accounted for as secured borrowings. For IBRD, the ASU will be effective from the quarter ending
March 31, 2015. IBRD is currently evaluating this ASU, but does not expect the ASU to have a significant impact
on its financial statements since all IBRD’s repurchase agreements are already accounted for as secured borrowings.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements (Subtopic 205-40): Going
Concern - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The ASU
provides guidance on management's responsibilities in evaluating the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern
and for the related financial statement disclosures. Until now guidance related to this topic was provided under U.S.
auditing standards, which do not govern management’s disclosures. Under this ASU, each reporting period,
management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. For IBRD,
the ASU will be effective from the quarter ending September 30, 2016. IBRD is currently evaluating the impact of
this ASU.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Summarized below are the techniques applied in determining the fair values of investments.
Investment securities
Where available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of trading securities. Examples include
most government and agency securities, mutual funds, futures contracts, exchange-traded equity securities and ABS.
For instruments for which market quotations are not available, fair values are determined using model-based
valuation techniques, whether internally-generated or vendor-supplied, that include the standard discounted cash
flow method using market observable inputs such as yield curves, credit spreads, and constant prepayment rates.
Where applicable, unobservable inputs such as constant prepayment rates, probability of default and loss severity are
used. Unless quoted prices are available, time deposits are reported at face value which approximates fair value.
Securities purchased under resale agreements, Securities sold under repurchase agreements, and Securities lent
under securities lending agreements
These securities are reported at face value which approximates fair value.

Commercial Credit Risk
For the purpose of risk management, IBRD is party to a variety of financial transactions, certain of which involve
elements of credit risk. Credit risk exposure represents the maximum potential loss due to possible nonperformance
by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the contracts. For all securities, IBRD limits trading to a list of
authorized dealers and counterparties. In addition, IBRD receives collateral in connection with resale agreements as
well as swap agreements. This collateral serves to mitigate IBRD’s exposure to credit risk.
Swap Agreements: Credit risk is mitigated through the application of eligibility criteria and volume limits for
transactions with individual counterparties and through the use of mark-to-market collateral arrangements for swap
transactions. IBRD may require collateral in the form of cash or other approved liquid securities from individual
counterparties in order to mitigate its credit exposure.
IBRD has entered into master derivatives agreements which contain legally enforceable close-out netting provisions.
These agreements may further reduce the gross credit risk exposure related to the swaps. Credit risk with financial
assets subject to a master derivatives arrangement is further reduced under these agreements to the extent that
payments and receipts with the counterparty are netted at settlement. The reduction in exposure as a result of these
netting provisions can vary due to the impact of changes in market conditions on existing and new transactions. The
extent of the reduction in exposure may therefore change substantially within a short period of time following the
balance sheet date. For more information on netting and offsetting provisions see note F-Derivative Instruments.
The following is a summary of the collateral received by IBRD in relation to swap transactions as of September 30,
2014 and June 30, 2014.

As of September 30, 2014, IBRD had received total cash collateral of $3,286 million ($3,234 million—June 30,
2014), of which $2,298 million was invested in highly liquid instruments ($2,114 million—June 30, 2014).
Securities Lending: IBRD may engage in securities lending and repurchases, against adequate collateral, as well as
securities borrowing and reverse repurchases (resales) of government and agency obligations, and corporate and
ABS. These transactions have been conducted under legally enforceable master netting arrangements, which allow
IBRD to reduce its gross credit exposure related to these transactions. For Balance Sheet presentation purposes,
IBRD presents its securities lending and repurchases, as well as resales, on a gross basis. As of September 30, 2014
and June 30, 2014, there were no amounts which could potentially be offset as a result of legally enforceable master
netting arrangements.
Transfers of securities by IBRD to counterparties are not accounted for as sales as the accounting criteria for the
treatment as a sale have not been met. Counterparties are permitted to repledge these securities until the repurchase
date.
The following is a summary of the carrying amount of the securities transferred under repurchase or securities
lending agreements, and the related liabilities:

24        IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 (UNAUDITED)
At September 30, 2014, and June 30, 2014 there were no liabilities relating to securities transferred under repurchase
or securities lending agreements that had not settled at that date.
In the case of resale agreements, IBRD receives collateral in the form of liquid securities and is permitted to
repledge these securities. While these transactions are legally considered to be true purchases and sales, the
securities received are not recorded on IBRD’s Balance Sheet as the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale have
not been met. As of September 30, 2014, securities purchased under resale agreements included $562 million of
securities which had not settled at that date ($2,027 million—June 30, 2014). For the remaining purchases, IBRD
received securities with a fair value of $418 million ($1,069 million—June 30, 2014). None of these securities had
been transferred under repurchase or security lending agreements as of that date (Nil—June 30, 2014).

NOTE D—LOANS AND OTHER EXPOSURES
IBRD’s loans and other exposures (exposures) are generally made to, or guaranteed by, member countries of IBRD.
In addition, IBRD may also make loans to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), an affiliated organization,
without any guarantee. Other exposures include: Deferred Drawdown Options (DDOs), Irrevocable Commitments,
Exposures to member Countries’ Derivatives, and Guarantees. IBRD’s loans are reported at amortized cost, with the
exception of one loan which is carried and reported at fair value, because it contains an embedded derivative.
IBRD uses derivative contracts to manage the currency risk as well as the repricing risk between its loans and
borrowings. For details regarding derivatives used in the loan portfolio, see Note F—Derivative Instruments.
Of the total loans outstanding as of September 30, 2014, 82% were to the Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe
and Central Asia, and East Asia and Pacific regions, combined.
Based on IBRD’s internal credit quality indicators, the majority of loans outstanding are in the medium risk and high
risk classes.
As of September 30, 2014, only 0.30% of IBRD’s loans were in nonaccrual status and were all related to one
borrower. The total provision for losses on accrual and nonaccrual loans accounted for 1.06% of the total loans
portfolio.
Credit Quality of Sovereign Exposures
Based on an evaluation of IBRD’s exposures, management has determined that IBRD has one portfolio segment –
Sovereign Exposures. IBRD’s loans constitute the majority of the Sovereign Exposures portfolio segment.
IBRD’s country risk ratings are an assessment of its borrowers’ ability and willingness to repay IBRD on time and
in full. These ratings are internal credit quality indicators. Individual country risk ratings are derived on the basis of
both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The components considered in the analysis can be grouped broadly into
eight categories: political risk, external debt and liquidity, fiscal policy and public debt burden, balance of payments
risks, economic structure and growth prospects, monetary and exchange rate policy, financial sector risks, and
corporate sector debt and vulnerabilities. For the purpose of analyzing the risk characteristics of IBRD’s exposures,
these exposures are grouped into three classes in accordance with assigned borrower risk ratings which relate to the
likelihood of loss: Low, Medium and High risk classes, as well as exposures in nonaccrual status. IBRD considers
all exposures in nonaccrual status to be impaired.
IBRD’s borrowers’ country risk ratings are key determinants in the provision for losses. Country risk ratings are
determined in review meetings that take place several times a year. All countries are reviewed at least once a year,
or more frequently, if circumstances warrant, to determine the appropriate ratings.
IBRD considers loans to be past due when a borrower fails to make payment on any principal, interest or other
charges due to IBRD on the dates provided in the contractual loan agreement.

Accumulated Provision for Losses on Loans and Other Exposures
Management determines the appropriate level of accumulated provisions for losses, which reflects the probable
losses inherent in IBRD’s exposures. Probable losses comprise estimates of potential losses arising from default and
nonpayment of principal amounts due, as well as present value losses. Delays in receiving loan payments result in
present value losses to IBRD since it does not charge fees or additional interest on any overdue interest or charges.
These present value losses are equal to the difference between the present value of payments of interest and charges,
made according to the related instrument’s contractual terms and the present value of its expected future cash flows.
It is IBRD’s practice not to write off its loans. All contractual obligations associated with exposures in nonaccrual
status have eventually been cleared, thereby allowing borrowers to eventually emerge from nonaccrual status. To
date, no loans have been written off.
Notwithstanding IBRD’s historical experience, the risk of losses associated with nonpayment of principal amounts
due is included in the accumulated provision for losses on loans and other exposures.

Effective July 16, 2013, all loans to, or guaranteed by, Iran were placed into nonaccrual status. The aggregate
principal balance outstanding on these loans at July 16, 2013 was $697 million, of which $79 million was overdue
on that date. Subsequently, on September 27, 2013, Iran cleared all of its overdue principal and charges due to IBRD
and the loans to, or guaranteed by, Iran were restored to accrual status on that date. Interest revenue for the period
ended September 30, 2013, increased by $8 million, $7 million of which represents revenue that would have been
accrued in the previous fiscal year had these loans not been placed in nonaccrual status.

Guarantees
Guarantees of $1,722 million were outstanding at September 30, 2014 ($1,804 million—June 30, 2014). This
amount represents the maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that IBRD could be required to
make under these guarantees, and is not included in the Condensed Balance Sheet. These guarantees have original
maturities ranging between 5 and 20 years, and expire in decreasing amounts through 2029.
At September 30, 2014, liabilities related to IBRD's obligations under guarantees of $56 million ($60 million—June
30, 2014), have been included in Other liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheet. These include the accumulated
provision for guarantee losses of $24 million ($25 million—June 30, 2014).
During the three months ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013, no guarantees provided by IBRD were
called.
Waivers of Loan Charges
IBRD provides waivers on eligible loans, which include a portion of interest on loans, a portion of the commitment
charge on undisbursed balances and a portion of the front-end fee charged on all eligible loans. Waivers are
approved annually by the Executive Directors of IBRD.
The reduction in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013, resulting from
waivers of loan charges is summarized below:

Segment Reporting
Based on an evaluation of IBRD’s operations, management has determined that IBRD has only one reportable
segment since financial results are reviewed, and resource allocation decisions are made, at the entity level.
Loan income comprises interest, commitment fees, loan origination fees and prepayment premia, net of waivers. For
the three months ended September 30, 2014, one country contributed in excess of 10 percent of total loan revenue;
this amounted to $60 million.

Fair Value Disclosures
The only loan carried at fair value is classified as Level 3. This loan has an embedded derivative and its fair value is
estimated on a matrix basis against the related bond. As IBRD’s loans are not traded, the yield which is used as a
key input to determining the fair value of this loan is not observable. The yield applied in determining the fair value
of the loan at September 30, 2014 was 2.8%. An increase (decrease) in the yield would result in a decrease
(increase) in the fair value of the loan.
The following table provides a summary of changes in the fair value of IBRD’s Level 3 loan during the three
months ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013:

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
All IBRD’s loans are made to or guaranteed by, countries that are members of IBRD, except for those loans made to
IFC. IBRD does not currently sell its loans.
As of September 30, 2014 and June 30, 2014, except for one loan which is reported at fair value, all other loans are
carried at amortized cost. The fair value of these loans is calculated using a discounted cash flow method. This
method incorporates Credit Default Swap spreads for each borrower. Basis adjustments are applied to market
recovery levels to reflect IBRD’s recovery experience.

NOTE E—BORROWINGS
IBRD issues unsubordinated and unsecured fixed and variable rate debt in a variety of currencies. Some of these
debt instruments are callable. Variable rates may be based on, for example, exchange rates, interest rates or equity
indices.
Borrowings issued by IBRD are carried and reported at fair value. As of September 30, 2014, 98% of the
instruments in the portfolio were classified as Level 2, within the fair value hierarchy.
IBRD uses derivative contracts to manage the currency risk as well as the repricing risk between its loans and
borrowings. For details regarding the derivatives used in the borrowing portfolio, see Note F—Derivative
Instruments.

During the three months ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013, IBRD’s credit spreads remained
largely unchanged.
IBRD’s Level 3 borrowings primarily relate to structured bonds. The fair value of these bonds is estimated using
valuation models that incorporate model parameters, observable market inputs, and unobservable inputs. The
significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of structured bonds are correlations and long-
dated interest rate volatilities. Generally, the movements in correlations are considered to be independent from the
movements in long-dated interest rate volatilities.
Correlation is the statistical measurement of the relationship between two variables. For contracts where the holder
benefits from the convergence of the underlying index prices (e.g. interest rates and foreign exchange rates), an
increase in correlation generally results in an increase in the fair value of the instrument. The magnitude and
direction of the fair value adjustment will depend on whether the holder is short or long the option.
Interest rate volatility is the extent to which the level of interest rates change over time. For purchased options, an
increase in volatility will generally result in an increase in the fair value. In general, the volatility used to price the
option depends on the maturity of the underlying instrument and the option strike price. For IBRD, interest rate
volatilities are considered an unobservable input for maturities greater than ten years for certain currencies.
The following table provides a summary of the valuation technique applied in determining fair values of these Level
3 instruments and quantitative information regarding the significant unobservable inputs used.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Techniques applied in determining the fair values of debt instruments are summarized as follows:
Discount notes and vanilla bonds
Discount notes and vanilla bonds are valued using the standard discounted cash flow method which relies on market
observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads and funding spreads, where available,
quoted marked prices are used to determine the fair value of short-term notes.
Structured bonds
Structured bonds issued by IBRD have coupon or repayment terms linked to the level or the performance of interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, equity indices or commodities. The fair value of the structured bonds is derived using
the discounted cash flow method based on estimated future pay-offs determined by applicable models and
computation of embedded optionality such as caps, floors and calls. A wide range of industry standard models such
as one factor Hull-White, LIBOR Market Model and Black-Scholes are used depending on the specific structure.
These models incorporate market observable inputs, such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads,
funding spreads, interest rates volatilities, equity index volatilities and equity indices. Where applicable, the models
also incorporate significant unobservable inputs such as correlations and long-dated interest rate volatilities.

               IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 (UNAUDITED)                                 33
IBRD is not required to post collateral under its derivative agreements as long as it maintains a AAA credit rating.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that are in a liability
position on September 30, 2014 is $2,346 million ($1,216 million—June 30, 2014). IBRD has not posted any
collateral with these counterparties due to its AAA credit rating.
If the credit-risk related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered to the extent that IBRD
would be required to post collateral on September 30, 2014, the amount of collateral that would need to be posted
would be $684 million ($164 million—June 30, 2014). Subsequent triggers of contingent features would require
posting of additional collateral, up to a maximum of $2,346 million ($1,216 million—June 30, 2014). In contrast,
IBRD received collateral totaling $5,026 million as of September 30, 2014 ($6,019 million—June 30, 2014), in
relation to swap transactions (see Note C—Investments).
The following table provides information on the location and amount of gains and losses on the non-trading
derivatives during the three months ended September 30, 2014, and September 30, 2013, and their location on the

Offsetting assets and liabilities
IBRD enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements with
substantially all of its derivative counterparties. These legally enforceable master netting agreements give IBRD the
right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty, in
the event of default by the counterparty.
The presentation of derivative instruments is consistent with the manner in which these instruments are settled.
Interest rate swaps are settled on a net basis, while currency swaps are settled on a gross basis.

Transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 are due to increased price transparency.
The fair value of IBRD’s Level 3 borrowings related derivatives is estimated using valuation models that
incorporate model parameters, observable market inputs and unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable
inputs used in the fair value measurement of these derivatives are correlations and long dated interest rate
volatilities. See Note E – Borrowings for details on these unobservable inputs.
The following table provides a summary of the valuation technique applied in determining fair values of these Level
3 instruments and quantitative information regarding the significant unobservable inputs used.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Derivative contracts include currency forward contracts, TBAs, currency swaps and interest rate swaps. Currency
swaps and interest rate swaps are either plain vanilla or structured. Currency forward contracts and plain vanilla
currency and interest rate swaps are valued using the standard discounted cash flow methods using market
observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads and funding spreads. For structured
currency and interest rate swaps, which primarily consist of callable swaps linked to interest rates, foreign exchange
rates, and equity indices, valuation models and inputs similar to the ones applicable to structured bonds valuation are
used. Where applicable, the models also incorporate significant unobservable inputs such as correlations and long-
dated interest rate volatilities. 

NOTE G—RETAINED EARNINGS, ALLOCATIONS AND TRANSFERS
IBRD makes net income allocation decisions on the basis of reported net income, adjusted to exclude the unrealized
gains and losses on non-trading portfolios, net, restricted income and Board of Governors-approved transfers, and
after considering the allocation to the pension reserve.
On August 7, 2014, IBRD’s Executive Directors approved the following allocations relating to the net income
earned in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, a reduction in the Pension Reserve by $43 million and an increase in
Restricted Retained Earnings by $2 million.
Subsequent event: On October 10, 2014, IBRD’s Board of Governors approved the following allocations relating to
the net income earned in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014: an immediate transfer to IDA of $635 million and
$134 million to Surplus. The Board of Governors also approved a transfer of $15 million to the Global Infrastructure
Facility from Surplus, by way of grant. The transfer to IDA was made on October 14, 2014.
Retained earnings comprise the following components at September 30, 2014 and June 30, 2014:

NOTE H—PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
IBRD, IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) participate in a defined benefit Staff
Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) and PEBP that cover substantially all of their staff
members.
All costs, assets and liabilities associated with these pension plans are allocated between IBRD, IFC and MIGA
based upon their employees’ respective participation in the plans. Costs allocated to IBRD are then shared between
IBRD and IDA based on an agreed cost sharing ratio. The net periodic pension cost (credit) for the SRP, RSBP and
PEBP is included in Administrative expenses, in the Condensed Statement of Income.

Loans
IBRD has a Local Currency Loan Facility Agreement with IFC which is capped at $300 million. At September 30,
2014, the loan balance under this facility amounted to $25 million ($25 million—June 30, 2014) and carried a fixed
interest rate of 3.96% and weighted average maturity of 1.5 years. This loan is not eligible for interest waivers.
In addition, on July 5, 2012, the Board of executive Directors approved for IBRD to lend up to $197 million to IFC.
This loan is at LIBOR less 25 basis points (0.07% as of September 30, 2014) and is not eligible for interest waivers.
At September 30, 2014, the balance of this loan was $196 million ($196 million—June 30, 2014).
During FY 2014, IBRD entered into an exposure exchange agreement with MIGA under which IBRD and MIGA
agreed to exchange $120 million each of notional amount of exposures on their respective balance sheets with one
another. Under the agreement, MIGA provided a guarantee on one of IBRD's loan principal and interest exposures
in exchange for IBRD's guarantee of principal and interest exposure of MIGA under its Non-Honoring of Sovereign
Financial Obligation. As of September 30, 2014, liabilities related to IBRD’s obligation under this agreement
amounted to $3 million. These include an accumulated provision for guarantee losses of less than $1 million.
Administrative Services
Expenses jointly incurred by IBRD and IDA are allocated based on an agreed cost sharing ratio, and amounts are
settled quarterly. For the three months ended September 30, 2014, IBRD’s administrative expenses are net of the
share of expenses allocated to IDA of $374 million ($376 million—three months ended September 30, 2013).
At September 30, 2014 and June 30, 2014, the amount receivable for administrative services was net of IDA’s share
of investments associated with PCRF.
Other Revenue
Revenue jointly earned by IBRD and IDA is allocated based on the same agreed cost sharing ratio that is used to
allocate administrative expenses. Amounts are settled quarterly. For the three months ended September 30, 2014,
IBRD’s other revenue is net of revenue allocated to IDA of $45 million ($48 million—three months ended
September 30, 2013).
For the three months ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013, the amount of fee revenue associated with
