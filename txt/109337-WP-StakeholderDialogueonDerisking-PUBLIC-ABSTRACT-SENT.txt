to adequately apply AML/CFT rules.

    Suggested Recommendations
    •• Proactive interaction should take place between regulators and correspondent banks about risks arising
       from correspondent banking relationships in some cases before the relationship commences. Sharing of
       specific risk-related information with (prospective) respondent banks should be encouraged;
    •• Regulators/supervisors should seek to provide greater clarity and consistency concerning regulatory
       expectations. Specific issues mentioned include the conditions under which it would be required to conduct due
       diligence on the client of a respondent bank (so called “know your customer’s customer”);
    •• Regulators/supervisors should provide guidance and engage with financial institutions in addressing problems
       before resorting to enforcement action/fines;
    •• Regulators/supervisors should be more transparent on how they will deal with infringements in order to provide
       more predictability. They should publish their methodology and conditions for sanctioning – e.g. the criteria
       they use to determine a sanction. The regulator/ supervisor should publish specific examples of infringements
       and how they were be dealt with. Regulators should provide periodic updates to regulations based on handled
       cases;
    •• From the respondent side, regulators/supervisors should do more to provide information on what their
       jurisdictions are doing on the identification and mitigation of AML/CFT risks and more generally on the
       functioning of their AML/CFT system;
    •• The regulator/supervisor should encourage the use of customer due-diligence utilities/platforms by banks that
       would lower due-diligence costs by allowing for the sharing of customer data among a wider group of banks
       and thereby facilitate access to financial services;
    •• Correspondent banks should use regulator-approved digitization and data analytics for customer due diligence
       of respondent banks;
    •• Internationally, regulators/supervisors should cooperate to ensure harmonization of regulations to facilitate
       global compliance;
    •• In order to further these recommendations, stakeholders should support the creation of a research project, which
       would be undertaken by a neutral party, to develop a clear set of regulations/guidance, plus an accompanying
       methodology for examination, supervision, and enforcement of those regulations/guidance, that was practicable
       at the bank level and that could be endorsed by a broad range of bank regulatory/supervisory agencies.

4                                  STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE ON DE-RISKING: FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
 Suggested recommendations
 •• It is important that there is a personalized relationship between the respondent and the correspondent
    bank and to ensure there is a direct line of communication between compliance departments in both
    banks. In that communication, banks should focus on the risk profile of the clients rather than exclusively
    on the process/controls of the respondent bank;
 •• Where low volumes are an impediment to the establishment of a correspondent banking relationship,
    respondent banks in a jurisdiction should seek to consolidate their relationship through one bank to
    increase attractiveness. This may be a factor for regulators to consider in encouraging the consolidation
    of the banking sector within their local jurisdictions;
   •• There may be a role for regional development banks here to facilitate through guidance and technical
      assistance, the consolidation of institutions, transactions, and information in the regional financial
      services sector;
   •• Regional or national banking associations could play a role in establishing principles on correspondent
      banking;
 •• Regulators should issue a standard framework or guideline to decrease uncertainty about the treatment
    of detected failings in (the establishment of) correspondent banking relationships;
 •• Although ex-ante and more proactive information sharing to avoid termination was preferred, in the case
    of termination, correspondent banks should be transparent in their reasons for terminating a relationship
    to allow respondent banks to improve their systems. Correspondent banks should share with respondent
    banks the information on transactions they find concerning so that respondent can assess their risk
    assessment and strengthen their risk assessment;
 •• Correspondent banking should be considered a public good and therefore public funds/powers should be
    brought to bear on ensuring their viability;
   •• Banks that make a profit out of helping governments to raise funds should be asked, in return, to play
      a role in ensuring the establishment/maintenance of correspondent banking relationships;
   •• Governments should provide an indemnity/guarantees to banks establishing a correspondent
      relationship when they are able to show a sufficient degree of due diligence. This way sufficient
      transparency on transactions through their banking sector is maintained;
   •• Banks should be given credit, as under the US Community Reinvestment Act, to encourage them to
      take on correspondents in high-risk regions;
   •• Further work should be undertaken to identify and quantify the negative effects on the economies of
      smaller jurisdictions (trade finance and remittance dependent individuals/families) to strengthen the
      case for public intervention/concern;
 •• Correspondent banks should, more purposefully, seek to implement processes to identify and, where
    possible, measure the correlation between social impact (both direct and indirect) and long-term
    business development, and give this factor sufficient consideration when conducting organizational
    strategic planning. It is argued that such an approach would encourage correspondent banking and
    create mutual benefits for the correspondent bank, respondent bank and wider customer base, through
    positive impacts on profitability, customer loyalty, and financial services accessibility;
 •• Insurance for AML/CFT related regulatory enforcement penalties should be considered and implemented
    at the regional and/or national levels;
 •• The establishment of a KYC utility to allow correspondent banks to have timely access to relevant
    information on potential respondent banks would potentially significantly reduce the costs of establishing
    correspondent banking relationships. The idea would be to establish a centralized data warehouse and
    processing center that would hold all customer information from all member banks in a country/region




STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE ON DE-RISKING: FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS                                                  5
      and would serve as a central point for confirming adherence to KYC standards and sanctioning money
      transfer processing. It would operate a bit like a credit bureau where basic customer data and scoring
      algorithms are held centrally and ratings are provided to subscribers or paying customers. This could
      have the advantage of greater independence, security and credibility, coupled with better technology, and
      could insulate global banks from taking direct risk on smaller, harder to assess, higher risk respondent
      banks in higher risk jurisdictions. The advantage would be that the utility could guarantee that senders
      and users of funds in the local market met all KYC requirements. Block-chain technology would also
      improve the quality/reliability of available information. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
      Telecommunication (SWIFT) or the IFC may play a role in establishing these utilities. An official sanctioning
      of the utility would give it extra value – although chances of that were acknowledged to be slim;
    •• Governments and/or the private sector should also consider a centralized utility for transaction monitoring
       to help defray the significant cost associated with transaction monitoring. The cost of monitoring alone
       has been sufficient to prompt terminations of relationships;
    •• Governments/international organizations should consider the establishment of “white-lists”, identifying
       respondent banks that are considered to meet requisite standards in their internal controls and
       client basis, thereby facilitating the establishment of correspondent banking relationships with these
       respondent entities;
    •• Respondent banks could be subject to an independent and transparent evaluation to be made by a
       reputable audit firm to ascertain the existence and effectiveness of their AML/CFT internal system.
       An ISO-like “certification” process could also be envisaged to add credibility, by demonstrating that
       respondent banks’ AML/CFT systems meets international standards. This could increase level of trust of
       correspondent banks. A certificate is easier to display than an inspection report;
    •• Attempts should be made to disaggregate risk assessments/differentiate risk at the entity level, to avoid
       lower risk entities in higher risk jurisdictions being classified as high risk merely on the basis of their
       geography;
    •• Respondent banks could sue correspondent banks for severing relationships based on discrimination
       provisions – along the lines of rules that already exist for community banking in the US;
    •• To enable support respondent bank relationships with correspondents, permanent platforms for dialogue
       between local regulators and their OECD counterparts should be established;
    •• Correspondent banks should agree on a common questionnaire in terms of addressing common
       unknowns.

      Suggested Recommendations
      •• Safe-haven provisions should be granted to financial institutions that bank charities in good faith;
      •• Financial institutions should be transparent and provide retail customers such as NPOs and MSBs with
         reasons for terminating accounts, and opportunities to address issues of concern before closing accounts;
      •• Charities should be subjected to a vetting process to ensure they meet high standards for transparency.
         Regulators should support a standard audit scope and issue consistent guidelines to provide clarity and
         lower compliance costs, facilitating risk differentiation, and allowing for different treatment of individual
         NPOs;
      •• The establishment of a utility (possibly from the IRS) that conducts (some of the) due diligence on non-
         US NPO’s should be explored. Some form of repository of NPOs’ information could facilitate banks
         processing of funds and assist charities in due diligence obligations;
      •• White lists should be considered for vetted NPOs to facilitate the provision of financial services to those
         entities;
      •• Public entities (possibly central banks or regional development banks) should step in to facilitate the
         movement of funds, even on an emergency basis, from reputable NGOs that have lost their banking
         relationship;
      •• The “particularly vulnerable” language in the Interpretative Note to FATF Recommendation 8 should be
         removed4. International and national policymakers should avoid similar language in the future and should
         avoid over-stating the risk associated with NPOs;
      •• A study should be commissioned to provide a deeper analytic base to analyze the challenges confronting
         NPOs and to provide options for next steps5;
      •• A separate discussion or workshop focused more explicitly of bank de-risking on NPOs should be
         organized;
      •• A safe haven for banks and bank representatives that meet certain criteria when dealing with NPO
         clients should be granted.

    Suggested Recommendations
    •• Some form of KYC utility should be introduced at the MSB level to facilitate gathering relevant information
       on each MSB, including regulatory information. Respondents and correspondents should have access to
       this utility;
    •• The following issues should be included in the utility:
      •• Does the MSB have a solid compliance program in place?
      •• Does the MSB conduct internal monitoring and independent reviews based on its risk?
      •• Are the MSB licenses and registrations current?
      •• How many types of services does the MSB provide?
      •• Does the MSB conduct cross-border transactions?
      •• Are the primary services provided conducted in an agent relationship with a large MSB (i.e., Western
         Union, Money Gram, etc.)?
      •• Does the MSB have limits in place when conducting its services?
      •• What is the track record and experience of the MSB?
      •• Is the MSB offering services in a High Intensity Financial Crime Area (HIFCA) or High Intensity Drug
         Trafficking Area (HIDTA)?
      •• Does the MSB have subagents?
    •• Regulatory standards for MSBs should be harmonized across the US states to facilitate compliance and
       thus bring down costs. This would also provide a measurable framework of regulations that all interested
       parties (MSBs, state and federal regulators and financial institutions) could easily audit and monitor MSB
       compliance to the regulations, thereby minimizing actual risk as well as perceived risk;
    •• All jurisdictions/regulators should be able to show that they are comprehensively regulating MSBs and be
       public about their regulatory activity in order to provide a degree of comfort to foreign banks/regulators.

  Suggested Recommendations
  •• As neutral parties, without a direct stake, international organizations should play a role in fostering
     dialogue and bringing parties together. They should act as an honest broker in facilitating understanding
     and establishing trust between correspondent and respondent banks and/or their regulators, financial
     institutions, and their customers working in higher risk jurisdictions, and regulators and the private sector
     (banks, NPOs, and MSBs);
  •• By assisting countries in improving their AML regime or the supervision and regulation of the financial
     sector, international organizations/technical assistance providers should help address (correspondent
     banks’) concerns about the AML/supervisory regime in a particular country;
  •• •	    Also as providers of technical assistance, they should communicate the efforts that specific
     countries are taking to improve their AML and general financial supervisory regime;
  •• To increase attractiveness of correspondent banking, international (prudential) standard setters should
     seek to effect a relaxation of the international rules (BCBS) on the liquidity coverage ratio;
  •• FATF should seek to clarify regulatory expectations on the degree and intensity of due diligence to be
     conducted by a correspondent bank – and whether, and if so under what circumstances, due diligence
     should be exercised on the clients of the respondent bank;
  •• FATF should continue to monitor implementation of its revised recommendations to ensure that outdated
     perceptions of high-risk groups reflects current assessments;

  •• International organizations should extend guarantees to cover smaller banks in emerging markets and
     act as guarantors for a select set of client banks that meet their standards. Those (local/respondent) banks
     would pay for this service;
  •• International organizations should play a role in the establishment of new utilities and other forms of
     relevant information, as well as “white lists” of entities;
  •• In furtherance of their public function, international organizations should establish a regulated US bank
     that can act as a US correspondent for emerging market banks and join the global payment system as a
     participating US clearing bank. This would enable the direct provision of correspondent accounts to banks,
     improving inclusion of banks that were sound and well run, but too small to be cost effectively served by
