Our Climate
The World Bank strives to be a leader in climate action with its
comprehensive program to measure, reduce, offset, and report
greenhouse gas emissions from Bank facilities and corporate
activities. Its Washington, DC-based buildings and travel have
been carbon-neutral since 2007. On the global corporate level,
facilities and travel achieved carbon-neutrality in 2009.

Our Mission
The World Bank, one of the world’s largest sources of funding
and knowledge for developing countries, is committed to
eliminating extreme poverty, increasing shared prosperity, and
promoting sustainable development. Not a bank in the ordinary
sense but a unique partnership to reduce poverty and support
development, the World Bank comprises two of five institutions.
