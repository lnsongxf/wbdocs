1. INTRODUCTION




              3
       This report was developed to introduce Japanese disaster simulation drills as a model to
       help other countries plan and implement disaster simulation drill exercises.
       The main objectives of this guideline are to:

       1.	Provide an overview of the institutional and legislative frameworks for Disaster
          Management which underpin the organization of disaster simulation drills in Japan;

       2.	Introduce disaster simulation drills conducted by various national and community
          level organizations, such as: the government, schools, non-governmental organiza-
          tions (NGOs), and the private sector; and,

       3.	Introduce other tools for raising residents’ disaster awareness and preparedness.	



       Rather than provide a manual for planning a simulation drill, this report aims to introduce a menu of
       possible activities. The target audience of the report includes: national Disaster Risk Management (DRM)
       agencies, local governments, utility corporations, and NGO/Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) which plan
       to organize disaster simulation drills.


       This report consists of four parts: Introduction (Chapter 1, 2, 3), Simulation drills (Chapter 4, 5, 6, 7),
       Community based activities for disaster awareness and risk communication (Chapter 8, 9), and Conclu-
       sion (Chapter 10). The introduction (Chapter 1) starts with an overview of the institutional and legislative
       frameworks for Disaster Management in Japan (Chapter 2), followed by an overview of disaster simulation
       drills in Japan, particularly focusing on the Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill Framework, which
       is an overarching framework for both national and local governments (Chapter 3). The following four
       chapters present examples of simulation drills organized at the national and regional level, including the
       National Scope (Chapter 4), and overviews of three prefectures: Hyogo (Chapter 5), Shizuoka (Chapter
       6) and Tokyo (Chapter 7). The next part of the report introduces a number of community level activities
       aimed at increasing residents’ disaster awareness and preparedness. These activities are led by various
       actors, including: a school, an NGO/CSO, and a learning center (Chapter 8). Risk communication activities
       in Kobe city are introduced (Chapter 9). Finally, the conclusion (Chapter 10) outlines common challenges
       and offers tips for the planning and implementation of disaster drills in addition to other disaster aware-
       ness/preparedness activities.

2.1. Background

       Large-scale natural disasters are a frequent and common occurrence in Japan (Figure 1).
       Over the years, Japan has evolved its disaster management system to address all phases of
       a disaster: from disaster prevention, mitigation, and preparedness, to emergency response,
       recovery, and rehabilitation. The system clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of
       national and local government agencies while also enlisting the cooperation of relevant
       stakeholders in both the public and private sector. To achieve such a robust disaster risk
       management system, Japan continually assesses the capacity of its related systems in order
       to better prepare and react to anticipated large-scale disasters.

2.2. The Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act
       In the 1940s and 1950s, Japan was repeatedly ravaged by typhoons and earthquakes. In particular, the
       1959 Ise-wan Typhoon caused tremendous damage, leaving 5,098 people either dead or missing. Two
       years later, in 1961, the Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act was passed, which established the following:


       •	   A Central Disaster Management Council to formulate the national policy for Disaster Management.
            The Council was created to function as the national coordinating body for Disaster Management. The
            Council is chaired by the Prime Minister, and comprises the entire Cabinet including the Minister of
            State for Disaster Management, heads of designated public institutions (such as the Bank of Japan,
            the Japanese Red Cross, and companies in public broadcasting and telecommunications), as well as
            experts including representatives from academia.1

6 — Overview of the Institutional and Legislative Frameworks for Disaster Management in Japan
•	     Clearly defines roles and responsibilities related to disaster reduction at the national, prefectural,
       and municipal government levels, as well as the civil society level, including community organiza-
       tions and citizens. This requires the three levels of government to draw up master disaster man-
       agement plans. Additionally, all relevant ministries and semipublic organizations prepare disaster
       management plans for their sectors.


•	     A report is submitted annually by the Cabinet which defines the status of disaster management to the
       National Diet (or the parliament) and specifies their budgetary allocations for disaster management
       programs. The National Diet then forms special committees for Disaster Management in the House
       of Representatives and the House of Councilors, which continue to monitor governmental disaster
       management initiatives.


The Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act is continuously reviewed and revised based on lessons learned
from large-scale natural disasters, as shown in Figure 2.

       The Cabinet Office serves as the secretariat for the Council. The Minister of State for Disaster Management,
       who is assisted by Cabinet Office staff, has a mandate to oversee the planning and implementation of
       basic national disaster management policies as well as the central coordination of large-scale disaster
       countermeasures. In the face of disaster, the Minister of State is responsible for information gathering to
       understand the situation of the disaster and the disaster emergency measures required.

2.4. The Basic Disaster Management Plan

    The Basic Disaster Management Plan underpins all disaster management activities in Japan. It is prepared
    by the Central Disaster Management Council in accordance with the Disaster Countermeasures Basic
    Act. The plan clarifies the duties of the central government, public corporations, and local governments
    with regard to implementing measures. The plan also describes the sequence of countermeasures (i.e.
    preparation, emergency response, recovery, and reconstruction) for various types of disasters. The
    Central Disaster Management Council revises the Basic Disaster Management Plan as necessary based on
    the latest circumstances.

       is the technical committee that prepared a report to document facts and findings from the Great East
       Japan Earthquake (GEJE) experience. In response to this report, the Japanese government amended the
       Basic Disaster Management Plan on December 27, 2011, with an aim to enhance its multi-hazard counter-
       measures. As a result, a new chapter was added to the Basic Disaster Management Plan on Tsunami
       Disaster Countermeasures.

2.5. Local Disaster Management Plans

    Local Disaster Management Plans are formulated by prefectural and municipal disaster management
    councils based on the Basic Disaster Management Plan. The Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act
    mentions the importance of the role played by municipalities, as they are responsible for establishing
    local disaster management plans, conducting emergency operations, activating warning systems, issuing
    evacuation recommendations and orders, fighting floods, and conducting relief activities. In cases where
    a municipality is so widely and heavily devastated that it cannot carry out many of its primary roles, the
    prefectural government shall issue evacuation recommendations and orders instead of the municipality.


    Local disaster management plans provide the following:
    •	   Specification of the roles of government organizations, designated public corporations (such as
         public utilities and the Red Cross), and other relevant public organizations
    •	   Plans by category of activity, including: development or improvement of disaster management
         facilities, investigation and research, education, drills and other preventive measures, collection and
         dissemination of information, issuance and dissemination of forecasts and warnings, evacuation, fire
         fighting, flood fighting, rescue, hygiene management, and other emergency measures and rehabilita-
         tion efforts
    •	   Plans for coordination, stockpiling, procurement, distribution, communication, facilities manage-
         ment, equipment, materials, funding, shipping of food and supplies, and so on


    When a Prefectural Disaster Management Council wishes to formulate or revise a local disaster manage-
    ment plan for the prefecture, the Council is required to consult the Prime Minister in advance, who in
    turn shall consult the Central Disaster Management Council. When the Prefectural Disaster Management
    Council has formulated or revised its Local Prefectural Disaster Management Plan, the Council is required
    to release and disseminate a summary of the plan or revision to the public.

3.1. Background

       In theory, in the event of a natural disaster, the national government, prefectural and local governments,
       public agencies and other institutions work in cooperation with residents to effectively respond to the
       disaster. For this to happen in practice, all actors involved in disaster management are expected to
       collaboratively conduct disaster management drills on a regular basis. The Disaster Countermeasure
       Basic Act, the Basic Disaster Management Plan, and other regulations provide the framework for different
       governmental organizations to organize and implement disaster drills.
       The first Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill Framework was established after the Great Han-
       shin-Awaji Earthquake in 1995. Every year since, the Japanese government prepares an updated version
       of the Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill Framework (See Appendix-2), under the auspices of the
       Central Disaster Management Council, in order to update the basic policies governing disaster response
       drills. The drills are then conducted at the national and local government level (See Appendix-3 for List of
       Activities for the Disaster Simulation Drills (National and Prefectural) and Appendix-4 for Disaster Simulation
       Drills at Community Level). Ultimately, the goal of the Framework is to guide the comprehensive and system-
       atic execution of disaster response drills while linking disaster management entities with one another.



3.2. The Laws and Regulations for Coordinating
     Disaster Simulation Drills Background

       On March 31, 2015, the Central Disaster Management Council established the following articles regarding
       the Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill Framework for 2015:
       1. A statement of purpose for the Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill Framework
       2. The purpose of the drills (expanded below with more detail)
       3. Basic policies for implementing disaster simulation drills
       4. List of disaster simulation drills conducted at the national and regional level
       5. Guidelines for disaster simulation drills conducted by local governments
       6. Evaluation principles for disaster simulation drills by the national government
       7. Procedures for revising the Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill Framework


       The purpose of the disaster simulation drill, discussed above in article 2, are as follows:
       1.	 To confirm, evaluate and examine the effectiveness of the organizational systems of disaster manage-
            ment organizations;
       2.	 To confirm appropriate roles held and shared by various disaster management organizations, to
            ensure that they collaborate with one another, and to promote and reinforce collaboration during
            ordinary/non-emergency times;
       3.	 To identify vulnerabilities and challenges in existing disaster management plans with the intent of
            continually improvement;
       4.	 To raise awareness of the importance of disaster management and to improve local residents’ knowl-
            edge of relevant topics;
       5.	 To give disaster management representatives an opportunity to validate their daily disaster management
            efforts and to provide an opportunity to evaluate those efforts for possible improvement.

       In addition to laying out basic policies governing disaster response drills held by
       both national and local governments, the Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill
       Framework also provides a list of drills carried out by different governmental agencies
       at the national and regional level. The drills listed in the 2015 Comprehensive Disaster
       Management Drill Framework are below (See Appendix-2) :

4.1. Planning

       To explain the different steps of conducting simulation drills, this report focuses on typical examples of
       the following drills: the Disaster Simulation Drill, held annually on September 1 (“Disaster Preparedness
       Day”), and the Disaster Simulation tabletop drill, held biannually by the government. Both drills are
       primarily organized by the Cabinet Office of Japan and are explained in more detail above, under Earth-
       quake and Tsunami Drills in Table 1, and below.


       A. “Disaster Preparedness Day” Simulation Drill
       Annually, the Cabinet Office creates a plan and schedule based on the Comprehensive Disaster Manage-
       ment Drill Framework and suggests a disaster scenario in consultation with relevant organizations.


       B. Tabletop drills
       Annually, the Cabinet Office creates a plan and schedule based on the Comprehensive Disaster Manage-
       ment Drill Framework and suggests a disaster scenario in consultation with relevant organizations.




18 — Disaster Simulation Drills: National Scope
4.2. Preparation

    A. “Disaster Preparedness Day” Simulation Drill
    The Cabinet Office, other relevant ministries and responsible departments in local governments imple-
    ment the Nine City and Prefecture Joint Disaster Simulation Drill 6. They prepare and conduct the drills
    on the same day, after coordination and collaboration are made with the relevant organizations. The
    purpose of the disaster simulation drills is to confirm and verify the effectiveness of emergency measures
    by disaster-management-related organizations during a disaster, and to enhance disaster management
    awareness among residents.


    B. Tabletop Drills
    Led by the Cabinet Office, relevant ministries and local governments invite local government officials to
    participate in the drill, as shown below in Table 2. The purpose of the tabletop drill is to help all relevant
    personnel improve their disaster management capacity.



4.3. Execution

    A. “Disaster Preparedness Day” Simulation Drill
    In September 1, 2015, the Prime Minister and all the cabinet members participated in the Disaster Simulation
    Drill on “Disaster Preparedness Day.” It was held in concert with the joint disaster drill held by nine cities
    and prefectures around the Kanto area. The Disaster Simulation Drill presumed the occurrence of a Tokyo
    Inland Earthquake. Figure 6 outlines the scenario of the presumed disaster and the emergency conditions
    under which the drill was implemented. See Figure 7 for a detailed program of the Disaster Simulation Drill.

    6 Since 1980, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has held a regional-area joint drill called the Nine City and Prefecture

    Joint Disaster Simulation Drill in cooperation with municipalities in the Kanto area. The drill executed on September 1, 2015
    was the 35th drill in this series. The prefectures of Chiba, Saitama, and Kanagawa, and the cities of Yokohama, Kawasaki,
    Chiba, Saitama, and Sagamihara, as well as Tokyo, participated. The supervising municipality for this Joint Drill is elected
    each year. In 2015, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government was the supervising authority.

B. Tabletop Drills
In FY 2015, led by the Cabinet Office, two Tabletop Drills were conducted at a central government
building. The first table top drill presumed a Tokyo inland earthquake. The second table top drill
presumed a Nankai Trough earthquake. Disaster simulation drills have two key purposes: to assess
the effectiveness of emergency measures conducted by disaster-management-related organizations
during a disaster and to make the nation generally aware of relevant issues. That said, tabletop drills
are based on details from actual disasters and are realistically presented. They are intended to help
all relevant personnel improve their disaster management abilities.


There are two types of participants in the central government’s tabletop drill: Controllers, the staff
who oversee the drill and know the scenario, and Players, the staff who participate in the drill and do
not know the scenario. The Players ask the Controllers for information and updates on local condi-
tions so that they may make appropriate decisions and issue instructions.


The outlines of the two drills implemented in FY 2015 are shown in Table 2.

5.1. The 1995 Hanshin Awaji Earthquake

       The Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake of 1995 has had a great impact on Hyogo
       Prefecture’s disaster management system, particularly its disaster simulation drills.
       The Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake struck in the early morning, at 5:46 AM on January
       17, 1995, killing more than 6,400 people. Hyogo Prefecture, where the city of Kobe
       is located, was the most impacted area. There was extensive damage to buildings,
       railways, roads and to water, electricity and gas lines. Going forward, the delayed
       recovery of lifelines and problems with the operation of shelters, for people who had
       lost their homes, became important recovery issues.

       The Great Hansin Awaji Earthquake spurred a reevaluation of disaster management in Japan. As such,
       the recovery of lifelines is now recognized as one of the most important countermeasures after a disaster
       occurs. Accordingly, existing laws and regulations related to disaster management were reexamined.

26 — Overview of Disaster Simulation Drills: The Case of Hyogo Prefecture
5.2. Hyogo Prefecture’s Disaster Simulation Drills

     Hyogo Prefecture holds a disaster simulation drill every year, within the prefecture. Hyogo also holds a
     joint disaster simulation drill with various prefectures (typically seven, including: Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo,
     Nara, Mie, Shiga, and Wakayama) in the Kansai region, south of Japan’s main land, in collaboration with
     prefectures adjacent to the Kansai region. The joint Kansai disaster simulation drill aims to find ways to
     conduct recovery efforts appropriately if a large-scale disaster occurs.


     This chapter will discuss the main activities of the Kansai regional joint disaster preparedness program,
     namely: the Kansai regional execution drill and its associated tabletop drill, as these are excellent
     examples of disaster simulation drills in Japan.



5.3. The Laws and Regulations For Coordinating
     The Disaster Simulation Drill

     The Kansai prefectures' joint disaster simulation drill is regulated by the Disaster Countermeasures Basic
     Act, Fire Service Act, local disaster management plan, and a basic agreement among the nine prefectures
     in the Kansai region to provide mutual support when a crisis occurs.


     The participants of the drill include: emergency fire support teams, police forces, the self-defense forces,
     as well as organizations, bodies and companies doing disaster management related work. The drill aims
     to foster a regional support system with the primary objectives being: to improve mutual interactions and
     enhance shared response capacities across the region.

5.4.1. Planning
The prefectural governments that accept involvement in the drill take leadership roles in planning it. They
create scenarios, make schedules and plans for the entire program which they disseminate among the
participating prefectures in the Kansai region. The shared information is then closely reviewed through
multiple meetings and the final plan for drill is determined.



5.4.2. Preparation
In addition to creating the plan, the participating prefectural governments consult with related organiza-
tions, confirm the equipment and materials needed, and give instructions to participating organizations.



5.4.3. Execution
One of activities of the 2015 Kansai Regional Execution Drill was a materials transportation drill, which
aimed to rapidly distribute support materials throughout the Kansai area. An outline of the program is
shown below in Table 6.

       Participants of the Tabletop Drill include a facilitator and delegates from different governmental agencies.
       Through the Tabletop Drill, participants learn how "response functions" work during a disaster. Partici-
       pants collaboratively consider suitable actions and write suggested measures on a map. See Table 7 for
       an outline of the 2015 Tabletop Drill Program.

       5.4.4. Evaluation

       Both the Kansai Regional Execution Drill and the Tabletop Drill were evaluated at the end of their
       respective programs. Participants exchanged ideas regarding drill implementation activities for the year
       and discussed measures to be taken going forward. In 2015, the evaluation revealed the need for suitable
       headquarters management to facilitate the sharing of information between the fire department and
       hospitals. Through the evaluation process, participants pointed out the need to strengthen the manage-
       ment system for sending and receiving support for the following year.




       9 Union of Kansai Government: This is the first extended association in Japan and was inaugurated in December 2010. The

       Union was founded jointly by Kansai's seven prefectures (Shiga, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Wakayama, Tottori and Tokushima).
       The aim is to tackle inter-prefectural area-wide issues, making a breakthrough for greater decentralization.




30 — Overview of Disaster Simulation Drills: The Case of Hyogo Prefecture
     Special Attention to Vulnerable Groups for Emergency Preparedness and Response



     In 2013, it became mandatory for municipalities to create a list of residents who require evacuation
     support (such as elderly people, people with disabilities, and patients with intractable diseases) during
     disasters and to distribute this information to relevant support groups in each municipality. To promote
     this initiative, the national government developed a guideline for municipalities. The guideline offers
     rules, principles and advice on: 1) incorporating special attention to vulnerable groups into municipality
     disaster management plans; 2) creating a list of people who require disaster evacuation support; 3) using
     this list in the wake of a disaster; 4) creating evacuation plans for each individual who requires evacua-
     tion support; and 5) building community support and capacity for the disaster evacuation of vulnerable
     people (See Appendix 5 for examples).


     Special attention to vulnerable groups is one of the basic policies listed in the Comprehensive Disaster
     Management Drill Framework 2015. The Framework recommends local governments utilize drills to
     establish and improve systems that support vulnerable groups in the event of a disaster. The Framework
     advises that drills should be conducted with vulnerable people to confirm that risk communications,
     evacuation assistance, evacuation site support, evacuation site design, and so on are all working as they
     should.



5.5. Local Disaster Simulation Drills Conducted by
     Public Service Agencies
     In Hyogo Prefecture, alongside the joint disaster simulation drills, sponsored by the Hyogo Prefectural
     Government, public service bodies hold their own drills. By holding these specialized drills for their par-
     ticular fields, these bodies are able to enhance their disaster management capacities. This section of the
     report discusses the efforts made by the Kobe City Waterworks Bureau and the Kobe City Fire Department,
     both of which hold their own disaster simulation drills. An outline of these drills is shown below in table 8.

5.5.1. Kobe City Waterworks Bureau

Annually, the waterworks bureaus of 19 metropolitan areas hold and host a Joint Disaster Simulation Drill
with other Metropolitan Waterworks Bureaus. This drill is in compliance with the Memorandum for Mutual
Support among 19 Metropolitan Waterworks Bureaus10 which was established by the waterworks bureaus
of 19 metropolitan areas, of ordinance-designated cities in Japan. From among the 19 metoropolitan
waterworks bureaus, groupings of three or four waterworks bureaus jointly hold simulation drills. This
drill is an example of local self-government.


The 2015 Joint Disaster Simulation Drill with other Metropolitan Waterworks Bureaus was held on
November 17-18. The aim of the drill was to provide the reliable transfer of support and information and
to reinforce emergency recovery capacities when a disaster occurs involving the cities of Kobe, Osaka and
Fukuoka. In the 2015 drill, approximately 60 residents and 50 waterworks staff members participated.
The drill allowed waterworks bureaus to share information the about disaster management activities they
undertake and to perform these activities with residents, who were selected by waterworks bureaus in
each city. Among other activities, residents learned how to open public fire hydrants as part of this drill.
The schedule for the drill is shown below in table 9.

       To improve the disaster management capabilities of the local residents, the Kobe City Waterworks Bureau
       holds local disaster simulation drills at sites in Kobe in addition to holding the joint disaster simulation
       drill with waterworks bureaus in other cities.


       The Kobe City Waterworks Bureau installed 47 underground emergency water reserve system reservoirs
       to be able to provide domestic water to residents if a disaster occurs. See Figure 10 for an image of one of
       the reservoirs. These storage installations are linked by pipes so that the water is always kept fresh. Keys
       to unlock these facilities are given to each community leader so that they can use the storage system at their
       discretion in the event of a disaster. The Kobe City Waterworks Bureau uses local disaster simulation drills to
       train community leaders and local residents so that they can open the water pipes quickly and by themselves.



       “The waterworks bureau has limited staff. In an actual disaster, residents will be required
       to self-support and share mutual support, as was the case during the Great Hanshin Awaji
       Earthquake. Therefore, we would like to include the voices of local residents as we develop
       local disaster reduction activities.” - Mr. Higashiyama, Kobe City Waterworks Bureau

5.5.2. Kobe Fire Department

The Kobe City Fire Department holds a general disaster simulation drill each year in the city of Kobe.
Many residents attend these general disaster simulation drills, where they have the opportunity to learn
transportation and fire fighting techniques they can employ when a disaster occurs. Before holding this
drill, the Kobe City Fire Department holds a leadership training session, such as “Bousaisi” a Disaster
Prevention Expert certification by the Japanense Bousaisi Organization, to educate disaster management
community leaders who will lead residents when the time comes. In 2016, five instructors from the Fire
Department and approximately 10 residents participated in the leadership training.
Community leaders were given lectures on important topics, including: details of the general disaster
simulation drill to be held on March 13, a week after the lecture, and trainings for instructing people on
how to use fire extinguishers and conduct simple methods of moving an injured person. Photos of the
leadership training session held on March 6, 2016 are shown below in Figure 11.lation drills to train
community leaders and local residents so that they can open the water pipes quickly and by themselves.



“It is very difficult to keep residents mindful of disaster management principles in times
of calm. But, I speak to residents during those ordinary times and I find that attending a
disaster simulation drill contributes to people’s storage of knowledge, and as a result we
will have less damage when a disaster occurs.“ - Mr. Shimomura, Fire Department

6.1. The Nankai Trough Earthquake

       The anticipated Nankai Trough Earthquake is the greatest threat of natural disaster
       facing the Shizuoka Prefecture. A Nankai Trough Earthquake occurs along the Nankai
       megathrust fault which is divided into three zones - the “Tokai,” “East Nankai,” and
       “Nankai” - which will rupture separately or in combination resulting in a moment
       magnitude (Mw) of 9. It is anticipated that as many as 320,000 people could die in
       such an event. The areas along the Pacific Coast would likely be where most of the
       damage is concentrated. The Japanese government has prepared a support plan that
       will be executed promptly to these areas. Similarly, Shizuoka Prefecture promotes
       various measures within its territory to reduce damage. For example, the prefecture
       has created physical assets, such as breakwater structures, and knowledge assets,
       including the execution of evacuation drills.

6.2. Disaster Simulation Drills in Shizuoka Prefecture

     Disaster simulation drills were first held in Shizuoka in 1979. Shizuoka Prefecture is one of the local
     governments that historically has cause for concern about the large-scale damage that can result from
     an earthquake arising from the Nankai Trough fault. Therefore, many of the various drills carried out by
     Shizuoka Prefecture are aimed at mitigating anticipated Nankai Trough earthquake damages and impacts.
     The “general disaster simulation drill”, outlined below, is held annually at various sites within Shizuoka,
     presuming a large-scale earthquake, often the Nankai Trough Earthquake. The drill strengthens the
     functionality of the disaster countermeasures headquarters in the prefecture’s cities and towns. Further,
     the drill establishes support systems, links them with disaster-management-related organizations, and
     improves local disaster management capabilities, in cooperation with voluntary disaster response organiza-
     tions and volunteer fire services. The drills attract approximately one million participants every year.



6.3. The Laws and Regulations for Coordinating
     Disaster Simulation Drills

     Shizuoka Prefecture’s general disaster simulation drill is conducted in accordance with the Disaster
     Countermeasures Basic Act.



6.4. Shizuoka Prefecture: 2015 Local Disaster
     Simulation Drills

     Various types of drills are held every year in Shizuoka Prefecture. A number of Shizuoka’s drill activities
     are listed below:
     1.	 Drill for emergency response
         Government officials assemble
     2.	 General disaster simulation drill (to be expanded below in more detail: 6.4.1-6.4.4)
         Held in cooperation with officers, experts, residents, and others
     3.	 Local disaster simulation drills
         Held at the community level and conducted by Local Voluntary Disaster Management Organizations
     4.	 Tabletop drill: Earthquake countermeasures operation
         Operation drill for public officers only
     5.	 Disaster simulation drill related to nuclear power
         Strengthens capacity for Nuclear Emergency Response Headquarters
     6.	 Tsunami evacuation drill
         Disaster simulation drill for residents who are living in coastal areas conducted by Local Voluntary
         Disaster Management Organizations


     This section will go on to outline the 2015 general disaster simulation drill held during Disaster Pre-
     paredness Week.

       6.4.1. Planning

       Every fiscal year, a different Shizuoka Prefecture municipality is appointed to conduct the general disaster
       simulation drill. The host of the drill may be a single city, a town municipality, or, alternatively, multiple
       municipalities can share hosting responsibilities.
       The host municipality is responsible for preparing the basic plan and arranging the details for the drill,
       including the hypothetical disaster scenario. The disaster scenario is decided based on past natural
       disasters and regional characteristics, such as: geographical conditions, etc. The host municipality holds
       instructional meetings for relevant participants several times before the implementation date.

       6.4.2. Preparation

       The host municipality calls for the participation of relevant disaster management organizations and
       voluntary groups. It is responsible for selecting a venue and setting up tents for the drill. The participat-
       ing organizations voluntarily bring useful materials in their possession to the drill venue site. As noted
       above, the general disaster simulation drill may be hosted by multiple municipalities. When this is the
       case, general requirements for the drill such as requesting a helicopter from the Self-defense Force (SDF)
       is fulfilled by the Shizuoka Prefectural Government.

6.4.3. Execution

The host municipality proposes and executes an appropriate disaster simulation drill program based on
the outline of the general disaster simulation drill, shown below. There may be multiple venues for the
general disaster simulation drill within the municipality or municipalities. In which case, the host will
examine the program and execute the drills for each venue after coordinating with the relevant organiza-
tions.

       6.4.4. Evaluation

       Currently, there are no evaluation activities for the disaster simulation drills presented above. However,
       evaluation activities will be considered in the future. Further, the current schedule of activities for
       executing general disaster simulation drills concludes before noon so that drills may be an inclusive
       exercise involving strong resident participation.
       During the last general disaster simulation drill, in 2015, some program activities were halted due to
       weather. In an actual disaster, the effects of weather upon the countermeasures must be considered. The
       activities from the 2015 drill are seen as an opportunity to consider the effects of weather in future drills.


       “Approximately 890,000 people and over 5,200 staff members from related organizations
       participated in this general disaster simulation drill. Shizuoka Prefecture extends widely
       from east to west. Disaster simulation drills on such a large scale are held at sites inside
       the prefecture every year. Staff members from various organizations, including the SDF,
       police, fire departments, as well as civilians confirm the actual sites in advance of the day
       the drill is executed and become familiar with the locations. This study will contribute to
       their ability to take appropriate measures if a disaster actually occurs.”
       - Mr. Sakakibara, Crisis Management Department, Shizuoka Prefecture Government

6.5. Disaster Simulation Drills
     Conducted By Private Companies

    Many organizations participate in the general disaster simulation drill, sponsored by the Shizuoka
    Prefectural Government, such as the police, SDF, fire departments, medical institutions, volunteer
    disaster management organizations, and local municipalities. Some private companies also participate.
    Private companies from sectors, including: major infrastructure, gas, communications, and transporta-
    tion, participate in the drill. This section discusses the participation and role of the Chubu Electric Power
    Co., Ltd. (CEP) in the general disaster simulation drill. To begin, CEP supplies electrical power to the
    prefectures of Shizuoka, Nagano, Gifu, Aichi, and Mies.



    6.5.1. Chubu Electric Power

    This section explains the steps that CEP and the Shizuoka Prefectural Government took to plan and pre-
    pare for the general disaster simulation drills held by two municipalities: Yaizu and Fujieda, at the end of
    August 2015. The general disaster simulation drill held by the Shizuoka Prefectural Government consists
    of two parts: (1) a general disaster simulation drill aimed at improving the operation of the headquarters,
    and (2) a general disaster simulation drill held by the appointed municipalities, on a later date. CEP sent
    employees to participate in each of these two 2015 drills.


    Earlier in the year, the Shizuoka Prefectural Government invited CEP to participate in the drills. CEP staff
    attended three joint explanatory meetings in preparation for the general disaster simulation drills. In
    those meetings, the detailed roles of each company participating in the drill were explained. In the orig-
    inal drill plan, a large-scale power failure was presumed, and the staff from CEP were meant to demon-
    strate how emergency power would be supplied to general hospitals from their mobile power generators
    in the cities of Yaizu and Fujieda. In this scenario, the emergency power would be supplied upon request
    from the disaster management office of Yaizu and Fujieda city. CEP planned to exhibit materials to show
    how it would manage a disaster and to make the public aware of its disaster management activities.




                                                Overview of Disaster Simulation Drills: The Case of Shizuoka Prefecture — 45
       About 20 employees from the CEP Shizuoka and Numazu branch offices, and an additional 10 employees
       from the Numazu branch office of Tokyo Electric Power, were scheduled to attend the activities for
       supplying power to the eastern part of the prefecture.


       However, due to heavy rainfall, a number of activities planned for the disaster simulation drill were
       implemented on a much smaller scale. For the first time, weather conditions forced the Shizuoka Prefec-
       tural Government to implement remarkable changes to the execution of the drill plan.


       In addition to participating in general disaster simulation drills, CEP annually holds its own, in-house,
       full-scale disaster management drill. In 2015, CEP implemented its drill on a real-time schedule for
       three consecutive days, from the occurrence of the disaster through to the power restoration measures.
       Ultimately, these drills help CEP improve its emergency response measures in order to respond effectively
       in the event of an actual disaster. A testament to this, is that drill participants sought technical improve-
       ments in providing an immediate power recovery response.



       “CEP strives to improve its employees' technical abilities by having its employees attend the general
       disaster simulation drills held by the municipalities and the general disaster management drill held
       by our headquarters. However, in the Chubu region of Japan, in addition to earthquakes, disasters,
       such as floods and landslides occur frequently. It is true that disaster response practice is effective
       experience for our employees. Power is an important factor in saving lives in medical situations, it’s
       also needed to provide energy for recovery activities after the disaster. In the future, we would like
       to continue to participate in various activities during disaster simulation drills so that we can better
       respond to disasters.” - Mr. Shibata, Director, Disaster Management Group, General Affairs Department

7.1. Tokyo Inland Earthquake

       The Tokyo Inland Earthquake is similar to the Nankai Trough Earthquake, of the
       Shizuoka Prefecture, in that it is the greatest threat of natural disaster for the Tokyo
       Metropolitan Area. It is estimated that a massive epicentral earthquake with a
       magnitude of 9 or greater will occur at intervals of 200-400 years (See Figure 12:
       Anticipated Large-scale Earthquakes in Japan). According to a governmental report, an
       earthquake with an epicenter in the southern part of Tokyo (assumed scale of M7.3),
       which is one of the 19 types of possible M8-class earthquakes, would cause extensive
       damage, including a death toll of as many as 23,000 people. This would likely leave
       approximately 72,000 people in need of rescue, a total collapse of approximately
       610,000 buildings, and a maximum possible economic loss of 47 trillion yen for assets
       and another 48 trillion yen for degradation of production and services.



7.2. Disaster Simulation Drills in Tokyo

       To better prepare for natural disasters, such as the anticipated Tokyo Inland Earthquake, a number of
       disaster simulation drills are conducted in the metropolitan area. Since 1980, the Tokyo Metropolitan
       Government has held a regional joint drill called, the Nine City and Prefecture Joint Disaster Simulation
       Drill,11 in cooperation with municipalities in the Kanto area. The drill executed on September 1, 2015 was
       the 35th drill in the series. The prefectures of Chiba, Saitama, and Kanagawa, and the cities of Yokohama,
       Kawasaki, Chiba, Saitama, and Sagamihara, as well as Tokyo, participated. The host municipality for
       the Joint Drill is appointed each year. In 2015, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government was the supervising
       authority.


       One aspect of the Joint Drill, that is different from drills executed by other local governments, is that it
       operates in close collaboration with the national government’s general disaster simulation drill. As such,
       the Prime Minister visits the host municipality during the drill. Therefore, the host municipality must
       additionally prepare to receive the Prime Minister and their Cabinet members.



7.3. The Laws and Regulations for Coordinating The Disaster
     Simulation Drill
       The Nine City and Prefecture Joint Disaster Simulation Drill is executed according to the Disaster Counter-
       measures Basic Act and the guidelines specific for the joint disaster simulation, which are updated every
       year by the nine cities and prefectures.

7.4. 2015 Local Disaster Simulation Drill

     In order for the drill to generate appropriate countermeasures to problems arising from the GEJE and its
     presumed damage, the 35th Joint Disaster Simulation Drill was held with the following principles in mind:
     1.	 Establish self-support and mutual-support on the part of residents and improve disaster management
         awareness
     2.	 Improve disaster response capabilities through practical drills held by each disaster management
         organization and government agency
     3.	 Improve disaster response capabilities through mutual cooperation among relevant organizations
     4.	 Verify regional disaster management plans
     5.	 Support people who need special assistance during a disaster
     6.	 Collaborate regionally, based on the agreement of the nine cities and prefectures
     7.	 Support and cooperate with relevant overseas entities
     8.	 Utilize regional support that takes advantage of the capabilities of local helicopters and machinery



     7.4.1. Planning

     The host municipality creates a scenario at the beginning of the year, examines the overall outline, and
     proposes it to the other participating municipalities. In parallel, each municipality holds disaster simula-
     tion drills based on their own detailed and developed plans.
     The name “nine joint municipalities” is derived from the fact that some drill programs are held by each
     municipality and involve linking with other municipalities. By integrating the Nine Municipality Joint
     Disaster Simulation Drill into one program, which incorporates each municipality's drills, the municipal-
     ities can better cooperate with each other during an emergency. This is an important purpose of the nine
     municipalities joint disaster simulation drill.

       7.4.2. Preparation

       As noted above, disaster simulation drills are conducted separately in each municipality. Each munici-
       pality invites relevant organizations to participate in the drill and prepares the required items at the drill
       sites, including installing tents, 14 below, outlines the disaster simulation drill executed by the Tokyo

       7.4.4. Evaluation

       After each drill, evaluation meetings are held at each of the nine prefectures and city municipalities.
       A part of this evaluation is for key relevant officials, of the nine municipalities, to confirm the details of
       the joint disaster simulation drills for the next year. This evaluation is held the same the municipalities
       execute their disaster simulation drills, which helps maintain the concentration of the residents and
       reduce burdens on participants. In addition to the evaluation by respective municipalities, key relevant
       officials of the nine municipalities evaluate the details of the joint disaster simulation drills, particularly
       regarding collaborative works between municipalities in the drills, for the next year.



       “Past disaster simulation drills were focused on public support. However, in an actual
       disaster, self-support and mutual support are important. Therefore, the joint disaster
       drill is changing, year by year, to do more to promote the voluntary disaster management
       capabilities of the citizenry.”

                               53
8.1. Introduction

       Various organizations make up the fabric of a community. Schools, NGO/Non-profit
       organizations (NPOs), and learning centers play a significant role in raising public
       awareness about disaster prevention and risk reduction. This chapter features
       examples of disaster awareness activities performed by the aforementioned players
       (See Appendix-6, List of Featured Tools for Disaster Preparation Awareness).




8.2. Schools

       8.2.1. Nagisa Elementary School and Maiko High School12

       Kobe suffered great damage during the Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake that occurred in 1995. As of
       2015, Kobe City had 169 elementary schools with about 77,600 pupils. In Kobe, and in many other areas
       of Japan, elementary schools employ various disaster management activities. This section describes how
       two schools are aggressively promoting disaster management activities: Kobe Municipal Nagisa Elemen-
       tary School and Hyogo Prefectural Maiko High School.


       Kobe Nagisa Elementary School is located near the coast in Chuo Ward, Kobe. There are 59 teachers and
       914 pupils. The Nagisa Elementary School conducts three sets of disaster management activities every
       year.


       The first type of activity, is: the execution of evacuation drills. The school holds three evacuation drills a
       year, in the spring, autumn and winter which is held on January 17, the anniversary of the Great Hanshin
       Awaji Earthquake. Almost the entire staff and all the pupils participate in the drills, which presume an
       earthquake and a resultant a fire. The emergency evacuation drill takes approximately one hour and a
       half. This span of time was chosen to take into account the limits of young children’s attention spans.


       First, the drill participants are presented with a simple disaster management education program. This is
       followed by evacuation drills, and finally, a review meeting is held with the students and teachers. The
       emergency evacuation drill is timed to see how long evacuation takes, but the school prioritizes safety
       above all else, so they do not encourage competition.


       The second activity memorializes the Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake of March 11, 2011. The principal
       and teacher, responsible for disaster management, talk to the students about the disaster and pray for
       the victims. They continue to hold these events annually in order to prevent the memories of earthquake
       disasters, particularly GEJE, from fading.

       lum. During these classes, teachers convey basic knowledge about disasters, provide updates on evacu-
       ation activities, instruct the children about preparations they can make during normal times, in anticipa-
       tion of future emergencies, and stress the importance of communicating with family members about such
       matters. The city of Kobe developed a disaster management education booklet, “Shiawase Hakobo (Bring
       Happiness to the World),” which is shown in Figure 16. It is used for disaster management education at
       the elementary school level throughout the city. “Bring Happiness to the World” allows pupils to gain
       basic knowledge about various disasters, including: earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, and landslides. It also
       describes the preparations people can make for possible disasters, like stocking supplies.

       In 2006, an officer from the Kobe City Board of Education was dispatched to Armenia to help execute a
       disaster management education project using the “Bring Happiness to the World” booklet.


       Hyogo Prefectural Maiko High School in Kobe has an Environmental Preservation and Disaster Mitigation
       Course. This course was established in April 2002, seven years after the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake.
       In its curriculum, the course offers a number of subjects concerning disaster management and environ-
       mental preservation. For example, the students participate in activities of handing down the experience
       and lessons from the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake to the younger generations. Additionally, Maiko
       High School collaborates with elementary schools on disaster mitigation education. High school students
       make a regional map together with third-grade pupils and talk about disaster mitigation and response.
       Maiko High School actively promote internationalization, by accepting foreign students, since the
       course was established. Moreover, the students get opportunities to exchange opinions with disaster
       management experts in other countries, who are invited to Japan through the training programs of Japan
       International Cooperation Agency (JICA).




56 — Raising Residents' Disaster Prevention Awareness Through Schools, NGOs and Learning Center Activities
    There are many education programs providing advanced disaster management education in Kobe City,
    similar to those at Nagisa Elementary School and Maiko High School. In spite of this, an increasing
    number of students and even their parents do not remember the Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake.



    “I believe it is important to keep practicing
    disaster management education activities to keep the memories of
    the Great Hanshin Earthquake alive."

8.3. NGOS

    8.3.1. Plus Arts13

    Plus Arts, a nonprofit organization, was established in July 2006, 10 years after the 1995 Great Hanshin
    Awaji Earthquake occurred in the Chuo Ward of Kobe, Hyogo. Plus Arts promotes various activities inside
    and outside Japan in the fields of education, community development, disaster management, welfare,
    environmental awareness and international cooperation.


    The “Iza Kaeru Caravan (a toy exchange caravan)” is a disaster management event typical of Plus Arts,
    which was created based on a study of the Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake. At the caravan, children can
    learn fire extinguishing, rescue strategies and how to provide relief while enjoying the program in the
    form of game. This caravan is now held in 14 countries, including: Turkey, Thailand, Chile, Indonesia, the
    Philippines, and Myanmar. This is an effective program that allows residents and officials to learn about
    disaster management in a fun way while improving awareness of the subject.

                    Raising Residents' Disaster Prevention Awareness Through Schools, NGOs and Learning Center Activities — 57
       “Iza Kaeru Caravan” has two major components. The first is a pre-briefing for local coordinators and
       responsible people. For example, Mr. Nagata, a representative of Plus Arts, will visit a group of people
       and tell them the general idea of the “Iza Kaeru Caravan.” He talks about disaster management issues in
       the community with participants and then demonstrates and discusses a menu of different activities in
       the “Iza Kaeru Caravan event. He also helps the group create a plan and examine the actual programs that
       will be implemented in that community.


       The second step is the actual implementation of the program. Usually, there will be an interval between
       steps 1 and 2. However, when executed abroad, the 1st and 2nd steps may be conducted on consecutive
       days to save travel and flight expenses for Plus Arts staff. The actual implementation is carried out
       according to the pre-determined program, in step 1. Preparation of a venue, invitation of the residents,
       and preparation of the equipment will be carried by the local coordinators. This is because the project is
       intended to be locally continued and supported after Plus Arts leaves. “Iza Kaeru Caravan” is not a fixed
       program, rather its concept is localized based on conditions specific to an area. Originally, in Japan, a frog
       (“Kaeru” in Japanese) was used as the mascot. But abroad, an elephant or a bear, may be used, based on
       what is most appropriate to the local context. The seeds that have been sown are now flourishing locally
       at each site where the program has been run.



       "The Kaeru Caravan program is not difficult to understand. It is a program in which children
       and their families can learn disaster management in a fun way. We hope to expand our
       efforts widely, both in and outside of Japan, while respecting the opinions and feelings of
       the local people wherever we go." - Mr. Iwane, Plus Arts

    The Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake Memorial Hall holds evidence of the experiences and lessons learned
    from the Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake, and therefore contributes to reducing future damage caused
    by disasters. The facility is designed to teach about the dignity of life and the delight of sharing our lives
    together. There are approximately 150 registered volunteers who work at the facility. Storytellers convey
    the memories of the earthquake to visitors.
    Approximately 500,000 people visit this facility annually. 60% of them are from schools and 40% of
    them are from overseas. The concept of passing on these lessons through learning centers is expanding
    overseas, and museums, similar to this facility, have been constructed in Indonesia and Turkey.

                                 61
9.1. Introduction

       Risk communication is critically important to raising residents’ awareness and preparedness for natural
       disasters. This chapter will introduce some examples of risk communication initiatives in Kobe City.




9.2. Information Sharing related to Evacuation

       In Japan, various hazard maps are available to the public which give information about the conditions in
       each municipality which are prone to disaster. The hazard map is an effective tool for obtaining various
       information about disaster management at a glance. The map contains evacuation locations, routes to
       evacuate, areas where past disasters have occurred, and basic knowledge about disasters. This section
       describes a map developed by Kobe, the capital of Hyogo Prefecture.


       Kobe City suffered severely during the Great Hanshin Earthquake of 1995. The city is also at risk to
       damage caused by other natural disasters, such as: floods, landslides, and tsunamis. As such, Kobe
       provides extensive disaster related information to residents using paper media and an internet-based
       map information system. Additionally, evacuation routes and shelter locations are made widely known to
       nearby residents and children through local disaster prevention drills and school activities.


       In this way, the government shares information about evacuation and related matters to residents in more
       than one format. The following section, will introduce four communication methods used in Kobe.




       9.2.1. Online Tsunami Information Service, “Kokokuru” 16

       Kobe’s tsunami evacuation information is provided through "kokokuru", a website, published by the Kobe
       City Government for residents. Unfortunately, it is highly likely that in the near future an earthquake and
       tsunami will happen in the Nankai Trough. ”Kokokuru” provides information such as where to evacuate if
       a tsunami alert is issued when you are in Kobe City. A tsunami hazard map shows predicted flooding levels
       and a range of other things you should know to prepare for a tsunami. You can also send your location
       using GPS to friends and family with "kokokuru." This services offers users access to real time information
       for evacuation.

9.2.2. Capacity Building Through Disaster Risk Reduction Booklets

Every year, Kobe City publishes a disaster education booklet for residents. This booklet includes a great
amount of information including the latest news, public emergency alerts, basic disaster information
(on landslides, earthquakes, typhoons, tsunamis, etc.), how to prepare an emergency kit, hazard maps
(showing evacuation sites and routes), and more. Residents can learn to mitigate disaster risks by using
this booklet before a disaster strikes.



9.2.3. Evacuation Information by Alarm System in City

In the event of a disaster, evacuation information will be provided by the government to residents through
alarm systems installed throughout the city and through the mobile phones of each resident. Remote sites
which are difficult to reach by alarm system have remote disaster management radio equipment provided
to each household so that disaster evacuation information is available widely and equitably.

9.2.4. Activity of Voluntary Disaster Prevention Organizations (BOKOMI)

There are many disaster simulation drills coordinated by voluntary disaster prevention organizations
in Kobe City. The purpose of a voluntary disaster prevention organizations is to enable residents to
conduct disaster risk reduction activities in their own town. The Kobe City Fire Bureau has developed
the “BOKOMI guidebook,” in cooperation with JICA, to support residents’ activities. Residents can learn
their own roles and responsibilities in the event of a disaster from these voluntary disaster prevention
organizations. Good examples of such organizations in Japan are shown in Appendix-6, List of Disaster
Prevention Awareness Activities at the Community Level.

10. CONCLUSION




             65
      This report was developed to introduce disaster simulation drills and other disaster
      awareness and preparedness activities in Japan, in order to help other countries plan
      and implement such activities. To develop this report, approximately 15 different
      organizations were interviewed about disaster simulation drills, from national and
      local governments to private sector infrastructure companies, schools, and NPOs. For
      the sake of the report, it was important that each organization was in a different field.
      In spite of this, we found three key similarities in the ways various sectors think about
      executing disaster simulation drills. Below is a summary of these findings:



      A.	 Resident participation in disaster simulation drills helps residents strengthen their ability to self-
          and mutually support each other in the event of a disaster
           •	 During an actual disaster, the energy and awareness of the residents will determine the initial
             response to the event. Therefore, the participation of individual residents is a crucial part of
             disaster simulation drills, as well as the participation of governmental and related organizations.
             vDisaster simulation drills help residents improve their disaster preparedness and reinforce their
             awareness of the importance of providing self- and mutual support in the event of a disaster.
           •	 Most of the people in the organizations interviewed create programs for disaster simulation drills
             that place residents at the center of the exercise.


      B.	 Programs to develop the additional capacities of officials are crucial for continual improvement
           •	 General disaster simulation drills conducted by the government and municipalities are good
             opportunities for each organization to tell the local residents during ordinary times about the
             disaster management activities they will carry out during extraordinary times. However, it must be
             said that governmental officials and private company employees are not provided enough
             opportunities to improve their technical skills related to disaster management.
           •	 In order to improve their skills, each municipality and private enterprise should perform tabletop
             drills, in-company disaster management drills and execution drills, taking advantage of their own
             networks. These activities are a useful addition to comprehensive disaster simulation drills.


      C.	 The task of getting a budget is foundational.
           •	 In order to perform a disaster simulation drill, sufficient time is required beforehand to fulfill
             foundational steps, like selecting a venue, in order to successfully get a budget for the drill itself.
             The municipalities interviewed for this report started contacting their target municipalities more
             than a year before the date of the scheduled drill, and made major adjustments to the drill plan
             before its official announcement. Additionally, it is important to understand the needs of local
             companies and organizations. Therefore, it is crucial to start making arrangements as early as
             possible for a successful implementation of the disaster simulation drill.

      Annex 2: 2015 Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill Framework
      (Unofficial Translation)
      31 March 2015, Approved by the Central Disaster Management Council




      1.	 The Significance of the Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill Framework
          In the event of a disaster, it is desirable that disaster-management-related organizations such as
          national government organizations, local governments, and semipublic organizations work as one to
          respond while coordinating with the citizenry. In relation to disaster countermeasures conducted by
          these disaster-management-related organizations, the implementation of disaster simulation drills
          has been established based on the Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act, the Basic Disaster Manage-
          ment Plan, and various other regulations. This Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill Framework
          presents guidelines for disaster-management-related organizations to work with each other and
          comprehensively and systematically implement disaster simulation drills in 2015. In addition,
          this Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill Framework also presents the fundamental ideology
          behind implementing drills in order to increase the awareness of as much of the citizenry as possible
          concerning disaster management through disaster simulation drills based on the 2011 Great East
          Japan Earthquake and the current state of society.



      2.	 The Purpose of the Drills
          The purpose of the disaster simulation drills is confirmation and verification concerning emergency
          measures by disaster-management-related organizations during a disaster, and the enhancement of
          disaster management awareness among residents. More specifically, the purposes of the drills are as
          follows.


          (1) Through disaster simulation drills, to confirm and evaluate the functions of the organizational
          systems of the disaster management organizations, and examines their effectiveness.


          (2) Through disaster simulation drills, to confirm disaster management policies are effective, have
          appropriate roles held and shared by the various disaster management organizations, and that these
          organizations collaborate with each other during disasters; as well as to promote and reinforce
          collaboration during ordinary, non-emergency times in preparation for disaster, including in particu-
          lar the strengthening of relations between the national government and local governments.


          (3) As concerns the implementation of disaster simulation drills, to emphasize the discovery of
          points of vulnerability, and the challenges faced by disaster management personnel, and to focus on
          continuous improvement of the disaster management plan.


          (4) To serve as opportunities to raise awareness of the importance of disaster management and to
          improve local residents’ knowledge about it so that each and every resident may think about what
          they themselves should do during everyday life and during disasters when participating in disaster
          simulation drills and make sufficient preparations for disasters.




68 — Conclusion
   (5) Bearing in mind that self-improvement and self-development by disaster management repre-
   sentatives during ordinary, non-emergency times through government organizations and private
   companies ties directly into the improvement of society’s ability to manage disasters; to give disaster
   management representatives opportunities to validate the disaster management efforts related to
   everyday life and take opportunities to evaluate them for possible improvement.



3.	 Basic Policies for Implementing Disaster Simulation Drills
   Disaster simulation drills shall be implemented according to the following basic policies.


   (1) Improvement of disaster management abilities based on the Great East Japan Earthquake
   In order to improve abilities needed to manage the many challenges concerning disaster manage-
   ment measures raised by the Great East Japan Earthquake, incorporate emergency management
   for various conceivable types of damage and injury and large-scale management extending across
   multiple local governments into drills.


   (2) The promotion of practical, effective drills
   A scenario, comprised of situation setting and damage presumption, along with emergency measure
   scenarios, is the most important part of drill implementation. Create drills based on the Great East
   Japan Earthquake which presume more practical and conceivable worst-case situations and avoid
   conducting drills which are occupied with necessities concerning the progress of drills or which are
   for show only. From the preparation stage of drills, confirm the roles of national government organi-
   zations, local governments, semipublic organizations, residents, and lifeline/infrastructure operators
   while cooperating with them, work to discover and detect problems concerning disaster management
   organizational systems and emergency measures, and verify effectiveness. As concerns drill methods,
   implement drills using methods which involve actual judgement and action, such as execution drills
   where people and things move and tabletop drills where participants must make judgements based
   on situation assignment.


   (3) The implementation of drills in which numerous agents participate and cooperate
   It is expected that drills will be held in each agent not only engages in its own individual drilling but
   also in which as many agents as possible cooperate together in drills in order to promote disaster
   management measures which span organizations – it is necessary to increase mutual complemen-
   tation through the implementation of drills in which numerous agents participate and cooperate.
   As such, strive to implement drills in which numerous agents participate via cooperation between
   various agents such as national and local governments, local governments in wide area blocks, the
   government and civilians, at the field (industry) level, regional level, and between execution teams,
   as well as via international cooperative frameworks with organizations such as the U.S. Armed Forces
   in Japan.




                                                                                                    Conclusion — 69
          (4) Strengthening of mutual cooperation between disaster-management-related organizations, etc.
          When a disaster occurs and particularly at the initial response stage, it is essential that disaster-man-
          agement-related organizations such as national government organizations and public organizations
          in the disaster-stricken region work together in close cooperation to engage in the collection of accu-
          rate information and provide a fast and appropriate response based on the same. As such, implement
          periodic combined drills conducted by disaster management representatives, including the leaders
          of national and local governments. In addition, the national government will actively participate in
          disaster simulation drills conducted by various regions and industries and work to create extensive
          systems for cooperation and coordination, including during ordinary, non-emergency times, with
          disaster-management-related organizations such as local governments, semipublic organizations,
          and lifeline/infrastructure operators.
          Local governments shall strive to promote drills which make use of extensive networks under
          close cooperation with fire departments, police, SDF, the Japan Coast Guard, government offices in
          charge of safety regulations, designated government organizations, local governments, and lifeline/
          infrastructure operators, as well as wide area support drills based on agreements concluded between
          local governments.


          (5) Designing and improving disaster simulation drills which contribute to citizen movements to
          reduce disaster damage
          Design and improve drill content together with working with the media and strive to improve pub-
          licity concerning disaster simulation drills so that residents are able to improve their preparations
          for disasters through active participation in disaster simulation drills and by watching reports on
          drills, as well as so that residents may participate in a broad array of layers, such as regions, schools,
          and workplaces. As concerns the content of disaster simulation drills, actively add preventative
          initiatives to reduce damages such as confirmation of hazard maps, securement of furniture and
          furnishings, and glass anti-scattering, as well as risk aversion actions via Earthquake Early Warnings.
          Together with this, equip each resident with correct knowledge concerning disaster management, call
          for the implementation of specific preparations and the encouragement of appropriate actions during
          a disaster, and create opportunities for them to think for themselves about how they should prepare
          in their daily lives and what they should do during a disaster.


          (6) The implementation of drills from the perspective of gender equality and persons who require
          special consideration
          In the implementation of drills, incorporate the perspective of gender equality and strive to achieve
          the active participation of women together with taking the perspective of persons who require
          special consideration such as senior citizens, the disabled, and persons with incurable diseases, gain
          the participation of actual persons who require special consideration, and conduct drills on leading
          evacuations to evacuation sites and shelters.




70 — Conclusion
(7) Implementing objective analysis and evaluation of drills
After a drill has been completed, conduct objective analysis and evaluation of the drill through the
analysis of problems identified during scenario creation, engaging in the exchange of opinions with
participants, and listening to opinions from people observing the drill and outside experts. Once challeng-
es have been revealed, review the state of drills, disaster management manuals, and disaster management
cooperation agreements as necessary in order to maintain and establish effective disaster management
organizational systems and to strengthen mutual disaster-management-related organization cooperation.


(8) The promotion of planned drills throughout the year
Disaster-management-related organizations and disaster management representatives should strive
to implement a diverse variety of disaster simulation drills of the type presented in this Comprehen-
sive Disaster Management Drill Framework in a planned and systematic manner in order to systemati-
cally improve disaster response abilities.


(9) The promotion of disaster management training prior to drills
The advance acquisition of the skills and abilities needed to respond to disasters is essential to
conducting effective disaster simulation drills. Not only disaster management representatives but
also top members and leaders of organizations which take command during disasters are expected to
engage in habitual, repeated self-improvement and self-development. As such, strive to implement
training in order to acquire the knowledge and abilities needed for disaster response prior to disaster
simulation drills and to confirm and verify the results of the same via drills. In addition, as concerns
the implementation of training, in addition to conventional “classroom” methods of acquiring
knowledge and abilities, also strive to incorporate methods which present an accurate image of the
conditions of disaster management representative staff during disasters so that trainees may engage
in proper response during an actual disaster.


(10) Support from the national government
In order to improve training and drills at local governments, the national government shall strive to
provide manuals and teaching materials.




                                                                                                       Conclusion — 71

      5.	 Disaster Simulation Drills by Local Governments

           (1) The importance of general disaster simulation drills for local governments
           Local governments are directly responsible for initial response during a disaster and are required to
           strive to obtain the cooperation of disaster-management-related organizations such as the national
           government and of residents and offices, and local disaster management systems must strive to
           demonstrate sufficient ability. As such, they must clarify key themes in the implementation of drills
           each year such as initial response drills on establishing and operating disaster response headquar-
           ters and confirming cooperation with the national government, evacuation shelter establishment and
           operation drills, and drills on provisioning and transporting aid materials, and strive to implement
           periodic drills each year. In addition, local disaster-management-related organizations such as local
           governments and designated local semipublic organizations must strive to cooperate with national
           government organizations such as the SDF and Japan Coast Guard. Further, they must strive to
           improve local disaster management abilities through such means as properly dividing roles mutually
           with voluntary disaster management organizations, emergency communications councils, private
           companies, organizations for the disabled, and volunteers, together with residents; implementing
           unified and cooperative drills; sharing the results of objective drill analysis and evaluation with
           participating organizations; and, as necessary, reviewing the state of cooperative efforts. Particularly
           in regions where a large-scale earthquake might occur such as an earthquake directly under Tokyo or
           a Nankai Trough earthquake, they must strive to implement wide area simulation drills based on the
           Great East Japan Earthquake and agreements concluded mutually between local governments under
           drills which make use of wide area networks and close cooperation between local governments.




76 — Conclusion
(2) Drills in response to local conditions
Due to the types of disasters for which drills are required differing depending on region, strive to
implement drills which actively conform to local conditions and which presume those disasters for
which drills are particularly necessary based on past disaster history such as earthquakes, tsunamis,
heavy winds and floods, tornadoes, landslides, volcanoes, heavy snows, and nuclear power disasters.


(3) Providing opportunities for residents to think about disaster management and take specific actions
Based on the view that local residents are the primary players in disaster management countermea-
sures, strive to create drill plans based on the same and reflect the opinions and suggestions of local
residents in the analyses and evaluations of drill results. When doing so, strive to incorporate the
perspectives of both men and women equally and to obtain the active participation of women. In
addition, disaster simulation drills serve as opportunities for thinking not just what actions to take
during a disaster such as checking evacuation sites and shelters and checking means of contacting
family and general outline of such contact, but also about preparations to make before disaster
strikes. As such, actively add preventative initiatives to reduce damage such as hazard map confirma-
tion, securing furniture and furnishing, and the prevention of glass shattering; strive to encourage a
wide array of levels such as regions, schools, and workplaces to cooperate and participate, work on
drill publicizing methods and forms, and strive to help improve the everyday preparations residents
make for disasters.


(4) The spread and promotion of autonomous disaster simulation drill jointly by local residents
In order to improve local disaster management abilities, strive to spread disaster simulation drills
implemented by residents themselves, such as drills based on community disaster management
plans, and in which a broad array of levels cooperate and participate. In particular, promote the
implementation of drills in which local residents participate as a unified whole at schools, which
serve as local disaster management bases. In addition, strive to ensure that drills implemented by
offices and volunteers contribute to the improvement of local disaster management abilities via the
participation of local residents and relevant organizations.


(5) Cooperation with volunteers
Seek broad-based participation in drills from and strive for the greatest possible cooperation with
volunteers and organizations involved in volunteer activities concerning extensive disaster relief.


(6) Evacuation assistance drills for persons who require special consideration
Presume all conceivable disasters and types of damage and injury, make use of registers of persons
requiring assistance in the event of evacuation, announce and transmit information on evacuation
preparations, provide guidance on evacuating to evacuation sites and shelters, provide assistance
at evacuation shelters, and implement drills while attaining the participation of disaster-manage-
ment-related organizations concerned with matters such as establishing welfare evacuation shelters,
as well as persons who require special consideration such as senior citizens, the disabled, and
persons with incurable diseases. Afterward, strive to establish and refine systems for supporting the
evacuation of persons who require special consideration through the consideration of measures to
resolve challenges discovered through the aforementioned drills.

           (7) Disaster simulation drills for unspecified large numbers of people
           Cooperate with large scale customer facilities such as department stores, inns and hotels, and tourist
           facilities, promote disaster simulation drills in which employees and regular customers participate,
           and strive to ensure local safety during disasters.


           6. Implementation of Follow-Ups
           Implement follow-ups on the state of implementation of government disaster simulation drills based
           on this Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill Framework toward the end of the fiscal year and
           reflect the results of the same in the following year’s Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill
           Framework.


           7. Changes in the Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill Framework
           This Comprehensive Disaster Management Drill Framework may be changed at the discretion of the
           Central Disaster Management Council president when it becomes unavoidable.

      Annex 5: Examples of Special Attention to Vulnerable Groups for
      Emergency Preparedness and Response in Japan


      Example 1: Considerations for people with physical challenges to
      evacuate Fukuoka City

      Fukuoka City has a policy on evacuation assistance for those who need special care, including the elderly
      living alone and people with physical challenges. First, local CSOs apply to the city for evacuation
      assistance projects to support those requiring special care. The City shares the list of those who need
      special assistance with the CSOs. The CSOs then work with those requiring special care for evacuation
      to develop an evacuation assistance plan for each individual, in close coordination with social workers,
      healthcare facilities, etc. Special assistance during evacuation may include immediate confirmation of
      their safety after disasters, guidance to evacuation areas, contacting fire/rescue services, transportation
      to hospitals, etc.

      Example 2: Example 2: Gender considerations in evacuation centers in Oita Prefecture

      The Oita Prefecture proposed the following principles to reduce the social and psychological impacts in
      evacuation centers after a disaster, particularly for women:
      •	   Use partitions to provide privacy, as needed, for those who need special care: single women, people
           with physical challenges, mothers with infants, etc.
      •	   Consider the safety and security of routes to bathrooms in evacuation areas for women and young
