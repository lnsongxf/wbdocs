Words from the GAFSP Team
Dear Friends,

A lot has happened over the past six months. With your help, we have been working hard to increase
coordination between the public and private sector windows, improve the implementation of the GAFSP
portfolio, and understand exactly how recipients are using GAFSP funds and how those funds will
impact poverty and food security. This progress implementation report covers key activities from July 1,
2013 through December 31, 2013.

As you know, in September 2013, GAFSP held its first joint meeting with the program’s Steering
Committee and Private Sector Window’s Donor Committee. This marked the first time that all key
stakeholders – including recipients, donors, civil society, and Private Sector Window representatives -
met to work together to increase the impact of the program. The meeting included updates on both
portfolios, discussions of GAFSP moving forward, and the newest allocations for the Public Sector
Window. This work will help to ensure that the key goals and objectives of this innovative program will
come to fruition.
With these 8 new allocations, our portfolio has grown to include $912 million in grant funds allocated to
the 25 countries through the Public Sector Window, $45 million in financing to 10 Private Sector
Window investment projects, and $4 million to 17 private sector advisory services projects. This marks
an increase in the portfolio size of over 38% during the reporting period alone. GAFSP has also been
working to ensure that projects under implementation are moving as efficiently as possible. As of
December 31, 2013 disbursements to Governments through the Public Sector Window had increased to
$117 million (this represents a 40% increase during period). The Private Sector Window has disbursed
approximately $3 million through its investment projects and will continue to pick up pace as the
portfolio matures.

Thanks to hard work from our team leaders and supervising entities, we have recently conducted a very
revealing portfolio review on the key investment areas as well as crosscutting themes. GAFSP seems to
be ahead of the curve of many programs and MDBs with statistics relating to gender mainstreaming,
nutrition, climate change, and fragility. While we are not sure exactly why - it could be due to the highly
competitive nature of GAFSP funding or that grant funding encourages newer and more innovative
approaches- we are proud to report that:
    • 100% of Public Sector Window projects address at least one elements of good gender
         mainstreaming (gender analysis during preparation, gender informed actions and gender
         disaggregated M&E) and 60% address all three;
    • approximately 11% of the Public Sector portfolio is targeted towards nutrition related activities;
    • over a third of GAFSP investments are committed to generating climate adaptation and/or
         mitigation benefits (for reference the climate change commitment for IDA 17 is 25% and the
         current IDA agriculture portfolio averages at 15% for adaptation and 13% for mitigation)
    • across the portfolio we are also working to push forward in fragile and conflict affected states
         with 38% of funds allocated to 10 such countries.
We appreciate your hard work and continued support and look forward to working together as GAFSP
scales up to its full potential.

Thanks,

The GAFSP Team

Introduction
1.      The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) addresses the need for more and
better public and private investment in agriculture and related sectors to improve the income and food
security of poor and vulnerable people in low-income countries. GAFSP is a transformational approach in
development assistance targeted to helping countries make lasting improvements in their food security
through sustainable investment in their agricultural and related sectors. It focuses on five key investment
areas: raising agricultural productivity, linking farmers to markets, reducing risk and vulnerability,
improving non-farm rural livelihoods, and through technical assistance.

2.      This is the third semi-annual project implementation progress report to the GAFSP Steering
Committee for projects financed by GAFSP funds and was prepared by the GAFSP Coordination Unit
with input from the GAFSP Private Sector Window Secretariat, Supervising Entities, and the Trustee.

Status Overview of the GAFSP Portfolio (as of December 31, 2013)
8.       The GAFSP portfolio amounts to a total of $961 million across the Public and Private Sectors.
Of this, $912 million is through the Public Sector Window and the remaining $49 million is through the
Private Sector Window.

9.       The current portfolio targets approximately 12 million beneficiaries through the Public Sector
Window and about 0.8 million people from the Private Sector Window. Since the first public sector
project began in 2011, the window has already reached 917,991 people (about a third are women).5 This
figure has increased over 60% during the reporting period and is expected to further increase as more
projects start and scale up implementation. During this six-month period alone, actual beneficiaries
increased by more than 380,000 people. Following IFC’s standard monitoring procedures, the Private
Sector Window projects will not report on actual beneficiaries until a few years into the project when
results are expected to have materialized.

10.     To date, the Public Sector Window has awarded grants to 25 countries selected on a competitive
basis: Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, the Gambia, Kyrgyz
Republic, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mongolia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone,
Tajikistan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Yemen, and Zambia.

11.     The GAFSP Steering Committee made the fifth allocation in September 2013 and awarded $255
million to 8 countries (Burkina Faso, Honduras, Kyrgyz Republic, Mali, Nicaragua, Uganda, Yemen, and
Zambia).6 Each round of allocations of the GAFSP Public Sector Window has been highly competitive
with more technically sound proposals received than available funds. Generally only the top third of
submission are funded (i.e., for this allocation 20 countries submitted complete submissions totaling $733
million).. Amongst the proposals that were not funded, approximately $150 million from five countries
were deemed technically sound yet could not be funded due to lack of resources at the time of allocation.

12.    As of December 31, 2013 GAFSP, through Supervising Entities, disbursed $117 million to
Governments up from $82 million at the end of the last reporting period (this represents a 40% increase
during the reporting period). This represents about 24% of commitments for the projects under
implementation.

  Results reporting: For GAFSP funding share for the Public Sector Window and Private Sector Window Advisory Service
activities all results used in this report and other GAFSP results documents are prorated i.e., if a GAFSP funded project was co-
financed by another financier at a rate of 1:1, GAFSP will claim only half of the result as “GAFSP results”. However, for the
Private Sector Window investment projects, GAFSP reports all results from the projects with no prorating following standard IFC
practice for concessional investment projects.

  Of these eight countries, seven received GAFSP funds for the first time. The Kyrgyz Republic submitted a proposal again for
this round of allocation to receive additional funding for their current project (the first allocation was in May 2012).

14.      As of December 31, 2013, the Private Sector Window portfolio consists of 10 investment projects
and one investment program (totaling $45 million) as well as 17 advisory service projects (totaling $4
million). During the reporting period, four new investment projects7 (totaling $10.5 million) and seven
Advisory Services projects8 (totaling $0.8 million) were approved.

15.     To date, the Private Sector Window has funded investment and advisory services projects in 14
countries (not including regional and global projects): Bangladesh, Cambodia, Cote d’Ivoire, Ethiopia,
Honduras, Kenya, Liberia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and Vanuatu.

16.      As of December 31, 2013 the Private Sector Window had disbursed $4 million ($3 million for
investments and $1 million for advisory service activities). See Table 3 for key information of the Private
Sector Window investment portfolio. Key target values and current data for the Private Sector Window
projects are included in the section titled “Progress on GAFSP Investments” later in this report.          All
investment projects will use IFC’s Development Outcome Tracking System (DOTS) to track relevant
outcome indicators including farmers reached, employment, and number of outstanding loans. Following
IFC’s standard monitoring procedures, these projects will not report on actual beneficiaries until a few years
into the project when results are expected to have materialized.

17.     GAFSP provides support to both the public and private sectors to create an enabling business
environment for farmers and agribusiness to thrive. Both windows are active in nine countries (Table 4).
This includes three new countries that were added during this reporting period (Cambodia, Nicaragua, and
Uganda). However, the exact coordination or linkages between public and private activities within each
country needs to be further assessed to discern ways to maximize synergy between investments under the
two windows.

18.      Over 60% of GAFSP funds (through both windows) are invested in Africa, followed by about a
quarter to East, South, and Central Asia (Figure 2). The distribution for the Public Sector Window remains
more or less the same as in the last reporting period. Notable changes are in Latin America and the
Caribbean where the share has increased to 11% from 7% in June 2013 (due to new allocations to Honduras
and Nicaragua) and from 0% to 4% in the Middle East (the new allocation to Yemen).

Progress on GAFSP Thematic Pillars
20.     This section reports on progress under each of the five GAFSP thematic pillars for both windows.
The five pillars are: raising agriculture productivity, linking farmers to markets, reducing risk and
vulnerability, improving nonfarm rural livelihoods, institutional building and capacity building.


GAFSP Pillar 1: Raising Agricultural Productivity
Context: Raising yields and improving their resilience to climate change are the most important actions
needed to raise income and increase food security in the world’s poorest countries.
Main activities: Irrigation and drainage, adoption of high yield varieties, water management, land
administration etc.
Projects with a strong focus: Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kyrgyz Republic, Niger, Rwanda, Tajikistan [Public
Window]; ECOM Coffee (Kenya), CISA (Nicaragua and Honduras), Poultry Sector Support (Nepal)
[Private Window]
Key message: Raising agricultural productivity remains the dominant pillar for GAFSP due to high demand
by countries and businesses. In fact 55% of all GAFSP funds support activities that fall in this category.
Significant progress has been made during this reporting period in Bangladesh and Rwanda in the Public
Sector Window, especially on farmer training, promotion of new technologies, and water management.
Private Sector Window advisory services activities also reported significant progress towards their targets
with Pearl Dairy (Uganda) and CISA (Nicaragua), especially on farmer training and certification
accreditation. Private Sector Window investment activities did not report on progress during the reporting
period.
Project progress highlights:
•       In Bangladesh (Public Window – $50 million), more than 310,000 additional farmers have been
        reached through GAFSP support since the last progress report, bringing the total farmers reached to
        439,085 farmers (crop, fish, or livestock). For example, five new crop varieties have been
        introduced (two for rice, two for wheat and one for oilseed) and four more are in the process of
        development. Eleven improved crop and fish production technologies are being implemented,
        including three improved fish variety seedlings that are being provided to farmers. In addition, over
        5,700 hectares of improved irrigation systems have been put in place.
•       ECOM Coffee in Kenya (Private Window Advisory Services - $0.6 million) has provided 130
        Promoter Farmers training on: coffee farming establishment, nutrition, canopy management, coffee
        insect pests and diseases, coffee processing, coffee defects, environmental conservation, safe use of
        agrochemicals and climate change. Four new co-operatives received certification from UTZ,
        Rainforest Alliance, and Fairtrade, bringing the total number to nine; and training modules were
        developed targeting promoter farmers.
Other projects active in this area:
•       CISA in Nicaragua and Honduras (Private Window Investment Services - $3 million) The
        project will improve the quality and productivity of its existing coffee growers through the roll out
        of a long-term, on-lending program in Nicaragua benefitting approximately 150 small and midsize
        farmers over 5 years; increasing de-hulling and sorting capacity; purchasing equipment to improve
        productivity; increasing mechanical drying capacity; reaching 5,000 smallholder farmers; and
        expanding storage facilities.
•       Many of the newest allocations from the Public Sector Window include funding for relevant
        activities, most notably: in Mali, GAFSP support will target investments in water control to
        reduce climatic risks and increased productivity in key agricultural sectors by adopting a value


                                                     13
        chain approach; and in Yemen, GAFSP will support decentralized community-based smallholder
        productivity programs by improving water and land management, investing in water harvesting
        technologies, and introducing or expanding new or improved rain-fed staple and higher value crops.
Progress on GAFSP core indicators (Public Sector Window)
Significant progress has been made in many of the core indicators under this pillar. Advances in
implementation in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Rwanda drove these results. Projects only report on indicators
that are relevant to its activities and not all projects report on all indicators. Therefore, the figures for each
indicator are not the aggregate value for the entire program, but rather are the aggregate values of all the
projects that report on that particular indicator (Table 5).

Progress on Private Sector Window Advisory Service Indicators
Table 6 below summarizes progress under this pillar by reporting on progress to date for the Private Sector
Window advisory service projects, which uses some GAFSP core indicators (employed by the Public Sector
Window) but also reports on standard indicators for IFC advisory services. Overall, projects under this
theme are progressing well. Advances in implementation in ECOM Coffee in Kenya and Poultry Sector
Support in Nepal mainly drove these results. Projects only report on indicators that are relevant to its
activities and not all projects report on all indicators. Therefore, the figures for each indicator are the
aggregate values of all the projects that report on that particular indicator.

GAFSP Pillar 2: Linking Farmers to Market
Context: Increasing income and reducing hunger requires sustained efforts to link farmers to markets and
develop vibrant value chains beyond the farm gate.
Main activities: Construction or rehabilitation of rural roads, marketing infrastructure, rural finance,
processing etc.
Projects with a strong focus: The Gambia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Togo PADAT [Public Window];
AfricaJUICE (Ethiopia), CISA (Nicaragua), FDL (Nicaragua), Root Capital (Africa), COPSL (Vanuatu)
[Private Window]

Key message: Linking farmers to market continues to be the second largest pillar for GAFSP funding from
both the public and private sector windows: public funds for the provision of marketing infrastructure and
enhancing farmer capacity, and private funds to provide credit as well as for processing. Significant
progress has been made during this reporting period, in fact, since last reporting period GASFP Public
Sector Window projects in Cambodia EFAP and Ethiopia marked a joint 93% increase in rehabilitating or
constructing rural access and feeder roads to connect farm areas to markets.
Project progress highlights:


                                                     15
•           In Ethiopia (Public Window – $51.5 million), the project has already surpassed its end target of
            constructing 47.8 km by more than 100% having reported construction of 129 km of all-weather
            roads in order to further develop and increase the efficiency of key value chains through improved
            access to markets. There was also reported progress in developing and managing market centers,
            now reaching six centers (up from two during the last reporting period).
•           Cambodia EFAP (Public Window – $24.5 million) added 44.2 km in the country’s rural road
            network during the last reporting period; reaching 60% of its target on this indicator, while also
            supporting increased access to markets and other public services.

Other projects active in this area:
•           africaJUICE in Ethiopia (Private Window Investment Services - $3 million) AfricaJUICE is
            embarking on a $15 million expansion to triple fruit-processing capacity, and to build a self-
            sustaining network of farmers who can supply high-value fruit crops. It is expected that this
            expansion will double its current labor force to about 3,000 employees, over half of whom are
            expected to be women, and increase the number of smallholder farmers who supply the company
            from 70 to about 1,000. IFC Advisory Services is also supporting inclusion of small farmers into
            the company’s supplier base.
•           During the reporting period the IFC Board approved three projects that are heavily focused in this
            investment area: FDL in Nicaragua (Private Window Investment Services - $2 million) to
            support the microfinance institution as it expands on-lending to the rural agribusiness sector and
            micro-entrepreneurs through its network of rural branches and provide an additional 19,000 loans;
            Pearl Dairy in Uganda (Private Window Investment Services - $4 million) to support the
            operations of its milk processing plant and the establishment of milk collection centers reaching
            10,000 farmers and employing 150; and SIB RSF in Côte d’Ivoire (Private Window Investment
            Services - $1.5 million) to support a portfolio of short- and medium-term loans to SMEs, with a
            focus on women and agribusiness.
•           In addition, out of the eight newly awarded Public Sector Window projects (in September 2013),
            six are expected13 to include activities to ensure that farmers profit from their labor and a viable
            value chain is fostered. For instance: in Honduras, project interventions include promoting farmer
            organization and market access and developing long-term private sector alliances; while in
            Zambia, the project aims amongst others to facilitate installation of three processing plants, and
            support agro-dealers.
Progress on GAFSP indicators (Public Sector Window)
Table 7 below summarizes progress under this pillar by reporting on progress to date for GAFSP indicators.
Strong results are reported for road construction and rehabilitation in Cambodia EFAP and Ethiopia. The
latest reporting shows a negative change for the indicator on support to producer groups (second indicator
in Table 7) due to a negative change in Ethiopia. The project Task Team Leader suspects that a more
thorough review of farmer groups led to a more accurate count of the numbers, and he has requested
information from the Government. Togo PADAT reported no progress towards the same indicator during
this reporting period. Projects only report on indicators that are relevant to its activities and not all projects
report on all indicators. Therefore, the figures for each indicator are the aggregate values of all the projects
that report on that particular indicator.

Progress on Private Sector Window Advisory Service Indicators
There are currently no indicators reported (target or actual) for the Private Sector Window advisory service
projects under this pillar.

GAFSP Pillar 3: Reducing Risk and Vulnerability
Context: Raising agricultural productivity and linking farmers to markets are vital to improve income and
other assets of the poor. Volatility in these assets, however, can jeopardize the short and long term welfare
of poor households, particularly women and children.
Main activities: Cash transfer programs, nutrition education and training, weather and price risk
management etc.
Projects with a strong focus: Cambodia (EFAP), Nepal, Tajikistan [Public Window]; GWFP (Global),
SIB RSF (Côte d’Ivoire) [Private Window Investment Services]
Key message: Significant progress has been made during this reporting period in Bangladesh, especially
on laying the foundation for improving nutrition of vulnerable groups, and Cambodia EFAP, especially on
strengthening social safety nets. Private Sector Window investment activities did not report on progress
during the reporting period. No Private Sector Window advisory service activities fall under this investment
area.
Project progress highlights:
•       In this reporting period, Cambodia EFAP (Public Window – $24.5 million) added 6,351
        households as beneficiaries for its cash-for-work program, reaching a total of 11,290 beneficiaries
        and exceeding its end target of 10,000.




                                                      17
•        In Bangladesh (Public Window – $50 million),14 481 community facilitators and field assistants
         received nutrition sensitization and basic nutrition messages training during the reporting period.
         This strengthened capacity will have a long-term impact on ensuring country leadership in
         designing and implementing operations in the field of nutrition.
Other projects active in this area:
•        Global Warehouse Financing Program (Private Window Investment Services - $20 million)
         is a comprehensive investment and advisory program that supports the agriculture sector by
         providing banks with liquidity or risk coverage backed by warehouse receipts, which can be used to
         provide financing in the form of short-term loans or guarantees to agriculture producers and traders.
         GAFSP collaborates with GWFP via a GAFSP risk participation component embedded within
         GWFP that enables the Program to expand financing to second-tier banks in frontier regions.
•        In addition, all eight newly awarded Public Sector Window projects (in September 2013) include
         activities designed to develop longer term resilience to income and food shocks. For example, in
         Uganda, the project aims to improve smallholder farmer access to start-up materials to increase
         household production of nutritious foods, while implementing targeted nutrition and health
         education through schools and community-based agriculture extension and health services to build
         demand for these products; and in Nicaragua, food and nutrition education and school feeding will
         complement ongoing activities to increase nutrition for schoolchildren and promote consumption of
         autochthonous (indigenous) produce.

Progress on GAFSP indicators (Public Sector Window)
Table 8 below summarizes progress under this investment area by reporting on progress to date for GAFSP
indicators. Solid progress is reported on the two indicators reported. For the first indicator progress is
reported only by Cambodia EFAP, and for the second indicator only by the Bangladesh TA component.

GAFSP Pillar 4: Improving Non-farm Rural Livelihoods
Context: Non-farm rural sources of income are important for the rural poor for income and employment
supplementation. Non-agricultural goods and services produced in rural areas also tend to promote
equitable distribution of income by providing employment for women, youth, small and/ or landless farmers
and workers.
Main activities: Investment climate analysis, promotion of rural non-farm employment etc.
Projects with a strong focus: Cambodia Rice-SDP
Key message: To date, GAFSP recipient countries or agribusinesses have not prioritized improving non-
farm rural livelihoods; the pillar only constitutes 1% of GAFSP portfolio covering both windows. Given
this status it will not be covered in detail going forward until investment for non-farm rural livelihood
activities reaches some level of critical mass.
Project progress highlights:
    •   None to report during this reporting period.
Other projects active in this area:
    •   Cambodia Rice-SDP (Public Window - $14.6 million) is working to promote non-farm rural
        entrepreneurship activities by commercializing the predominantly subsistence rice subsector. The
        Government is currently recruiting a program implementation consultant to work on the following
        issues: organization and functioning of self-help groups; provision of basic administration training;
        development and functioning of micro-businesses (women headed) and small-scale agro-
        processing; implementation of community micro-projects; training of beneficiaries in new and/or
        additional vocational skills.
    •   There are no Private Sector Window projects that fall under this theme
    •   Out of the eight newly awarded Public Sector Window projects (Third Call for Proposals in
        September 2013), two include some activities under this pillar. In Nicaragua, the project aims to
        promote innovative non-farm small enterprises and build capacities to increase participants’ access
        to labor markets and self-employment opportunities, and in Honduras, project interventions aim to
        analyze and identify non-agriculture value chains to increase incomes; diversify incomes through
        off-farm activities; and increase employment in new or expanded private sector business ventures
        and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).
Progress on GAFSP indicators (Public Sector Window)
To date, there are no core indicators tracked under this pillar.

Progress on Private Sector Window Advisory Service Indicators
There are currently no indicators reported (target or actual) for the Private Sector Window advisory service
projects under this pillar.

GAFSP Pillar 5: Institution Building and Capacity Development
Context: Improving the capacity of agricultural institutions and organizations at household, local, national,
and/or regional level is equally important to delivering on investments and contributing towards poverty
reduction and improved food security.
Main activities: policy formulation, training on M&E, engagement with civil society etc.
Projects with a strong focus: not applicable




                                                       19
Key message: Institution building and capacity development are crucial activities that support investments.
Overall this pillar consists only 3% of the total GAFSP portfolio. For the Public Sector Window, all
investments in technical assistance are integrated into the investment portfolio. Given this, and the fact that
the outcome of this activity will be seen through the outcome of other project investments, going forward
we will not report on this area separately. Rather progress under this pillar will be reported through other
pillars to which it contributes.
Activities under both windows made steady progress under this pillar. Notably in Bangladesh on capacity
building with farmers’ organizations, and progressing with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil
(RSPO) certification process in Liberia and Sierra Leone (Private Sector Window).
Project progress highlights:
•       Bangladesh (Public Window - $50 million) has marked impressive progress in the number of
        additional community based organizations’ staff trained in institutional strengthening or sectoral
        planning and strategy, and in number of participants in M&E workshops (up by 209% and 131%
        respectively since last reporting period). Now in its second year of implementation, the project is
        advancing towards goals in farmers’ organizations capacity development including mapping of
        capacity development requirements and organizing a workshop of federated farmer organizations.
•       Mongolia (Public Window - $12.5 million) has shown progress in the number of people trained in
        value chains and business planning and management activities from zero to 30 and is meeting its
        target in this reporting period.
•       RSPO Liberia and Sierra Leone (Private Window Advisory Services - $1.1 million). In Liberia
        and Sierra Leone, Fauna and Flora International (FFI), a non-profit organization was selected as the
        conveners of the RSPO national interpretation process in both Liberia and Sierra Leone. In
        addition, both countries appointed legal officers to draft a legal review as part of the requirements
        of the RSPO process.
•       Africa Irrigation Diagnostic (Private Window Advisory Services - $0.4 million). FAO
        completed phase 1 of the irrigation diagnostic study and selected five countries for deeper analysis:
        Kenya, Senegal, Ghana, Ethiopia and Zambia. Phase 2 is ongoing; market analysis missions to
        Ghana and Zambia have been completed and draft analyses for Ghana and Zambia are to be
        completed by end of February 2014.

Other projects active in this area:
•       Root Capital (Private Window Investment Services - $5 million). GAFSP supports Root Capital
        (a non-profit development financier) scale up its Sustainable Trade Fund operations in order for it
        to become a financially viable business.
•       Lastly, out of the eight newly awarded Public Sector Window projects (Third Call for Proposals in
        September 2013), three include activities of technical assistance and capacity building for country-
        owned strategy formulation, and program development in agriculture and food security.
        Specifically, in Uganda, the project aims to provide necessary technical support to line ministries
        to deliver community-based services; in Nicaragua, project implementing agencies and their
        partners will strengthen their capacities and skills and further enhance their ability to monitor and
        evaluate the program; and in Mali, the project aims to build the capacity of professional
        organizations, local authorities, technical services and the private sector that constitute one of the
        constraints on the rice sub-sector and market garden produce value chains.

Progress on Private Sector Window Advisory Service Indicators
There are currently no indicators reported (target or actual) for the Private Sector Window advisory service
projects under this pillar.


Progress on Cross-cutting themes
21.     This section reports on progress for four cross-cutting themes that go beyond traditional agriculture,
but are of key interest to many GAFSP stakeholders. The four cross-cutting themes that are selected for
analysis are: gender mainstreaming, nutrition, climate smart agriculture, and fragile and conflict-affected
areas. In general, GAFSP projects have a higher inclusion of these cross-cutting themes compared to


                                                        21
Supervising Entities’ regular projects. This could be due to the highly competitive nature of GAFSP
funding that pushes governments to prepare innovative proposals touching upon some of these cross-cutting
themes. Or, it may also be due to the fact that GAFSP funds are grants (and not loans), thereby encouraging
governments to see it as a source of funding for riskier, newer, and more innovative approaches. Analysis
for gender mainstreaming, nutrition and climate smart agriculture are only for the Public Sector Window
projects while analysis on fragile and conflict-affected states covers both windows.

GAFSP Cross-cutting Theme 1: Gender Mainstreaming
Context: According to FAO, if women had the same access to productive resources as men total
agricultural output in developing countries could rise by 2.5 – 4%. Women as the primary care-takers of
their families are also responsible for translating agriculture sector products into food and nutrition security
of their households.
About 60% of GAFSP Public Sector Window projects address all three elements of good gender
mainstreaming in projects (gender analysis during preparation, gender informed actions, and gender
disaggregated M&E).16
Gender activity highlights:
•        In Cambodia Rice SDP, the project outlines important existing gender gaps, including in female
         farmers’ access to resources, essential extension services and decision-making. The project is
         categorized as “effective gender mainstreaming,” and has policy/ tranche conditions to ensure that
         gender issues are mainstreamed into the Agricultural Land Policy and the Law on Management and
         Use of Agricultural Land. It monitors a number of gender-disaggregated indicators, such as
         percentage of women unskilled laborers employed in the rehabilitation of irrigation structures; of
         women construction sub-committee members; and of women in management positions of farmer
         water user community established in each irrigation scheme.
•        In Nepal the gender analysis highlights the nutritional status of women and children and the
         feminization of agricultural labor force. The project is working to make agriculture technology,
         extension, and other interventions more gender sensitive, as well as empowering women
         through nutrition education and behavior change communications. The project monitors gender-
         disaggregated indicators, such as women farmers with increased productivity in crops and
         livestock, and improved dietary intake for pregnant and nursing women.
•        In Sierra Leone, the project identifies the challenge of persistent marginalization of women in rural
         areas, and has an explicit strategy to address it in its operations. The three-pronged strategy for
         gender mainstreaming and women’s empowerment aims at: strengthening women’s decision-
         making role in community development; improving the knowledge and well-being of women while
         easing women’s workloads by facilitating their access to rural services and infrastructures; and
         fostering women’s economic empowerment through access to and control over fundamental assets.
         Relevant indicators include number of: women trained in production practices and technologies;
         women trained in post-production, processing and marketing; female membership in financial
         services associations; women active borrowers; and agricultural business centre female board
         members.




16
  In the previous reporting period the relevant figure was 78% based on a review of 18 project appraisal documents. This time, a
total of 28 projects were reviewed. Of the 28 projects, 18 were carried over from the last review, and for the ten projects where
appraisal documents were not yet complete, interim project documents such as project concept notes were used for three projects
(Burundi, Kyrgyz Republic and Tanzania); and project proposals were used for the seven projects awarded in September 2013
(Burkina Faso, Honduras, Mali, Nicaragua, Uganda, Yemen, and Zambia).


                                                              22
GAFSP Cross-cutting Theme 2: Nutrition
Context: Malnutrition costs children's lives, perpetuates poverty, and slows economic growth. It is a multi-
sectoral issue that needs a multi-sectoral response. While there are critical health-based interventions that
are effective (nutrition specific interventions), experience has shown that these need to be accompanied by
interventions that address underlying factors such as food availability, water & sanitation, care practices
(nutrition sensitive interventions). Thus, agriculture plays an important role in reducing malnutrition.
In 15 (out of 25) GAFSP countries17 around $100 million of GAFSP Public Window funds (or 11% of the
$912 total portfolio) is targeted towards nutrition related activities – both nutrition-sensitive agricultural
activities and direct non-agricultural nutrition activities. This is a significant progress since the last
reporting period when $63 million was targeted towards nutrition. This reflects the inclusion of projects in
the September 2013 allocation such as Uganda that have a dominant focus on nutrition. About 60% of the
$100 million is for nutrition-sensitive agricultural activities, and the remainder is for nutrition specific non-
agricultural activities such as behavioral change communication campaigns, improvement of home
conditions etc.
Nutrition activity highlights:
 •          In Bangladesh, 481 community facilitators and field assistants received nutrition sensitization and
            basic nutrition messages training during the second half of 2013. This strengthened capacity will
            have a long-term impact on ensuring country leadership designing and implementing operations in
            the field of nutrition.
 •          Nutrition-related activities are measured by various indicators across projects, including:
                     • Number and proportion of malnourished, as defined by underweight, stunting, wasting,
                          and micronutrient deficiency, disaggregated by gender (Bangladesh)
                     • Chronic malnutrition rate in children under five (Burundi, Honduras, Mali, and
                          Zambia)
                     • Delivery of nutrition, health awareness, and access to micronutrient foods to pregnant
                          and nursing women (Cambodia and Nepal)
                     • Improved food security and nutritional status of vulnerable groups and households
                          measured by wasting prevalence (the Gambia)
                     • Food Consumption Score (the Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia)
                     • Dietary Diversity (Nicaragua, Rwanda, Uganda, and Yemen)

GAFSP Cross-cutting Theme 3: Climate-smart agriculture
Context: Agriculture is highly climate sensitive, and responsible not only for contributing to greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions, but also capable of carbon sequestration from the atmosphere. Climate-smart
agriculture comprises activities that increase farmer adaptation to climate change and/ or activities that
mitigate GHG along with activities that simultaneously increase agricultural productivity.
Preliminary analysis of measuring climate change commitments of GAFSP funded investments found that
about a third of GAFSP investments are committed to generating climate adaptation and/or mitigation
benefits. Some projects such as Haiti PTTA, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, address both adaptation and
mitigation, while most address adaptation only. This compares favorably to similar benchmark figures such
as the climate change commitment for IDA 17 which was 25%18, or figures for IDA’s agriculture portfolio
(15% for adaptation and 13% for mitigation; FY11-13 average).

     This target was established based on existing MDB climate change actual commitments which were about 23%.


                                                               23
Project highlights:
•        In Bangladesh, the project contributes to improving climate resilience to crops, fisheries and
         livestock production through the introduction of new technologies, agronomic practices and farm-
         level investments. These include the development and introduction of improved varieties and
         disseminating techniques, training of water user groups in on-farm water management, irrigation
         system operation and maintenance, pump mechanics, and rain-water harvesting.
•        In Sierra Leone, the impacts of climate change affect local stakeholders in the form of unusual
         weather patterns, and more intense rainfall resulting in severe floods and landslides which affect
         cropping patterns and water availability. The project supports the use of inland valley swamps in
         order to restore soil fertility, and promote sustainable rice intensification approaches which also
         reduce carbon emissions. The project will also explore the opportunity for testing climate resilient
         rice varieties through a Climate Field School for Farmers.
•        In Haiti PTTA, the project promotes the adoption of agricultural technologies and practices aiming
         at reducing land degradation, encouraging resilient agriculture, and allowing for farmers’ adaptation
         to future changes in weather and precipitation patterns. The project finances tools that could be
         used to better manage agro-climatic risks to enhance agricultural production systems.
•        In Niger, the project supports construction of dams and a water storage system to help manage
         changes in the water cycle due to climate vulnerability. As a Sahel country, Niger has a highly
         variable climate over time and space, especially with regard to rainfall resulting in recurrent low
         rainfall and severe droughts. This has led farmers to cultivate marginal lands that are particularly
         sensitive to erosion, and herders to engage in overgrazing especially around water points and
         livestock concentration areas.

GAFSP Cross-cutting Theme 4: Fragility and Conflict-affected States
Context Agriculture plays a very important role in the economies and livelihood of people in the low-
income fragile and conflict-affected states.19 It is estimated that by 2015, over 50 percent of the world’s
poor surviving on less than 1.25 dollars a day will be found in fragile and conflict-affected states, up from
about 20 percent in 2005.20
The GAFSP portfolio (under both the Public and Private Sector Windows) has allocated 38% of funds to 10
fragile and conflict affected states (Burundi, Côte D’Ivoire, Haiti, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Nepal, Sierra
Leone, Togo and Yemen). GAFSP funding in these countries increased by 25% (from $289 million during
the last reporting period to $362 million).
Highlights in fragile and conflict-affected states:
•        Côte d’Ivoire SIB RSF (Private Window) supports a difficult to reach part of the agricultural
         sector with limited access to financial services. Côte d’Ivoire is emerging from a decade of
         instability and economic dislocation. Women-owned SMEs account for a third of all SMEs in the
         country. Expected development impacts of the project are to support economic recovery and
         development of Côte d’Ivoire through private lending to SMEs and to enhance access to finance for
         women-owned and agricultural SMEs.
•        In Mali, where the proposed project is expected to reduce poverty and increase food and nutrition
         security enhancement in four the extremely vulnerable regions (Koulikoro, Sikasso and Ségou).


19
   The designation of a country as fragile and conflict affected state is based on harmonized average (3.2 or less) of World Bank
CPIA Score and ADB/AfDB CPIA Score, or the presence of a UN and/or regional peace-keeping or peace-building mission during
the past three years.

        The project is aligned with Mali’s 2013-2014 Sustainable Recovery Plan (PRED) and is consistent
        with the country’s transition roadmap and the 2013-2014 Emergency Priority Action Plan (PAPU).
•       Since early 2011, Yemen has passed through a period of political uncertainty and economic
        disruption. The agricultural sector was particularly hard hit, with an estimated 16% drop in output
        due to shortages of inputs and disruption of markets. The transitional government of Yemen has
        given importance to the economic recovery of the most vulnerable and affected groups, particularly
        in rural areas, prioritizing investment to raise agricultural productivity, improve rural incomes and
        strengthen food security. The GAFSP project in Yemen is consistent with the government’s
        priority in the rural areas to raise agricultural productivity.


Programmatic Updates
22.     During this reporting period, GAFSP has worked to improve the implementation of projects across
the portfolio, monitor and understand the portfolio, and ensure that all of the program mechanisms are
running as smoothly as possible.

23.     GAFSP has continued to work with DIME for impact evaluations (IE) in: Rwanda, Bangladesh,
Mongolia, Haiti, Nepal, and Liberia. The team works with each county to develop impact evaluations that
answer questions pertinent to the government clients. Each evaluation design is outlined in a concept note,
which goes through a formal review process. After concept notes are reviewed, one of the first activities of
the IE teams is to conduct a baseline survey and produce a report on the main variables of interest for the
government and operational teams. During the reporting period, concept note reviews were completed for
Nepal and Haiti PTTA. The team also completed baseline data collection efforts in Haiti, Nepal, and
Mongolia, and completed the baseline report for Bangladesh during this reporting period (the Rwanda
baseline report was completed in May 2013).

24.      In the first half of FY14, DIME team members undertook missions to Nepal, Haiti, Rwanda, and
Liberia. During this period, DIME also hired three in-country field coordinators to work on cleaning and
analysis of the growing collection of data. Additionally, DIME completed the first round of follow-up data
collection in Rwanda and Bangladesh. Based on this data, preliminary IE results for Rwanda and
Bangladesh will be available in the next six-months.

25.      GAFSP has also worked in coordination with the World Bank Innovations Team to use geo-
referenced data to monitor and report on projects, project impacts, and beneficiaries. During the reporting
period, GAFSP and WBI launched “GAFSP-Stories”, which is an online platform that allows stakeholders
to see the exact locations of the projects and hear directly from beneficiaries. The Teams travel out to the
project sites and often work to ensure their government counterparts can use the mapping tools in project
planning and to communicate project activities with donors, local stakeholders, and other development
partners. Maps and stories are available and published on the GAFSP web site for: Bangladesh, Rwanda,
Sierra Leone and Togo.

26.      On the Private Window side, an M&E framework for the Private Sector Window was approved in
December 2013 by the Private Sector Window Donor Committee. The framework includes three tools to
measure results and impact of both Investment and Advisory Services: (i) IFC’s regular M&E system – to
track primary and secondary indicators from IFC’s Development Outcomes Tracking System (DOTS) used
for Investment services and Advisory Services Operations Portal (ASOP) for Advisory services, (ii)
Poverty Scorecards - on a sample of approximately 15-20 projects poverty scorecards will be prepared to




                                                     25
track poverty and income over the life of the selected projects.21, and (iii) Project Evaluations: impact
evaluations will be conducted by third-party organizations on 6 projects to allow for a more robust analysis
of the impact of select projects and GAFSP’s contribution to the impact.

27.     The GAFSP is committed to learning through doing, and consistently working to improve the
program as a whole. Launched in April 2012, the GAFSP Continuous Improvement Process works to
identify and prioritize programmatic challenges and opportunities facing the program as a whole and the
Public and Private Sector Windows independently. During the reporting period, representatives from the
various constituents of the Steering Committee, Private Sector Window Donor Committee, Public Sector
Window Technical Advisory Committee, Coordination Unit, and Private Sector Window Secretariat
worked closely on issues surrounding the coordination between the Public and Private Sector Windows, and
Public Sector allocation guidelines. On-going discussions are held on these, and other important
programmatic issues. Some key activities during the reporting include the following:

     1) In an effort to increase coordination and transparency, GAFSP held its first ever joint meeting of
        the GAFSP Steering Committee and Private Sector Window Donor Committee on September 4-6,
        2013. The minutes of the meeting are posted on the GAFSP website. Main outcomes of the
        meeting are as follows:
            a. GAFSP will hold joint Steering Committee-Private Sector Window Donor Committee
                 meetings going forward
            b. GAFSP will issue joint Calls for Proposals (Public and Private) for the Fourth and
                 subsequent Calls for Proposals.
            c. Future Public Calls will be more explicit in indicating that Public-Private Partnerships are
                 permitted for financing under the Public Sector Window.
            d. The Private Sector Window will continue to move forward with innovative approaches to
                 use blended concessional and commercial finance and advisory services to meet the needs
                 of smallholder farmers
            e. A working group with diverse participation from GAFSP stakeholders will develop a
                 comprehensive proposal of a new “component” or “financing modality” for the program
                 that will address the financing needs of smallholder farmers, smallholder farmer
                 associations, and small scale agribusiness enterprises.

     2) In preparation for the above mentioned meeting, the Coordination Unit carried out analysis of past
        applications to the Public Sector Window, and potential improvements. The analysis included
        aspects such as the regional distribution, primary language, types of activities funded, the amount of
        time needed for recipients to prepare proposals, factors impacting the speed to first disbursement;
        and composition and weight of the current proposal assessment scoring system. The analysis
        included a list of recommendations for consideration. The final approved version of the
        recommendations will be applied to the next Call for Proposal.




21
   A Poverty Scorecard usually includes 10 simple questions like whether the household owns a TV, or the material used for the
roof of their house, or the number of household numbers etc. These questions enable a statistically significant estimate of the
likelihood of a household being below the poverty line. Over time, poverty scorecards will be used to track income/poverty changes
among project beneficiaries.
