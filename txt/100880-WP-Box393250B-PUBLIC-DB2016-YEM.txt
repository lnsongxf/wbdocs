THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 165*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name

        and the engineering drawings and designs, to the Construction
        Licensing Department of the Ministry of Public Works.
        Subsequently, the construction form, along with the aerial plan,
        will be given to the district where the construction is to be done.
        An actual permit is not granted at the end of this first step; this
        stage simply initiates the process by which the Construction
        Licensing Director signs the construction forms and dispatches

      The Licensing Department reviews the engineering drawings and
      designs for the construction of the warehouse submitted by
      BuildCo. If these conform to the Construction Law, the
      department determines the building permit fees. Subsequently,
      the company obtains the provisional building permit necessary
      in order to commence work. Although the law does not require
      provisional permits, the administration of the ministry imposes
      this condition to minimize construction violations and to force
      the permit applicant to adhere to the conditions of construction
      that the Ministry has approved.

        because of some issues in Yemen’s addressing system, it might be
        difficult for inspectors to know the exact location of the building if they
        are not picked up.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

        ensures that there is no objection, dispute, or mortgage against the
        transfer of title deed. Then they enter the application with a serial No.
        and refer it to Ownership Confirmation Department for survey and visit
        of the location of land to ensure compliance of the borders and area
        with the new title deed. Then they project it to their cadastral map. The
        application and the survey are registered in their records and submitted
        to the Legal Department. The Legal Department writes to the General
        Director of Survey & Land Registration Authority stating that all the
        primary Procedures have been completed under the law. Then he in turn
        notifies the concerned party to complete the Procedures and registration
        after payment of duties and taxes. Duties and taxes are paid at the
        Financial Affairs Department in the Survey & Land Registration
        Department. After the payment for the registration, the purchaser's
        name is recorded in the registry of owners. In the event of non
        registration, the law requires a fine to be paid for delayed registration.
        After payment of the duties, Title Deed Confirmation Department shall
        complete the Procedures of registration stating the name of the new
        owner. All documents of the application are then sent to the Information
        & Documents Department for archiving.

for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
