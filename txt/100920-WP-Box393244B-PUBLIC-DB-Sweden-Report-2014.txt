     Note: The equity restriction is calculated as an unweighted average of all foreign equity ownership indices across the 32 sectors covered. A value of 100% indicates that an
     economy is fully open to foreign equity ownership across all 32 sectors, and a lower value that limitations are imposed in one or more of them. The global average includes the
     103 economies covered by the FDI Regulations data on investing across sectors, and the OECD high-income average all OECD high-income economies shown in the ﬁgure.
