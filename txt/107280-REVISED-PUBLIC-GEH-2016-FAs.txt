    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
    This policy note provides an overview of government health financing in the Lao People’s
    Democratic Republic (PDR), with an added focus on health center financing. The note sum-
    marizes overall trends in health outcomes and government health financing over 2000-
    2014 and analyzes trends in planned and realized government budgetary health spend-
    ing data covering fiscal years (FYs) 2000/01 to 2013/14 and planned expenditures for FYs
    2014/15, updating a previous assessment conducted in 2012. In addition, this note summa-
    rizes findings from health center financing data collected as part of the UFGE-CNP facility
    survey which collected information from a nationally-representative sample of 120 health
    centers in 2013-14. This policy note is one of a series designed to disseminate findings of
    the World Bank’s program of analytic and advisory activities for health in Lao PDR.

                                              Key Messages
     •	 Lao PDR has made notable progress in improving maternal and child health outcomes and
        is on-track to attain maternal and child health-related MDGs, which compares performance
        today with a 1990 baseline. However, by current global and regional standards, Lao PDR still
        has some of the worst maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes. Furthermore, Lao PDR is
        currently off-track to attain nutrition-related MDGs, with about one-third of children under-
        five underweight and almost half stunted.
     •	 These poor population health outcomes are associated with low and inequitable utilization of
        health services, and worsening measures of financial protection. The incidence of catastrophic
        health expenditure has worsened in 2012-13 to 5.0 percent from 3.8 percent in 2007-08, and
        large inequalities in health service delivery and health outcomes, across economic, urban-ru-
        ral, geographic, and ethnic dimensions remain.
     •	 From a health financing standpoint, Lao PDR is characterized by low but increasing levels of
        government spending, associated with high levels of out-of-pocket (OOP) spending and unsus-
        tainable dependence on external financing.
     •	 The Government of Lao PDR has committed to increasing government health expenditure to 9
        percent of overall government expenditure by 2015, which is to be affirmed, although consid-
        erable challenges remain in ensuring not just an increase in the quantum of spending, but also
        to increase the allocative and technical efficiency, and the effectiveness of spending to achieve
        desirable population health outputs and outcomes.
     •	 Concurrent commitments and initiatives to expand coverage and financial protection for the
        poor, via the use of pooled and prepaid financing, through health equity funds (HEFs), and the
        removal of user charges for maternal and child care (MCH) services, with an overall policy aim
        of attaining universal health coverage (UHC) by 2025, are important adjuncts to ensure that
        spending results in expanded health service delivery to those most in need of these services.
     •	 Inclusion of technical revenues and external financing in the 9 percent target however, reduces
        the clarity of health sector goals intended by such a target – as technical revenues (and RDFs)
        undermine the financial protection goal of the health system and is indeed antithetical to the
        goals of UHC – while inclusion of external financing weakens the accountability for the 9 per-
        cent target.
     •	 The national health financing context is reflected, at the health center-level, with dependence
        on revolving drug funds (RDFs) – paid for directly by users of health services as OOP - and
        external financing for 58 percent and 20 percent of health center revenue respectively. Yet,
        despite extracting finance from end-users through RDF revenues, the availability of essential
        medicines remains poor.
     •	 In moving towards UHC and in order to reap the economic and social benefits of improved
        health status and greater financial protection, Lao PDR will need to decrease reliance on OOP-
        financed revenues from RDFs, increase domestic government health financing, and increase
        pooled and pre-paid financing via strengthened pre-payment mechanisms.

    2. Background and Health Outcomes
    1.	      Lao PDR is a landlocked country with a population of 6.4 million, where the ma-
    jority of the workforce is engaged in agriculture and 70 percent of the population lives
    in rural areas. As a result of rapid economic growth, poverty reduction over the past two
    decades has been impressive. The proportion of the population living below the poverty line
    fell from 45 percent in 1992 to 23 percent in 2012. The World Bank now classifies the coun-
    try as lower middle-income with a gross national income of US$1,450 per capita. However,
    income and other inequalities are prominent. Poverty remains high especially in remote and
    highland areas where access by road or river is difficult; and rural areas continue to have
    poor access to sanitation and electricity. Ethnic minorities, who tend to live in the highlands
    and mountain slopes, are particularly disadvantaged even though they comprise almost
    one-half of the population.

    2.	     Lao PDR has made steady and significant progress on several key population
    health outcomes over the past few decades. Life expectancy has increased steadily to al-
    most 68 years in 2013, up from 49 years in 1980 (Figure 1). Under-five and infant mortality
    rates have also declined significantly over the same period: the under-five mortality rate
    declined from 201 per 1,000 live births in 1980 to 71 per 1,000 live births in 2013. At current
    trends, Lao PDR is projected to meet the child health Millennium Development Goal (MDG)
    which calls for a two-thirds reduction in under-five mortality over the period 1990-2015.2
    Lao PDR also appears also to be on-track to attain the maternal health MDG, which calls
    for a 75 percent reduction in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) over 1990-2015, although
    not on-track for nutrition-related MDGs.3 Furthermore, despite notable progress, consider-
    able challenges remain. Lao PDR continues to have some of the worst maternal and child
    health (MCH) outcome indicators, both globally as well as in the East Asia & Pacific (EAP)
    region. Under-five and infant mortality rates are below average relative to GDP per capita
    (Figure 2). Although there is some uncertainty regarding exact numerical values, at 220 per
    100,000 live births Lao PDR’s MMR is high and much higher than that of neighboring Cam-
    bodia and more than four times the estimate for Vietnam (Table 3).4

3.	      About a third of all children under five remain underweight and almost half are
stunted. At current trends, Lao PDR is off-track on the nutrition MDG. Underlying poor
MCH outcomes include low levels of coverage for key MCH utilization indicators such as
antenatal care (ANC), skilled birth attendance, and immunization for measles and DPT,
and contribute towards suboptimal growth conditions during the crucial first 1,000 days of
life, beginning at conception. Low quality of health care remains a key challenge facing the
health sector.
 
10   GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH IN LAO PDR



     4.	     Like several other countries in the region, Lao PDR is undergoing a rapid epide-
     miological transition. NCDs now account for the largest share of the burden of disease in
     the country. Whereas in 1990 only about 28 percent of morbidity and mortality in Lao PDR
     was due to NCDs, by 2010 this number had risen to 47 percent (Figure 3). Lower respiratory
     infections were responsible for the largest share of the overall disease burden, causing 8.8
     percent of all disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to morbidity and premature
     mortality in 2010 (Table 1). Ischemic heart disease’s and stroke’s share of DALYs has been
     rising rapidly over the period 1990-2010. Smoking tobacco is one of the five main risk fac-
     tors, accounting for substantial burden of disease in Lao PDR, where the other risks are
     household air pollution from solid fuels and dietary risks5 (see Table 2).

12   GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH IN LAO PDR



     5.	     There are significant economic, urban-rural, geographic, and ethnic-group re-
     lated inequalities in health outputs and outcomes in Lao PDR (Table 4). Inequalities re-
     lated to economic status and ethnicity are particularly large: whereas skilled birth attend-
     ance amongst the richest quintile was 91 percent, it was only about 17 percent among the
     bottom 40 percent; skilled birth attendance among the Lao-Tai was 59 percent whereas
     among Hmong-Mien it was only 18 percent; stunting prevalence among the bottom 40 per-
     cent was double that of the richest group. DPT immunization coverage rates among the
     bottom 40 percent were half of those among the richest 20 percent. The Central region
     generally had better indicators for skilled birth attendance and ANC visits, but lagged be-
     hind other regions in immunization coverage. Whereas health outcomes in some provinces
     are comparable to those found in richer countries such as Indonesia, infant and under-five
     mortality rates in several provinces are similar in magnitude to those found in much poorer
     countries such as Sierra-Leone (Figure 4).

14   GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH IN LAO PDR




     3. Health Financing Context
     1.	     From a health financing perspective, Lao PDR’s health system has transitioned
     from a centralized Soviet-style health system providing free health services to all prior
     to the 1990s to a system that increasingly relies on OOP payments by patients. In recent
     years however, the system has attempted to scale back its reliance on OOP payments,
     moving towards provision of free care for selected health services (such as MCH) and for
     selected populations (such as the poor, via health equity funds), and the government has
     committed to attaining universal health coverage (UHC) by 2020.10, 11, 12 At present, separate
     social insurance mechanisms exist for civil servants and for private formal sector workers;
     and community-based health insurance coverage for some of the non-poor informal sector.
     Estimates suggest that only about 20 percent of the country’s population has some form
     of formal coverage, including about 40 percent of the poor covered under health equity
     funds.13

     2.	     The free MCH policy endorsed by the Prime Minister (decree number 178/PM)
     makes all pregnant women and children under-five exempt from fees related to deliveries
     and child health at all health centers and public hospitals, although implementation has
     been geographically limited. On the supply side, the policy provides fixed-fee reimburse-
     ment to health facilities depending on the type of service and the location of service provi-
     sion. The Free MCH packages consist of antenatal care, postnatal care, and institutional
     deliveries, and well-baby clinic examination (including inpatient and outpatient services)
     for children under-five. Implementation was rolled out in 2013, first in poor districts and
     governmental focus sites for development. There is a plan to expand the free MCH program
     in year 2014 with three options, ranging from US$2.9 million to US$5.5 million per year.14 A
     World Bank assessment (2013) of the new policy notes that the policy’s removal of user fees
     may not be sufficient to improve utilization and inequalities across the country.15 The policy
     should be accompanied by supply-side interventions and community focused demand-side
     interventions as well as greater financial or other incentives to improve utilization rates
     among the poorer sections of the population.

3.	     By international standards, Lao PDR is characterized by low levels of government
spending, associated with high levels of OOP spending and reliance on external financ-
ing. On the positive side, there is some evidence to suggest that Lao PDR is undergoing
an appropriate health financing transition, with an increase in total health expenditures
per capita and a rising share of financing from pooled sources, but it is doing so at a very
slow rate (see Figure 5).16 Based on WHO NHA estimates, general government spending on
health (MOH budget and social security expenditures on health) as a share of GDP in 2013
was only 1.0 percent in Lao PDR, against 2.6 percent in Nepal, 3.6 percent in Thailand, and
2.5 percent in Vietnam (Table 5 and Figure 6). At the same time, Lao PDR has substantial
dependence on external finance in total health spending (greater than that of Nepal and
Bhutan, for example). International evidence suggests that the government health spend-
ing share of GDP would need to increase to lower the OOP share of total health spending
– although because the financing gap is so large, even an increase of government health
spending by one percentage point of GDP, would still leave Lao PDR behind countries like
Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam.

     Evidence,” Social Science & Medicine, 105: 112-121. Countries in the bottom right quadrant of Figure 5 can be
     characterized as undergoing a rapid health financing transition as pooled health spending is growing and OOP
     spending is declining (such as Thailand); those in the upper right quadrant below the 45-degree line are those
     where pooled spending is growing at a faster rate than OOP spending and therefore they are transitioning
     relatively slowly (such as Lao PDR); countries in the upper right quadrant and above the 45-degree line are
     regressing as OOP spending is growing at a faster pace than pooled health spending (such as Philippines).

4.	     The heavy reliance on OOP payments in Lao PDR results in considerable financial
barriers to utilization of health services, contributing to low and inequitable utilization of
health services, with significant health-related financial risk. Analysis of the Lao Expendi-
ture and Consumption Survey (LECS) LECS V 2012/13 indicates inequitable utilization of
health services between the poorest and richest quintiles, which is not accounted for solely
by differences in the incidence of reported illness, as this inequity remains even among
those reporting illness. Although the richest quintile utilizes more services than the poor
even in public facilities, the utilization patterns vary substantially between the poorest and
richest quintiles (see Table 6).

5.	    Further analysis of LECS V in Table 7 demonstrates the weakness of financial risk
protection, which has deteriorated since the previous LECS in 2007-08. Defining cata-
strophic expenditure payments as 10 percent or more of the total household consumption,
5.0 percent of households incur catastrophic health expenditure. This has increased from
3.8 percent in 2007-0819 to 5.0 percent in 2012-13.

     6.	     There are socioeconomic variations in financial protection, which are likely to re-
     flect the inequitable utilization and access of households to health services. Wealthier
     households have both a higher incidence of catastrophic health expenditure and expend a
     greater proportion of consumption on health care. There are further regional and urban-
     rural variations, which likely reflect variations in utilization and access to health facilities.
     For example, households living in urban areas spend 2.3 perent of their total consumption
     compared with 1.7 percent in rural areas; and about 6.6 percent of urban households are ex-
     posed to catastrophic health spending compared with 4.6 percent in rural areas (see Table
     8).

     7.	     Although contributory health insurance/coverage schemes can play an important
     role in strengthening financial risk protection, there are considerable challenges. These
     include the size of the informal sector - with large numbers of the population engaged in
     subsistence farming – and the incidence of poverty, that need to be addressed if coverage
     of such schemes is to be expanded successfully. Hence, as underscored in the government’s
     own draft Health Financing Strategy for 2014-202522, increasing the quantum and improv-
     ing the effectiveness and efficiency of existing government health spending is likely to be
     the most viable strategy for improving access to health care services and enhancing finan-
     cial protection in the near term.

4. Budgetary Government Spending on Health
1.	     Budgetary government spending on health in Lao PDR has been increasing, al-
beit from a very low and erratic base. In FY 2013/14, based on the latest financing data
provided directly by MoH, realized government budgetary spending on health at the cen-
tral and subnational levels totaled LAK1,339 billion, roughly 1.4 percent of GDP (≈US$24
per capita).23 This estimate shows a decline of government health spending per capita in
FY 2012/13, and includes both recurrent and capital expenditure from both domestic and
external sources, but does not include health spending by other ministries nor social secu-
rity spending. Planned government expenditure on health for FY 2014/15 is expected to be
much higher - 1.7 percent of GDP.

2.	     However, due to dependence on external financing, government health spending
has been erratic over time (see Figure 7), although progress in weaning off external financ-
ing especially since FY 2012/13 is acknowledged. If only domestically-financed spending
is considered, government health expenditure accounted for only 1 percent of GDP in FY
2013/14, almost triple compared to the previous decade. As part of the Seventh Socioeco-
nomic Development Plan, a modest portion of revenues from the Nam Theun 2 hydropower
project has been allocated to eligible health programs (and as discussed later in the policy
note, several health centers indeed report receiving support from the Nam Theun 2 Power
Company). Furthermore, planned domestically-financed government expenditure on health
for FY 2014/15 is expected to be 1.2 percent of GDP and realizing this increase in actual
spending will be an important step for Lao PDR to attain health sector goals.

      Lao PDR Department of Finance, Ministry of Health (personal correspondence). The authors note the dif-
     ferences in health financing indicators from the two sources of data – WHO NHA (Table 5), which includes
     private OOP spending, and latest MOH budgetary records presented here – although the temporal coverage is
     different due to the nature of FYs. For this section on ‘Budgetary Government Spending on Health’, the value of
     the ‘freshness’ of government spending was judged to be important in informing current policy considerations
     and hence these health financing indicators were included, with irregularities transparently presented. The
     authors further consider relevant the challenges in obtaining timely and consistent health financing indica-
     tors, as a finding of this analytic process.

     3.	     The Government of Lao PDR, in the latest draft Health Financing Strategy 2014-
     25, has committed to increasing government health expenditure to 9 percent of over-
     all government expenditure by 2015.24 Unfortunately, this target includes both technical
     revenue and external financing which will make accountability for the target unclear and
     may indeed override important health sector goals such as financial protection. Technical
     revenues contribute towards OOP paid for by users of public health services, but may have
     implications on the access, financial risk protection, and equity. Furthermore, dependence
     on external financing given that Lao PDR has ascended the ranks of middle-income coun-
     tries appears to be an increasingly unsustainable solution. Clarity and accountability for
     this modest target would be improved by setting a specific target for domestically-sourced
     government health expenditure excluding technical revenues and external financing, espe-
     cially as actual and planned government expenditure is approaching this 9 percent target
     (see Figure 8, left).

4.	      In addition to the quantity of government health spending, the composition of
government health spending, which is heavily weighted towards capital and wages, also
needs to be considered. In Lao PDR, most government health spending is allocated towards
capital expenditure and wages, leaving little room for critical non-wage recurrent spending
(including purchasing critical health-related commodities and financing operational plans)
in an already tight resource environment. Capital expenditures have been relatively high,
averaging over 50 percent of government health spending in the past decade (with 80-90
percent of capital expenditures on health being externally financed). About 35 percent of
government health expenditures went to capital spending in FY 2013/14, and another 35
percent was wage-related recurrent expenditure. The remaining 30 percent was non-wage
recurrent expenditure, down from a generally about 35 percent share in previous years,
totaling LAK374 billion (≈US$6.7 per capita) in FY 2013/14. This low level of non-wage re-
current will have big implications for the provision of health care and bolstering supply-side
readiness, which is noted to be weak at health centers (as discussed in the next section).
In absolute terms, domestically-financed government health expenditure increased from
LAK65.7 billion in FY 2000/01 to LAK918 billion in FY 2013/14, representing an average
annual increase of 20 percent in nominal terms and 13 percent in real terms (Figure 9).
Planned domestically-financed government health spending in FY 2014/15 was LAK1,215
billion.

     5.	      Dependence on external financing also skews the apparent investments in capital,
     as all external financing is classified as capital expenditure. External sources of finance
     account for almost 90 percent of total capital expenditure, even if in reality, operational
     expenditures and the purchase of commodities are being financed. This will be discussed
     later in this policy note when analysis of data from health center surveys is presented.

     6.	     Domestically-sourced government health spending is increasingly focused on
     wages. This reverses a trend in which the share of non-wage spending in recurrent expen-
     ditures decreased from 41 percent in FY 2000/01 to 17 percent in FY 2006/07, but has
     been increasing steadily ever since and was 43 percent in FY 2013/14. There was a nota-
     ble reduction 30 percent jump in wage-related recurrent expenditure in FY 2011/12 from
     FY 2010/11, but this was matched by an increase in non-wage recurrent expenditure of
     a similar magnitude. This is discussed in a separate policy note in this series - Lao PDR
     Health Center Workforce Survey: Findings from a nationally-representative health center
     and health center worker survey.

     2013/14
                                                                                                           GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH IN LAO PDR                                                                                                 23



7.	     A further concern is the distribution of government health spending, which is
concentrated at the national-level, and inequitably distributed between provinces. In FY
2013/14, less than half (44 percent) of government health spending occurred at the sub-
national, that is, provincial and lower–level. Planned subnational expenditures on health
for FY 2014/15 were also roughly half of government health spending. In 2013/14, 100 per-
cent of subnational expenditure went to recurrent expenditure, of which 66 percent is wage
spending; this is possibly due to most of external capital expenditures being categorized as
central expenditure, even if it was spent at subnational levels.

8.	     Provinces differed not only in the share of total government spending dedicated
to health, but also in the actual amount spent per capita. Not surprisingly, provinces with
higher levels of overall government spending per capita also tend to spend more on health
(particularly, recurrent health expenditure) (see Figure 10). Some of this variation appro-
priately reflects an attempt to address inefficiencies. For example, per capita government
spending on health is higher in sparsely populated and poorer provinces such as Sekong and
Attapeu, where health needs are likely to be greater, as opposed to in wealthier provinces
such as Champassak, Savannakhet, and Vientiane Capital.

     9.	    Budget execution has been reasonable between FY 2007/08 and FY 2011/12, but
     since FY 2012/13, there have been large discrepancies in budget planning and execution –
     with actual spending far exceeding the budget plan in FY 2012/13 but this was followed by
     underspending by an equivalent quantum, thus reflecting weaknesses in the budget plan-
     ning and execution processes (see Figure 11).

5. A Financing Snapshot from Health Center Data
1.	      This section summarizes some health financing information collected from 120
health centers sampled as part of the UFGE-CNP survey 2013-14. The regional distribu-
tion of the sampled health centers is: 36 from the North region; 36 from the Central region;
and 48 from the South region. A total of 81 health centers were rural and the remaining 39
were urban.

     2.	      As part of the background on health center financing, the budgeting process in the
     health sector in Lao PDR is described (Figure 12). Budget preparation in Lao PDR begins at
     the district level (as health centers only make informal requests for resources but are not
     actively involved in the formal budget proposal procedures).25 Links between health centers
     and District Health Offices (DHOs) in the budget process can be significantly strengthened.
     Most health centers do not prepare or submit budget proposals nor discuss the annual
     budget with DHOs. DHOs receive guidance and instructions from Provincial Health Offices
     (PHO) on budget planning and use current, historical, and the proposed budget to decide on
     the total annual budget proposal. DHOs prepare annual budget plans and submit proposals
     to the District Finance Office (DFO) for approval, and to PHOs, for official acknowledge-
     ment. PHOs consolidate budgets received from DHOs without adjusting the proposed budg-
     ets and submit consolidated budget proposals to the Provincial Finance Office (PFO). PHOs
     also submit budget proposals to the MOH directly, although not for approval. PFOs receive
     health budget proposals from PHOs and DFOs, and submit provincial budget proposals,
     which include health budget proposals, to MOF. When PFOs receive budget approvals from
     MOF (generally as per approval by the National Assembly), they approve budgets to PHOs
     according to the budget ceiling the MOF has determined, although the MOH may reallocate
     funds within the sector. The budgets are then approved for transfer to DFOs, which in turn
     approve budgets to the DHOs. However, due to the often large difference in approved and
     proposed budgets, after receiving approval of annual budget by PFO, PHO officers submit
     quarterly budget proposals to request additional non-wage recurrent financing. Health fa-
     cilities at the district- and provincial-level are also required to transfer all technical revenue
     (from user fees) to the relevant DFO/PFO, and to submit a formal expenditure application
     to use these revenues although the finance office may decide to reallocate these to the non-
     profit generating sector.26

3.	      Health centers receive financing from five potential sources, as summarized in
Table 9, with the prominence of revolving drug fund (RDF) revenue and external financing
as the two largest sources of revenue, reflecting the national health financing context.
Prior to 1990, health services were provided for free at all health centers (and all public
hospitals) in Lao PDR. Limited financing for non-wage recurrent expenditure resulted in the
subsequent introduction of user fees and RDFs with nation-wide formalization of imple-
mentation of both policies in 1995. RDFs are implemented by the Ministry (and donors) and
provided initial financing for the purchase of drugs. RDF regulations and guidelines allow
facilities to charge a mark-up of 25 percent on the purchase price of drugs and other com-
modities, however a recent report indicates that adherence to this mark-up varied widely
and some facilities exceeded this 25 percent ceiling.28 Health facilities were given some
degree of flexibility in the use of revenues from user fees and RDFs. As noted above, budget-
ary transfers tend to primarily cover wage-related recurrent expenditures whereas facili-
ties rely on technical revenues and RDFs for non-wage recurrent expenditure, some capital
expenditure, and payments for contractual staff. In addition to RDFs, technical revenues,
and budgetary transfers, donors/NGOs and insurance reimbursements are two additional
sources of revenue for health centers.29

   As noted earlier, in recent years the government has removed user fees and RDFs for MCH and replaced them
   with utilization-based budgetary transfers to facilities. Large-scale introduction of this so-called free MCH
   policy began in 2013.

             vations31 and 818 outpatient attendances over a six-month study period (Table 10). Most
             outpatient visits were for child health services, followed by antenatal and postnatal care.
             Only about a third of DPT3 immunizations were conducted at health centers, the remainder
             occurring during outreach activities.

             5.	    Health centers reported average semi-annual revenues of LAK39.4 million and
             average semi-annual expenditures of LAK27.9 million. In per capita terms, based on the
             estimated catchment area population for each health center, semi-annualized revenues
             and expenditures – representing resources for non-wage recurrent purposes -- averaged
             around US$2-4 per capita per year, similar in magnitude to estimates derived from budget-
             ary data (see Table 11).

6.	     Almost all (97 percent) of the 120 UFGE-CNP survey health centers reported using
RDFs as a source of operational financing. This includes all the sampled health centers in
the North and Central regions and 92 percent of those in the South region that reported uti-
lizing RDFs.32 About 95 percent of rural and all urban health centers reported using RDFs.
Although there were variations across health centers, on average RDFs were also the larg-
est source of revenues for health centers. RDFs often sourced more than half of all non-
wage recurrent spending for many of health centers in the sample, consistent with previous
findings and those reported elsewhere.33 Health centers in the Central region generally had
the highest share of operating revenues coming from RDFs, followed by those in the North
and South regions. There was no significant different between RDFs sourcing shares among
rural and urban health centers.

     7.	     Despite dependence of health centers on RDF revenues, the availability of essen-
     tial medicines at health centers was generally poor indicating problems with planning,
     budgeting, and/or supply-chain management. Table 12 summarizes the availability of the
     WHO list of essential medicines across the sample of health facilities at the time of the sur-
     vey: the average availability of essential medicines was only 55 percent, with health cent-
     ers in the South region being worse than those in the North and Central regions. The differ-
     ences in average across urban and rural health centers were not significant. The availability
     of essential medicines such as diazepam, magnesium sulphate, metronidazole, enalapril,
     procaine benzyl penicillin, zinc tablets, and folic acid tablets was particularly low across all
     health centers. Almost none of the health centers in the sample reported availability of all
     medicines in the WHO list.

8.	     MOH and donors/NGOs were generally the second-most prominent source of rev-
enues in the sample, each accounting for about a 20 percent share. Health centers in the
South region tended to have a noticeably higher dependence on donor/NGOs for revenues
as compared to those in the North and Central regions. Rural health centers had a three-
fold higher share of revenues from donors/NGOs than did urban health centers. Table 13
summarizes the proportion of health centers reporting receiving support from selected do-
nors/NGOs. As can be seen, several donors such as UNICEF, Asian Development Bank, and
World Bank support recurrent expenditures such as for medicines/commodities, training,
and outreach activities at the health center level even though all external support is classi-
fied under capital expenditure in government budgetary classifications in the country.

9.	    Technical revenues and insurance payments were not a prominent source of rev-
enues, accounting for less than a 5-10 percent share across the 120 health centers.

10.	    Approximately 60 percent of expenditures at the health centers were reported
to be for “medicines and supplies”; 20 percent were for “routine maintenance”; and the
remaining 20 percent, on average, were utilized for staff incentives. Prior assessments
have highlighted important financial management capacity constraints that need to be
addressed to improve revenue management at central and local levels, including at health
centers.34

     6. Conclusions




     11.	    Lao PDR has made notable progress in improving maternal and child health out-
     comes and is on-track to attain maternal and child health-related MDGs, which com-
     pares performance today with a 1990 baseline. However, when compared across coun-
     tries, current MCH indicators in Lao PDR are some of the worst globally and in the EAP
     region. Furthermore, nutrition outcomes remain very poor with almost half of under-fives
     stunted; and Lao PDR is hence off-track with regard to attainment of nutrition-related
     MDGs. Although the MDG-agenda remains unfinished, Lao PDR is undergoing a rapid epi-
     demiological transition with the rise of NCDs associated with tobacco, indoor air pollution,
     and poor diet. In addition to poor outcomes, the distribution of outcomes is inequitable
     across socioeconomic dimensions such as income, ethnicity, and geography.

12.	     These poor and inequitable health outcomes are associated with low utilization of
health services, which vary by economic quintile, even among individuals already report-
ing illness. Further analysis of the LECS V (2012-13), in comparison with earlier LECS sur-
veys indicates that financial risk protection, as measured by the incidence of catastrophic
health spending (10 percent threshold), has worsened in 2012-13 to 5.0 percent from 3.8
percent in 2007-08. Ironically, due to inequitable utilization and access to health services,
the poorest quintile of households has a lower incidence of catastrophic expenditure com-
pared with the richest quintile.

13.	    These poor population-level health outcomes and financial risk protection meas-
ures are reflected in the health financing context of Lao PDR, where this policy note finds
extremely low (albeit increasing since FY 2012/13) levels of government expenditure on
health, which are associated with high levels of OOP expenditures (40 percent of THE in
2013) and high (given Lao PDR’s ascendency to middle-income-country status) reliance on
external financing, which has resulted in erratic year-by-year health expenditure trends
and a composition of health expenditure skewed towards capital expenditure. The compo-
sition of domestically-sourced health expenditure, meanwhile, has been directed increas-
ingly to wages (57 percent in FY 2013/14) rather than prioritizing the purchasing of health
commodities and operational budgets required under non-wage recurrent expenditures.

14.	    The distribution of government health expenditure is suboptimal – where less than
half of domestically-sourced health financing is directed at the subnational level – such
that only approximately US$1 per capita of non-wage recurrent health expenditure is al-
located at the subnational level, although there is substantial variation between provinces
(after per capita adjustments).

15.	    This policy note further presents new findings from the analysis of a nationally-
representative health center survey. Given the national health financing context, the find-
ings are unsurprising and confirm at the ground-level, the dependence of health centers on
revenues from RDFs (the sale, at a markup, of drugs to patients) and external donors, which
account for 58 percent and 20 percent of health center revenues (amounting to approxi-
mately US$2-4 per capita per year at the health center-level). The extraction of unpoooled
financing from end-users of the health system (in the form of user fees/technical revenue
or through RDFs) is antithetical to the stated objections of the government of Lao PDR to
attain UHC. Furthermore, despite the ability of health centers to extract revenue to cover
the purchase of drugs by imposing inequitable and inefficient OOP expenses on households,
the supply-side readiness of health centers – with significant deficiencies in life-saving ma-
ternal health drugs such as oxytocin and magnesium sulphate (present in only 80 percent
and 9 percent of health centers respectively) – is very weak.
34   GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH IN LAO PDR



     16.	     Recently announced increases in government health spending are welcome, al-
     though the inclusion of external financing and technical revenues in the 9 percent tar-
     get reduces the clarity (especially with regard to the aim to reduce OOP, as per the goals
     of UHC) and financial accountability (where neither the government nor donors would be
     incentivized to make commitments) of this target and these increases must also be ac-
     companied by increases in the efficiency of spending and accountability for results. With
     regard to increasing efficiency, this would require more than just a reduction in waste but
     equitable allocation of resources to the right level of service delivery (greater emphasis on
     frontline health service delivery units such as health centers and district hospitals), the
     right place (to remote and poor provinces and districts with the greatest needs), and the
     right mixtures of expenditures – to enable health workers to work optimally with appropri-
     ate capital investments and the availability of life-saving commodities to enable health
     workers to be effective. With regard to accountability for results, this should include focus
     on the level and equity of population health outputs/outcomes such as immunization rates,
     skilled birth attendance, institutional delivery rates, need-based outpatient and inpatient
     utilization rates, and adequate levels of financial protection from health shocks.

     17.	    Likewise, the policy directions of Lao PDR – in providing critical services free-of-
     user fees (for example, the free MCH policy) and in providing a package of services to
     specific vulnerable populations (for example, health equity funds for the poor) – are to be
     affirmed. However, these require greater accountability for results, greater supply-side in-
     vestments, and demand-side initiatives to increase the uptake of these services in remote
     and poor areas, as detailed in another policy note in this series - Maternal and Child Health
     Out-of-Pocket Expenditure and Service Readiness in Lao PDR: Evidence for the National
     Free Maternal and Child Health Policy from a Household and Health Center Survey (2013
     Update).

     18.	    The purchasing function of insurers needs to be further advanced, as the health
     insurance system evolves in Lao PDR. This would include appropriate credentialing, pro-
     vider payment mechanisms, and benefits packages, which should be strengthened to en-
     sure sustainable and high-quality health services (especially preventative services) are in-
     centivized for delivery to those most at need of these services.

     19.	    Finally, in order to allow key government policymakers to make timely and in-
     formed decisions, the health financing information systems need to be strengthened such
     that financing flows, accountability, and intended results should be detailed clearly across
     financing channels, providers, and beneficiaries. This should also allow for timely presenta-
     tion of policy and advocacy-relevant products such as the national health accounts and
     system of health accounts.
