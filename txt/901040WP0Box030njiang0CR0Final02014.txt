   1. Strategic Framework
      Xinjiang has identified WfD as a priority and established a high degree of
      coherence between WfD strategy and concomitant policies. Coordination in
      setting and implementing WfD policy is aided by clearly defined roles and
      responsibilities for all stakeholders, but the role of employers and other non-
      government stakeholders often does not extend beyond implementing
      government decisions. Policymakers have enough information on labor market
      conditions to make informed decisions, but assessments of economic
      development prospects and future skill needs are not systematic.

   2. System Oversight
      Xinjiang enforces strict accreditation of public and private training institutions and
      rigorously implements skills testing and certification. However, the lack of
      articulation agreements to facilitate transfer between education programs means
      that students sometimes find that their current qualifications will not allow them to
      progress to further education or change fields of study. Funding for TVET is
      increasing, but reviews of the impact of the procedures for allocating funds on
      efficiency are not undertaken on a regular basis, and efforts to leverage
      businesses as a source of resources are limited

   3. Service Delivery
      The public training sector, which comprises the vast majority of providers, is well
      managed. The major system strengths are the existence of institutionalized
      procedures for combining provider-level and labor market data to manage overall
      service provision and the use of industry inputs in the design of training
      programs. However, there is only limited use of incentives for providers to
      improve the quality and relevance of training programs and little diversity in
      pathways for skills acquisition.

   Data Processing and Scoring
  For each of the 27 Policy Actions, the information gathered

  rubrics correspond to four stages of maturity in policy and
  institutional development for WfD, as follows: (1) latent,
  (2) emerging, (3) established and (4) advanced. A summary
  description of the rubrics is given in Figure 3, while the
  details are explained in Annex 6.

  Note that, in order to conform to the standardized

Economic Trends
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is a large,
sparsely populated region with abundant natural
resources. It is an important province in China’s Northwest
region. In the past 10 years, Xinjiang has achieved rapid
economic development. In 2010, Xinjiang’s GDP reached
543.75 billion Yuan (US$ 80.4 billion), and per capita GDP
reached 25,034 Yuan (US$ 3,700). However, these figures
are still below the national average. Xinjiang’s economy
makes up only 1.36 percent of the national GDP, and its
per capita GDP is about 5,000 Yuan (US$ 740) below the
                     4
national average. In addition, its pace of economic
growth has been slower than the national average; from
2001 to 2010, the average per capita GDP growth rate in                  Source: Chinese Statistical Yearbook 2002 to 2011
Xinjiang was only 8.6 percent, whereas the national
average was 9.8 percent (see Figure 4). This economic
feature is related to the existing sectoral structure of
Xinjiang’s economy, and also to the current workforce
status in Xinjiang.
Compared with the national economy, the ratio of the
primary sector’s contribution to GDP in Xinjiang is greater
than that of the national average, while the ratio of the
secondary sector is almost the same as the national

The supply of a skilled workforce by the TVET system has
not yet played an important role in Xinjiang compared to
the national average. The National Bureau of Statistics
and HRSS divide the sources of total new labor market
entrants in urban areas for each province each year into
“recruited from the countryside”, “recruited from cities
and towns”, “recruited demobilized and transferred
soldiers”, “recruited TVET graduates”, “transferred into”
               17
and “others”. Figure 10 shows the percentage of TVET
graduates among new entrants. The percentage of
employed TVET graduates against total urban incremental
employment in Xinjiang increased rapidly from 7.6
percent in 2006 to 14.2 percent in 2011. However, it is
still lagging behind the national average, which shows
that, compared with other provinces, TVET in Xinjiang
does not serve as a strong contributor in providing
qualified workers.
Xinjiang’s TVET system, especially vocational colleges,
have expanded rapidly in the past 10 years, but additional
improvements in quality and capacity will be necessary to
support the government’s goal of creating a more skilled
workforce to support Xinjiang’s economic and social
development. The Xinjiang government has thus defined
TVET development objectives in various plans. It intends
to reach a 50:50 balance between student enrolled in
general and vocational tracks by 2015, and catch up with
the national average level and the advanced level in the
western region in 2020 in terms of quality. To achieve
such objectives, it is necessary to systematically examine
the Xinjiang TVET system, to identify its strengths and
weaknesses in the context of global best practices, and
then determine relevant and effective measures.

To solve these problems, the government has put more
investment into infrastructure construction, opened up
employment opportunities through public works projects,
organized     regular   employment     exchanges and
recruitment fairs, and promulgated a series of policy
documents on training subsidies, promoting access to
training, and improving the environment for investment in
TVET, among others. Meanwhile, a series of targeted
training programs have been implemented, including re-
employment training for redundant urban workers,
employment readiness training for rural residents,
employment training for rural migrants, on-the-job skills
improvement training for enterprise employees, and
entrepreneurship training.     The Special Subsidy for
Employment funding mechanism has also been
established, which has subsidized employment
intermediation, vocational training, social insurance,
public welfare jobs and the development of occupational
competencies. At the same time, efforts have been made
to speed up basic capacity building for vocational
education. Eight practical training bases and four TVET
parks have been set up for the key industries and sectors
in the province.

Build high quality pre-school and compulsory education.
High quality TVET builds on high quality pre-school and
compulsory education as these provide children with a
good start and solid foundation for further training and
life-long learning; it is therefore critical for Xinjiang to
have good pre-school and compulsory education.
Based on the above analysis, pilot projects and research,
some new regulations and legislation should be initiated
to achieve quality assurance, monitoring and evaluation,
and multilateral cooperation. Furthermore, it is necessary
to strengthen life-long learning by ensuring that basic
education is fully integrated into the system.

 21 A holistic approach is one that addresses multiple dimensions of skills development, including: (a) aligning skills training to employers’ needs and national goals for productivity, growth and
 poverty reduction; (b) governing the system to achieved the desired national goals, and (c) ensuring tangible results on the ground.
 22 In a demand-driven strategy, the demand for skills drives the supply of training services. Arrangements to achieve this relationship between skills supply and demand include: the involvement

 of employers in shaping training policies and provision, financing tied to employment outcomes, etc.

This report is the product of staff at the World Bank comprising Liping Xiao and Jin Song (senior education
specialist and labour economics consultant, respectively, East Asia and Pacific Region Human Development
Sector Department), as well as Jee-Peng Tan and Ryan Flynn (leader and member, respectively, of the SABER-
WfD team based in the Education Department of the Human Development Network). Liping Xiao led a research
team under the China Programmatic AAA on Xinjiang TVET Study. The research team collected and analysed
socio-economic and education data both at national and provincial levels and conducted field visits in Xinjiang to
build partnership with local authorities and researchers. Zhihui Jin’s team from the Government of Xinjiang’s
Education Department played the coordinating role with government departments, schools, research
institutions and enterprises. Lei Shen from Urumqi Vocational University was responsible for data collection
using the SABER-WfD instrument under guidance of and with personal involvement of the research team. Liping
Xiao and Jin Song wrote the report. All the comments had been incorporated into the final report. The Bank
SABER-WfD team scored the data, designed the template for the report and made substantive contributions to
the final write up.
Broad consultations had been conducted with government officials, school teachers and administrators, and
researchers in Xinjiang and Beijing. The research team acknowledges the support of all who have contributed to
the report and its findings, including informants, participants at various consultation workshops. The team
benefited from valuable discussion with Eduardo Velez Bustillo and Shuchao Ma. The team also benefited from
comments from Xiaonan Cao, Rita Costa, and Nalin Jena. The team is grateful to Gaifen Qu from the Xinjiang
Education Department for making arrangements for field visits and workshops. Kenneth H. Ashworth thoroughly
reviewed and proofread the English version of the report. In preparing the report, the team was ably supported
by Tao Su as well as members of the SABER-WfD team at the World Bank: Rita Costa, Viviana Gomez, Lorelei
Lacdao, Joy Yoo-Jeung Nam, Brent Parton and Alexandria Valerio. The research team gratefully acknowledges
the generous financial support of the Government of the United Kingdom through its Partnership for Education
Development (PFED) with the World Bank, which makes it possible for HDNED’s SABER-WfD team to provide
technical support in the form of standardized tools for and guidance on data collection, analysis and reporting.

   The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative
   produces comparative data and knowledge on education policies and
   institutions, with the aim of helping countries systematically strengthen
   their education systems. SABER evaluates the quality of education
   policies against evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic
   tools and detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all
   parties with a stake in educational results—from administrators,
   teachers, and parents to policymakers and business people—an
   accessible, objective snapshot showing how well the policies of their
   country's education system are oriented toward ensuring that all
   children and youth learn.

   This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of Workforce
   Development.
