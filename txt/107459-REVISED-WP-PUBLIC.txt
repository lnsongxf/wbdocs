Overview
 Highlights
  When middle-income countries experience situations of fragility, conflict, and violence, providing
    assistance can be a challenge for the World Bank Group. The government may have its own
    views on how and when to tackle the underlying issues, or may be reluctant to increase its
    borrowing to correct what may be seen as a localized or temporary problem.
  Through examining such cases, IEG concludes that the World Bank Group’s comparative
   advantage is supporting countries in tackling longer-term development challenges, including
   early engagement and a sustained presence in conflict-affected areas, as well as continuous
   dialogue with the parties to violent conflicts, where possible.
  The World Bank has been adept at responding and at adjusting its strategies and analytical
   support to situations of violence and conflict, but its operational response has been constrained
   by its limited menu of instrument choices. Moreover, institutional and staff incentives to engage
   in conflict situations and to take risks seem to be lagging the spirit of its strategic approach, as
   expressed in various Bank documents, including the 2011 World Development Report on
   conflict, security, and development.
  The community-driven development model has often provided the World Bank Group with a
   point of entry in conflict-affected areas. Though it has not addressed the causes and
   consequences of violence, the approach has been useful as a form of establishing a presence
   and contextual learning to support more ambitious efforts once peace is restored.
  The World Bank Group can further enhance its impact in these situations by exploring
   opportunities beyond supporting livelihoods in conflict-affected communities, including support
   for private sector development, using its expertise in public financial management more
   effectively, and improving its monitoring and evaluation frameworks.

Management Response
The Management of the World Bank Group institutions welcomes the evaluation of
the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) entitled World Bank Group Engagement in
Situations of Fragility, Conflict, and Violence. Overall the evaluation is useful for
identifying lessons from experience and understanding the World Bank Group’s
contributions in providing solutions to cope with situations of fragility, conflict, and
violence (FCV) in mostly middle-income countries (MICs).

The evaluation rightly asserts that, given the current global context, conflict and
violence are no longer primarily a low-income country problem. The evaluation
recognizes the progress the World Bank Group has made in addressing issues of
conflict and violence, more systematically discussing the political economy around
these issues, and developing analytical and operational instruments to provide
support. As the report acknowledges, the theme of conflict and violence, including
in cases of subnational conflict, has become “more apparent in country strategies.”

Management broadly agrees with all recommendations of the IEG evaluation.
Management’s views are summarized below, and the detailed responses to the IEG
recommendations are presented in the Management Action Record.


World Bank Management Comments
STRATEGIC PRESENCE
The report rightly points out that the World Bank’s sustained physical presence in
conflict-affected areas is crucial. As the World Development Report 2011 noted,
breaking cycles of violence requires a long-term process of creating legitimate
institutions. Ensuring sustained engagement, presence, and continuity is indeed a
critical element for successful work in conflict-affected areas, as the World Bank’s
recent experience shows.1 An important operational point to consider is how the
World Bank’s presence can continue even during periods of political crises. In this
context, it is important to forge close links with a wide range of actors on the
ground, from nongovernmental organizations and academics to labor unions and
media. There are several examples of continued and sustained technical assistance

engagements, including some in extremely difficult circumstances, in which the
World Bank is playing a leading role in strengthening local capacity.

Management agrees that the regional dimensions of FCV situations are increasingly
important. Contemporary fragility is characterized less by interstate wars than by
civil conflicts, violence, and transnational crimes, with regional spillovers and global
implications. Because localized conflicts can trigger regionwide conflicts and
destabilize neighboring countries, it is necessary to take regionwide approaches to
conflict resolution and management. Therefore, the World Bank Group’s approach
incorporates the multidimensional nature of FCV, internal risk factors and stresses,
and regional/external risks from spillovers.2 For the World Bank, the task is to
strengthen its ability to engage on fragility issues at the regional level, in terms of
both analysis (e.g., through regional fragility assessments) and appropriate
financing, and to build the necessary partnerships to be able to effectively contribute
to a broader, multidimensional international engagement.

OPERATIONAL RESPONSE
Management has taken steps to strengthen the overall organizational structure to
effectively deliver on the World Bank's FCV agenda. The FCV Cross-Cutting
Solutions Areas (CCSA) has a substantive role in coordinating the institutional
approach of the World Bank in FCV issues. It also has a major role in providing
inputs to policies related to FCV strategy and operations. The FCV CCSA was
created in FY15 to support the World Bank Group’s strategic engagement in FCV
situations; provide knowledge management, cross-country support, and experience-
sharing in addressing drivers of fragility; strengthen partnerships; and improve the
World Bank Group’s response to the forced displacement crisis. Recently the FCV
CCSA has strengthened a global operations support team in Nairobi, and it has
assigned dedicated specialists to FCV countries to augment country engagement
and coordination with development partners.

Management plans to fine-tune the fragility measurement instrument. Regarding the
call for redefining and fine-tuning the fragility measurement instruments, in 2015
the FCV CCSA initiated analytical work to improve the metric for identifying
fragility. The starting point of the exercise was the need to capture fragility beyond
the fragile states list and permit a view beyond static situations that only depict
outcomes. The expanded metric framework will capture fragility across multiple

2
 For example, the Middle East and North Africa strategy recognizes that a reduction in conflict in
any one country will benefit the Region as well as other countries. Peace and stability in the Region
are hence global public goods, and a global coalition is required to pool resources and expertise to
bring them about.


                                                                                                        xv
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


dimensions by using a combination of key indicators on adverse outcomes and risk
flags based on the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA); the gross
national income per capita cutoff is not applied. The data on adverse outcomes will
be made public, and will allow the World Bank to answer with greater precision
such questions as how many people live in FCV situations. The risk factors scan
through the CPIA flags described above is meant to be an internal tool, since CPIA
ratings are not disclosed for MICs. Also, any risk scan can only be indicative. It will
not be able to provide a detailed and nuanced understanding of the nature of the
fragility in FCV countries. To identify fragility risks, the World Bank will draw its
information from several sub indicators of the CPIA, complemented by other robust
indicators of fragility and qualitative assessments produced by internationally
recognized and specialized organizations. Such information will constitute the basis
on which the World Bank Group will engage clients in discussions on potential risk
management and prevention.

Management welcomes IEG’s finding that the FCV diagnostic was useful and
relevant, when it was used. The evaluation suggests that such diagnostic work
should be more systematically built into FCV operations, and Management agrees
that this would be useful. During the 18th Replenishment of the International
Development Association (IDA) and beyond, the World Bank Group will continue
to address fragility in countries on the Harmonized List of Fragile and Conflict-
affected Situations. It will also adopt an expanded approach to identify and address
the fragility dynamic than can persist in countries not on the list. To gain more in-
depth understanding of the issues at play in such countries, the World Bank Group
will undertake detailed fragility assessments or similar diagnostics (also increasingly
referred to as Assessment of Risks and Resilience) as part of the Systematic Country
Diagnostic (SCD) and Country Partnership Framework (CPF) process to be applied
systematically in countries where fragility is a threat to the achievement of the
strategic objectives of reducing poverty and sharing prosperity.

The value of the community-driven development (CDD) approach goes well beyond
establishing a presence and contextual learning. CDD operations in FCV settings
have provided a local platform for inclusive dialogue about development; opened
space for line agencies (which often cannot enter the areas for security reasons) to
connect with local communities through subproject support; helped establish
positive relationships with rebel groups; and enhanced the World Bank’s credibility,
trust, and acceptance by state and nonstate actors through building partnerships.
Management agrees with the report’s finding that creating opportunities for
generating employment and local entrepreneurial success are important. Support to
the education sector can address psychosocial issues among children and provide
safe spaces for integration and community cohesion to develop. Policy advice on

budgeting and fiscal decentralization also deserves more attention, especially since
the World Bank has proven technical expertise and experience with such analysis.

Management agrees that FCV-sensitive operational responses require a core
program that effectively translates diagnostics into programming. However, there is
no one-size-fits-all approach to preventing, managing, and mitigating FCV. What
constitutes FCV-sensitive programming can be determined only at the country level.
Program approaches may include mainstreaming sensitivity to FCV across the
portfolio, incorporating activities that address the direct outcomes of FCV, or
directly tackling the drivers of FCV. Further effort is needed to develop innovative
operations that address key drivers of FCV, either to avoid an occurrence of FCV in
the first place or to prevent its recurrence. This effort should include, among other
things, consideration of various sectoral efforts or approaches (e.g., CDD, fiscal
decentralization, private sector development, education, provision of justice) to
address the economic drivers of conflict (e.g., corruption, access to land, political
participation, exclusion or discrimination). The FCV-CCSA is preparing a note on
operationalizing fragility that will outline a shared understanding of how the World
Bank Group can assess a country’s vulnerability to FCV and prepare programs that
sets out feasible pathways for inclusive peace and development. However, it will not
attempt to prescribe a standard or comprehensive response to FCV situations.

Management agrees with the need to strengthen monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
frameworks and to record positive experiences for better assessment of results and
learning from projects. However, M&E in FCV countries faces several challenges,
including dearth of baseline data, potential political sensitivity in data collection,
and the difficulty of defining appropriate measures of near-term progress for
institutional reforms. Despite these challenges, there are hopeful signs that new tools
and technologies will help overcome some of these challenges to better monitor and
evaluate results—for example, the explosion of new information communication
technologies; unprecedented increases in phone and Internet connectivity;
availability of low-cost, web-based tools and information; use of the services of
third-party monitoring agents; and modern monitoring techniques using remote
sensing and satellite imagery analysis. Management has also produced a Pilot
Toolkit, accompanied by a searchable FCV indicator database, designed to assist
teams in measuring peace-building and state-building progress. The toolkit is an
interactive resource to help inform strategic and operational results frameworks and
enhance practical data collection efforts.

Management is committed to further strengthening the partnership with
development partners in FCV issues. Management welcomes the report’s reference
to the commitments made in 2011 at the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid

Effectiveness in Busan. The main thrust of the “New Deal for Engagement with
Fragile States,” endorsed by development partners at that meeting, was that
achieving any substantial progress is unlikely without country ownership and
leadership, and inclusive political dialogue.3 The New Deal also called on donors to
work more transparently and make real progress in coordinating their efforts under
country leadership, while also using aid to strengthen and use country systems as
much as possible with a view toward building countries’ capacity. The report also
refers to the World Bank’s partnership with the United Nations, which remains our
primary international partner for fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS). This
partnership has evolved, moving gradually from a focus on post-conflict recovery
and reconstruction (and assumptions of clearly phased linear progress) to an
approach that addresses challenges of fragility, peace-building, and institutional
strengthening. A key area of focus will be the increasingly important
humanitarian/development nexus, an area where both institutions are engaging at
the highest levels.

Management agrees that there is a need to develop innovative financing
mechanisms and to leverage the use of the existing instruments or fast-response
facilities. There are also challenges related to speed and flexibility in responding to
crises or conflict situations and mobilizing sufficient resources for post-conflict
reconstruction. In light of the World Bank Group’s work on redefining fragility,
there is interest in exploring innovative ways to mobilize and delivering financing
for FCV in MICs; for example, the Middle East and North Africa Region is
establishing a Concessional Financing Facility to provide refugee host countries with
access to finance on more concessional terms than International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development financing.4 The report makes a case for the need to
set aside specific financing to be mobilized rapidly as needed for FCV interventions
in nonfragile countries. Such interventions have often been supported by the State-

  The New Financing Initiative to Support the Middle East and North Africa was established in
October 2015 during the World Bank Group–IMF Annual Meetings in Lima, Peru. The working
group formed then, co-chaired by the United Nations, the World Bank Group, and the Islamic
Development Bank Group, is now developing a roadmap for implementation. The approach proposes
blending contributions from supporting countries with lending from implementation support agencies
(a broad range of partners, including multilateral development banks) to improve the concessionality
of development financing. It integrates blending arrangements with a financing facility that can
provide coordination and oversight. The World Bank Group would act as the trustee for a financial
intermediary fund, receiving contributions from supporting countries, holding and investing these
funds, and transferring funds to implementation support agencies (including United Nations
agencies).

and Peace-Building Fund (SPF), as the fund’s eligibility criteria allow for support to
all borrowing countries regardless of country classification. We also agree on using
global FCV thematic trust funds while boosting their agility, as well as on the merits
of starting with small pilots. Management will explore appropriate modalities for
high-risk investments in FCV situations, particularly in MICs.

Management agrees with the finding that multi-donor trust funds (MDTFs) are
“vital strategic tools in conflict regions, but their effectiveness can be enhanced by
stronger links to the rest of the World Bank portfolio.” The overall impact of IDA
resources in fragile and conflict-affected situations has been greatly enhanced by
mobilizing complementary resources through trust fund support, at both the
country level through MDTFs and at a global level through funds such as the SPF.
The availability of additional trust fund resources has allowed the financing of (i)
seed interventions in non-IDA-eligible countries and countries in arrears (e.g.,
Somalia); (ii) innovative high-risk schemes that lay the groundwork for impactful
follow-up IDA investments; (iii) regional and global initiatives to build the evidence
base and share knowledge on emerging themes; and (iv) partnership initiatives (e.g.,
with the United Nations or under the New Deal). Trust funds have also helped
nonfragile countries cope with negative spillovers from fragile neighbors. In some
countries, such as Afghanistan, IDA has helped to leverage additional trust fund
resources.


IFC Management Comments
Management of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) welcomes the IEG
evaluation World Bank Group Engagement in Situations of Fragility, Conflict, and
Violence, highlighting the World Bank Group’s efforts in countries that were not
classified as FCS and experienced localized or externally imposed situations of FCV
at the time of the evaluation. IFC staff appreciates the engagement with IEG
throughout the preparation of the report and believes that this report will provide a
useful platform for further discussions with a view to improving the effectiveness of
operations in fragile situations. More outreach to IFC teams during the field visits
would have provided the IEG team better opportunities to learn first-hand about
IFC’s efforts on the ground.

IFC Management broadly agrees with the report’s recommendations. Regarding the
institutional approach to FCV situations, it is important to note that IFC adopted
some enhancements as of January 2017 in line with IFC 3.0 strategy. A new Vice
Presidency for Blended Finance and Partnerships includes a new FCS/IDA Unit
(building on the former IFC FCS Coordination Unit), which now provides cohesive

oversight to IFC’s support for private sector development in fragile situations,
including several FCV countries. The FCS/IDA Coordination Unit remains in
routine communications and close engagement with FCV CCSA and an FCS
Network of more than 400 IFC and other World Bank Group staff focused on private
sector development in FCS. It also continues to support and coordinate IFC’s
business in fragile situations through focal points in all IFC operational departments
and key support units. As IFC aims to ramp up support for fragile situations and
other challenging markets, including through the deployment of the IDA18 Private
Sector Window, IFC Management believes that this institutional set-up will enable
efficient information flows between IFC’s central team and operational departments
and creates strong links between strategy and operations.

To the extent that the evaluation stresses a strong distinction between FCS and FCV
countries, IFC’s focus at the corporate level has been on FCS, which is among IFC’s
current strategic priorities. Over the five years through FY16, IFC’s new investment
commitments in FCS countries have increased to average at over $800 million per
year, including mobilization, and IFC’s annual advisory expenditure has averaged
over $40 million. IFC has been an integral part of the international effort to move
fragile states away from the margins, enabling them to entrench stability and
growth. In partnership with the World Bank, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA), and other development partners and clients, IFC has been striving
to stimulate private investment and growth in fragile situations. IFC believes that
economic growth and employment can make a significant contribution to reducing
fragility. The private sector plays a key role, providing 90 percent of jobs in
developing countries. Private companies often deliver essential goods and services
in fragile situations, and create tax revenues for governments. That said, however,
many fragile situations also suffer from extremely challenging business
environments. Firms in those situations cite access to power, access to finance and
political instability as the top three barriers to growth. For this reason, alleviating the
barriers to business growth underpins IFC’s strategy in fragile situations.

As the report highlights, IFC has been also providing diverse types of relevant
support for fragile situations in countries not classified as FCS. In IFC, such support
has been developed and provided at a regional and country level, given the unique
challenges and more localized and often rapidly evolving nature of those situations.
This evaluation provides an opportunity for IFC to consider enhanced approaches,
including more corporate efforts and cross-fertilization among its teams engaging
with the private sector and other stakeholders in FCV situations.

Management agrees that fragility assessments are useful tools that the World Bank
Group has used in certain country strategy processes when it was determined

                                                                  MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


appropriate. IFC is also piloting some additional analytical work, complementary to
Risk and Resilience Assessments and aimed at adapting the fragility assessments to
private sector needs. The IFC team will continue collaborating with the World Bank
and MIGA in developing SCDs and CPFs in countries characterized by FCV. With
respect to developing a new multidimensional system of markers and flags for
monitoring and measuring fragility, including in non-FCS countries, IFC is
monitoring with strong interest the fragility markers that FCV CCSA is developing.

As the evaluation found, IFC does generally maintain more engagement in FCV
areas post-conflict. However, as the report recognizes, when fragility, conflict, or
violence is not completely over, this can pose challenges as it limits IFC’s presence
on the ground, which is key to local market intelligence and IFC’s understanding of
the situation. Without a minimum level of security and stability, investment is
impossible, or inadvisable.

Management also agrees that a holistic and sequenced approach to private sector
development in FCV situations is critical. In this regard, IFC will seek to increase
collaboration with the World Bank, MIGA, and other key institutions, in particular,
to strengthen government and private sector capacity and develop new tools to “de-
risk” projects and crowd-in private capital.

Regarding IFC’s operational response, first, Management agrees that specially
designed products would facilitate support for the private sector in fragile and
conflict environments. The IFC FCS Risk Envelope is an example of a program that
is specifically designed to help stimulate more investments in FCS and increase
IFC’s development impact in these most difficult operating environments by
allowing teams to take additional, defined risks. IFC will also further explore ways
to deploy donor funds and blended finance in FCV situations in a speedy manner, as
appropriate, building on its successful access, including at the Ebola outbreak.

Second, IFC will continue to engage with the World Bank and MIGA in the
SCD/CPF process for enhancing private sector development in FCV-affected areas
(through a more customized approach to risk assessment, project mix, policies, and
procedures). Management agrees that it would be helpful to improve coordination
and information-sharing within the World Bank Group, with attention to the areas
mentioned. In this regard, IFC looks forward to the findings of the upcoming IEG
evaluation of SCD/CPF processes. Management is committed to advancing and
improving the M&E framework in FCV situations and believes that greater
flexibility, with room for adjustment during project/program implementation,
would allow adapting to evolving conditions. IFC has started to test this with its
FCS M&E framework. Finally, regarding partnerships, Management is pleased to

note that IFC teams have been developing various partnerships and exchange and
collaboration mechanisms with bilateral and multilateral organizations that would
help IFC’s support for FCV situations.


MIGA Management Comments


MIGA Management welcomes the IEG evaluation report World Bank Group
Engagement in Situations of Fragility, Conflict, and Violence. In the absence of accepted
criteria for classifying nonfragile MICs facing situations of fragility, conflict, and
violence, the evaluation has proposed choosing a group of countries using four
parameters: (i) prolonged and widely publicized episodes of conflict and violence;
(ii) presence of significant World Bank Group programs; (iii) different levels of
income and institutional capability; and (iv) representation from different global
regions. MIGA notes that this classification system could be useful in identifying
other FCV situations.

The report concludes that MIGA’s political risk insurance products are a useful tool
that can help facilitate foreign direct investment when a country faces FCV
situations, including at the subnational level, and the use of these products can be
further expanded. While agreeing with this assessment in principle, MIGA notes the
need to be cognizant of its demand-driven business model. Even so, the jointness
envisaged under the World Bank Group’s New Country Engagement Approach
provides the potential for proactive MIGA engagement in FCV situations. MIGA
also notes its ongoing interactions with the FCV CCSA for operational work.
Regarding the report’s suggestion of MIGA’s non-honoring of sovereign financial
obligations (NHSFO) coverage as relevant to FCV situations, MIGA notes that the
stringent requirements for NHSFO guarantee projects are likely to be challenging in
FCV situations with diminished state capacity and effectiveness.

Chairperson’s Summary: Committee on
Development Effectiveness
The Committee on Development Effectiveness discussed the report of the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) entitled World Bank Group Engagement in
Situations of Fragility, Conflict, and Violence: An Independent Evaluation and the draft
response by Management of the World Bank Group institutions.

The committee welcomed the evaluation and was pleased that Management broadly
concurred with the report’s findings and recommendations. Members noted the
timeliness of the discussion in the context of the Forward Look, the 18th
Replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA18), and the
general reassessment of the World Bank Group’s engagement model in fragile and
conflict situations. The committee commended the engagement to date of
Management of the World Bank Group institutions, acknowledging the implicit
challenges to long-term development success in settings of fragility, conflict, and
violence (FCV). Members highlighted the World Bank Group’s response to the call
of the IDA deputies for the World Bank to “innovate and do everything it can to be a
critical implementation agent for achieving the 2030 Agenda.” They welcomed the
World Bank Group’s progress in tackling FCV in middle-income countries more
strategically, in consolidating the FCV cross-cutting solutions areas, and
mainstreaming FCV strategy and knowledge into Global Practices and World Bank
Group projects.

Members noted that success in FCV situations requires sound knowledge of local
conditions and a deep understanding of the political context as well as of the drivers
of violence and conflict; being responsive and agile to detect fragile situations at
country and regional levels; and shifting resources and instruments into new
priorities. They indicated that a better understanding of potential weaknesses and
the challenges of remaining engaged would allow the World Bank Group to be more
selective in its approach, despite potential operational, fiduciary, and reputational
risks. The Committee supported mainstreaming a strategic, long-term approach that
would include a new agile engagement model in these countries. Members
acknowledged Management’s effort to update its existing tools, such as the “Risk
and Resilience Assessment” to assess impediments to country stability and
sustainability. This new model would take into account political economy issues and
include a multidimensional system for monitoring and diagnosing fragility and
creating cross-cutting solutions for fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS) and
FCV, where possible. Members expressed concerns regarding the mismatch of

available resources to address fragility challenges and inquired about the World
Bank Group’s prevention work.

Members urged Management to address the regional drivers of fragility, particularly
with respect to disabling effects of cross-border spillover. They encouraged
Management to address M&E system weaknesses. They underscored the importance
of integrating the new multidimensional publicly disclosed system for monitoring
and measuring fragility into Systematic Country Diagnostics and Country
Partnership Frameworks. Members stressed the importance of enhancing local
institutional capacity and considering the potentialities offered by South-South
knowledge exchange. They acknowledged the World Bank Group’s strategic
advantages and capacity to assist affected countries in the long-term development
challenges, including in creating and consolidating legitimate institutions and
strengthening governance.

Members underscored the need to develop innovative financing mechanisms and to
leverage the use of existing instruments or fast-response facilities. They encouraged
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to move beyond the definition of FCS
and incorporate FCV challenges into its strategy. They urged IFC and the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency to play more significant roles to attract
and maintain private sector investment. The committee also highlighted the
importance of building strong partnerships not only with the United Nations but
with multilateral development banks (MDBs) and local institutions and underscored
the importance of donor division of labor based on respective comparative
advantages. Management informed the committee of ongoing progress including a
joint study with other MDBs on migrations issues, and with the United Nations and
think tanks on building sustainable peace and development.

Evaluation Objectives and Coverage
Context. Fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV) are known to have significant
adverse impacts on economic development and poverty levels. According to the
2011 World Development Report (WDR) on conflict, security, and development
(World Bank 2011), countries that experienced major violence over the period 1981
to 2005 had poverty rates 21 percentage points higher than those that did not
experience significant violence. The Institute for Economics and Peace estimated the
cost to the world economy of containing violence at $14.3 trillion in 2014, or almost
13.4 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP).1

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recognize the
importance to human development of peace and effective governance, and SDG 16
proposes to “promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development,
provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive
institutions at all levels.” This expansive goal implies that fragility is no longer seen
as restricted to fragile states; in fact, fragility and violence affect nearly all states, and
if all types of violence are included, in particular, organized criminal violence, FCV
can be seen as primarily a middle-income country (MIC) problem.

The development community has often linked fragility and violence with a
country’s lack of development progress. However, instances of organized violence
in MICs have recently exceeded those in low-income countries, suggesting that it is
no longer primarily a LIC problem (Figure 1.1). Today, violence or the imminent
threat of violence affect development outcomes for almost 2 billion people, 37
percent of whom live in higher-MICs and 37 percent in lower-MICs, with the
remaining 25 percent in LICs.2

The commitments made at the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness
(Busan 2011) included the “New Deal for Engagement with Fragile States”.
Although the document refers specifically to FCS, some of the New Deal principles
are equally applicable to MICs. In particular, the document noted that achieving any
substantial progress is unlikely without country ownership, leadership and
inclusive political dialogue. It also called on development partners to work more
transparently and make real progress in pooling their efforts in support of country
leadership, while also using aid to strengthen and use country systems as much as
possible with a view of building state capacities.

destabilizing effects on a country are usually obvious and long-lasting. But violence
that creates localized pockets of insecurity can also pose considerable local and
national challenges. These situations may not always present an immediate threat to
the overall stability of the country, but they do have far-reaching development
consequences, harming the economy and resulting in loss of life, disability, and
displacement.

Hence, helping country clients to address the challenges of organized violence is an
important component of the World Bank Group Strategy (World Bank 2013) and
will be essential to achieving its twin goals: to end poverty and promote shared
prosperity.3 However, MICs are typically reluctant to engage in dialogue on
subregional conflicts, and the World Bank Group, by virtue of its limited lending to
these countries, has little leverage to push such engagement. Moreover, exiting from
fragility and violence is complex and difficult to achieve and sustain. The 2011 WDR
suggests that the high road to peace and prosperity is best approached through a
consensual form of politics featuring inclusive political coalitions, credible signals of
intent, and the development of accountable institutions. Desirable as this may be, it
is the road less travelled in the early stabilization and recovery trajectories of low-
income fragile states, where the historical record show that post-colonial
stabilization in low-income countries was frequently achieved through judicious
admixtures of authoritarian governance and economic patronage. It can indeed be
argued that the 2011 WDR's exit narrative has greater applicability in MICs, with

generally more advanced institutions and higher capacity supported by emerging
middle classes. However, MIC governments tend to consider such internal political
challenges as outside the remit of the World Bank.

In 2014 the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) undertook an evaluation of World
Bank Group activities in LICs that were classified as fragile and conflict-affected
(FCS).4 World Bank Group management has developed an implementation plan for
the recommendations of that evaluation and implementation of the plan is
underway. At the concept stage of that evaluation IEG agreed with management
and the Board that it would be complemented by an evaluation of World Bank
Group activities in countries not classified as FCS. This evaluation fulfills that
request.


 Box 1.1. IEG Evaluation of World Bank Group Assistance to Low-Income Fragile and Conflict-
 Affected States (2014): Main Findings and Recommendations
 The evaluation examined the relevance and effectiveness of World Bank Group country
 assistance strategies and assistance programs to 'fragile and conflict-affected states' (FCS)
 over the period 2001–2012. Operations in FCS are more resource intensive and require
 customized operational approaches. Reforms in the World Bank’s policies since 1997 led
 to enhanced financial and staff resources and greater managerial attention in FCS. As a
 result, portfolio performance in low-income FCS at the end of the review period was
 better than in low-income countries that were not FCS.
 The evaluation found that the World Bank has been most responsive to FCS in the
 immediate aftermath of violent conflict. However, classification of FCS is not based on
 political economy and violent conflict risks, and country assistance strategies often lack
 realism and tailoring to those risks. Gender issues are increasingly integrated in sector
 programs, but Bank assistance has paid insufficient attention to conflict-related violence
 against women and economic empowerment of women in FCS. CDD has been a useful
 vehicle for short-term assistance in FCS but needs institutions to ensure program
 sustainability. The World Bank Group lacks a realistic framework for inclusive growth
 and jobs that is based on economic opportunities and constraints in FCS and effective
 coordination and synergies across World Bank Group institutions.
 To enhance the relevance and effectiveness of its assistance to FCS, the evaluation
 recommends that the World Bank Group adjust its strategy, approach, and product mix
 by: developing a more suitable and accurate mechanism to classify FCS; tailoring country
 strategies to fragility and conflict contexts; providing support for state capacity building
 at national and subnational levels; enhancing the institutional sustainability of
 community development programs; addressing the effects of violence against women;
 developing a more realistic framework for inclusive growth and jobs; and adapting the
 business models, incentives, and systems of the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
 and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) to the needs of FCS.

EVALUATION CONTEXT AND MAIN FINDINGS
Objectives. The main task of this evaluation is to identify lessons from experiences
in coping with FCV situations in countries not on the FCS list and to better
understand how the World Bank Group can be effective in these situations. The
cases of violence examined in this study have occurred in relatively affluent and
stable countries with functioning systems of government. Thus, they ask questions
of the widely accepted assumption still prevailing in non-FCS, that violent conflict is
associated with a lack of development progress, and of the prioritization of
economic interventions that flow from such an assumption. The World Bank Group
and the development community as a whole are aware of this emerging challenge,
as evident in their commitment to the SDGs, but a focused analysis of a wide set of
cases of violent conflicts in otherwise nonfragile countries could help increase the
robustness of the World Bank Group strategies and approaches.

This report does not aim to define the nature, drivers, and political economy of
violent conflict, but draws on existing research and experience. Breaking recurrent
cycles of violent conflict requires time, patience, and the contributions of multiple
actors. Particularly in the MICs, the World Bank Group is often not the major player
in these efforts, but it can nonetheless play an important role. This evaluation
therefore focuses on the contributions that World Bank Group activities have made to
creating positive solutions through the relevance and effectiveness of its activities.

Coverage and typology. There is no defined and widely accepted list of “non-FCS
countries experiencing or threatened by major forms of FCV situations.” This
evaluation therefore aimed to select a representative group of MICs, by using the
following criteria: (i) prolonged and widely publicized episodes of organized
violence, with significant levels of fatalities and costs to development progress; (ii)
presence of significant World Bank Group programs, including work related to FCV;
(iii) different levels of income and institutional capability (IBRD, blend, and IDA);
and (iv) a reasonable cross-section of different global Regions.

For the purposes of this evaluation, four dominant drivers of organized violence were
selected. We do not intend to suggest that these were/are the only drivers present,
nor that only one driver was present in each situation--in fact most sustained
outbreaks of organized violence are driven by multiple factors. The intermingling of
factors can be seen in the typology presented below. The categorization we have
used is principally to allow for a more nuanced appreciation of the appropriateness,
and effectiveness, of the remedial measures attempted by the World Bank Group.
The four drivers selected are:

       Subnational (local) violence with a regional or ethnic identity marker, often
        involving prejudicial disputes over land and natural resources. A core issue

                                                                                CHAPTER 1
                                                      EVALUATION CONTEXT AND MAIN FINDINGS
       animating rebellion in such instances is the reality of, or a perception of bias
       and injustice imposed by the State or by a more dominant identity group. The
       emotions stirred by such conflicts are often amplified when the ethnicity,
       geographical location, or religion of the affected group are easily defined or
       visible. This driver is a critical factor in violence in four cases in this report:
       the Philippines (Mindanao), Indonesia (Aceh), Uganda (the North), and Sri
       Lanka.
      Organized crime/drug trade-related violence. This is a dominant factor in
       Central and South America (represented by Colombia and Honduras in this
       report), where the expanding drug trade has fed an exponential growth in
       organized criminal gangs. The lawless violence thus created has been
       nurtured by perceptions of the illegitimacy of the state and its
       inability/unwillingness to address socioeconomic issues such as skewed land
       ownership and gross income inequality.
      Systemic failures of governance and an overall erosion of state legitimacy:
       Sustained failures of national and local governance, including widespread
       and visible corruption, have alienated broad swaths of the population from
       the “state project” and have encouraged forms of violence driven both by
       perceptions of unfairness as well as by opportunism in the face of ineffective
       state constraining mechanisms. This kind of violence is witnessed in cases
       that highlight problems in parts of Pakistan (Balochistan, Federally
       Administered Tribal Areas, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces), Nigeria
       (Delta) and Kyrgyz Republic (Fergana Valley).
      Overwhelming pressure from external political shocks. Some smaller middle-
       income countries can become inadvertent victims of a violent and unstable
       neighborhood that draws in forces beyond anything that individual
       governments can repel. Two such cases are reviewed: Lebanon and Jordan.
       Both are impacted by civil war in Syria and Iraq and the consequent influx of
       refugees, causing immense pressure on state systems and resources. The issue
       in these cases is not internal fragility per se, but rather the compounding effects
       of external pressure, and the impossibility of addressing the 'hosting' problem
       without significant external support.


Main Findings

CHAPTER 1
EVALUATION CONTEXT AND MAIN FINDINGS
World Bank Group strategic engagement and presence. The high incidence of
violent conflicts in MICs with established institutions suggests that FCV is not
primarily a low-income country problem and that impoverishment per se is only one
driver of organized violence. Localized violence in relatively stable and
economically successful countries poses particular challenges to World Bank Group
engagement. MICs have in general been less receptive than many LICs to Bank
involvement, given their ability to 'contain' subnational violence, and to manage the
fiscal consequences of such violence. This places a greater premium on World Bank
Group diplomatic skills, creativity, and appreciation of the local political economy in
finding entry points that do not enervate political sensitivities.

Involvement in attempting to mitigate violent conflict has required the World Bank
Group to trade away the benefits of demonstrating quick wins for the uncertain and
sometimes costly process of addressing root cause issues, often from an oblique angle.
It is often more attractive for the World Bank Group to engage where it believes it can
achieve visible impact (emergency response) than in situations where the problems
are more intractable. At the same time, World Bank Group emergency assistance,
while important of itself, is unlikely to fundamentally alter the fragility profile of
many, especially middle-income, countries, and its strategic comparative advantage
remains in helping countries to tackle essential longer-term developmental challenges.

The World Bank Group’s sustained strategic presence in all types of FCV situations,
reflected in project financing, analytical work, and direct dialogue with wide array of
stakeholders in conflict-affected areas (including ahead of the peace settlement,
during ongoing violence, and after settlement) has been shown to be of critical
importance. This presence can help to develop contacts and build credibility among
the parties to the conflicts, and can have important payoffs once there is a peace
settlement. Strong partnerships with local communities are important to ensure that
the entire community and region are vested in the success.

Maintaining a presence (even nominal) in former conflict zones may be necessary to
help sustain peaceful development, while abrupt exit following the cessation of
hostilities could be detrimental to sustained peace and post-conflict reconstruction,
given the often-weak institutional capacity in post-conflict situations and the high
risk of resuming the conflict and violence.

Success in FCV situations requires excellent knowledge of local conditions as well as
determination, commitment, and often plain courage on the part of Bank staff and
local counterparts. In this context, continuity in staffing policy is very important,
albeit not common in the cases observed. However, when it happened, the payoff
was clear. For example, the transfer of many Bank staff who worked on conflict and

                                                       EVALUATION CONTEXT AND MAIN FINDINGS
violence issues in Aceh, Indonesia, to the World Bank’s Philippines country office
resulted in the effective transfer of knowledge and expertise that benefited the
program in Mindanao.

Most of the time, the main drivers of violent conflict go beyond the boundaries of
single countries, and require much broader, regional approaches, including regional
projects or joint analytic and advisory work across the relevant countries.

World Bank Group instruments: An FCV environment can limit the choice of
instruments available to the World Bank Group. In such situations, flexibility of
project design and ability of management at various levels (project and country) to
take quick decisions is particularly important.

Often relatively small and experimental operations can be highly relevant, particularly
during the periods of extreme violence. Such operations can generate significant
amount of new knowledge, as well as allow to gradually scale up at more peaceful
times, and replicate the positive experience elsewhere. At the same time, such
operations are often reputationally (as well as operationally) risky, time-consuming,
and costly to implement. Specialized grant programs to top-up operational budgets
for small pilot programs in FCV situations could be a way of dealing with it.

In some situations, finding alternative financing instruments has been a challenge for
the World Bank Group. Helping Lebanon and Jordan to cope with the Syrian
refugee crisis is a recent vivid example. The most easily available option of IBRD
loans was quickly exhausted (and not particularly embraced by the governments),
while the alternative sources and mechanisms (IBRD surplus, trust funds) were a far
cry from the needs. An important lesson from this experience is that the World Bank
Group needs to develop financial mechanisms or fast-response facilities to be used
in similar situations, as well as use its global convening power more effectively.

Analytical and advisory work was relevant and generally of high quality, and often
contributed to awareness and understanding of the issues and main challenges.
Most of it was part of larger studies (often in partnership with donors), such as
needs assessments, political economy analyses, and core economic diagnostics.
These assessments helped to set the stage for subsequent reconstruction and
development efforts and were widely used by the governments and the
international community.

FCV-specific diagnostic work (fragility assessments, conflict filters) was generally
useful and relevant, but not particularly common in non-FCS group of countries.
Fragility assessments, in particular, are a useful tool, but there is no obligation for
Bank staff to conduct them in non-FCS environments. Even when conducted,


                                                                                          7
CHAPTER 1
EVALUATION CONTEXT AND MAIN FINDINGS
sharing them with client governments, or making them part of the broad country
dialogue remains at the discretion of Bank management.

Public financial management (PFM) diagnostics—a clear area of World Bank Group
comparative advantage—appeared to have been deployed in an ad hoc manner to
look into issues of fragility and violent conflict in the reviewed sample, whereas their
potential is much higher. The World Bank has both the mandate and the capacity to
carry out reviews of fiscal decentralization and security sector budgeting and
governance, and these core tools should be exploited more often than they have been.

One of the operational weaknesses observed across the board in many Bank projects
in fragile and violent environments is the inadequate attention paid to the monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) frameworks - a deficit which has undermined the assessment
of results and diminished the learning potential. Despite efforts to account for FCV
factors in project design and implementation, they were rarely captured in results.
Only a third of observed programs recorded fragility-specific outcomes, and only a
quarter of them had M&E systems specifically designed to track FCV issues.

World Bank Group definitions, measurement metrics, and policy application along the
full spectrum of countries experiencing fragility and violence remain somewhat
inconsistent (more pronounced in the non-FCS group). The CPIA index, despite its
usefulness as a gross measure of fragility has many deficiencies if used as the main
tool for assessing specific kinds of fragility or forecasting the risk of violent conflict.
Moreover, the low-income country cut-off excludes MICs, where much of today’s
violent conflict is occurring.

Sector engagement: Within the reviewed sample, community-driven development
(CDD) was by far the most popular type of intervention employed by the World
Bank Group. While it did prove to be a useful entry point for the World Bank Group
into the conflict-affected areas and a convenient tool for facilitating participation of
local stakeholders, its impact on improving social cohesion and reducing the risk of
violent conflict should not be overestimated, given that these projects were not
designed as fora for addressing the causes and consequences of violence. The
broader lesson is that the success of CDD projects in conflict resolution or mitigation
is highly context-specific, and that these projects give the World Bank a
placeholder—an opportunity to acquire the local knowledge necessary for more
ambitious efforts at a later stage.

Creating opportunities for private sector development, generating employment and
local entrepreneurial success can be important to making a peace settlement last. In
this area, opportunities were sometimes missed due to the lack of coordination and

communication between different parts of the World Bank Group, including IFC
and MIGA, as well as lack of flexibility of World Bank Group instruments and
inadequate staff incentives.

Support to the education sector can be important in dealing with issues of fragility,
particularly as they pertain to psycho-social issues among children and providing
safe spaces for integration and community cohesion to develop, countering
radicalization, and dealing with the problem of “lost generations” in more
protracted conflicts. The experience in Pakistan showed that even with small
regional commitments and relatively high cost, implementation of nationwide
education programs in fragile and violent environments, adjusted to local realities,
can deliver important developmental outcomes and contribute to progress on
conflict mitigation.

Partnerships. One of the comparative advantages of the World Bank Group in FCV
situations is its ability to play convening role and generate and disseminate
knowledge. World Bank Group engagement was most successful in situations of
fragility and violence when it had catalytic impact—triggering scaling up and
replication by the governments and other partners.

Partnership between the World Bank Group and United Nations agencies was of
particular importance in the FCV contexts. Yet, the evaluation found that it was not
systematic and its frequency and effectiveness varied across the countries and
themes. The main factors negatively affecting such partnerships are perceived high
transaction costs, lack of strong staff incentives, incompatibility of the fiduciary and
legal frameworks, and competition for influence and limited donor resources at the
country level.

Multi-donor trust funds (MDTFs) are a vital strategic tool in conflict regions, and they
require a diverse and specific skill set. This includes the ability to liaise and interact
effectively with donors, effectively link MDTF projects to other projects in the World
Bank portfolio, establish, build, and maintain relations with regional governments in
difficult circumstances, as well as the foresight to see how different project priorities
can be made to serve with longer-term strategic planning.


Report Structure
This report consists of seven chapters. Chapter 1 lays out the context and structure
of the report, and summarizes its main findings. Chapter 2 includes an overview of
the World Bank Group strategic approach and instruments. Chapters 3-6 assess
World Bank Group programs in response to four main drivers of FCV:

subnational/ethnic violence, violence driven by crime and the drug trade, failure of
governance and state legitimacy, and externally imposed fragility. Chapter 7
summarizes the main conclusions and recommendations.

The key outputs and building blocks of the evaluation are the case studies of World
Bank Group activities in selected countries, complemented by cross-cutting thematic
reviews. These studies were based on IEG’s own research as well as interviews with
the main stakeholders and participants in the field and at World Bank Group
headquarters in Washington, DC. The evaluation covered 11 country cases (7 of
which included field visits): Colombia, Honduras, Indonesia, Jordan, Kyrgyz
Republic, Lebanon, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Uganda. One of
the main limitations was restricted access to some of the project sites and
beneficiaries due to security concerns. In these cases, the team relied on secondary
data and analyses. Another limitation was that due to time and budget constraints
the study could only cover a relatively small sample of countries and situations, so
the report is cautious to avoid over-attribution and hasty generalizations.

2. World Bank Group Strategic Engagement
Evolution of World Bank Group Thinking
The understanding and discourse on violence in the World Bank Group has evolved
over the years, reflecting the way that the World Bank is gradually becoming more
comfortable focusing on the political economy of subnational violence and
developing analytical and operations instruments to address it.

The evolution of the World Bank’s involvement with organized violence dates from
the 1990s when a Post-Conflict Unit (PCU) managed operational interventions using
a Post-Conflict Fund (PCF). The concept of low-income countries under stress
(LICUS) was also pioneered at that time, with a LICUS unit established within the
Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) vice presidency, adding to the
World Bank‘s analytical lexicon the notion that various stress factors could
precipitate violent conflict. This risk was most strongly associated with LICs with
weak institutions, and the World Bank found that sustained periods of policy and
institutional weakness, as measured by the Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) index, served as a useful predictor of violent conflict. The
prevailing interest in the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD), and many bilateral agencies in the “conflict trap”
afflicting several poor LICs led the World Bank to merge the PCU and the LICUS
into a Fragile and Conflicted Affected Countries Department in 2007. At the same
time, a separate stream of work had developed in the Social Development
Department, especially in Latin America, focusing on interpersonal and criminal
violence in MICs. These two streams of work proceeded relatively independently
from one another. The PCF and LICUS Trust Fund were combined into the State and
Peace-Building Fund (SPF) in 2008.

The 2011 WDR formulated an analytical framework for operations to address FCV,
discussed further in the next section. The creation of a Global Center for Conflict,
Security and Development (CCSD) in Nairobi was a specific outgrowth of the 2011
WDR. In retrospect, while placing operational staff near a quorum of the World
Bank’s “fragile states” clients made sense to ease operational support to task teams,
it removed management of the Center from the Washington-based policy orbit. It
also reinforced the notion that fragility was an African, LIC issue, which global
developments in 2014-2015 have clearly refuted.1

Structural reorganization undertaken in 2013 attempted to elevate the place and role
of FCV among the priorities of the World Bank Group. The establishment of FCV as


                                                                                    11
CHAPTER 2
BANK GROUP STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT
a cross-cutting solution area (CCSA) within the new organizational structure was
supposed to reflect the high priority attached to this theme. The FCV CCSA was
tasked with enhancing a systematic and coordinated approach to dealing with FCV
across the World Bank Group and is responsible for providing advice to the World
Bank’s global practice (GP) units and support to country management teams. The
Social, Urban, and Rural Global Practice (SURR) undertakes country social analysis
as well as many operations that address conflict and violence. The FCV CCSA
management was later relocated back to Washington with the rationale that
proximity to decision-making processes would help in influencing the development
of World Bank Group policy on fragility and violence. The most important issues
that the FCV CCSA faces today are the degree of authority it should seek over
operational policy, and how far it should involve itself in operational work.


 Box 2.1. 2011 WDR: Institutions and Legitimacy Matter
 The 2011 WDR developed an analytical framework that has been adopted by the World
 Bank Group in its work on FCV. The WDR reviewed about 40 countries’ experiences in
 tackling deep-seated violent conflict over the past 60 years. It winds many complex and
 often opposing strands of political and economic research into a simple causative
 model—one in which the risk of organized violence is great when combinations of
 security, justice, and economic stresses encounter weak institutions. This model has
 relatively straightforward remedial implications: the restoration of sufficient stakeholder
 confidence to provide space and time to develop national institutions that are considered
 legitimate (“the causal relationship between weak institutional legitimacy and violence
 may be compared to the relationship between a human body’s immune system and
 disease”).
 The 2011 WDR also stresses just how long it takes to create such institutions. The process
 is measured in decades, not project cycles, and it calls for new institutional behaviors and
 incentives. The report also shows how and why the temptation to pull the plug too early
 on difficult institutional support exercises needs to be resisted.
 Many cases, including those covered in this report, show that the key to institutional
 legitimacy and staying-power is not technical excellence per se and its portability across
 contexts: it is the extent to which an institution is able to inspire trust. Although good
 performance is a vital aspect of legitimacy and can be influenced by example, much of
 what makes an institution responsive to local needs cannot be generalized. From this
 perspective, the 2011 WDR’s support for “best fit” solutions over the pursuit of illusory
 “best practice,” with context taken as the starting point, is fully consistent with this
 evaluation’s findings. This underlines the importance of local knowledge and contextual
 understanding.
 The 2011 WDR distinguishes between 'internal' and 'external' stress factors—internal
 stresses being those that emanate primarily from the dynamics within a particular society,
 and external stresses referring to pressures that arise from regional or global interests and
 developments. This distinction counteracts a common under-emphasis in academic and

 policy literature on the extent to which powerful external forces can determine the fate of
 smaller and more vulnerable countries. This is important when looking at violence in
 MICs -- though 2011 WDR country cases show that countries with capable national
 institutions have often managed external security stresses better than countries where
 elites and factions depend excessively on competing external actors for support and
 validation. A key residual question, though, is how organizations with multifaceted
 mandates and constrained budgets, like the World Bank Group, can achieve an acceptable
 balance between granular local adaptation and insights with 'global' applicability.

Definitions and Measurements of Fragility
Moving on from the CPIA. The FCV concept in the World Bank Group has hitherto
been associated with LICs. The current system of classifying countries as fragile and
conflict-affected states relies heavily on the CPIA index, and excludes IBRD-only
countries (for which CPIA scores are not disclosed).

The World Bank currently identifies FCS as those countries or territories that present
a very weak policy and institutional framework, signified by a CPIA score below 3.2,
or countries with the presence of the United Nations or regional peace-keeping or
peace-building mission during the past three years. The 2011 WDR comments
favorably on the way in which the CPIA is a good predictor of FCV: it does a good
job of capturing the efficiency and equity of economic policy, the delivery of public
services and the quality and transparency of government -- but is one-dimensional
on security (the state's ability to protect citizens and property from crime and crime-
related violence are assessed) and even more deficient on social inclusion (gender
equality alone is assessed) and justice (restricted to the equity of public resource
use). It is also a static measure and has no real predictive capacity. The LIC cut-off
excludes MICs, where many of today’s FCV situations are occurring. The
aggregation of the indicators into one composite score can obscure serious or
potential violence if there is strong performance along other performance axes; using
the country as the unit of account may not capture subnational, cross-border, or
supranational forms of stress and violence; and the destructive potential of specific
kinds of short-term shocks is not brought out by the incremental scoring method
used in the CPIA.

The 2014 IEG evaluation observed that relying on CPIA ratings to determine FCS
status results in considerable errors of exclusion and inclusion in FCS classification.
It recommended that the World Bank Group develop a more accurate mechanism to
define FCS status, one that integrates indicators of conflict, violence, and political



                                                                                           13

BANK GROUP STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT
risks within the current system. The 2015 OECD fragile states report, moreover,
highlights the need for a more suitable descriptive and predictive framework than
the Harmonized List's single measure of fragility, proposing the use of an index
consisting of five measures of vulnerability (vulnerability to violence, injustice,
illegitimate institutions, weak economic foundations and poor social resilience).
Considering the 2014 IEG recommendation, World Bank Group management has
committed to reviewing the criteria for FCS classification.

At the time this report was being finalized, the FCV CCSA was finalizing a system
that assesses policy and institutional risks using clusters of revised CPIA measures
(CPIA flags) applied to all countries irrespective of income level, and quantifies
undesirable economic and social outcomes. A multidimensional marker system of
this kind would deliver much more nuanced results and would permit a degree of
prediction that the current CPIA does not. At the same time, the new “flag and
outcome” system will have a much-diminished impact if it cannot be published and
tracked openly.

The case for tracking fragility and the risk of violence more systematically in MICs is
compelling: the impact of severe and widespread episodes of violence on 'non-FCS'
significantly impacts their ability to reduce extreme poverty and increase shared
prosperity, and this fact argues for the adaptation of analytical and operational tools
that have been used successfully in FCS. At times, violence creates localized pockets
of insecurity that pose considerable local and national challenges. These incidences
may not always present an immediate threat to the overall stability of the country,
but they do have far-reaching development consequences, harming the economy
and resulting in loss of life, disability, and displacement.

Fragility Assessments. As part of the IDA 17 process, World Bank Group
management committed to ensure that all Country Partnership Frameworks (CPFs)
prepared in IDA FCS during the IDA 17 period will be informed by analysis of
drivers of fragility and violence. This was reinforced by the 2014 IEG evaluation. For
non-FCS (including IBRD) it has been at the discretion of the World Bank country
management whether an FCV lens is used to help to address some of the key
impediments to poverty reduction and shared prosperity, such as institutional
fragility, urban crime and violence, terrorism, or subnational conflict. In the
countries reviewed by this evaluation, most of which are IBRD borrowers, fragility
assessments were prepared in three cases: Colombia, Kyrgyz Republic, and Nigeria.
This section of the report briefly discusses the utility of such assessments, and
particularly in the non-FCS and MIC context.

According to a guidance note2 for preparing fragility assessments, the purpose of the
assessment is to identify the underlying causes (“drivers”) of fragility and violence,
understand the capacity of institutions to manage them, and recommend how the
World Bank can address the identified drivers. The note allows for a flexible format
and content—the objectives, scope, timeframe, and resources required for a fragility
assessment are to be defined by the Country Management Unit (CMU). Most
commonly the assessments have been undertaken in tandem with the preparation of
a Country Program Strategy. Under the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF)
model, the fragility assessment is supposed to supplement the Strategic Country
Diagnostic (SCD) and thereby contribute to the CPF.

The guidance makes a notable observation which clarifies that fragility and violence
are not just a LIC/'fragile states' issue: "SDG 16 proposes to 'promote peaceful and
inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and
build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.' Such an
encompassing goal implies that fragility is no longer seen as pertaining only to
fragile states; in fact, FCV affects nearly all states; (different types of violence are
included, many middle-income countries now top the list of countries affected)".
The Note also stresses that political context matters and encourages an explicit
discussion of elite motivations and understanding of political settlements. It
broadens the 2011 WDR's emphasis on stress factors by insisting on the need to
focus on resilience and institutional capabilities. It also introduces the possibility of
subnational or supranational (“regional”) fragility assessments. The flexibility of the
assessment format is another commendable suggested feature: if the context does
not support it, there is no need for a formal report.

At the same time, the utility of such assessments in non-FCS environments is
somewhat undermined by two factors: (i) that it is at the discretion of the CMU in
non-FCS environments as to whether such a diagnosis should be undertaken or not
and (ii) that the World Bank is not obliged to share the results of the fragility
assessment with client governments. It is not surprising, that the list of countries in
which fragility assessments have been carried out over the past three and a half
years includes only a handful of non-FCS. It is also noteworthy that the majority of
these assessments (FCS and non-FCS) have not been discussed with the
governments, and have not been made public.


 Box 2.2. Conflict Filter Application in Kyrgyz Republic
 In 2010 a violent overthrow of the ruling regime in Kyrgyz Republic caused a collapse of
 the government and led to an outbreak of inter-ethnic violence that caused hundreds of
 deaths, widespread damage, and displacement of an estimated 400,000 people. Most

 refugees and internally displaced people returned home within the same year as violence
 subsided.
 The World Bank co-led a multi-donor Joint Economic Assessment: Reconciliation,
 Recovery and Reconstruction (JEA) that indicated that the key drivers of conflict were not
 just interpersonal ethnic animosities but also national government policies. Earlier Bank
 projects in the conflict area did not mention ethnic tensions and potential for violence.
 Later, in acknowledgment of the changed circumstances, the World Bank approved
 additional financing and restructuring of an urban infrastructure project. The
 implementation and supervision plans included use of the conflict filter matrix to ensure
 adequate attention to social and conflict risks
 The conflict filter was a screening tool that aimed to make sure that any Bank activity
 distributed benefits among ethnic and social groups in a way that seemed fair and would
 not exacerbate conflict situations. It aimed to provide information and guidance to
 improve the design of projects to mitigate the risk of violence and strengthen social
 cohesion. The objectives of the conflict filter were to make task teams more cognizant of
 the context in which they operate and assist the teams in identifying and managing the
 conflict and fragility risks. The conflict filter sought to identify and then avoid doing
 activities—lending and nonlending—in ways that might do harm by stirring up ethnic
 animosities.
 A study by International Alerta reviewed Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World
 Bank urban projects in the city of Osh, where both organizations financed housing
 projects for post-conflict areas—the World Bank using the conflict filter and ADB without
 looking systematically at the ethnic distribution of benefits. While the ADB project
 experienced some vandalism, delays, and higher cost, these did not happen with the
 World Bank-financed project, the extension of which was implemented using the conflict
 filter. The International Alert evaluation gave credit for the better outcomes to the use of
 the conflict filter.
 The Kyrgyz case shows that the World Bank can, at reasonable cost, gather information
 about the fault lines of potential conflict and design activities to bridge those fault lines
 rather than exacerbate them. This fairly simple and inexpensive tool seems to be most
 useful in the aftermath of relatively short and recent conflicts. Its application in other
 contexts, such as Sri Lanka, where the conflict was much more protracted and stayed
 unresolved for a very long time, was found to be less useful by the country teams.

World Bank Group Strategic Approach
This evaluation reviewed World Bank Group programs in mainly IBRD borrower
countries, where the nature and modality of engagement are generally different
from those used in FCS. MICs are normally less aid-dependent, and are less likely to
engage in dialogue on the sensitive political issues associated with subnational

                                                                              CHAPTER 2
                                                       BANK GROUP STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT
conflicts. World Bank Group strategies in these countries reflected this the more
limited role that the World Bank Group is therefore able to play in tackling
organized violence, and the World Bank objectives in the conflict zones depended
heavily on what the governments were willing to allow.

The theme of conflict and violence—and especially “localized conflict”—started
appearing in Bank strategies as a separate pillar (or subpillar) relatively recently, in
the past 5-7 years. Earlier Bank strategies acknowledged the presence of the
problem, but were either silent about any response or explicitly noted that the World
Bank will be staying away. For example, the Indonesia 2001-03 CAS does refer to
Aceh as one of four provinces with serious violent conflict, but it notes that the
World Bank does not foresee taking a leadership role there. Colombia was a notable
exception, where the 1997-2002 CAS introduced a specific pillar to address violence,
acknowledging that this was a new and much riskier area of involvement, but the
World Bank could no longer stay on the sidelines.

The 2011 WDR was a game changer in this respect. The theme of violent conflict,
including subnational conflicts, becomes increasingly prominent in many country
strategies, some of them quoting the 2011 WDR as the guiding analytical document
for engagement in FCV situations. At the same time, the institutional and staff
incentives for such engagement and the risk-taking associated with it continue to lag
the spirit of the World Bank's strategic approach.

World Bank Group strategies generally pursued two broad objectives in relation to
serious organized violence: addressing, or mitigating the impact of drivers of violent
conflict. Mitigation activities at the local level (supporting communities and local
institutions) were often the starting point. Concerns about security during the active
conflict phase often limited the World Bank presence in the field to essential
personnel, but Bank staff were often able to develop rapport and trust at the local
level and effectively supervise projects, especially the CDD. The World Bank
continued CDD projects in areas of ongoing conflict in Aceh, Mindanao, Sri Lanka,
and nNorthern Uganda. In the end, such early engagement was relevant and useful
for laying the foundation for post-conflict engagement.

World Bank Group strategies were generally supported by comprehensive analytical
work, most commonly represented by diagnostic studies that identified the main
drivers of conflict and violence for ongoing conflicts, or comprehensive post-conflict
needs assessments.

One of the objectives of the new country engagement model (SCD/CPF) is to
improve Bank-IFC cooperation, including through joint identification of needs,

BANK GROUP STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT
shared assessments, and collaboration on projects. Among the cases reviewed were
some promising initiatives in this direction, but they appear to be the exception
rather than a norm. Engaging in FCV situations in non-FCS and MICs presented a
distinct set of challenges and opportunities for IFC. Overall, IFC engagement on
FCV in the reviewed cases was limited, almost exclusively focusing on post-conflict
reconstruction.

GENDER IN BANK PROGRAMS

Conflict-affected areas posed both common and area-specific challenges on gender
issues. Common themes included displacement, restricted mobility, an increase in
the number of war widows and female-headed households, and psycho-social
impacts of witnessing violence. Country-specific gender-based challenges were also
common, such as targeted destruction of schools and health facilities in northwest
Pakistan; human trafficking of young women and children in displaced
communities in the ARMM region in the Philippines; forced marriages (“war
wives”) in Northern Uganda; war widows without access to adequate resources,
housing, or vocational skills in the northeast of Sri Lanka; and high rates of rape and
domestic violence in displaced populations in Colombia.

With few exceptions, World Bank Group country strategies did not focus on gender-
based challenges in a conflict context until the latter half of the evaluation period
(2010 onwards), and some crucial gender issues (such as forced marriages by the
Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) in Uganda, acts of violent extremism targeted on
keeping women away from schools and the workforce in Pakistan) were not
mentioned in the strategies throughout the evaluation period.

The majority of Bank-supported nationwide projects were not gender-responsive in
design or implementation in regions of subnational conflict. For example, even
though Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) I, II, and III have operated in
conflict regions like Balochistan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), and
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), the PPAF work has been retrofitted into the conflict
situation rather than conflict-related issues (on security, mobility, women-headed
households, etc.) being addressed specifically in the project design and
implementation phase. The Pakistan Social Safety Net Program (which also includes
the Benazir Income Support program) has a women’s empowerment emphasis since
it disburses cash only to female representatives of eligible families, but does not
address the gender-based challenges in pockets of fragility and conflict.

CDD approaches have dominated work on gender issues in conflict-affected areas,
where women’s role in decision-making remains limited. Other sectors such as

                                                        BANK GROUP STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT
health, education, employment, agriculture, and social protection have not focused
on gender issues.

Analytical work (AAA) on gender and conflict was sparse. In cases where it existed,
it was not always translated into operations. The Philippines is one of the few
countries that included gender and conflict-related AAA work during the evaluation
period. The Philippines ARMM Human Development Sector Study suggested that
more boys drop out of school in their early teens than girls, and observes that early
dropout rates of boys may itself feed the supply of boys who take up arms.3
However, there were no follow-up programs that work with youth who are
dropouts and had taken up arms or were ex-combatants.

Overall, the World Bank Group’s focus on gender issues in conflict-affected areas
reviewed by this evaluation was limited. In particular, few programs were designed
or implemented taking into consideration gender disparities in conflict-affected
areas, and the little analytical work on these issues was not translated into
operations.

COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNITED NATIONS
In recent years, demand for collaboration between the World Bank Group and
United Nations agencies has grown. Such partnerships are particularly important in
the FCV context, as the United Nations agencies have political and security-related
skills and contacts that the World Bank needs to leverage, and the United Nations
system, as the prime global actor on the security and humanitarian fronts, is almost
always present where there is a serious conflict. As a growing number of MICs now
face violence and crises, both the World Bank Group and the United Nations face
challenges in responding to them. Neither of them is ready to tackle those challenges
alone, as most of the intervention tools are not effective on their own.

Within the World Bank Group, the FCV CCSA is the lead focal point on global FCV
partnerships, including the relationship with the United Nations. In the United
Nations system, the responsibilities for FCV are shared widely. Citizen security, rule
of law, and justice are largely the domain of the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP). The recent surge of violence and forced displacements
increased the demand for stronger collaboration by the World Bank Group with
United Nations agencies with humanitarian mandates, such as the United Nations
High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and World Food Programme (WFP).

Mechanisms of collaboration. Country-level cooperation in observed cases was
context-specific and ranged from information sharing in donor coordination forums
to joint programmatic, operational, and analytic work. Operational partnership was


                                                                                    19
CHAPTER 2
BANK GROUP STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT
often not easy to initiate because of the difficulty of cross-funding. The value added
of this type of partnership in MIC countries was often small and had limited impact.

Analytical work often included joint economic and social impact assessments
(ESIAs). In several countries, these assessments informed strategies and plans and
paved the way for operational partnership, joint analytical work, and better
alignment of programming efforts. Joint thematic analytical work was particularly
valued as an area where the division of labor between the World Bank Group and
partnering United Nations agency was clear, contributing to the success and uptake
of those studies (Philippines Mindanao,4 Jordan, and Lebanon5).

Operational cooperation often meant the World Bank contracted a United Nations
agency to implement activities in which the latter had clear comparative advantage.
Collaboration between the WFP, UNHCR, and World Bank in Lebanon, within the
framework of the National Poverty Targeting Program, was an example of
introducing good practice solutions from humanitarian partners. The e-card
program established a reliable channel to support vulnerable Lebanese and refugees
and it is hoped that the government can scale it up for conditional transfers in
education and health.

Examples of successful programmatic collaboration were limited. One of them was
in Lebanon, where the World Bank and the United Nations Children’s Fund
provided a concerted response to the emergency and development needs in the
education sector.6 A promising collaboration in Kyrgyzstan—the Joint Country
Support Strategy (JCSS 2005)—never realized its full potential. The partners
prepared a joint background analysis and results framework but had their own
programs and implementation plans. It was a transaction-heavy undertaking that
was challenging to implement.

Country-level MDTFs were effective tools for coordinated and timely international
response and helped share the risks associated with operating in post-crisis
environment. The Mindanao MDTF supported community-driven reconstruction
and has successfully evolved into a facility supporting capacity building of the
partner institutions. The United Nations–World Bank FASTRAC Facility in
Mindanao is another smart transitional solution to support capacity building based
on the different mandates and comparative advantages of the World Bank and the
United Nations (see chapter 3).

Overall, cooperation between the World Bank and the United Nations followed the
key principles of partnership, such as flexibility to respond to different country
needs, appropriate division of labor, and recognition of the role of other regional

                                                       BANK GROUP STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT
and international partners. However, the existing system did not encourage building
such partnerships, and the incentives to collaborate across institutions were not
strong. While the benefits of effective partnership are clear, going an “extra mile” in
partnership is not rewarded. Missed partnership opportunities may be visible only
at the country level and are rarely noticed.

The cases reviewed by this report also offer some good examples of collaboration.
These success stories can be attributed to the changing nature of challenges that
required more multidisciplinary approaches, as well as the entrepreneurial skills
and efforts of the World Bank and United Nations field staff that saw mutual
benefits in collaboration and were willing to take the risks.


World Bank Group Engagement Areas
This section provides a brief overview of selected approaches and themes covered by
the World Bank Group in FCV situations reviewed by this evaluation. It includes the
World Bank Group’s private sector development agenda (engagement in the public
sector, which comprised the bulk of World Bank Group support, is covered in detail
in chapters 3-6); PFM, and in particular, various diagnostic tools, as applied in FCV
context; and CDD approach—the most common operational model applied by the
World Bank Group in FCV situations.

PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
The vulnerabilities caused by underdevelopment and unemployment are commonly
recognized as a major driver of conflict (2011 WDR). There is also increasing
recognition of potential contribution that private sector development (PSD) could
make to the peace-building effort by strengthening economic foundations needed
for sustainable growth.7 In the FCV context, jobs not only can provide people with
livelihoods but also reconstruct the fabric of society. The private sector can reduce
fragility by creating jobs, enabling economic opportunities, and supporting
livelihoods but it needs nurturing, support, and engagement from the outset.8 A
legacy of violence and conflict includes particular severe challenges for both private
investments and private firms’ operations, as it led to deterioration in trust and
linkages between firms as well as in the infrastructure needed to access markets.

The 2014 IEG evaluation found that the World Bank Group had difficulty
developing and implementing a PSD strategy that would be effective in the
challenging environment of FCV situations. Specifically, the 2014 evaluation
concluded that the World Bank Group “lacks a realistic framework for inclusive
growth and jobs that is based on economic opportunities and constraints in FCS and



                                                                                    21
CHAPTER 2
BANK GROUP STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT
effective coordination and synergies across [World Bank Group] institutions… The
World Bank Group did not adequately address major constraints and did not have a
holistic approach to private sector development in FCS.” This evaluation concurs
with that conclusion. The World Bank Group still lacks a holistic and sequenced
approach to private sector development in FCV situations in non-FCS, and its
interventions that addressed the PSD agenda have been limited, with very few
successful examples of cooperation across the World Bank Group.

The main support for the PSD agenda was delivered through CDD-type projects.
Projects in Colombia and Indonesia (Aceh) aimed at boosting activities of small
farmers in the conflict-affected areas. Other CDD projects supported small
infrastructure (rural roads, etc.) that have broader benefits for PSD. In the Niger
Delta, a Bank-supported project (SEEFOR) provided financing for a youth
employment scheme (see chapter 5).

However, these projects did not include investments in small businesses. In other
words, the primary focus of the World Bank efforts was on direct support to
livelihood and short-term employment schemes, with rather questionable prospects
for longer-term sustainability. This finding is similar to the conclusion of the 2014
IEG evaluation. At the same time, the scale of the problem (“inadequacy of efforts to
support PSD”) seems to be even more pronounced in cases covered by this
evaluation, where the country risk heterogeneity is higher than in the countries on
the FCS list. Many countries reviewed (in particular the larger ones, such as
Indonesia and the Philippines) include, along with the high-risk conflict-affected
areas, large territories with much lower investment risks and better investment
climate (compare Mindanao and Manila), which attract most of World Bank Group
PSD-related activities.

IFC engagement in the reviewed cases almost exclusively focused on post-conflict
support during reconstruction, reflecting the difficulty and perception of high risk
when operating in FCV situations, but also revealing lack of institutional staff
incentives and corporate targets in the FCV context outside of FCS. It is worth
noting that engaging in FCV situations presents a distinct set of challenges and
opportunities for IFC. Specifically, IFC has taken very seriously the issues associated
with compliance by potential local clients with the institutional integrity
requirements, based on carrying out a detailed Integrity Due Diligence (IDD). More
often than not, IFC decided not to proceed with its project financing due to concerns
over IDD issues or other FCV-specific factors.9

In several cases IFC engagement has had a significant positive impact. The most
prominent of them is IFC’s post-tsunami support in Aceh, Indonesia, where IFC


22
                                                                              CHAPTER 2
                                                       BANK GROUP STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT
carried out an investment climate diagnostic. Based on this diagnostic, IFC and
Agency for the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Aceh and Nias (BRR) jointly
developed an investment climate and promotion strategy for the region, including
drafting a new investment policy, establishment of the investor service center, and
provision of training programs. IFC supported implementation of these efforts with
its advisory services. Even in Aceh, however, scaling-up IFC support remains a
challenge as witnessed by a large number of memoranda of understanding (MOUs)
with private investors that have not been transformed into actual IFC investments.

In Sri Lanka, IFC was able to encourage its partner financial institution to expand
business in the conflict-affected region of the country by offering both investment
and advisory services to the client bank.10 In the Philippines, the Mindanao advisory
project with Unifrutti, launched in 2008, is a good example of IFC-Bank
collaboration, where the World Bank funded related infrastructure projects, such as
farm-to-market roads and bridges (see chapter 3). IFC’s engagement with Unifrutti
also underscores an importance of long-term client engagement in FCV situations.

In most country cases reviewed, IFC has deployed its standard instruments with
little adaptation to FCV circumstances or innovation. It is questionable, however,
whether the standard investment strategy and operational model of IFC are
appropriate in FCV situations. In contrast, IFC has adjusted its standard approach
for its work in the countries on the FCS list and succeeded in increasing its business
volumes in this group of countries for both investment and advisory services. In
October 2015, IFC updated its investment policy in FCS by eliminating the
restriction on processing smaller long-term investments (less than $10 million) that
fall outside of IFC’s standard risk criteria. Regardless of the investment size, IFC can
now consider investments with higher risks in FCS by assuming more risks that it
normally does. In addition, IFC has set up a specific allocation of its economic
capital dedicated exclusively to investments in FCS, and increased its capital
allocation to $200 million from $70 million. Similarly, based on the Aceh experience,
there was a discussion within IFC team about making specific adjustments to the
IFC strategy and operation rules in the post-conflict environment, including
considering making smaller investments, de-linking advisory from investment, re-
assessing the product mix, and adjusting general investment standards. It is not
clear, however, if any of these options were pursued and turned into a policy change
or a revised instrument in FCV situations.

MIGA’s political risk insurance (PRI) products can help facilitate foreign direct
investment when a country, or a part of it, faces FCV situations. In recent years,
MIGA has been able to increase its role in addressing various risks for investing in
FCS countries.11 Similar MIGA’s activities could be useful in non-FCS countries


                                                                                       23
CHAPTER 2
BANK GROUP STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT
facing FCV situations by offering one or a combination of its four insurance
coverages under PRI (currency incompatibility and transfer restriction,
expropriation, breach of contract, and war and civil disruption). Among these
products, war and civil disturbance (WCD) coverage and the recently introduced
non-honoring of sovereign financial obligations (NHSFO) coverage are perhaps the
most relevant to the FCV circumstances. In recent years, MIGA has strengthened its
due diligence process by incorporating conflict dimension into its standard risk
analysis. This improvement, however, so far has applied mainly to FCS countries
through the MIGA’s Conflict-Affected and Fragile Economies Facility, whereas they
could also be fully applicable to FCV situations in non-FCS countries. The MIGA
staff should be encouraged to broaden the use of this innovation.

PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Bank teams have often used PFM diagnostics to provide inputs to development
strategies in FCV context. These included expenditure, institutional, and regulatory
analyses that assessed the efficiency and level of expenditure allocations, quality of
underlying PFM institutions, robustness of intergovernmental fiscal arrangements,
and related subjects.

Expenditure analysis for post-conflict reconstruction strategy. The Aceh Public
Expenditure Analysis (2007) presented a picture of major fiscal gains from increased
autonomy, granted to the region earlier, while showing that these additional
allocations did not lead to improvements in service delivery and poverty reduction.
Stakeholders interviewed by IEG gave the report considerable credit for guiding the
recovery and reconstruction effort. The Public Expenditure Review for Northern
Uganda (NUPER, 2007) provided a comprehensive picture of overall public financial
flows, both off- and on-budget, being disbursed to the North. This was considered a
critical input to finalizing the government’s post-conflict strategy—Peace, Recovery,
and Development Plan (PRDP). Similarly, in Pakistan the World Bank’s KP
provincial Public Expenditure Review (PER 2013) was one of the important
outcomes of regional Post-Crisis Needs Assessment.

Analysis of horizontal fiscal inequality. One of the common drivers for regional
conflicts relates to the perceived unfairness in distribution of national resources,
especially of public expenditures, across the regions. In Uganda, the 2007 NUPER
found that per capita fiscal flows are the same to the North as they are to other
regions. This finding was politically important as it suggested that there was no
evidence of discrimination against the North. Similarly, in Indonesia the PER (2007)
did not find any evidence that the central government treated Aceh fiscally
unfavorably. According to the report, Aceh’s poverty reduction has been lagging not

because of insufficient funding, but largely due to institutional bottlenecks,
including inadequate capabilities and incentives of local governments. In contrast, in
the Philippines the PER (2011) showed that public spending per capita is lower in
the ARMM region than elsewhere, particularly for human development. The PER
concluded that after two decades of decentralization, regional inequality in revenues
and expenditures, living standards, and access to public services remains stark and
in critical aspects has been growing.

Analysis of public expenditures in the security sector. The World Bank has
traditionally abstained from the analysis of national security arrangements. In the
country programs that were the focus of this evaluation no such analysis has been
undertaken so far. However, by now the World Bank has accumulated important
and innovative experiences of policy analysis in this sector. Most of the World
Bank’s expenditure analysis in the security sector so far has been concentrated in
low-income FCS. The PER for Guatemala (2012) represents a relatively rare example
of in-depth review of security arrangements in MICs that have been facing elevated
security risks. The PER provided an assessment of both the level and quality of
public expenditures related to the security sector, complemented by institutional
analysis of the sector’s governance arrangements. The report concluded that the
existing level of expenditures was low for the size of the problem and provided a set
of recommendations aimed at improving efficiency of spending within the existing
budget envelope. This type of Bank analysis would have been applicable and useful
in many countries reviewed by this evaluation.

Strengthening intergovernmental fiscal arrangements. Issues of regional autonomy
and subnational control over resources have been among the core drivers of conflict
in many countries, including a few covered by this evaluation. The World Bank has
recognized that redesigning intergovernmental fiscal relations in FCV situations
could be an important element of post-conflict risk mitigation strategy. Resource
allocation that is seen as fair and politically sensitive can alleviate the conflict.12
However, the programs reviewed for this report contained only a few examples of
policy advice on decentralization arrangements in the conflict-affected areas. There
has been no common approach to the decentralization agenda across the country
programs within the sample reviewed. The analysis usually did not represent the
core of the respective programs and was done on a case-by-case basis with no
sustained follow-up over the medium term. Thus, NUPER (2007) carried out a
detailed examination of the central government’s system of fiscal transfers to local
governments in Northern Uganda and provided recommendations to address the
system’s weaknesses. But the World Bank did not follow up on this work through
another study to analyze the latest developments and it therefore remains unclear
how many of the recommendations were implemented by the government.


                                                                                    25
CHAPTER 2
BANK GROUP STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT
The most prominent example of World Bank Group advisory support on
decentralization in FCV situations in the sample comes from Mindanao, where the
World Bank helped to design decentralization arrangements for the newly
established Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. Under the Facility for Advisory
Support for Transition Capacities (FASTRAC), the World Bank supported the policy
dialogue related to the implementation of the Peace Agreement, including allocation
of responsibilities across various governments in particular sectors. However,
decentralization of advisory support in Mindanao still was quite modest compared
to other better-funded and higher-profile decentralization programs run by the
World Bank (for example, the Decentralization and State-Building Program in
Yemen, 2012-14).

At the same time, in several countries covered by this evaluation, the World Bank
conducted the traditional, high-profile and generally high-quality analysis of the
existing system of intergovernmental fiscal arrangements. These include PERs for
Philippines (2011) and Uganda (2013). However, these reports were prepared
outside of Bank’s FCV strategies as their diagnostics and recommendations were not
intended to address political issues of regional tensions and longer-term conflict.
This is somewhat unexpected, given the wealth of expertise accumulated by the
World Bank in this area, and the importance of regional autonomy and fiscal
decentralization for addressing actual or potential violence.

PFM diagnostics as an entry point for engagement: The Nigeria program is a good
example of the use of PFM diagnostics as an entry point for engagement. In the
Delta, a general failure to provide adequate governance has been one of the core
drivers of conflict. The 2005 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Nigeria linked
the possibility of direct state-level lending to demonstrated commitment to the
reform through Bank-led PFM diagnostics and state governments’ decisions to
address identified weaknesses. For the Delta states the CPS emphasized actions to
strengthen the demand side of governance reforms—supporting public-private
dialogue and growth of coalitions around management of oil resources within the
framework of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The World Bank’s
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Reviews (PEMFARs),
based on which the states prepared reform action plans, created enabling conditions
for direct Bank lending to Delta states.

The above strategy has been consistently followed over the last decade, but the
implementation has been quite slow and so far did not bring conclusive results, in
part due to slower than expected build-up of state commitment. The CAS Progress
Report (2011) admitted that progress in governance at the state level had been slow.
The State Employment and Expenditure for Results (SEEFOR) project was approved

in 2012 to assist, under its PFM component, four states in the Delta to advance their
governance reforms and capacity building in public finance. The recent (2014) CPS
Completion Report acknowledged some progress on state-level PFM under the
SEEFOR, especially in public procurement. In several aspects, the World Bank
program in Nigeria Delta could be seen as an example of governance-centered
conflict-responsive lending, illustrating major associated risks and costs.

Institutional strengthening of local governments. One of the lessons learned by the
World Bank in the post-conflict context suggests that community participation and
related efforts aimed at bottom-up state-building tend to be quite beneficial for risk
mitigation in the long term. Therefore, various World Bank Group project
interventions in the conflict-affected regions contain (usually quite small and
complementary) technical assistance components aimed at strengthening
accountability and transparency of local governments. This type of project
interventions is considered important because it is expected to strengthen the
legitimacy and credibility of local governments and thus contribute to the
sustainability of conditions for peace over time. As local institutional capabilities in
post-conflict situations are often rudimentary, the project interventions in question
are quite basic, do not promise to deliver much, and tend to plan for sustained long-
term engagement. This seems appropriate, as it would be naïve to expect that strong
PFM capacity could be built in such adverse circumstances over the lifetime of a
single World Bank Group operation. Instead, the World Bank projects tend to
deliver some basic training, introduce straightforward processes for budgeting and
reporting, and, especially, help to strengthen local demand for government
accountability by reaching out to local nongovernmental players.

Overall, the combination of Bank investments in CDD projects with small volumes
of technical assistance to improve local governance looks sustainable from the
development perspective and is attractive to the World Bank’s clients. Such projects
also tend to leverage considerable amount of bilateral technical assistance for local
capacity building. Examples include Northern Uganda Social Action Fund 2
(NUSAF 2), the Peace and Development Project in Colombia, and North East Local
Services Improvement Project in Sri Lanka. The latter project aimed at
comprehensive strengthening of local government capacity in the conflict-affected
areas. While its main focus was on rehabilitation of local infrastructure, the project
also had two governance components—to strengthen accountability and build
capacities at the local level.

CHAPTER 2
BANK GROUP STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT
COMMUNITY-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

Projects with a CDD design were an important tool in many reviewed countries and
were a useful point of entry for the World Bank Group in areas affected by actual or
potential violence. While the details are context-specific, CDD projects in such
contexts are typically justified because they help to deliver a blend of the following
objectives: rebuilding trust and social cohesion, shifting the locus of decision-making
to the communities, incremental funding for public goods, and rapid disbursement
that offers a peace dividend. The evidence from the case studies does not always
bear out these presumptions.

Public versus private goods. The World Bank used Learning and Innovation Loans
(LILs, 1998-2002) with CDD-like characteristics to support communities under stress
in rural Colombia, where local government institutions were virtually absent.
Contrary to any presumption of fostering collective action in pursuit of the
provision of public goods, however, an overwhelming number (60 out of 67) of LIL 1
subprojects identified by the communities were individual farmers’ projects. LIL 2
had two sets of projects: “social projects” and productive projects that helped small
farmers diversify output and improve food security. In the end, most subprojects
were productive projects and social interventions did not contain subprojects to
sustain education and health services. This may have reflected either the overriding
importance of farm output for food security at a time of loss of livelihoods, or the
complexity and time-consuming nature of collective decision-making for public
goods.

Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF 1, 2002) was designed as a CDD
project and sought to empower communities confined to camps for internally
displaced people (IDPs). Project funds could be spent on community infrastructure,
livelihood support, or reconciliation and conflict management. However, not all
members of a camp were necessarily drawn from the same village, making it
difficult to determine the location for infrastructure. This resulted in project funds
being allocated more to support income-generating activities, including provision of
livestock, with the cost of this component becoming 2.5 times as high as estimated at
project appraisal. This illustrates the difficulty of using a CDD design to decentralize
decision-making for public goods in an environment where the notion of
community is hard to define. In contrast, the successor project NUSAF2,
implemented in conditions of peace, which allowed people in the camps to return to
their villages, has disbursed nearly two-thirds of its funds for community
infrastructure.

                                                        BANK GROUP STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT
Typically, three-quarters of project funding under a large nationwide Kecamatan
Development Program (KDP) in Indonesia was used for community infrastructure,
with one-quarter allocated as individual grants for productive investment. In
contrast, 95 percent of project funds in conflict-affected Aceh went for community
infrastructure, with only a small amount for individual grants. This was due to the
risk of extortion by both parties to the conflict. After the 2004 tsunami and the 2005
peace agreement, some KDP money was used for aid to victims of the conflict. A
similar government program, the Community-Based Reintegration Assistance for
Conflict Victims Program (BRA-KDP), had the same open menu as the KDP, and
channeled national government funds allocated to support reintegration. However,
in a pattern similar to that in Colombia LIL1, the communities allotted 90 percent of
funds for livelihoods proposals, such as livestock, agriculture, and small trading by
individuals, leaving the remaining 10 percent for community infrastructure. This
was because the program was seen by villagers as providing them with
compensation for damage and loss from the conflict. This is in contrast with the KDP
in the rest of Indonesia, where community infrastructure projects were dominant.

Context-specificity is important and three examples of the balance between public
goods and private livelihood support from Colombia, Uganda, and Indonesia do not
lend themselves to generalization. However, they demonstrate that any
presumption that communities will mostly choose subprojects with the
characteristics of public goods may not hold under conditions of insecurity.

Development impact. Impact assessments examine how effectively CDD projects
achieve their objectives of providing services and benefits to communities and
restoring trust and social cohesion through a process of collective decision-making.
An instructive example is provided by an impact assessment of the Autonomous
Region of Muslim Mindanao Social Fund project (ARMM, 2003) in the Philippines.
The following results were found.

The impact of the project on people’s perception of quality of life was not significant.
On community cohesion and social capital, the impact evaluation showed minor
increases in membership of community groups. The impact on reduction in violence
and conflict and safety was mixed, the results depending on the nature of the
conflict. There was no improvement in community perceptions of local
governments’ ability to deliver on poverty and public service outcomes.

The minimal impact of the ARMM project on governance and social cohesion is
notable. This might be because more time is needed for such an impact to be seen.
But it might also point to the need for more concerted action beyond CDD projects
to strengthen institutions of local government that have been degraded by conflict.


                                                                                      29
CHAPTER 2
BANK GROUP STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT
An impact evaluation of the NUSAF 1 project in Uganda found that it had a
significant impact on access to water and sanitation, quality of school buildings, and
the quality of students and teachers, but not much impact on social capital
improvement in NUSAF communities compared to non-NUSAF communities. The
NUSAF project was dogged by allegations of corruption and elite capture, captured
in audits. This is an example of the speed of disbursement outrunning the capacity
of local institutions to enforce fiduciary standards, highlighting the risk of financial
irregularity in the pursuit of a potential post-conflict peace dividend.

Learning and scaling up. Approaching conflict-responsive lending through small
LILs, as in the Magdalena Medio region of Colombia, had several advantages. It
helped test and refine a participatory methodology in a volatile environment where
the World Bank had limited knowledge of priorities and could join ongoing efforts
spearheaded by respected civil society leaders. The Magdalena approach was then
extended to several other severely affected regions and was instrumental in securing
European Union financial support, which was then significantly scaled-up to cover
other regions in Colombia.

Another illustration of the catalytic impact of Bank lending is provided by the
ARMM Social Fund project in the Philippines, the design of which was largely
adapted from proven approaches developed in Indonesia. The project delivered
CDD in every municipality in ARMM, reaching almost 1 million people. The
government of the Philippines considered the CDD approach an important
instrument and used the project’s network under separate government projects from
2010 through 2013.

Overall, the emerging lesson from Bank CDD projects in FCV areas is that these
projects represent an important entry point for the World Bank to expand its
engagement with the clients at an early stage of post-conflict reconstruction. These
projects are an effective instrument of building local partnerships, but they should
be seen as a step in a longer-term development assistance strategy, which
complements CDD projects by interventions in other critical areas, such as
infrastructure, local capacity building, and decentralization arrangements, among
others.

3. Subnational Conflicts
This chapter reviews World Bank Group engagement in non-FCS (mainly middle-
income) countries that experienced localized organized violent conflict with an
ethnic or religious identity marker. In all countries reviewed violence has largely
subsided (although not all conflicts are formally settled) and the review looks at the
assistance provided by the World Bank during and after the hostilities.

The 2011 WDR found that the most potent of all drivers of violence was the
experience, or perception, of injustice. When the ethnicity, geographical location, or
religion of the affected group is easily defined, the potential for aggrievement is
enhanced. The global history of violence is replete with cases of callous behavior by
dominant officials that did not evoke rebellion. Famines offer one such example.1
Although such searing experiences damage the legitimacy of the ruling authorities,
they do not translate into rebellion unless there is a clear animating ideology and
space to organize.

When the state is inattentive or overextended, where there is a memory (or a myth)
of former independence, and where the area of repression is relatively remote from
the center of a state’s authority, rebellions are more likely to emerge. In MICs, and
absent serious external involvement, the state is generally able to manage such
rebellions, containing them to their area of origin. By the same token, there is less of
an impulse to resolve them decisively, often because the ruling elite has a vested
interest in the distribution of power and resources in the area in question. Aceh
(Indonesia) was an example of this prior to the tsunami, which then broke the
pattern of the past, brought in massive external resources (and thereby new forms of
rent), and provided all parties with an opportunity to reset the political agenda.

In Aceh, Mindanao, Northern Uganda, and Sri Lanka subnational conflicts arose as
organizations representing distinct ethnic, tribal, or religious populations—
minorities nationally but predominant in one region—used violence to press their
demands for secession or at least much greater autonomy for regional governments
that they could control.

The trajectories of the conflicts and their resolutions differed, as did the ways the
World Bank Group operated, but the parallels between the four cases lead to some
useful conclusions and lessons. Appendixes A.1-A.4 include brief historical sketches
of the cases.

Conflicts Compared
In Aceh and Mindanao, violent conflict largely ended when the insurgent
organizations negotiated peace agreements with the national government, although
in Mindanao some violence from outlier groups continues. In both cases the
settlement included legal changes to allow extraordinary degrees of autonomy for
the regional governments in those places and to allow the insurgent group to
convert into a legally recognized political party that did (Aceh) or is expected to
(Mindanao/Bangsamoro) win the election for the new regional government.

In Uganda, the violent conflict ended when the LRA was driven out of the country.
The Acholi and Lango subregions of Northern Uganda, from whence LRA emerged,
did not get any special increase of political autonomy after the conflict ended,
although their public services improved somewhat. In Sri Lanka, the government
defeated the Tamil Tigers at the end of a protracted and brutal civil war. Few of the
known combatants survived. The predominantly Tamil provinces in the north and
along the east coast have not received any particular political autonomy.

The 2004 tsunami hit hard on both Aceh and the Tamil regions of Sri Lanka. In Aceh
(near the epicenter), the disaster and the flood of international aid that followed
catalyzed the parties to reach and sustain the peace agreement. In Sri Lanka, by
contrast, the large amount of donor funding made available did not contribute to a
peace agreement and much of the funding was deferred or never used because the
government (and Tamils) did not agree to a mechanism for local governments and
communities to participate in the reconstruction planning. Then in 2006-07 the
military campaign against the Tamils intensified, aiming for total victory.

The economic and social indicators in Bangsamoro (the Muslim-dominated part of
Mindanao) and in Northern Uganda are the lowest in their nations. Aceh was and
remains one of the poorest provinces in Indonesia. This not only fueled resentment,
feeding into the insurgencies, but the correspondingly low institutional capacity in
these locales also complicated their reconstruction and recovery.


World Bank Group Strategies
In all four countries, the World Bank Group’s objectives and degree of focus on the
conflict regions within the overall country strategies changed over time and
especially after the end of the violent insurgency. Concerns about security during
the active conflict often limited the World Bank presence in the field to essential
personnel, but the World Bank staff were able to develop rapport and trust at the
local level and effectively supervise especially the CDD-type projects.


                                                                                      33
CHAPTER 3
SUBNATIONAL CONFLICTS
In Aceh and Mindanao, the insurgent organizations cooperated with the World
Bank, whereas the national governments were often initially reluctant to admit
publicly that they had a serious regional security problem that they themselves
could not handle, to allow international support in the insurgent areas. Nonetheless,
for Mindanao, Aceh, and Northern Uganda the national governments all eventually
came to welcome the World Bank Group engagement and assistance and allow the
terms of that to appear in the CAS/CPS. In Sri Lanka, the brief window of
opportunity for dialogue and cooperation on development and reconstruction after
the tsunami was not used.

In the Philippines, every CAS/CPS since at least 1999 has given some attention to
the Mindanao region, although they only in halting steps acknowledged the
centrality of the problem of organized violence. In 2002-05 CAS and 2006-08 CPS
none of the four thematic areas related explicitly to the problems of conflict or
Mindanao. Only 2009-12 CPS listed outcomes pertaining to Mindanao and violent
conflict. The new CPS for 2015-17 lists five primary engagement areas, the fifth of
which is “Peace, institution building, and social and economic opportunity.”2

Despite underplaying conflict in the CASs of the early 2000s, Bank staff were
engaging directly with the Bangsamoro Development Agency (BDA) and providing
technical assistance to the agency’s development efforts. As the World Bank’s
program in neighboring Aceh was winding down, many Bank staff who had
worked on conflict issues there relocated to the Philippines to work on Mindanao in
the late 2000s.3 This largely unforeseen continuity of Bank staff engagement has
helped the World Bank to use staff expertise developed in Aceh, particularly in
terms of using trust fund resources in a complex donor environment, and working
simultaneously with representatives of the national and local governments, and
insurgent groups.

In the Indonesia CASs and CPSs, the shift from little to lots of attention to Aceh after
the tsunami was rapid. The 2001-03 and 2004-07 CAS (prepared before the tsunami)
said little about Aceh. The CAS Progress Report of 2006 added a pillar for disaster
risk management, which included support for a peace process in Aceh.

Reconstruction efforts in Aceh grew into a portfolio of grant operations, technical
assistance, policy dialogue, and analytical work equal in scale to a full-fledged
country program. Most of the World Bank Group activities were not officially
related to the conflict. However, scaled-up field presence and expertise facilitated
the implementation of key programs, often funded by other donors, which were
essential to sustain the end to the conflict. The wind-down of the World Bank’s
program in Aceh was almost as swift as the build-up. Soon after the tsunami

reconstruction was declared complete, the World Bank Group left Aceh, closing its
office there in 2012.

In Uganda, the World Bank strategies for the late 1990s had little explicit mention of
the conflict. The results framework of the strategy for 2005-09 mirrored that of the
government’s Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP)—reduced number of
casualties and IDPs. A completion report preceding the 2005 strategy recommended
that the World Bank take more concerted action, stating that “in spite of the ongoing
conflict in Northern Uganda, the World Bank needs to support government and
development partners in addressing issues arising from the conflict in an integrated
way, especially the humanitarian aspects.”4

In Sri Lanka Bank strategy documents of 2003, 2008, and 2012 examined the impact
of the conflict on Sri Lanka’s development to varying extents and from different
vantage points. The 2008 CAS attempted to distill the salient lessons learned from
the previous five years, and underscored the need for projects to remain “conflict-
sensitive” and avoid inadvertently feeding into ethnic tensions. The CAS also
warned that the World Bank had to deftly manage reputational risks to avoid being
perceived as a biased development partner in a very sensitive region. The strategy
also introduced a conflict filter at the project level at the concept, design, and
implementation stages.

The CPS for 2012-16 echoed the lessons of the WDR, though conflict does not feature
as prominently in this report as it does in previous ones. It focuses on the economic
transition and how the World Bank could support growth. The CPS does not unpack
the sociopolitical dynamics of Sri Lanka after the war, despite recognition of its
importance in the previous CAS. Without this lens, the CPS does not make a clear
link between efforts to strengthen economic growth and the need to sustain a
durable peace.

In these four countries, Bank objectives in the conflict zones depended heavily on
what engagement the government was willing to allow. The World Bank pushed the
envelope to do CDD projects in areas of ongoing conflict in Aceh, Mindanao, Sri
Lanka, and Uganda, and in Mindanao to work with a wing of the insurgent
organization. Such early engagement was relevant and useful for laying the
foundation for post-conflict engagement. As the conflicts wound down, a
reconstruction phase began, and the World Bank duly realigned its objectives to
support the reconstruction and reconciliation.

PARTNERSHIPS AND DIALOGUE ARRANGEMENTS, CONVENING ROLE OF THE WORLD BANK
In all four cases, the conflicts and the stories of the suffering from them aroused
widespread international concern and offers of funding. Consequently, the World
Bank was often called on to help coordinate the donor assistance. The World Bank
took on this coordinating and convening role and to varying degrees made it the
center of its own reconstruction and development programs in the conflict-affected
regions.

In Aceh Indonesia, the World Bank led the Preliminary Damage and Loss
Assessment, which provided the basis to organize the massive multilateral relief
effort. The MDTF became the centerpiece of the World Bank’s contribution to post-
tsunami recovery in Aceh. Formed in May 2005, the MDTF supported a diverse
portfolio of projects in four areas of reconstruction valued at $492 million: recovery
of communities, reconstruction of large infrastructure, rebuilding governance, and

                                                                     SUBNATIONAL CONFLICTS
sustaining the environment. The World Bank took the lead in selecting and
implementing the activities funded by the MDTF. Eventually the MDTF pooled
approximately $673 million in pledges from 15 bilateral and multilateral donors.5

In Mindanao Philippines, the World Bank’s reputation as a technocratic and
politically neutral player, as well as its experience in Aceh, helped it play a
convening role among donors, the governments, and the Mindanao Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF). Bank projects and analytical work continued even during
episodes of violence. The Multi-Donor Facility (MDF) for Mindanao Reconstruction
and Development ($83.7 million, 2007-15) exemplifies that role. The MDF followed a
similar model as in Aceh. This was not accidental, because many of the World Bank
staff and consultants from the Aceh team subsequently moved to Mindanao. The
MDF financed projects to empower communities to recover from conflict and to
promote participatory local governance. To date the project has delivered over 300
subprojects, providing over 500,000 people in conflict-affected communities in
Mindanao with improved access to services and infrastructure. It also funds capacity
building and planning activities of local government units.

MDF provided capacity-building support to the BDA, the development arm of the
MILF, to prepare them for a role in government following the expected transition.
This included support to prepare the Bangsamoro Development Plan (BDP, 2015), a
comprehensive economic blueprint for the proposed Bangsamoro area. MDF
assistance is now shifting to help identify priority projects and to support the
government and MILF to establish a joint coordination mechanism to oversee
implementation of the development plan.


 Box 3.1. The Bangsamoro Development Agency
 The BDA was created as part of the June 22, 2001, Tripoli Agreement between the
 Government of the Philippines and the MILF. The MILF Central Committee requested a
 civil society organization (composed mostly of medical doctors) to run the agency. It was
 mandated to determine, lead, and manage relief, rehabilitation, and development
 programs in the conflict-affected areas in Mindanao. In 2005 the World Bank began to
 work with the BDA, with the tacit approval of the Philippine government. The World
 Bank provided technical and financial support to develop the BDA as an institution
 through the Mindanao Trust Fund for Reconstruction and Development Program (MTF-
 RDP). During the initial stages of the BDA other donors were reluctant to work with the
 agency but then began to do so after seeing its effective collaboration with the World
 Bank on the CDD program. While the final settlement (expected with the passage of the
 Bangsamoro Basic Law) is still pending, the BDA launched the Bangsamoro Development
 Plan (BDP, 2014), a roadmap for economic development of the Bangsamoro area.
 Currently, the BDA is the leading development agency for the Bangsamoro people. With

 the support of the World Bank and other partners, it helped deliver community
 development and livelihood programs to over 500,000 people in more than 215 villages in
 75 municipalities across Mindanao. As of 2015, the BDA has over 300 staff operating with
 a Central Management Office based in Cotabato City, which oversees six regional offices
 across Mindanao.

To make efficient and timely use of what became a network of trust funds for
Mindanao, the World Bank worked with the government, the MILF, and the United
Nations to create the Facility for Advisory Support for Transition Capacities
(FASTRAC)—an important instrument for the World Bank’s engagement strategy in
Mindanao, designed as a quick-response technical assistance mechanism to respond
to the needs identified by the Government of Philippines and MILF and the formal
transition bodies to help in the transition to Bangsamoro. FASTRAC came about as a
response to the October 2012 Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB).
After the FAB was signed, the United Nations and the World Bank mobilized a joint
mission to assess how to support implementation of the Agreement, with a focus on
building the capacity of the MILF.

FASTRAC built on the complementarity of respective mandates and comparative
strengths of the World Bank and the United Nations and had two pockets of
funding—one for each of the two institutions. This means the United Nations steps
up with funds when the World Bank cannot provide direct support, such as
initiatives on security and political transition. For the World Bank partnering with
the United Nations via this facility expands the scope of its support beyond
economic development and taps into the knowledge of the United Nations on
political processes and the broader mandate that allows working with many
different actors in the country. Despite some operational difficulties, FASTRAC is a
good model of cooperation where the funding streams are separate but the decision-
making is shared.

In Northern Uganda, the World Bank played an important role convening and
organizing donors and development partners and spearheading the PRDP. This
included chairing Donor Technical Group on Northern Uganda Rehabilitation and
Development that still meets. The World Bank also chaired the Transitional
Demobilization and Reintegration Program, a regional MDTF.

FINANCING
In Indonesia, the World Bank had had projects in Aceh since the late 1990s, with
generic developmental objectives with little or no reference to the conflict. The KDP,


38
                                                                                   CHAPTER 3
                                                                       SUBNATIONAL CONFLICTS
a countrywide CDD program, gave the World Bank a strong presence on the
ground. Before the tsunami, the project’s implementation was adapted to Aceh
circumstances—a larger share (about 95 percent) of subprojects went for community
infrastructure, with only a small amount for individual grants—compared to about
one-fourth for individual households in the rest of Indonesia. Local labeling of
activities as “World Bank” rather than Government of Indonesia helped to sidestep
local hostility to the central and provincial government. After the tsunami and the
2005 peace agreement, the institutional infrastructure of KDP played a critical role in
implementing reconstruction and rehabilitation programs. Some KDP resources
were reprogramed specifically for aid to victims of the conflict. The government
funded Community‐Based Reintegration Assistance for Conflict Victims (known as
BRA-KDP), adapted the KDP model to provide $22.7 million to conflict victims.

In the Philippines, the largest financial support for Mindanao came through the MDF,
discussed above. The ARMM Social Fund for Peace and Development Project (2002-
14, $61 million) had almost 1 million direct beneficiaries. The Mindanao Rural
Development Project I ($41 million, 1999-2005) and II ($84 million, 2007–14) created
job opportunities through rural infrastructure projects for roads and irrigation
facilities as well as livelihood and micro-enterprise subprojects. There were 2 million
direct project beneficiaries, about half of them women, and one-fourth IDPs.

IFC has also engaged with the private sector in Mindanao and had maintained an
office in the provincial capital of Davao until 2013. The engagement was rather limited
(six investments and five advisories). The successes with the private sector in the
conflict areas of Mindanao have come mostly in rural areas, including the Unifrutti
advisory service project in 2008. The proposed new IFC investment with Unifrutti is
expected to create 4,000 hectares of new farms and generate 6,000‐7,000 jobs, a large
proportion of which will employ ex-combatants of MILF (Box 3.2).


 Box 3.2. IFC’s Advisory Service and Client Engagement in Mindanao with Unifrutti
 Unifrutti has been active in attracting investors to Mindanao from leading corporations in
 the Philippines and providing advice on how to do investments in Mindanao. In addition to
 strong relationships between IFC, Unifrutti, and local government, project partners also got
 buy-in from high-level leaders within the MILF. This ensured security within the project’s
 borders while operating in a highly volatile region. Meanwhile, Muslim groups in Mindanao
 viewed the project positively, because Unifrutti had a good record of establishing a long-
 term profitable venture in the conflict-affected areas of Mindanao, and it helped them to
 begin to be viewed as a respectable political party. Another success factor was the project
 team’s emphasis on the assessment of the gender, environment, and peace and conflict risks
 during due diligence. For instance, peace and conflict risk assessment strengthened IFC’s

In Northern Uganda, the main operational engagement since 2003 has been the
NUSAF I (2003-09, $100 million) followed by the NUSAF II (2009-15, $100 million).
Both were CDD projects, with components for supporting vulnerable groups, post-
conflict reconciliation, infrastructure rehabilitation, conflict management, and
developing local community institutions.

In Sri Lanka, the national education program (Education Sector Development
Program, $60 million) incorporated features to address fragility by expanding
activities of the project to the northern regions and introducing initiatives such as
psycho-social support programs, conflict engagement models, multiethnic classes,
development of multiethnic curriculum materials, and multiethnic school linkage
programs.

CDD was used as a mechanism for delivering support to marginal communities
(Second North East Irrigated Agriculture Project (NEIAP II), and Community
Livelihoods in Conflict-Affected Areas). The NEIAP compiled district social baseline
profiles that became analytical insights to work with conflict-affected communities
and laid important foundations for the various Bank projects that followed. Design
documentation acknowledged recent experience in Bosnia and Herzegovina and
used this experience in the formulation of project components, suggesting that it is
not feasible to define an overall strategy a priori. A suite of projects delivered in the
North East (North East Housing Reconstruction Program, Puttalam Housing Project,
North East Local Services Improvement Project, and Emergency Northern Recovery
Project) responded to the needs of post-conflict environments: cash handouts,
reconstruction support, housing and/or shelter, community-based infrastructure,
education support to get children back in schools, and capacity development
programs to reengage regional authorities.

ANALYTICAL AND ADVISORY WORK
Indonesia. There was a considerable amount of AAA specifically on Aceh that
started after the tsunami and the peace agreement. The Preliminary Damage and
Loss Assessment (2005) provided the basis to organize the massive multilateral relief
effort in Aceh through the MDTF. GAM Reintegration Needs Assessment (2005),
conducted in partnership with GAM6 assessed the post-conflict process of
reintegration, focusing on potential obstacles to peace; identified the needs and

                                                                 SUBNATIONAL CONFLICTS
aspirations of former combatants, prisoners, and receiving communities; and helped
develop programs and mechanisms to address these needs.

Of the many other analytic activities, three stand out. The Aceh Public Expenditure
Analysis (PER, 2007) was led by the World Bank in collaboration with four Acehnese
universities and with support of the acting governor of Aceh. Interviewees gave this
report credit for guiding the recovery and reconstruction effort in Aceh, although it
is not clear which of the report’s 25 key recommendations were implemented. The
Multi-Stakeholder Review of Post-–Conflict Programming in Aceh (MSR, 2010) took
stock of Aceh’s post-conflict needs and provided recommendations to help
consolidate peace and promote prosperity in Aceh. Conflict and Dispute Resolution
in Indonesia: Information from the 2006 Governance and Decentralization Survey
(2010) sought to explain national patterns of conflict and dispute resolution, the use
of police services and the formal legal system, and connections between governance
factors (corruption, bribery, and information about development projects) and
conflict and dispute resolution. Other relevant AAA included a study on Violent
Conflict in Indonesia (covering the whole country), a component of the 2010
Consolidating Peaceful Development Program; and Aceh Conflict Monitoring
Updates in Conflict and Development reports.

IFC implemented advisory service projects in Aceh after the tsunami to help revive
private sector activities. IFC’s advisory service projects were developed under a new
multi-donor initiative, the Private Enterprise Partnership for Aceh and Nias
(PEPAN). FIAS7 cooperated with PEPAN to prepare an investment climate
diagnostic and develop an investment promotion strategy for the region. PEPAN
played a role in rehabilitating the shrimp sector in Aceh, and was the first
international organization focused on providing technical advice to farmers,
whereas others were focused on physical reconstruction of infrastructure.

The Philippines. Almost all the analytical activities in Mindanao have components
for developing the institutional capacity of local governments and civil society—
since the chosen political solution involved devolution of authority and resources to
local institutions. The central analytical output was the Joint Needs Assessment for
Conflict-Affected Areas of Mindanao (JNA, 2005, 5 volumes). It was produced and
published by the World Bank with the participation of a host of stakeholders.
Coming at the beginning of the collaboration with the BDA, the JNA became the
blueprint for the work together. The JNA recommended working through local
government units, with nongovernmental organizations, and with CDD-type
projects. Collaboration on the JNA brought the donors together to support the
Multi-Donor Fund for Mindanao (2007-15), discussed earlier.

CHAPTER 3
SUBNATIONAL CONFLICTS
Other analytical work complemented the JNA. Human Development for Peace and
Prosperity in ARMM (2003) identified three critical factors that underpin the
substantial disparities in basic human development indicators between ARMM and
the rest of the country: extreme poverty, armed conflict, and historical disadvantage.
The study was relevant and of good quality, but its impact was not clear. The
ARMM Social Fund project, starting shortly before the study was published and
then continuing thereafter, makes no reference to the study in its documentation.
Gender and Peace-Building Experience in the Philippines report analyzed the
gender dimension of the conflict in the Philippines and related gender policy to
peace-building at the national level. Violent Conflicts and Displacement in Central
Mindanao: Challenges for recovery and development (2011, joint with WFP)
provided evidence about recovery needs and development strategies in the conflict-
affected areas.

Uganda: The World Bank produced several AAA on the Northern Uganda conflict
region—but no overall needs assessment in conjunction with the donor community.
The more important ones were the Public Expenditure Review for Northern Uganda
(PER, 2007) and the Uganda Post-Conflict Land Policy and Administration Options:
The Case of Northern Uganda (2009). The PER estimated the total public resource
flows to the wide North region and covered both on- and off-budget flows. The
Land Policy paper addressed land tenure, one of the most pressing issues during
and after the conflict in Northern Uganda (and throughout the country), aiming to
inform the PRDP and the ongoing preparation of the National Land Policy. It
recommended immediate actions in relation to IDPs and land policy. IEG learned
that these recommendations were not fully taken on board by the government. In
recent years, the intensity of analytical work related to Northern Uganda seems to
have gone down sharply. IEG was unable to locate recent AAA on the conflict in
Northern Uganda or an economic report that would provide a diagnostic and sound
analytical underpinning for going forward.

GENDER AND CONFLICT
In addition to several common themes relating to gender impacts of conflicts, there
were also specific characteristics in each country relating to the overlap of conflict
and gender dimensions. In the Philippines, there was human trafficking of young
women and children in displaced communities in the ARMM region.8 In Indonesia,
some women faced sexual violence from soldiers, as a tactic of terror against their
communities.9 In Uganda, many LRA rebels targeted women for forced marriages.
In Sri Lanka, several thousand war widows in the North and the East are still
without access to adequate resources, housing, or vocational skills and are often
denied land rights and exposed to sexual violence and trafficking.10

                                                                              CHAPTER 3
                                                                  SUBNATIONAL CONFLICTS
Bank strategies emphasize conflict and gender issues in the latter half of the
evaluation period (2010 onwards), except for Sri Lanka. Gender issues in conflict-
affected areas were primarily addressed through involving women in CDD projects.
Findings from focus group discussions in Indonesia (BRA‐KDP project) suggest that
women-headed households tended to be more actively engaged than other women
in attending community meetings and participating actively since they were less
likely to be represented by men. While former combatants have found full-time
employment since 2006, certain groups, including women‐headed households, have
not benefited proportionally and are vulnerable to economic shocks.11

In Uganda, NUSAF I made systematic efforts to make the project gender-responsive.
NUSAF II built on lessons on gender from NUSAF I by further developing and
tracking gender equity outcome indicators and monitoring delivery of project
benefits. In Sri Lanka, CDD projects in conflict-affected areas showed success in
engaging women both in project implementation and as beneficiaries. There was no
systematic coverage of gender issues in conflict-affected areas beyond CDD projects.

Analytical work on gender and conflict was thin, and where it existed, it was not
translated into operations. In Indonesia, “Justice for the Poor” looked at reforms in
religious courts including easier access for women but no specifics of this program are
found in Aceh. Philippines is one of the few countries that included gender and
conflict-related analytical work during the evaluation period. ARMM Human
Development Sector Study suggested that more boys drop out of school in their early
teens than girls, and observed that early dropout rates of boys may itself feed the
supply of boys who take up arms. However, there were no follow-up programs that
worked with youth who had taken up arms or were ex-combatants. Country Gender
Assessments in the Philippines and Uganda did not focus on the gender and fragility.


Assessment
Indonesia: Among cases reviewed, Aceh was the clearest success in terms of ending
the conflict. The tsunami shocked the government and GAM into making a peace
deal that has lasted so far. Large funding for the physical reconstruction also created
many business and employment opportunities for ex-combatants and potential
insurgents. Current assessments see a low risk of a return to organized violence. The
previously insurgent organization GAM has converted into a recognized political
party, which is now in power as the government of the Aceh province, with a special
degree of autonomy.

The willingness of both parties to change to peaceful strategies and the fortuitous
flood of funding are the distinctive features of the case, but the World Bank was an


                                                                                     43
CHAPTER 3
SUBNATIONAL CONFLICTS
important facilitator. The World Bank’s high-capacity presence on the ground prior
to the tsunami, through the KDP, and the willingness of regional management to try
innovative arrangements enhanced the ability of the World Bank to play this
facilitating role. The World Bank’s presence in Aceh since the 1990s had developed
local expertise and trust with GAM cadres in the field. With the wave of funding for
emergency relief, the World Bank assumed a central role in coordinating donor
efforts. The Government of Indonesia regarded the World Bank as a neutral and
nonpolitical player, representing a technocratic approach to development. This
contrasted with the United Nations, which, according to some, was perceived as
more politicized institution and conveyed the undesirable impression that Indonesia
had a security problem.

The World Bank’s efforts in the post-tsunami period focused on repairing damage
from the tsunami and the impact of organized violence. Although the damage and
needs arising from the two overlapped, there was some differentiation, particularly
because some donors preferred to focus on one more than (or even to the exclusion
of) the other. The World Bank worked on both, through trust funds, essentially
making the donor funding fungible for meeting whatever needs seemed most
urgent. This work was not labeled as conflict prevention, but the creation of jobs and
business opportunities in the reconstruction effort played an essential role in
demobilizing and reintegrating ex-combatants.

The World Bank ended its presence in Aceh in 2012 after the tsunami reconstruction
was declared accomplished. No institutional arrangement was left in place to
monitor conflict risks in developmental programs. Some government officials, Bank
staff, and others have questioned the wisdom of this hasty exit. Although to date
major violence has not returned, some of the drivers of the original conflict remain,
and governance capacity at provincial level remains weak and very thinly spread.
The assets of the World Bank’s social and human capital in Aceh were allowed to
dissipate, although a number of Bank staff and consultants subsequently moved to
support the World Bank program in Mindanao. IFC closed its office in Aceh in 2010.
Since then, IFC has not been active in promoting private sector investments in Aceh,
and a large number of early MOUs with investors have failed to materialize.

The Philippines. The World Bank Group’s engagement in Mindanao is a good
example of active and effective long-term World Bank Group engagement for FCV
situations in MICs. The World Bank had the longest engagement in the conflict areas
in Mindanao of all four cases reviewed, and the peace settlement itself has come in
phases. In terms of the violence and conflict problem, the accord signed between the
Government of the Philippines and MILF in 2014 was directly related to the goal
toward which the World Bank’s work in Mindanao aimed to contribute - peace and

                                                                    SUBNATIONAL CONFLICTS
development in one of the poorest regions in the country. Intermediate steps were
the ceasefire and other interim agreements, which not only led to the eventual
accord but also provided respites from violence, even when there was another
interim resurgence.

The World Bank’s AAA, especially the 2005 JNA, played a pivotal role in
coordinating development efforts in Bangsamoro. Even while some violent conflicts
continued, the presence of this consensus blueprint for development helped the
parties keep in mind that a peace settlement would bring a positive payoff.

As far as other indicators of progress (such as human development), reports of the
early 2010s that used data from the 2000s, do not show improvement and sometimes
register declines. Peace itself, largely in effect only since 2012, will likely influence
positive effects, even before improvements in institutions and funding take effect.
Cooperation with the newly formed BDA since 2005 was an achievement in itself
that laid the basis for a parallel track of development cooperation alongside the
negotiations for a political settlement that proceeded on a slower track. Unlike Aceh,
the peace settlement in Bangsamoro/Muslim Mindanao is not yet finalized and
there has been no formal transfer of power. The future of peace will to some extent
depend on the success in the next steps—including setting up effective governance
structures and generating growth and employment.

Uganda: The World Bank has long been a major player in the country and stepped
in to provide critical assistance when needed. The military action of the government
against LRA and the latter’s failure to keep the loyalty of the local Acholi population
were the main factors in driving LRA into exile and ending major violence. The
World Bank can claim little credit for this. In IEG interviews, Bank staff reported
little risk of reversion to organized violence. Local counterparts, on the other hand,
said that there was some risk, as socioeconomic problems persist and, if not
addressed, could give rise to other insurgent groups and violence.

NUSAF—the flagship operation in Northern Uganda—is generally viewed as a useful
intervention that provided much needed infrastructure and support for income
generation. However, insufficient consideration of whether the CDD design was
relevant for the special environment of the IDP camps resulted in less than expected
uptake of the community infrastructure component, as most people preferred private
rather than public goods. People living in the camps were not all from the same
villages, which made group formation and selection of a community infrastructure
very difficult. Nevertheless, the conflict mitigation and community reconciliation

community relations. At the same time, pressure to rapidly disburse in a weak
fiduciary environment was a contributing factor to substantial misuse of funds.

Sri Lanka: There are three key features to the World Bank’s engagement in Sri
Lanka that helped inform the work in the North East conflict areas: (i) incorporation
of fragility features into the national education program; (ii) the use of CDD for
delivering assistance directly to communities and forming strategic alliances
between key stakeholders; and (iii) recognition that integration and coordination of
key projects is essential. While many of the projects were delivered through different
sector boards and by different task team leaders, there was a consistent narrative
that informed the projects in Sri Lanka, and an understanding among the task team
leaders of what had to be done and where the emphasis needed to be to make the
projects work. This was due to pragmatic and flexible use of country strategy to
inform the conflict response; steady confidence in local staff; and development of
project systems that ensured that even when conflicts arose, the mechanisms could
be switched on and off based on circumstances.


Conclusions and Lessons
        Sustained engagement in subnational FCV situations—through analytical work
         or CDD projects—ahead of the peace settlement and during the ongoing
         violence was helpful. The lessons learned and development of contacts with
         and credibility among the parties to the conflicts have important payoffs once
         there is a peace settlement (Mindanao, Aceh).
        Direct dialogue by the World Bank with an insurgent group can help the parties
         move toward a peace agreement. Initial approval of the government is needed,
         but the dialogue can continue even through periods of renewed fighting that
         interrupts the interaction between government and insurgents. This way, the
         World Bank’s financial support for projects can start before the peace
         settlement and continue on at least a maintenance level during intervals when
         violence resurfaces.
        Comprehensive assessment of the situation with participation from both sides of
         the conflict—the government and the insurgent organization (or its
         development wing)—helps to set the stage for subsequent reconstruction and
         development efforts. Such exercises in Aceh and Mindanao helped greatly; the
         absence of one in Northern Uganda probably diminished the World Bank’s
         effectiveness.
        CDD projects have proven a useful entry point for the World Bank into the
         conflict-affected areas and a convenient tool for facilitating participation of
         local stakeholders. Three important features of CDD projects were (i)

                                                                 SUBNATIONAL CONFLICTS
    perception of the World Bank’s role as impartial and technocratic player, (ii)
    sustained presence and engagement in the conflict-affected area, and (iii)
    Bank’s support to building capacity in local organizations and partners, such as
    BDA in Mindanao.
   Flexibility of project design and ability of management at various levels (project
    and country) to take quick decisions is key. The World Bank adapted the KDP
    project to the circumstances of Aceh during the conflict, and reallocated
    resources quickly after the tsunami, as needs changed.
   Support to the education sector can be important in dealing with issues of
    fragility, particularly as they pertain to psycho-social issues among children
    and providing safe spaces for integration and community cohesion to develop.
    The Sector-Wide Approach (SWAP) program in Sri Lanka showed that
    national-level programs can effectively identify fragility issues and engage
    specific instruments that address these in relevant areas while still adhering to
    the commitments at the national level.
   Creating opportunities for employment and local entrepreneurial success can help
    making a peace settlement last. This happened in Aceh, and while it was the
    massive donor funding after the tsunami that helped enable this, it is possible
    that even more modestly funded post-conflict programs could replicate this by
    giving priority to infrastructure projects executed by local firms and workers.
    This might come at the expense of some funding for human development
    projects, but these have a longer time to payoff, a longer term that the area
    might never reach if conflict were to restart.
   IFC engagement was relatively limited, especially when compared to the World
    Bank and other donors. Opportunities were sometimes missed due to the lack
    of coordination and communication between the World Bank and IFC. The
    One World Bank Group approach, including the co-location of offices, could
    have improved joint contributions. IFC was not flexible enough to make
    necessary changes to its instruments or staff incentives in FCV situations in
    non-FCS countries, despite the high demonstration effect of its active presence
    for the private sector.
   Continuity in Bank staffing policy in FCV situations in non-FCS was not
    common, but when it happened, the payoff was clear. The transfer of many
    Bank staff who worked on conflict and violence issues in Aceh, Indonesia, to
    the World Bank’s Philippine country office resulted in the effective transfer of
    knowledge and expertise that benefited the program in Mindanao.
   Maintaining presence (even nominal) in former conflict zones may be necessary
    to help sustain peaceful development. Various sources—nongovernment
    organizations, donors, and former Bank staff—expressed concern that the
    World Banks’s exit from Aceh was too sudden and too early, given the weak

4. Violence Related to Crime and Drug Trade
Manifesting differently in the two countries studied, drug-motivated criminal
violence is a specific example of social and political disruption caused by external
economic forces—in this case, the demand for cocaine.

A large MIC such as Colombia, with relatively durable public and nongovernmental
institutions, can resist the penetration of its public space by criminals. This is not to
underestimate the challenge to the state posed by the various Colombian cocaine
cartels and rebel groups in the 1990s, which disrupted and terrorized public
administration in urban and rural areas alike. In Honduras, criminal elements have
been able to eviscerate the courts, the police, and the administration. In both
countries, there are three important aspects of drug-driven violence that
policymakers need to appreciate.

The first is that most of the violence associated with the drug trade occurs between
rival cartels—the general public get drawn into and blighted by this violence, but
they are not the principal victims (although spill-over effects such as prostitution
and protection racketeering do inhibit healthy economic activity).

The second is that youth gangs form around the drug trade, providing the foot
soldiers who carry out violence. This represents a serious challenge to states that are
unable to provide adequate employment opportunities to young men (“adequate”
meaning forms of employment that offer enough prospects of upward mobility to
counteract the prestige and identity that comes with gang membership; short-term,
labor-intensive job programs clearly do not fit this description).

The third is the way criminal profits can distort ideological motivation, as can be
seen in the history of the FARC. Most long-running liberation movements in the
post-Cold War world are sustained by illicit funds, making the resolution of
conflicts more complex for peacemakers—who often must balance the acquisitive
motivations of leaders against the desire of their followers for social and economic
justice.

Colombian government efforts to counter the drug threat have been relatively
successful. A small, relatively poor MIC like Honduras cannot hope to manage such
a threat without enormous external assistance. In the case of drugs, though, the
numbers are sobering: data from the 2011 WDR show that the amount of money
spent by the United States and other regional partners on combatting the drug trade
in 2010 amounted to less than one percent of the value added to the raw cocaine sold

in North American markets that year. The economic muscle fueling this criminal
industry is overwhelming.

The literature tends to identify four major drivers of conflict and violence in
Colombia: political polarization; rural conflict, inequality, and lack of property
rights; limited state presence; and illegal drug markets. (See Appendix A.5 for
details.) Although the level of violence has been visibly reduced, it still has
significant impact on the lives of people. In 2013 about 157,000 new families were
displaced, and thousands of displaced households are still not able to repossess their
land due to ongoing violence. According to UNHCR, the cumulative number of
IDPs reached about 5 million by 2015, the highest of any country in the world.

During the past decade, countries in the Central America’s Northern Triangle—El
Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras—experienced some of the world’s highest
crime and homicide rates. (See Appendix A.6 for details.) In 2011 the World Bank
issued a major diagnostic report on crime and violence in Central America,
summarizing lessons and identifying priorities for the future.1 This evaluation takes
the 2011 study as a point of departure to examine the assistance of the World Bank
to Honduras, as it was issued in parallel with and provided the analytical basis for
the 2012 CPS. The 2012 CPS also introduced for the first time an explicit thematic
pillar/objective focusing on citizen security. The 2011 report suggested several
strategies to deal with crime and violence: (i) preventive measures, focusing on
children and families; (ii) effective law enforcement; (iii) policies regarding drug
trafficking; and (iv) coordinated regional approaches and international initiatives


World Bank Group Response
Colombia. This assessment covers the period since late 1990s. The World Bank
interventions generally aimed at mitigating the impact of conflict and violence on
households, farmers, and communities, as well as at addressing some drivers of
conflict. These two goals were highly interlinked and their importance changed over
time. During the period reviewed the World Bank started with mitigation activities
at the local level (supporting communities under extreme duress) and, as the
security situation gradually improved, started working with local institutions (with
an emphasis on supporting the education sector). Eventually the World Bank moved
to facilitating broader regional or national-level policies, with an emphasis on land
titling and restitution.

The 1997-2002 CAS introduced for the first time a specific pillar to address the issue
of violence. It acknowledged that the World Bank could no longer be on the

sidelines, and emphasized small knowledge transfer operations. The World Bank
started its involvement in the Magdalena Medio region with an objective to develop
demand-driven projects in partnership with a large set of local partners at the
community level.2 Magdalena Medio LIL,3 and Peasant Enterprise Zone LIL
supported poor farmers who had fled to the agriculture frontier areas of Colombia.
To prevent collapse of school services in communities with high levels of violence,
the World Bank prepared Pasto Education and Antioquia Basic Education pilot
projects. The goal was to enhance decentralization through improvement of
institutional capacity of local education authorities.

The 2003-07 CAS period witnessed a temporary slowdown in the level of violence,
which later intensified sharply. The authorities asked the World Bank to include a
special Peace and Development pillar in the World Bank assistance. The new Peace
and Development series of projects were envisaged as an extension of the
Magdalena Medio project to other regions. Continuous strengthening of the
education sector at the local level was seen as an important vehicle to support local
governments. A major development during this period was the increase in the
cumulative number of IDPs. The World Bank planned to support authorities’ efforts
to address their needs through expansion of the existing safety nets. Social Safety
Net project (2006, $191 million) allowed expansion of the existing FAMILIAS safety
net to cover the IDPs. More prominence was given to the issues of property and land
protection, an area that would become increasingly important over time.

The 2008-11 CPS initially envisaged focus on reintegration and reparation issues
through expansion of the Peace and Development projects. However, the global
financial and economic crisis changed the plans and large part of the World Bank
lending moved toward budget support operations. The World Bank assistance
concentrated on supporting FAMILIAS through a $636 million Second Social Safety
Net project. The World Bank remained active in mobilizing grants and donor trust
funds. As the process of reconciliation and restitution began to take hold, these
funds addressed issues of gender equity and protection of land and patrimony.
AAA started to focus on reparation issues and the demobilization of ex-combatants.

The 2012-16 CPS aimed at protecting land rights for IDPs through the ongoing
projects and grants, reflecting on the progress in security and reconciliation. A major
development during this period was the passage of the 2011 Victims and Restitution
Law, facilitating restitution of IDPs and the start of restitution claims, including the
creation of a new Land Restitution Unit. The World Bank remained active in this
area through Phase II of the State and Peace- Building Trust Fund and collaborated
with the new unit on a 2013 Land Assessment.

Honduras. The 2007-10 CPS period witnessed a 50 percent increase in the homicide
rate (from 50 to 78 per 100,000 inhabitants) in just three years. The CPS completion
report contains a major recommendation to address youth unemployment and
ensure that students are incentivized to stay in school rather than to join gangs. It
also recommends focusing on the quality of education, preparing youth for work,
and slum upgrading. These recommendations appear relevant and consistent with
2011 Diagnostic Report.

The 2012-14 CPS has an explicit and detailed pillar to address crime and violence,
entitled “Improving Citizen Security.” The strategy envisages a series of activities,
including: (i) supporting a new Integrated National Citizen Security and
Coexistence Program through a programmatic series of Development Policy Credits
(DPC); (ii) supporting violence prevention capacity of local governments and
communities through implementing and scaling up the ongoing Barrio Ciudad
project; (iii) enhancing employment opportunities for youth through the
implementation of Mi Primer Empleo component of the Nutrition and Social
Protection project; (iv) linking National Interventions to Regional approaches by
strengthening the capacity of SICA (Sistema de Integración Centroamericana) in the
area of crime and violence; and (v) expanding Honduras’ major conditional cash
transfer safety net, the Bono 10,000 Program. The CPS did not refer to coordination
and division of labor with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), a major
lender in Honduras, involved in the areas of security and justice, with much of its
activities potentially complementary to the World Bank’s work.

The CPS Progress Report (2013) states that “the Government of Honduras is making
progress toward a comprehensive approach to citizen security,” although the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of the First DPC operation acknowledged
that efforts in this area had been “marginal, sporadic and underfunded.”

The Programmatic DPC Series. The First Programmatic DPC (2011, $86 million)
included a Citizen Security component to support a “paradigm shift” in the
government strategy from law enforcement to prevention, calling for a more
integrated approach to violence and relying less on the earlier “iron fist” policies.4
Local governments have been at the forefront of these efforts and some
municipalities developed citizen security plans—some of them with the support of
the then ongoing Barrio Ciudad project.

The DPC included a series of prior actions, intermediate outcome indicators, and
indicative triggers for the Second DPC. The specific policy steps supported by the
prior actions were very modest and weak institutionally (easily reversed) relative to
the ambitious paradigm defined in the strategy. The Second DPC (2014, $55 million)


                                                                                         53
CHAPTER 4
VIOLENCE RELATED TO CRIME AND DRUG TRADE
did not follow up on the unfinished agenda of the first DPC, and there was no
reference to crime and violence issues or to the “paradigm shift.” The credit focused
instead on supporting the Bono 10,000 (Honduras’ main conditional cash transfer
safety net program)—the largest single area of Bank financial support since 2010.
The project documents do not address the links between the safety net and the
objective of reducing conflict and violence in vulnerable communities.

Supporting improved security in urban communities. Between 1980 and 2000, Honduras
experienced the highest rate of urbanization in Central America, resulting in a major
mismatch between the demand and supply of basic public services. In the process,
urban poverty and violence increased sharply. Surveys undertaken in Tegucigalpa
in 2000 reported violence as the second most important problem (after water supply)
affecting families in poor neighborhoods and the most important one in wealthier
areas. In response, the government developed a strategy to mainstream crime and
violence prevention into the urban development agenda. The World Bank assisted
these efforts through the pilot Barrio Ciudad project ($15 million, 2005-13), followed
up by the Safer Municipalities Project (SMP, $15 million, 2012).

The Barrio Ciudad project was considered a pilot intervention—it was the World
Bank’s first urban development project in Central America in more than 10 years
and the World Bank’s first explicit effort in addressing crime and violence
prevention in Honduras. The project provided loans to eligible municipalities to
invest in basic infrastructure. It had a very small component focusing explicitly on
the reduction of homicide through special urban designs (improved lighting of
streets, broader streets, etc.) and community initiatives to prevent local violence. The
ICR (2013) rates the project outcome moderately satisfactory, but the evidence and
performance indicators presented are weak. Originally actual measures of changes
in the incidence of crime and violence in the target communities were to be used, but
the ICR redefined the indicators in terms of change in perceptions. A major
drawback is the lack of information on the specific subprojects implemented and
their direction. There is no discussion on whether some of the subprojects were
scaled-up and survived independently of Bank financing. For a pilot project that was
intended to provide knowledge and lessons, little can be drawn from its experience.

The ongoing Safer Municipalities Project built on the approach developed in the
Barrio Ciudad but had some important changes in direction. First, assistance for
preventing crime and violence at the local level is the main objective of the program
and it influences its design. Second, it integrates crime and violence prevention
activities at the municipal and community levels. Third, the project tries to organize
and coordinate the growing assistance from other multilateral and bilateral donors.
A major direction of the project are efforts to directly target families, youth, and

children at risk, and identify pilots in “hot spot” neighborhoods, in line with the
2011 report recommendations.

This is the only project focusing directly on crime and violence in Honduras
following the “prevention paradigm.” Project design includes an impressive M&E
system—a clear improvement relative to the Barrio Ciudad program—which, if
properly implemented, will yield important lessons for the future.


Assessment
Colombia. This assessment identified four major themes/areas of World Bank
Group engagement. The order they are listed below reflects the evolution of the
World Bank response and its adaptation to the evolving situation: from supporting
local communities and preventing the collapse of basic services under extreme
situations to increasingly supporting programs and institutions of broader longer-
term relevance.

Supporting cohesion of communities under stress (Magdalena Medio and Peace and
Development projects): The CDD model, through series of relatively small and
experimental operations, was one of the few possible points of entry for Bank
assistance that could have been scaled-up and replicated. The approach was to help
create collective decision-making and problem solving capacity within the
communities. In some regions demand-driven projects had already been initiated by
the Colombian civil society. The World Bank was able to join and support those
efforts. The definition of community varied widely, often including a whole a
municipality. The model was able to preserve and stabilize a minimum standard of
living and rebuild social and human capital in a context of absence of government
institutions at the local level. The subprojects were particularly successful in cases
when incentives were created for participants to invest their own resources, join a
productive chain, and achieve some minimum economies of scale. Land titling was
critical, as it allowed farmers to borrow using land as collateral for investment.

The operational model used by the World Bank presumed moving from small
learning and innovation projects (LILs) to larger operations, facilitating the
participation of other donors and the government. Implementation required good
knowledge of local conditions as well as plain courage on the part of the task team
leaders. A major shortcoming of the series was the lack of systematic documentation
on the nature and specific objectives of the subprojects, which undermined proper
monitoring of progress and evaluation of results, as well as limited opportunities for

and qualitative assessments by IEG mission in the field.


 Box 4.1. Learning and Innovation Loans: The Magdalena Medio Series, 1998-2002
 The Region of Magdalena Medio was particularly affected by violence during the late 90s
 because of its strategic location. Guerilla and drug groups fought for the control of the
 region and its resources and state troops were mobilized to confront them. The
 municipality of Barrancabermeja became was one of the main five centers of urban
 violence in Colombia and by 2000 had one of the highest homicides rates in the world,
 about 250 per 100,000 per year. Rural areas were also heavily affected. While urban areas
 in the region were large receptors of IDPs, rural population decreased by 10.7 percent in
 the 1993-2005 period due to forced displacement. Parcels located in the basins of the Rio
 Magdalena became particularly attractive to mobilize troops, arms and drugs through the
 region. Displacements and the constant threats from armed groups deeply disrupted the
 rural economy, particularly small and vulnerable farmers.
 It was during that period that a group of civil society leaders—the Catholic Church,
 Unions, the National Petroleum Company (ECOPETROL) and specialized
 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)—got together to assess the main needs and
 challenges faced by the population in the region. The initiative was helped by the high
 moral reputation of these leaders and the perception of them being neutral by all parts
 involved in the conflict. It provided the basis for the creation of the Program for
 Development and Peace of the Magdalena Medio Region (PDPMM), initiated in 1995 and
 implemented through y the Consortium for Development and Peace of the Magdalena Medio
 (CDPMM). They developed a demand-driven approach with emphasis on development
 of skills and tools to allow communities to identify their priorities and build the capacity
 to achieve them. The ultimate goal was to foster development through a participatory
 approach at the local level that could eventually cover several municipalities to work on
 shared objectives.
 In 1998 the World Bank decided to support the Magdalena Program through a $5 million
 LIL, the Magdalena Medio Development Project, Phase I (MMDP-I), to help test and refine a
 participatory methodology and establish the basis for the design and implementation of
 an ambitious ten-year community-led, multisectoral development program. Broadly, the
 strategy responded to two potential opportunities: (i) obtain valuable knowledge from an
 ongoing program in a context of conflict; (ii) join and support an effort with a unique set
 of partners and actors available that point in time.
 Shortly after the start of the PDPMM, other regions initiated programs with very similar
 goals and internal structure as the CDPMM Consortium. A follow-up Second Magdalena
 Medio Development Project was approved in 2001, and shortly after the Magdalena
 Program seem to have started to have some catalytic impact at the regional and national
 levels. The EU allocated €50 million to the Magdalena Program, which became the EU
 First Peace Laboratory Project (Laboratorios de Paz). During the following years, the EU
 significantly scaled-up the scope of the intervention covering other regions in Colombia.

 The 2002 National Development Plan explicitly recognized these regional demand-driven
 programs as important strategies to be supported to promote peace and development in
 poor areas subject to violence. The plan acknowledged the importance of working with
 the World Bank, the EU and UNDP on such approaches, based on the experiences so far,
 in particular the experience with the Magdalena Medio Program. PRODEPAZ, a network
 of partner organizations (POs) was created in 2002 to improve coordination efforts among
 different consortiums and organizations supporting these types of programs. PRODEPAZ
 became an important partner for the World Bank’s subsequent Peace and Development
 operations that expanded to different regions with support from grass-roots
 organizations and local leaders.

As the security situation in Colombia improved and the state was able to gradually
enhance its institutional presence at the local level, the focus of the government and
the external assistance changed. The World Bank ended its assistance to this model
in 2012. The authorities showed increased interest in assistance for decentralization
and strengthening of local governments—as government institutions regain their
standing in the conflict areas.

Education in the time of conflict (Pasto, Antioquia, Rural Education, and Antioquia
Upper Education projects). The World Bank has shown significant commitment to
support education in Colombia under very difficult circumstances. The conflict
magnified the limitations of a highly centralized education system, with limited
capacity at the local level. Teachers and social leaders were often targets of violent
attacks. The flow of IDPs put pressure on local education systems, primarily at the
basic level. To respond to these challenges, in 1997 the World Bank approved the
Pasto Education Project ($7.2 million) and the Antioquia Basic Education Project ($40
million). The goal was to enhance decentralization by improving institutional
capacity of local education authorities to continue education process despite the
conflict.

The flexibility of project design allowed exploring exploration of new areas, such as
curriculum reforms and building new partnerships with civil society. Here as well, a
major shortcoming was the absence of basic performance indicators (for example,
attendance, enrollment, and teacher absenteeism), which undermined the quality of
the project evaluations and the learning that could have been derived from them.

As the intensity of violence gradually declined, the second generation of projects
had broader coverage, and supported local government capacity and national
government initiatives to enhance the role of schools in peaceful coexistence

VIOLENCE RELATED TO CRIME AND DRUG TRADE
initiatives. The World Bank played an important convening role, and was successful
in disseminating knowledge, and helping to create new partnerships with NGOs
and donors, most notably through the Education for Peace Partnership.

Refocusing safety nets and reaching IDPs. The World Bank provided significant
financial and technical assistance to Colombia’s main conditional cash transfer
program—Familias en accion (FAMILIAS) from its inception in 2001. The Second
Social Safety Net project ($636 million), approved in 2008 during the global financial
crisis, was disbursed against the expansion of cash transfers. A major development
was the waiving of the means testing requirements for the IDPs. The coverage of
displaced households increased from 40 thousand in 2005 to 350 thousand in 2010,
and to 500 thousand in 2013. The share of these households in FAMILIAS almost
doubled, reaching 20 percent of the total. Today FAMILIAS may be reaching about
one-third of the total displaced population. An in-depth impact evaluation6 found
positive results, not only on education and health outcomes, but also empowerment
of women.

Land patrimony protection, titling, and restitution (Protection of Land and Patrimony of
IDPs project series). High inequality and uncertainty in the ownership of land in
poor rural communities has been both a cause and consequence of conflict and
violence in the rural areas of Colombia. The World Bank has continually focused on
this area and tried to adapt its activities to the changing intensity of the conflict over
time. During the late 1990s, at the peak of the violence, it focused on small activities
aimed at protecting vulnerable farmers in isolated regions with no presence of the
state—to learn from these interventions so they could be replicated and scaled-up at
a later stage (the Peasant Enterprise Zone for Peace Project, 1998).

As the security situation began to improve, the institutions of the state strengthened,
and legislation on restitution was introduced, the World Bank changed its focus to
more systemic activities that could assist institutions in charge of land protection
and land restitution. The centerpiece of the assistance in this area was the Protection
of Land and Patrimony of IDPs project series financed by the SPF that spanned the
period of 2002-2014. It started with a small Phase 1 ($0.8 million) and then expanded
over time to a larger Phase 3 ($8 million), in the process helping mobilize a threefold
increase in government and donor resources.

In the initial stage, the World Bank provided institutional capacity assessment and
brought international expertise in the fields of cadaster and land registry. The
methodology developed with the help of the World Bank project was piloted in 13
municipalities in five regions. These activities were scaled-up at the next stage,
reaching additional regions and specific groups of IDPs. In addition, the project

                                                                                CHAPTER 4
                                                 VIOLENCE RELATED TO CRIME AND DRUG TRADE

developed complementary measures for women and ethnic groups: it identified
barriers and constraints in protecting women’s land rights and made
recommendations. By 2011 the Colombian government made land restitution a
national policy and created the Agency for Land Restitution. According to IEG
interviews in the field and views expressed by many government officials, these
changes were largely based on the World Bank’s inputs.

At the end, Bank support to land patrimony protection, titling, and restitution
combined courage and determination by counterparts, generated volunteerism, and
had significant catalytic effects that proved to be of major systemic importance over
time. It started with a very small pilot phase and then expanded, mobilizing a
significant amount of government and donor support—spanning over more than 10
years. It proved to be critical when the security situation improved, and households
started returning to their land. It was perhaps the most successful activity
undertaken by the World Bank if measured by size of the intervention relative to the
eventual impact.

Overall, Bank interventions made useful contributions to the peace and
reconciliation agenda of the Colombian authorities. The World Bank successfully
played a catalytic role and stuck with a consistent vision for many years, and was
able to build up slowly from small opportunistic interventions to activities that have
national impact. The World Bank played an important convening role and was
successful in disseminating knowledge. It helped to create new partnerships with
NGOs and donors, as well as facilitated involvement of government agencies, but
more importantly it facilitated and built up on the existing partnerships, with the
critical input of Bank’s national staff in Colombia. These partnerships are likely to be
sustained beyond the project activity—which is an important legacy of the World
Bank. Speed and flexibility of response, in particular in disbursement and
procurement, allowed the World Bank to move quickly (often ahead of other
donors). This way, in some cases, the World Bank was able to provide a “liquidity
cushion” to many of the joint initiatives. Those were also the contributing factors for
the World Bank’s successful financial support to Colombia’s main safety net during
the global crisis, a period that also coincided with a massive growth in the volume of
IDPs.

Honduras. The 2011 diagnostic report, the 2011 CPS, and the First Programmatic
DPC had a common forceful message and strategy: the need for an integrated
strategy (a “paradigm shift”) emphasizing prevention and a need to assist at the
family level, focusing on parenting, youth at risk, and school-based programs,




                                                                                      59
CHAPTER 4
VIOLENCE RELATED TO CRIME AND DRUG TRADE
complemented with strengthening conflict resolution and citizen security
approaches at the local level.

However, most of the later operations did not follow up in this strategic direction.
The Second DPC, approved in 2014, does not refer directly to crime and violence
and does not follow up on the specific actions and policy steps addressed in this
area by the earlier operation and charted by the CPS. A significant share of the
World Bank’s financing during that period focused on supporting the expansion of
the Bono 10,000 safety net.7 However, the main objective of reducing extreme
poverty through the Bono 10,000 program was not linked to the problem of crime
and violence, despite its severity in Honduras. Project documentation describing
assistance to Bono 10,000 does not attempt to synchronize interventions that address
both poverty and violence, and how to exploit complementarities.

There is no evidence that the World Bank had a significant convening and catalytic
role working with other donors or coordinating with the IDB, which had a sizable
program in this area. Perhaps such activities did take place informally, but if they
did, they were not recorded in the general documentation.

The ongoing Safer Municipalities Project is now the main lending activity
addressing specifically groups at risk, but given its relatively small size, the impact
is likely to be limited, unless it is scaled-up in the future. Successful scaling up
requires learning at an earlier stage, which depends on having a robust M&E system
incorporated into the project design, which seems to be the case this time. Learning
from the Barrio Ciudad experience was undermined by its weak M&E.

The new Programmatic Approach to Citizen Security in Central America (2014)
presents an opportunity to systematically expand the assistance to groups at risk in
Honduras and work with other donors. The Programmatic Approach takes stock of
developments since the launch of the 2011 report, and identifies critical areas of
emphasis as seen today. Some of them have specific relevance to Honduras. This is a
welcome effort which should inform the next strategy (CPF) for Honduras. The
Programmatic Approach reaffirms two critical areas of particular relevance to
Honduras: (i) community-based approaches to violence prevention and meaningful
participation of groups and risk; and (ii) strong emphasis on youth violence
prevention, focusing on youth development, child welfare, juvenile justice, and
similar areas.

In the end, the large lending program to support the expansion of the Bono 10,000
safety net, combined with a few much smaller projects targeted to communities, was




60
                                                                              CHAPTER 4
                                               VIOLENCE RELATED TO CRIME AND DRUG TRADE

not consistent with the forcefulness in which the “new paradigm” was advocated in
the CPS and the first Development Policy Credit.

Concentrating the World Bank’s support on the safety net programs may have been
be the most efficient way to reach the most vulnerable groups. It may have had some
indirect impact in preventing and reducing violence. But this connection and the
appropriate balance between supporting safety nets and targeted interventions at
the local level to reduce violence should have been elaborated in project and strategy
documents. Wholesale support to Bono 10,000 may have preempted some critical
programs more targeted to prevent violence. The possibility of scaling Safer
Municipalities and deriving operational priorities from the new Programmatic
Approach presents now an opportunity to focus more directly on the groups at risk
and informing the new World Bank Group strategy for Honduras.


Conclusions
Honduras and Colombia are quite different in per capita income levels, institutional
development, political stability, and the importance of nongovernmental
institutions. Although violence in both countries was linked to drug traffic, in the
case of Honduras it was compounded by the emergence of powerful gangs that
could move freely across Central America and Mexico. The international component
of the problem is more severe and less under the control of the authorities than in
case of Colombia. Furthermore, in Colombia violence affected specific regions and
was more localized and perhaps more predictable. Being a small country with very
porous borders, Honduras was affected by violence across the whole country and
society. In addition, the intensity of violence in Honduras, measured by the number
of violent deaths has been much more severe. During 2000-10 the annual number of
violent deaths was about 25 per 100,000 inhabitants in Colombia, with a strong
declining trend reaching half that number in recent years. In Honduras, it increased
drastically from about 50 to 90 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, almost 10 times
higher than in Colombia.8 Thus, the challenges for the authorities and the World
Bank are also probably higher. Nevertheless, some of these differences do accentuate
learning in various areas.

      Application of the demand-driven community development model in Colombia
       through a series of relatively small and experimental operations was highly
       relevant, particularly during the earlier period of extreme conflict and
       violence. This approach eventually allowed gradual scaling up and
       replication in other communities. An important conclusion is that small



                                                                                     61

VIOLENCE RELATED TO CRIME AND DRUG TRADE
         lending operations and pilots can generate significant amount of new
         knowledge and high levels of externalities.
        Successful implementation required excellent knowledge of local conditions as
         well as determination, commitment, and plain courage on the part of the
         World Bank staff and the Colombian counterparts, which often had to operate
         in unsecure environments. Many projects (such as the Magdalena model)
         mobilized significant volunteer support in advising the communities and
         assisting in the design and implementation of the subprojects, which was
         critical for success. The World Bank helped the process and provided quick
         and early support through financing and technical assistance.
        Importance of civil society engagement. In Colombia, civil society was actively
         involved at the community level in conflict-affected areas—experimenting
         with many local initiatives prior to the World Bank involvement. The World
         Bank was able to capitalize on that knowledge and the level of trust
         developed in conflict-affected communities. The Catholic Church, NGOs,
         volunteers, and community members in high standing had already been
         involved in CDD-type activities since the 1990s. Many of the World Bank staff
         were familiar with these efforts and knew the local conditions well. All of this
         helped the World Bank’s initial efforts at the community level, as critical
         partnerships were established with these organizations early on. It also
         facilitated the scaling up efforts later. These features are not apparent in
         projects in Honduras and may have been a constraint to their success.
        Balance between budget support and small pilots. Large budget support
         operations tend to overshadow smaller innovative pilot interventions. In an
         FCV context, the small pilots were quite important for identifying working
         solutions to the most urgent needs of the communities under stress and create
         conditions for scaling up successful interventions. At the same time, they are
         often risky, time-consuming, and costly to implement. Achieving a proper
         combination of these two approaches is not easy yet quite important.
         Specialized grant programs to top-up operational budgets for small pilot
         programs in FCV situations could be a way of dealing with it.
        Link between safety nets and community approaches—In Colombia the budget
         support operations to fund the expansion of the safety net incorporated some
         modifications in eligibility to reach people most affected by the conflict. A
         similar approach could have been applied in Honduras, with necessary
         adjustments to local conditions—as part of the many projects to expand Bono
         10,000.
        M&E—In both countries community-level projects had very weak M&E
         frameworks, which undermined the assessment of results and diminished the




62
                                                                                         CHAPTER 4
                                                          VIOLENCE RELATED TO CRIME AND DRUG TRADE

        learning potential from the projects even though many of them had been
        designed as pilots.
       The convening role of the World Bank in Honduras seems to have been limited
        compared to Colombia. Little is reported on work with the IDB, which had an
        important program on issues of violence and conflict. This seem to have
        changed with the new Programmatic Approach to Citizen Security in Central
        America, where the World Bank is working closely and coordinating with
        donors.
       Regional approaches—The problems of drug trafficking and gangs are quite
        common and interlinked with other countries in Central America and Mexico.
        Therefore, the World Bank may need to focus more on regional programs in
        this area, including regional projects or joint AAA work across the relevant
        countries.

significantly broader than a community, but sharing important commonalities as far as the conflict is concerned. In contrast
with CDD, the funding did not flow directly to the community but to the Consortiums in charge of implementation, often
designated as the partner organizations (PO).

5. Failure of Governance and State Legitimacy
Violence in parts of Nigeria (Delta) and Pakistan (Balochistan, FATA, and KP
provinces) —two large and globally important MICs—is a form of subnational
organized violence, but it differs from the cases described earlier in that they reflect
lack of loyalty with and popular legitimacy of national and local government —
rather than primarily reflecting state hostility toward local minorities. (See
Appendixes A.7-8 for details on the history of these conflicts.)

The two cases differ in important ways. The Niger Delta is intermittently in
rebellion, but history shows that when the rents from oil are more fairly distributed
between local and national elites, peace can be maintained. Identity and the
perception of injustice can become a fulcrum for violence (as in the Biafra civil war
in the 1960s), but can recede when rent extraction is better balanced. As in all the
cases examined in this study, external economic and or political drivers matter. In
this case they are manifested in the actions of the major international oil companies,
but since the oil companies share common cause with federal and local elites seeking
a stable rent regime, their contribution is not necessarily destabilizing.

In Pakistan, the central government has always had difficulty extending its writ in
the mountainous tribal areas—this problem long predates the modern state. Local
elites have resisted incorporation into a national polity, seeing few benefits to joining
a modernization process that would erode their power and influence. Religious
extremism further complicates this picture, but does not determine it—these forces
have not to this point shown an ability to threaten the one institution of the state that
demonstrates real competence, the army—not least because the funds they can
attract have not empowered them to the same extent as extremists in Iraq and Syria.


World Bank Group Response
Nigeria. During the reviewed period, the World Bank moved from a policy of not
sending staff to the Niger Delta to preparing and implementing a conflict-responsive
project in four Delta states. Ending a six-year hiatus, the World Bank re-engaged
with Nigeria in 1999 after civilian government was restored following decades of
military rule. However, it was only the 2010-14 CPS that included conflict-
responsive lending to the Niger Delta, after heavy fighting between armed militias
and the government gave way to an amnesty in October 2009.

CHAPTER 5
FAILURE OF GOVERNANCE AND STATE LEGITIMACY
Non-involvement (1999-2009). The conflict in the Niger Delta does not feature
prominently in the series of interim strategy notes (ISNs, 2000-04) issued after re-
engagement. They refer variously to pollution associated with oil industry activities
being a flashpoint for political unrest; the sentiment that the Delta population was
not receiving an adequate share of natural resource wealth; and ethnic conflicts
around oil resources in the Delta being much better financed through theft of oil.
The strategy notes mention growing youth unemployment contributing to social
instability. The documents relied mainly on the existing literature since the World
Bank, due to its earlier disengagement, had done no independent diagnosis of the
conflict. Except for CDD projects, no lending was envisaged in the Delta. This was to
persist for the rest of the decade. In 2002-03 the World Bank, together with other
donors, supported a Strategic Conflict Assessment prepared by the Institute for
Peace and Conflict Resolution in Nigeria.

The 2005-09 CPS mentions that the World Bank was increasingly introducing conflict
avoidance and resolution mechanisms in its projects and cites the FADAMA1 project
as one that includes specific mechanisms to resolve conflicts over land use. The CPS
states that the causes of violent conflict identified in the Strategic Conflict
Assessment of 2002-03 largely remained and observes that “Nigeria remains
vulnerable to resurgence of conflict. The extraction of oil in the Niger Delta provides
a particular force.” The CPS Progress Report (2008) takes the view that adjustments
in the program would be made to reflect, inter alia, an increased emphasis on Niger
Delta issues. It notes that conflict in the Niger Delta threatened stability in the region
and Nigeria’s economy.

Gradual engagement (2009-2015). The 2010-13 CPS was prepared at a time of heavy
fighting between militias and government forces over control of the Niger Delta. The
CPS Progress Report (2011), prepared when the amnesty had become well-
established, observes that “in the troubled states of the Niger Delta, the potential for
deeper engagement going beyond CDD projects was to be explored.” The World
Bank expected that, in these states, extensive fiduciary work would establish a basis
to strengthen governance and institutions over the longer term. Thus, both the
admittedly fragile peace, as well as the government’s eagerness to harness donor
support to demonstrate early wins in areas such as youth employment in the wake
of the amnesty, had removed the constraints to Bank lending to the Delta states.

The World Bank appeared to have taken the lead in going into the Delta states in
support of the government’s amnesty and development program, with other donors
such as the European Union and the United Kingdom’s Department for
International Development (DFID) following. The CPS Progress Report described
the preparation of the SEEFOR project ($200 million) in Bayelsa, Delta, Edo, and

Rivers states. SEEFOR was approved in 2013 as the main vehicle of Bank support of
the government’s development program in the Niger Delta. It used the provision of
youth employment as a point of entry to strengthen generally weak PFM systems in
Bayelsa, Edo, Delta, and Rivers states. The project had been under preparation for
two years and state commitment to move forward had emerged only in small steps.2

Pakistan. World Bank Group engagement and interest in conflict-affected regions of
Pakistan has varied considerably from one CAS cycle to another. From 2000
onwards there was regular reference to the challenges of the North-West, but the
heightened focus on specific FCV projects and engagement has been evident only
since 2010. Thus, much of the relevant overview relates to events between 2010 and
2015.

In the 2010-13 CPS, the security issue is taken up more explicitly as a development
challenge to be addressed. One of the four pillars of the CPS was to improve security
and reduce the risk of conflict. The CPS focused on the conflict in KP and FATA,
identifying the need to respond to the most vulnerable and marginalized
populations. The absence of employment opportunities and inadequate livelihoods
in these areas were considered to be fertile ground for militant groups to flourish.
Addressing security was one of the transformational outcomes the CPS prioritized,
and the formulation of the MDTF for KP, FATA, and Balochistan was seen as the
key tool in responding to the security challenge.

A Post-Crisis Needs Assessment (PCNA, done jointly with the United Nations,
European Union, and ADB) was undertaken to serve as the guide for Bank support
in FATA and KP. Expected support included agriculture, technical and vocational
training, social protection, and governance programs designed to enhance the
legitimacy of the state. Based on the PCNA, the World Bank Group took the lead in
establishing and managing the MDTF.3 To support priority interventions in
Balochistan, a comprehensive Balochistan Development Needs Assessment was also
carried out.

The 2015 CPS is responding to the effort by the government to develop a
comprehensive development framework of 4Es: Energy, Economy, Extremism, and
Education. In addition to challenges from militancy, sectarian and ethnic violence,
and rising crime, the CPS notes uncertainty over the post-2014 transition in
Afghanistan and possible spillovers. Feedback from stakeholders for the CPS
consultations indicated that the foremost priorities to create conducive conditions
for economic and social progress include: in KP—improving the security situation
and creating jobs; in Balochistan—water scarcity, transparency, and sharing benefits

from natural resources, girls’ education and access to finance; in FATA—governance
and constitutional reforms.


Assessment
Nigeria: The World Bank’s limited financial leverage with the Nigerian authorities
meant that opportunities for engagement were demand-driven, and the Nigerian
government (at least in the beginning) was not keen to involve the international
community in its internal conflicts. Furthermore, the World Bank’s ability to do so
did not depend solely on the federal government, since the Nigerian states have
considerable autonomy.

Another reason for the World Bank’s noninvolvement until after the amnesty in
2009 and the buyoff of over 20,000 ex-militants was the serious security situation. In
addition, since governance was a core theme of the CPS, the World Bank was
increasingly engaging with the Nigerian states that had demonstrated a
commitment to improved governance. The states of the Niger Delta did not fulfill
this criterion and lending to them was seen as a risk. Hence, once security
considerations permitted, involvement in the Delta in the interest of mitigating
conflict required the World Bank to trade off the benefits of demonstrating early
wins against the costs of operating in a governance-challenged environment.

At the same time, the World Bank has been implementing CDD projects in the Delta
states for some considerable time. Since the governments of the Delta states did not
meet the criteria for Bank engagement, the only agents with which the World Bank
felt it could engage were communities. The fact that the community associations
managing the CDD subprojects also included members of militant groups, offered
some security assurance for the World Bank project teams.

The return of an uneasy peace to the Niger Delta in the wake of the 2009 amnesty
and the government’s desire to demonstrate early successes there provided the
donor community with the opportunity to implement conflict-responsive programs.
The SEEFOR project combined a youth employment component targeting youth
from disadvantaged backgrounds, in which the state governments were most
interested, with a component to strengthen PFM. There is no particular connection
between the two components. The youth employment component will be judged to
have delivered an early win if those graduating from the program and equipped
with vocational skills pass a market test, where success implies finding employment
or becoming entrepreneurs. In contrast, the results from the PFM component will

take considerable time to materialize. So far, the project has been extremely slow to
take off since approval in 2012, and there are no results to report.

The World Bank’s analytical and advisory work on the Niger Delta has focused on
PEMFARs, using them as an engagement and motivation tool before the project
preparation in the states participating in the SEEFOR. Given the prominence of the
conflict in the Niger Delta and fragility of peace, an economic report on the causes of
the conflict would have deepened the World Bank’s understanding of the region’s
economy and provided a sounder analytical basis for conflict-responsive lending.

There were no projects or AAA to mitigate the negative environmental impact of oil
spills and gas flaring in the Niger Delta. While in the past (prior to the amnesty) this
was explained by the security conditions in the Delta, the World Bank is still reticent
to get involved in this area.

Pakistan: This evaluation identified three major themes or areas of engagement.
Each theme includes specific lending operations, technical assistance, and
partnerships.

Education in conflict.4 Bank interventions sought to ensure continued access to
education, in particular for girls, and development of institutional structures at the
provincial level. The capacity-building components that funded training for teachers
and staff, student achievement testing, and M&E, was instrumental to the successful
implementation of the project. The education team has seen a shift in priorities
regarding the education portfolio and acknowledged that the appetite for working
in difficult regions has grown. This has been partly driven by the priorities of the
World Bank strategy, but also by the performance of the provincial government and
its continued interest in education programs.

National and Regional CDD and Social Development Projects as complementary fragility
tools.5 The link between CDD, social protection programs, and the World Bank’s
strategy in Pakistan was fundamental to its impact in the areas of conflict.
Historically, national-level projects have not had the same reach in the North-West
Frontier Province (NWFP), Balochistan, and KP, but they have informed the nature
of the World Bank’s engagement. PPAF II implementation was affected by several
factors, including rising conflict, insecurity, and political instability across the
country. Nevertheless, the bulk of project objectives were achieved, and new
partnerships with and financing from multilateral and bilateral organizations and
the corporate sector were established, creating enough momentum to carry the
project into a third phase.




                                                                                      69
CHAPTER 5
FAILURE OF GOVERNANCE AND STATE LEGITIMACY
While the success of the PPAF project series was widely acknowledged, the diversity
of needs in the conflict-affected areas made it increasingly apparent that specific
projects were required to supplement national programs and respond to the specific
conflict drivers in FATA and KP. In discussions with program staff, there was
acknowledgment that the formality of the PPAF model worked against any
momentum established in conflict regions. Negotiations and partnerships took
considerable time and there was inadequate flexibility in the system to respond to
project inputs that either worked or failed. There was a clear sense that these regions
required specific projects tailored to their needs.

The NWFP CIP-II project was an early attempt at responding to the particular needs
of the conflict-affected regions. The project faced many logistical delays and its
impact was limited. The experience highlighted that implementing a community-
based project through a local government system that has been introduced recently,
needs sustained commitment at all levels and a major emphasis on institutional and
behavioral change. This was missing, and the project failed to meet expectations. In
addition, both project documentation and feedback from project staff indicated that
CIP-II did not consider how it could be strategically linked to the PPAF.

The KP-SADP project made a more explicit effort to strengthen the capacity of the
poor to improve their livelihood options through access to social and productive
infrastructure using participatory approaches. The project has been moving slowly,
but has paid attention to consultations with relevant stakeholders to ensure a degree
of ownership and the institution of appropriate project structures. A meeting with
the key field staff for this project showed that while security remains a burden, the
decision-making process that relies on a 75 percent majority for investment projects
was bringing consensus to how funds were disbursed.

In reflecting on the link between national and regional social development and CDD
projects in Pakistan, it is apparent that the lack of integration and strategy with how
the investments worked in fragile regions has prevented the World Bank program
from achieving better results. Much of the focus of these projects was on delivering
commitments rather than identifying expected changes and using these to determine
a way forward. The country team stressed that in the rural areas of northern
Pakistan, projects cannot hope to shift the value system simply through the
provision of assets and services. There are entry points for change, but they need to
emerge through persistent engagement and committed partnering.

In the KP-SADP, changing the way things are done has led to considerable impact.
Examples of this include sewing workshops where women were encouraged to take
other women along as their chaperones. This negotiated arrangement took time to

                                                                               CHAPTER 5
                                               FAILURE OF GOVERNANCE AND STATE LEGITIMACY
organize, but it resulted in more than 3,500 women being trained in communities
where they were previously restricted outside of the household. Shifting the mindset
of younger community members was having a big impact on change. Where youth
representation was encouraged, there was an emerging debate about shifting away
from families having to make the huge financial commitments to funerals and
weddings.

But observations of this kind were not being adequately tracked or monitored. Thus,
the opportunity in linking the various threads of the social development portfolio in
Pakistan was about identifying the range of entry points for innovation and using
these to better respond to the radically different needs of those in the conflict-
affected regions.

MDTFs as strategic tool for development assistance.6 The introduction of the MDTF for
KP and FATA led to a significant shift in the strategy and approach to working in
the conflict regions. The reviewed projects financed by the MDTF all sought to offer
an alternative model to working in the fragile regions.

Both emergency recovery projects had greater strategic oversight that came with the
World Bank’s MDTF responsibilities and renewed urgency in dealing with the
regional instability. Third-party monitoring became an integral part of the MDTF
setup as did the promotion of sustained beneficiary participation. The MDTF
committed significant resources to project preparation and supervision. The World
Bank drew on a long history of similar projects in close cooperation with other parts
of the World Bank Group to identify priority needs and approaches. Activities
proposed were to be identified in the PCNA and where possible to draw direct links
between the full range of MDTF instruments.

The Revitalizing Health Services in KP project was designed as a pilot in six districts
to be scaled-up further. What was missing from the engagement was the necessary
sophistication in the monitoring systems to illustrate how effective the pilot was
likely to be and the features needed for the project to be scaled-up. The FATA Rural
Livelihoods project intended to complement the recovery projects by reaching the
unserved and underserved low-income communities in a phased manner. The
project was consistent with the intentions of the PCNA in adopting a rights-based
approach, with an emphasis on empowerment, nondiscrimination, consultation, and
participation.

One of the pillars in the MDTF strategy was to enhance the development of a vibrant
and active economy, thereby addressing the core strategic objective of stimulating
employment and livelihood opportunities, as highlighted in the PCNA. The



                                                                                      71
CHAPTER 5
FAILURE OF GOVERNANCE AND STATE LEGITIMACY
Economic Revitalization of KP and FATA project sought to innovate by looking to
technological advancements such as geo-referencing for physical verification and
mobile phone-based voice messaging for beneficiary participation, tracking, and
verification. These measures were intended to provide a useful alternative in crisis-
affected areas where the World Bank’s supervisory capacities are challenged due to
limited access.

Overall, the projects funded through the MDTF offered a useful vehicle for support
to the conflict-affected regions, but Bank staff and development partners identified
two persistent issues that kept it from being more effective. First, while the
responsiveness of the World Bank and its projects were appreciated by partners,
there was inadequate programmatic oversight and strategy in how the MDTF
sought to deliver impact. The quality of Bank management and engagement on the
MDTF was acknowledged by a wide range of partners, particularly regarding the
PCNA process, but linking initial projects to a cohesive strategy reflective of
engagement on fragility was problematic. There was also concern regarding the
integration of MDTF and non-MDTF Bank projects. This left the MDTF as an
efficient vehicle for support to the conflict regions, but without a clear strategic
vision.


Conclusions
Bank programs in Pakistan and the Nigerian Delta aimed at helping to deal with the
consequences of violent conflicts (destruction of infrastructure and lack of services),
promote social cohesion, and address some of the drivers of violence (such as youth
unemployment). The main causes of fragility that were at the heart of
developmental challenges in these large and complex countries were often beyond
the reach of the World Bank—often even in terms of initiating dialogue on sensitive
topics such as distribution of rents and religious extremism.

The World Bank’s understanding of discourse on violence in both countries has
evolved over the years, reflecting the way that the World Bank is gradually
becoming more comfortable focusing on the political economy of subnational
violence and developing analytical and operations instruments to address it. CDD
has been used as a form of information-gathering and contextual learning.

Nationwide CDD projects allowed the World Bank to maintain a presence in the
conflict regions even when security conditions were highly unsettled. These projects
were seen as serving local communities rather than governments and ensured

                                                                                      CHAPTER 5
                                                      FAILURE OF GOVERNANCE AND STATE LEGITIMACY
relative security for Bank staff working on them. They were not, however, the forum
for addressing the causes and consequences of the insurgencies.

The experience in Pakistan showed that even with small regional commitments and
relatively high cost, implementation of nationwide education programs in conflict
zones, adjusted to local realities, can deliver important developmental outcomes and
contribute to progress on conflict mitigation. Lack of integration of investments in
fragile regions with national programs and strategy can limit the efficacy of those
programs.

Many Bank projects combined two essential elements: meeting community needs
(infrastructure, employment, services) and capacity building. The latter has a much
longer gestation period compared to the former and depends to a larger extent on
collaborative and committed local and central government counterparts.

MDTFs are a vital strategic tool in conflict regions, and they require a diverse and
specific skill set. This includes the ability to liaise and interact effectively with
donors, effectively link MDTF projects to other projects in the World Bank portfolio,
establish, build, and maintain relations with regional governments in difficult
circumstances, as well as the foresight to see how different project priorities fit with
longer-term strategic planning.

6. Externally Imposed Fragility
The Lebanon and Jordan cases demonstrate how small MICs can become
inadvertent victims of a violent and unstable neighborhood. Both countries have
been exposed to the consequences of the proxy struggles waged by global and
regional powers in Syria and Iraq, and the dire social consequences that these
rivalries have brought to pass in the form of a “refugee shock.” They contain the
highest proportion of refugees-to-native population in the world today (Lebanon
hosts 232 refugees per 1,000 of its native population, Jordan 87 per 1,000).1 Both
countries have also shown surprising social and political resilience in
accommodating numbers of refugees that would strain the boundaries of
sociopolitical acceptability in much wealthier and more stable Western European
countries, where the prospect of a much smaller hosting ratio2 is evoking a
significant political backlash. Both countries argue that they are providing a global
public good by hosting the refugees, and that they are responsible for preventing an
even larger influx into Western Europe. They also argue that their state resources are
stretched, and that if they do not receive more adequate direct support (refugee
relief funds) as well as indirect forms of relief (for example, to enable the types of
fiscal expansion necessary to accommodate large numbers of new entrants into the
schooling and health systems), they may not be able to survive this shock
indefinitely.

This chapter reviews World Bank Group assistance to Lebanon and Jordan to cope
with the inflow of millions of refugees from Syria. Unlike earlier described
situations, where the World Bank was helping to deal with either the consequences
of conflicts or their underlying causes, in Lebanon and Jordan it is helping the
extremely stressed systems of two high MICs to cope with an externally imposed
and still evolving humanitarian crisis.

Therefore, the review of World Bank Group portfolio and work programs in these
two countries is very selective and only refers to those parts that were either
designed specifically to address the impact of Syrian refugee crisis, or were modified
to accommodate the refugee presence. It is important to note that in both countries
the World Bank is not providing assistance directly to refugees (shelter, food, jobs),
which is a prerogative of the United Nations agencies and NGOs, as the
governments of Lebanon and Jordan explicitly refuse to borrow funds for
humanitarian assistance. Instead, Bank assistance is directed to mitigate the impact
of the refugee inflow on country systems and those Lebanese and Jordanian
communities whose livelihoods were affected by the crisis.

CHAPTER 6
EXTERNALLY EXPOSED FRAGILITY
Hence, this review covers a relatively short period (2011-present) while most
activities are still ongoing. The two country programs are reviewed in tandem,
although the political and economic dynamics and client relationship have been
very different: Jordan has been peaceful and stable for several decades and has a
strong government in control of the situation, while Lebanon has periodically been
in general turmoil since the 1970s, including a series of civil and cross-border wars.
The World Bank has a sustained and long-lasting partnership with both countries,
but is not a major player in terms of financial leverage, and its presence on the
ground is modest.

The Syrian crisis. Violent repression of peaceful antigovernment demonstrations by
Syrian state security forces in March 2011 morphed into an armed rebellion of an
array of groups fighting the government and each other. The insurgence escalated to
a full-blown civil war that has killed over 220,000 people and left hundreds of
thousands injured. The war led to massive displacement of civilian population
(approximately 11 million), creating the largest humanitarian crisis since World War
II. The United Nations estimates that 7.6 million people are internally displaced and
nearly 4 million have crossed the border to the neighboring countries (mainly
Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey).

As the conflict enters its fifth year with no end in sight, the humanitarian situation is
constantly deteriorating. Syrian refugees arrive with limited economic resources that
are quickly depleted. Without formal residency rights and access to work permits
they can only depend on (limited) humanitarian assistance and informal labor to
secure their livelihood. The associated financing needs increased from $836 million
in 2012 to $7.4 billion in 2015.3 Actual funding received never matched the
requirements and was actually on a downward slope relative to the needs (Figure
6.1).

Impact on Jordan and Lebanon. Four years after the start of the influx, the crisis is
now taking a heavy toll on the economy and society, with a potential for further
worsening in the next few years. Jordan has had a generally positive experience in
absorbing the previous waves of refugees from Iraq in 2003-04 (estimated at 500,000-
700,000) that have even proven to be beneficial to the economy because of the high
level of skills of many refugees and inflow of Iraqi capital. However, there are strong
views that the net impact of Syrian refugees is largely negative with serious
implications for the country’s future development.

Two camps (Azraq and Za’atari) were built in Jordan to offer shelter and ensure
security. However, today only about 14 percent of the registered refugees live in the
camps,4 while the rest reside in local communities, mainly in the north of the
country. The Government of Lebanon did not authorize the establishment of camps,
and most refugees have settled in the north and east, already the poorer parts of the
country.

In a region that already hosts millions of Palestinian and Iraqi refugees and Egyptian
migrants,5 the large scale of refugee inflow has led to de facto demographic changes
that can seriously disturb the social balance in both countries. The government of
Jordan estimates the total number of Syrians living in the country at 1.4 million,
most of which are displaced because of the Syrian crisis. In some municipalities and
villages, Syrians now account for more than half of the local population. Such an
extreme and sudden demographic transformation threatens social cohesion of the
communities.6 Similarly, in Lebanon the 1.2 million registered refugees (most of
them Sunni Muslims) account for almost one-fifth of the total population—a

EXTERNALLY EXPOSED FRAGILITY
potentially major shift in already complicated and fragile multiconfessional fabric of
Lebanon.

The perception of a deteriorating security situation has undermined consumption
and investment, which has dragged down economic growth. The impact of the
Syrian crisis depressed growth in both countries to around 2 percent since 2011
compared to 7-8 percent in 2007-08. The dramatic increase in supply added
considerable pressure on the already fragile labor markets, increasing
unemployment, with considerable impact on youth and unskilled workers, putting
pressure on wages and increasing informal employment. One of the key concerns is
the availability of affordable housing for low-income groups of local population, as
increased demand pushed rents upwards.7

In Jordan, many communities have grown overnight without having the necessary
infrastructure in place. In early 2014 municipal authorities reported that they were
unable to meet the needs for solid waste collection and disposal. The large influx of
refugees has further exacerbated the already very serious water scarcity. For Jordan,
one of the world’s driest countries, this is a major concern that borders on disaster.

Recognizing the serious humanitarian aspects, both countries allowed Syrian
refugees access to public services, notably basic health and education. This has
placed a serious burden on these services with a reported deterioration of quality. In
2013, 40 percent of schools in Jordan were considered crowded. In Lebanon, a
second shift was introduced in many schools to serve the increasing number of
children. Similar issues confronted the health sector.

The resources that Lebanon and Jordan had to allocate to meet the needs of refugees
put a strain on public finances that neither of the two countries can afford. In its
“Response Plan” prepared in 2013, the Government of Jordan estimated the
additional fiscal burden at $850 million per annum. This raises serious challenges in
a country with already very high and unsustainable fiscal deficits. In Jordan, the
debt-to-GDP ratio reached 86 percent in 2014, breaking the constitutionally allowed
ceiling of 60 percent. In Lebanon, public finances were structurally weak prior to the
Syrian refugee shock. The debt-to-GDP ratio fluctuated in the vicinity of 130 percent
after 2012, and fiscal deficit widened by $2.6 billion during 2012-14.

In summary, as the crisis persists, Jordan and Lebanon seem to have reached a
critical saturation point, which is further exacerbated by humanitarian aid fatigue
within the donor community. So far there have not been many reports of open
hostility toward the Syrians. In part this is because in many places that Syrians have
settled they already had tribal ties, or there were existing Syrian communities.

Nevertheless, there is a potential for future conflict as the situation continues to
deteriorate and the current sympathy toward the plight of the refugees wears off.8


 Box 6.1. Lebanon Economic and Social Impact Assessment Findings
 The Lebanon ESIA, prepared with the help of the World Bank in 2012, forecasted a
 refugee influx of 1.6 million by the end of 2014. The report estimated that in the 2012-14
 period, the conflict would (i) cut real GDP growth by 2.9 percent each year; (ii) push
 170,000 Lebanese into poverty (in addition to 1 million currently living below the poverty
 line) and double the unemployment rate to above 20 percent, most of them unskilled
 youth; and (iii) depress government revenue collection by $1.5 billion while
 simultaneously increasing expenditure by $1.1 billion due to the surge in demand for
 public services, bringing the total fiscal impact to $2.6 billion. The report estimated that
 the surge in demand for public services would initially result in decline of access to and
 quality of service delivery, which would require additional spending of $2.5 billion for
 stabilization. The report indicated that the impact of the Syrian conflict was particularly
 pronounced in trade and tourism sectors. This report was discussed at the first meeting of
 the International Support Group for Lebanon on the margins of the United Nations
 General Assembly meetings in September 2013.

World Bank Group Response
The World Bank’s emergency response in Jordan and Lebanon provided analytical
tools to be used for strategic decision-making and to set up financing mechanisms to
channel emergency response to the most affected sectors: municipal services, health
and education; and assistance to vulnerable groups. The main instruments of
additional emergency assistance were the $150 million emergency loan and a $54.3
million grant in Jordan, and an MDTF in Lebanon that attracted pledges for $74.5
million.

Pre-crisis Bank programs in Jordan and Lebanon targeted medium- and long-term
development needs including improved fiscal management, human capital
development, improved business environment, and social safety nets. Jordan’s CPS
2012-2015 was drafted at a time when the extent of the Syrian crisis could not have
been anticipated. The CPS Progress Report (2014) noted that the original focus on
fiscal management, growth, and competitiveness had to be complemented with
strengthening resilience and mitigating vulnerability. In Lebanon, the CPS Progress
Report (2013)9 reasserted the relevance of the current strategy but scaled back two of
its goals, considering regional instability and political volatility. In both countries,

CHAPTER 6
EXTERNALLY EXPOSED FRAGILITY
the World Bank was also trying to leverage additional grant resources, including
from the SPF, and donor financing.

Financing. In Jordan, the World Bank provided a fast-disbursing emergency loan
(Mitigate the Impact of Syrian Displacement on Jordan, $150 million, 2013) to help
maintain access to healthcare (immunizations) and basic household goods
(subsidized bread and LPG cylinders) for vulnerable households. The Emergency
Services and Social Resilience project (ESSRP, $54.3 million, 2013) was financed
through an MDTF leveraged by an initial $10 million from the SPF. The project
supported nine municipalities most affected by refugee inflow in addressing the
most pressing needs, including solid waste removal, water management, and
rehabilitation of roads. It is planned to expand to include 16 municipalities.
Additionally, the World Bank tried to factor in the Syrian refugee crisis into some
existing programs (Second Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy—ERFKE
II), and explored opportunities for leveraging additional grant financing, following
the successful model of the ESSRP. Neither effort materialized by the time of this
report was prepared.

In Lebanon, the World Bank set up an MDTF with $10 million seed capital from the
SPF which attracted pledges from several bilateral donors for a total of $74.5 million.
The objective of the MDTF was to help mitigate the impact of the refugee inflow on
the hosting communities through three separate sector interventions. However,
because of the Lebanese authorities’ inability to ratify the grants due to a political
standstill in the parliament and the cabinet, as well as delays in setting up the
MDTF, the first project has just started and the other two are still not operational.
There were some other minor initiatives, including $1.2 million financing through
the SPF for capacity building and support to local communities hosting refugees;
and scaling up the National Poverty Targeting Program.

Analytical Work. In both countries, following a request by the authorities, the
World Bank prepared ESIAs that became widely accepted reference documents for
policy decisions and coordination of donor support. In addition, the World Bank
prepares regular semiannual briefs on the economic and social developments in
Jordan and Lebanon.

In Jordan, the World Bank was part of the government effort to develop the
National Resilience Plan (2014-2016) and later the Jordan Response Plan (JRP),
jointly with many donor partners. However, the World Bank’s day-to-day
interaction with the authorities in Jordan was often constrained by its small presence
in the country—the World Bank does not have a formal office and is represented by
two operations staff, hosted by IFC office in Amman. Perhaps indicative of that was

                                                           EXTERNALLY EXPOSED FRAGILITY
the World Bank’s rather limited (and temporary) participation in the JRP sectoral
working groups.10 In Lebanon, the World Bank worked with the government on the
Lebanon Road Map of Priority Interventions for Stabilization, and then set up the
MDTF to finance parts of the Road Map.

Gender issues. The massive influx of refugees in Jordan and Lebanon has altered
the gender dynamics. Since many men are away at war, or have been killed,
women’s roles have changed in the household, community, and the workplace.
More than a quarter of Syrian refugee households across the region in Lebanon,
Jordan, and Turkey are headed by women. Nevertheless, World Bank Group
engagement on gender and conflict issues in Jordan and Lebanon has been limited.
Its primary focus was on issues like closing gender gaps in primary and secondary
enrollment, labor force participation, and an increase in the number of female-
headed households due to migration (Lebanon), and a conflict lens remains missing.


Assessment
Overall, the World Bank’s emergency assistance to Jordan and Lebanon included
relevant and timely analytical work that was widely used by the governments and
partners, and flexible financial instruments that attracted additional donor
financing—albeit far from the identified needs. The choice of strategic areas was
relevant in both countries: at the national level helping the stressed and
overcrowded health and education systems, and at the municipal level building
capacity and improving resilience of local authorities to face increased demand for
services.

At the same time, it quickly became clear that the World Bank’s traditional financial
instruments applicable in the context of high MICs such as Jordan and Lebanon
(IBRD loans) were not well suited to respond to a humanitarian emergency, such as
the Syrian refugee crisis. The $150 million emergency loan to Jordan helped to
relieve pressure and address some urgent needs, but there was little appetite from
the client to continue in the same vein. The World Bank tried various alternatives,
including use of several grant facilities and leveraging additional funding from
donors, with modest success. In Lebanon, the MDTF is still not fully operational,
after several years of crisis, generating doubts among donors about its effectiveness.
The SPF grant facility was useful in providing seed money, allowing the World Bank
to identify some initiatives, and generated some goodwill among donors, but the
amounts were miniscule compared to the needs.




                                                                                      81
CHAPTER 6
EXTERNALLY EXPOSED FRAGILITY
Social protection. The $150 million emergency loan for Jordan disbursed swiftly and
used country systems to the degree possible. The loan achieved the objectives of
maintaining universal access to essential health care services (immunization for
children in particular) and basic household needs (subsidized LPG and bread). The
subsidization prevented price increases (by 35 percent) for these basic goods, which
could have pushed about 45,000 people into poverty.

In Lebanon, the World Bank helped to scale up the successful National Poverty
Targeting Project (NPTP) with an $8.2 million grant (2014), which became an
independent stand-alone operation, the Emergency National Poverty Targeting
Program. The objective of the project is to expand the coverage and enhance the
social assistance package of the NPTP to the population affected by the Syrian crisis.
It introduced new benefits such as food assistance through an electronic card
system, currently implemented by the WFP for more than 800,000 refugees. The
overall package of assistance includes health coverage, education aid, and an e-card
food voucher program.

Municipal Services. The World Bank’s assistance for municipal services in most
affected municipalities in Jordan is making a difference, although sustainability
remains a concern. The ESSRP leveraged donor funding around the World Bank’s
initial grant, mobilizing total of $54 million. Municipal grants were allocated to
subprojects that were identified in consultation with local communities through a
participatory process that involved public debate, followed by approval by
municipal councils. Subprojects included a wide range of services and activities that
were defined in a positive eligibility list of expenditures (the most popular items
were solid waste management and infrastructure, mainly roads). The project
included cooperation with the UNDP (training on public participation/consultation
and the identification of needs) and nongovernmental organizations. Direct
beneficiaries of the project included over 1 million people—exceeding the 790,000
initially planned. The project’s scope is planned to expand to reach 16
municipalities. An IEG mission visit to two of the municipalities that have received
assistance from the project indicated a strong support for the effort. The Lebanon
MDTF’s first project (Municipal Services Emergency Project, $10 million) has only
recently become effective. It is expected to help the host communities to address
urgent priorities (water, sanitation, roads, and community activities).

Health and Education. In response to the increasing demand for health and
education services, the World Bank supported the health sector in Jordan as part of
the $150 million emergency loan. In the education sector situation was different. The
World Bank’s flagship 10-year multi-donor program (ERfKE II, 2009-15, $408
million) that supports the government’s education reform program, did not factor in

                                                             EXTERNALLY EXPOSED FRAGILITY
the 130,000 Syrian students that entered the system after the crisis, despite the 2014
CPS Progress Report’s expressed intention to do so.

In Lebanon, there are two MDTF projects in the pipeline, designed to help health
and education sectors: (i) the Emergency Primary Healthcare Restoration Project
($21 million); and (ii) the Emergency Education System Stabilization Project ($32
million). Neither of them is operational yet. In the meantime, the World Bank
responded to education sector needs through two components of the much smaller
5M: Displaced People in Jordan and Lebanon technical assistance project (2012-15,
$2.4 million). The project integrated 2,600 children into the system; upgraded
classrooms for 5,000 students and offered schooling benefits to 7,400 parents in
Jordan; and is helping build capacity in the Ministries of Education and Social
Affairs in Lebanon.

IFC Program. There have been no IFC projects aimed directly at addressing the
impact of the Syrian crisis in Jordan or Lebanon. Investments in potentially related
spheres—microfinance or small and medium enterprise development—did not have
specific links to refugee or host communities’ problems. At the same time, IFC is
trying to use its current product mix to address unemployment and absorb the
growing labor force through investment in financial intermediaries (Middle East
Micro Credit Company and FINCA Jordan) and support for micro, small, and
medium enterprise development through the Middle East and North Africa
Transition Fund ($3.2 million, 2015).


Conclusions
Jordan and Lebanon—both high middle income, but resource poor and heavily
indebted countries—have been hosting millions of Syrians fleeing the civil war at
the expense of their already stressed national systems (health, education, and
infrastructure) and public finances. Social cohesion of many communities is under
stress, and the fragile multiconfessional and ethnic fabric is threatened (especially in
Lebanon) by the new demographic challenge. The outlook on the resolution of the
crisis in Syria remains extremely bleak, making the timetable for voluntary
repatriation of the refugees more and more remote and unpredictable. Both
countries have clearly reached the limit of their capacity in hosting a large refugee
population.

The World Bank’s effort to help mitigate the impact of the crisis can be qualified as
the best it could do with the instruments at its immediate disposal. The country
department continues to do a commendable job with the resources available to it



                                                                                        83
CHAPTER 6
EXTERNALLY EXPOSED FRAGILITY
and has been a loud voice in various circles advocating for the needs of the
countries. The World Bank prepared timely and comprehensive needs assessments
for both countries, widely used by the governments and the international
community. Emergency financing was channeled to relevant sectors: municipal
services, health, education, and assistance to vulnerable groups.

However, the World Bank’s financial response to the crisis was inadequately small.
The presence of the World Bank played a catalytic role (including management of
and provision of seed capital for MDTFs), attracting additional donor resources, but
its effectiveness (if measured by amounts attracted and compared to the needs) was
quite low.

One of the main challenges for the World Bank in Jordan and Lebanon was finding
appropriate financing instruments. IBRD loans by their nature were not the best
choice (they disburse slowly, are relatively expensive, and both countries are highly
indebted), but the only one handily available. This option was exhausted fairly fast
in Jordan by providing a $150 million emergency loan. In Lebanon, the situation was
complicated by internal political crisis and a stalemate in the parliament
(parliamentary vote is required for loan approval in Lebanon) and the cabinet.

Budget support was the most important priority that the World Bank has supported
appropriately. Given further fiscal pressures from the large increase in population
from the refugees, the World Bank is one of the very few significant sources for
filling the budget deficit. But it further exacerbates the already high level of debt that
is now approaching 100 percent of GDP in Jordan and is close to 140 percent in
Lebanon.

Both governments are reluctant to borrow on IBRD terms for addressing a crisis they
did not cause in the first place. They believe, quite understandably, that since the
crisis has been externally imposed, it should be the responsibility of the international
community to bear most of the costs. The response of the international community
to the continuous pleas of Jordanian and Lebanese authorities to co-finance the
global public good of hosting Syrian refugees so far has fallen far short of the needs.
In this situation, the World Bank was using various alternative sources and
mechanisms (including the IBRD surplus, and various trust funds) to come up with
a response, albeit at a very limited scale. While highly commendable, these efforts
are a far cry from the needs of the two countries.

An important lesson from Lebanon and Jordan experience is that the World Bank
management—with the political and financial support of its shareholders—urgently
needs to develop financial mechanisms or fast-response facilities to be used in



84
                                                                                CHAPTER 6
                                                              EXTERNALLY EXPOSED FRAGILITY
similar situations. It also needs to use its global convening power more effectively
and encourage others to do so. A recent initiative announced in October 201511 is a
step in that direction, albeit a much delayed one—as it was clear at least since 2013
that Lebanon and Jordan were in for an unprecedented refugee crisis. Scaling up
existing and functional facilities such as the SPF is another option, as its current use
without catalytic effect raises questions about efficiency, given the small size and
high transaction costs.

In a volatile country environment, a strong local presence is imperative to establish a
monitoring mechanism that will allow quick strategy and program readjustment,
and carry out an effective convening function. The World Bank’s existing regional
presence is modest,12 and it may need more staff resources to cover all countries it is
dealing with. The country department currently covers Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon,
and Jordan—which suggests the need to look holistically at the problems of conflict
in Syria and Iraq and their spill-over effects. The World Bank needs to approach this
not as a country-specific issue, but as a subregional issue of the highest corporate
priority.

Another lesson is related to the importance of focusing on long-term developmental
challenges. The emergency element in the Syrian refugee crisis attracted the world’s
attention to the plight of the displaced population. The World Bank played a
positive (though limited) role in addressing the most burning issues within its
immediate reach. A bigger question, however, is how to deal with the longer-term
problems facing the countries and the region. While appropriate for the short-term
crisis, Bank assistance is not likely to fundamentally alter the fragility profile of both
countries. It is highly likely that most Syrians will stay in Jordan and Lebanon for a
long time, even in the unlikely event that war ends soon and a stable government
emerges.13 In both countries the refugee inflow exacerbated many already existing
and well-known fundamental systemic challenges, such as unsustainable public
sector expenditures and high unemployment. Therefore, there is a high probability
of a short-term crisis becoming a serious long-term development challenge. World
Bank Group strategy as currently designed falls short of dealing with it.

Finally, the Jordanian and Lebanese experience points to the importance of
maintaining a credible and robust macroeconomic framework to withstand impacts
from unforeseen crises. The World Bank is likely to be an important institution (in
addition to the International Monetary Fund) to provide financial support when a
crisis does occur. But absent a sustainable macro framework, the ability of the World
Bank to increase its support will be limited. Without more drastic structural reforms,
Jordan and Lebanon will continue to be vulnerable to events like the Syrian crisis.

7. Conclusions and Recommendations
Conclusions
World Bank Group strategic approach. The World Bank Group understanding and
discourse on conflict and violence has evolved over the years, reflecting the way that
the World Bank is gradually becoming more comfortable focusing on the assessment
of the political economy of subnational and regional violence in MICs and
developing analytical and operations instruments to address it. The 2011 WDR was
a critical step in this direction, as it presented a broadly applicable and relevant
analytical framework for engagement.

The incidence of violent conflicts in MICs with established institutions suggests that
violence and conflicts are not primarily a low-income country problem and that
impoverishment is not the sole driver of conflict and violence. Localized FCV
situations in relatively stable and economically successful countries pose particular
and sometimes unique challenges. MICs are less likely to feel obliged to engage on
the sensitive political issues associated with subnational conflict, thus placing a
greater premium on World Bank Group diplomatic skills and appreciation of the
local political economy.

Sustained engagement of the World Bank Group in conflict areas ahead of peace
settlements and during the ongoing violence has been critical. The experience,
contacts, and credibility acquired in this process had important payoffs once there
was peace. Concerns about security during the active phase of conflict often limited
the World Bank Group presence in the field to essential personnel, but the World
Bank staff were able to develop rapport and trust at the local level and effectively
supervise projects. The courage and commitment of local counterparts and Bank
staff were essential for success. Maintaining a presence (even nominal) in former
conflict zones is essential to help sustain peaceful development. In some cases, the
end of major violence led to rapid and complete withdrawal of the World Bank,
although the drivers of the original conflict and weak governance capacity were
unchanged. In many instances, the problems have much deeper regional roots and
the World Bank needs to develop a more holistic view of these problems and their
spill-over effects.

Involvement in the interest of mitigating conflict has required the World Bank
Group to trade off the benefits of demonstrating early wins against the costs of
operating in a challenging environment. It often has been more attractive for the

CHAPTER 7
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
World Bank Group to engage where it believes it can achieve strong impact
(emergency response) than in situations where the problems are more intractable.

World Bank Group emergency assistance is appropriate for short-term crises, but its
strategic comparative advantage remains in helping countries to tackle longer-term
developmental challenges. In some countries reviewed in this report, the World
Bank Group FCV-related strategy still falls short of dealing with the core drivers of
violence—regional conflicts and governance—perhaps out of reluctance to
compromise lending volumes.

World Bank Group definitions, measurement metrics, and policy application are still
somewhat inconsistent along the full spectrum of countries experiencing FCV (more
pronounced in the non-FCS group). In this regard, the role of the new structural
unit, the FCV CCSA—the focal point on FCV in the World Bank Group, currently
serving as a knowledge hub and advisory service provider—needs to be given
considerable authority over policy matters. At the same time, the new unit needs to
find a way to maintain a closer connection to operational work, which will maximize
the impact of transfer of knowledge that sits within the CCSA.

The CPIA index, despite its usefulness on some aspects, has many deficiencies when
used as the main tool for assessing fragility or forecasting the risk of societal
breakdown. The low-income country cut-off excludes MICs, where much of today’s
FCV situations are occurring. A new multidimensional marker system would
deliver much more nuanced results and would permit a degree of prediction that
the current CPIA does not. At the same time, the new “flag and outcome” system
will have a much-diminished impact if it cannot be published, tracked, and
discussed openly.

The institutional and staff incentives for engagement in conflict situations and risk-
taking seem to be lagging the spirit of World Bank Group’s strategic approach to
FCV, as reflected in various Bank documents, including the 2011 WDR. Continuity
in Bank staffing policy across the countries experiencing FCV has not been observed
frequently, but when it happened, the payoff was clear, resulting in effective transfer
of knowledge and expertise.

World Bank Group Instruments. The World Bank’s strategies were relatively fast to
respond and adjust to FCV situations, particularly in emergencies, as demonstrated
in strategy and analytical outputs, but the World Bank’s operational response was
often constrained by the lack of choice in instruments at its disposal and depended
to a large extent on donor financing and the presence of large MDTFs.

                                                      CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The CDD model was widely considered an appropriate tactic to establish presence in
conflict areas, increase community involvement in programming, encourage
community ownership of projects, and foster social cohesion. Projects with a CDD
design were a useful point of entry for the World Bank Group in conflict-affected
areas, used also as a form of information-gathering and contextual learning,
allowing the World Bank to maintain a presence even when security conditions
were highly unsettled. Early engagement was particularly relevant and useful for
laying the foundation for post-conflict collaboration. These projects were seen as
serving local communities rather than governments and ensured cooperation and
security for Bank staff working on them. They were not, however, a forum for
addressing the causes and consequences of violence. The broader lesson is that the
success of CDD projects in conflict zones is highly context-specific, and that these
projects give the World Bank an opportunity to acquire the local knowledge
necessary for more ambitious efforts to alter the political economy of the area.

Small pilots were useful for identifying working solutions to the most urgent needs
and creating conditions for scaling up successful interventions. At the same time,
they are often risky, time-consuming, and costly to implement. Specialized grant
programs to top-up operational budgets for small pilot programs in FCV situations
could be a way of dealing with it.

Investments in education can be important in dealing with issues of fragility,
particularly as they pertain to psycho-social issues among children, providing safe
spaces for integration and community cohesion to develop, and dealing with the
problem of “lost generations” in more protracted conflicts. Implementation of
nationwide education programs in conflict zones, adjusted to local realities, can
deliver important developmental outcomes and contribute to progress on conflict
mitigation.

Analytical and advisory work was relevant and high quality, and contributed to
awareness and understanding of the issues and main challenges. Most of it was part
of larger studies (often in partnership with donors), such as needs assessments,
political economy analyses, and core economic diagnostics. However, the
operational follow-up was uneven and depended on particular country
circumstances. That was particularly true for ongoing conflicts and follow-up on
diagnostic studies.

FCV-specific diagnostic work (fragility assessments, conflict filters) was generally
useful and relevant, but not particularly common in non-FCS group of countries.
The utility of fragility assessments in non-FCS environment is somewhat limited by
the fact that they are not mandatory, and the decisions on their preparation and

CHAPTER 7
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
sharing with the client governments is at the discretion of the country teams.
Experience with the conflict filter product differed from country to country.
Nevertheless, application of a conflict filter to Bank projects could, with suitable
customization, be useful in countries where ethnic or other divisions carry the
potential for igniting violent conflict—although its role should not be overestimated.

PFM diagnostics used by the World Bank in its programs in conflict-affected regions
seem to have been deployed in an ad hoc manner, tailored to the country’s
circumstances. Some areas, such as policy advice on budgeting and governance
arrangements in the security sector and fiscal decentralization in FCV situations,
deserve more attention, especially since the World Bank does have strong capacity
for and experience with such analysis.

World Bank Group engagement in supporting private sector development in FCV
situations in non-FCS was limited. Bank (IBRD) PSD-related activities focused
mainly on livelihoods, small infrastructure, and employment schemes, while IFC
concentrated its efforts on post-conflict reconstruction. There were only a few
examples of FCV-related Bank-IFC coordination at all stages—from conflict
mitigation to post-conflict support.

In general, IFC’s FCV-related strategy and corporate targeting focuses on the
countries included in the FCS list, and its activities in situations of localized FCV in
MICs were limited. In most cases reviewed by this evaluation, IFC has deployed
standard instruments, with little adaptation or innovation. At the same time, where
IFC was able to find a niche and identify clients, its contribution was relevant and
effective. Business volumes and financial returns of projects remain key
performance metrics in IFC. Advisory services are under pressure to link to IFC’s
investments, which makes it difficult to provide a stand-alone advisory service in an
FCV context. There are few incentives for staff to undertake riskier and generally
smaller projects in these countries.

MIGA’s PRI can help facilitate foreign direct investment when a country faces FCV
situations. MIGA products (WCD or NHSFO coverage) could benefit from
information exchange with the FCV CCSA, particularly regarding the use of
country-level fragility assessments.

Weak M&E frameworks undermined the assessment of results in many of the cases
observed, and diminished the learning potential from the projects even when they
were designed as pilots. Failure to properly record even the positive experience is an
indicator of lack of incentives to maintain institutional memory. Despite efforts to
account for FCV factors in project design and implementation, they were rarely

                                                          CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
captured in results. Only a third of observed programs recorded fragility-specific
outcomes, and only a quarter of them had M&E systems specifically designed to
track FCV issues. Generally, more positive outcomes of FCV-related interventions
(compared with the rest of the portfolio) point to the perception of risks to outcomes
in conflict-affected regions to be exaggerated.

The World Bank Group’s focus was limited on gender issues in conflict-affected areas
reviewed by this evaluation: few programs were designed or implemented taking
into consideration gender disparities, and the little analytical work done was not
translated into operations.

Partnerships. The World Bank-United Nations institutional partnership was not
systematic and its frequency and effectiveness varied across the countries and
themes. The existing system did not encourage building such partnerships because
of perceived high transaction costs, lack of strong staff incentives, incompatibility of
the fiduciary and legal frameworks, and competition for influence and limited donor
resources at the country level. The main reasons behind successful partnership
initiatives were clear division of labor (easier cooperation with specialized United
Nations agencies) and personal initiative and experience of the field staff (prior
work experience in the other institution was always a plus). A more nuanced
strategic and technical dialogue is needed to delineate respective roles and
comparative advantages, and ensure a common understanding of key strategic
issues that the two institutions can work on jointly. Clear guidance in this regard can
significantly facilitate the work of the teams on the ground to avoid unnecessary
competition and focus on effective collaboration.

Multi-donor trust funds are a vital strategic tool in conflict regions, and they require a
specific skill set that includes the ability to liaise and interact effectively with donors,
link MDTF to other projects in the World Bank portfolio, the foresight to see how
different project priorities fit with longer-term strategic planning, and the ability to
establish, build, and maintain relations with regional governments in difficult
circumstances.

Global thematic trust funds (such as the SPF and the Global Program of Forced
Displacement) were helpful in supporting synergies in the FCV context, as the
funding available through them allowed the flexibility and agility needed for
partnering in post-crisis context. However, these funds are fragmented, which
diminishes their impact, particularly in the MIC context. Since many FCV initiatives
depend on trust fund financing, more strategic alignment of those funds would lead
to less fragmentation, better targeting, and better results. Scaling up highly
functional facilities, such as the SPF, would be essential, as their current use without

much catalytic effect in MICs raises questions about efficiency, given the small size

Recommendations
This evaluation recommends the following:

WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGIC APPROACH

        Review the institutional setup and interaction of various World Bank Group
         units dealing with FCV matters to ensure that the FCV CCSA drives
         substantive thinking on strategy and policy in this area across the World
         Bank Group. This would also entail closer operational engagement of CCSA
         staff with and across the World Bank Group members (including IFC and
         MIGA), and regional and thematic departments.
        Develop a new multidimensional publicly disclosed system of markers and
         flags for monitoring and measuring fragility, including in non-FCS countries.
         Linked to this, integrate fragility assessments as part of the SCD/CPF process
         to be applied systematically in countries where conflict and violence or
         externally imposed fragility constitute a significant impediment to attaining
         the strategic objectives of the World Bank Group.
        Scale up regional presence and outlook, including through regional projects
         and joint analytic and advisory work across relevant countries, and ensure
         World Bank Group sustained presence in FCV-affected areas, monitoring the
         fragility profile of the countries/Regions.

WORLD BANK GROUP ENGAGEMENT TOOLS

        Develop new financial mechanisms or fast-response facilities to be used when
         outbreaks of violence or external threats jeopardize resilience in MICs.
         Improve strategic alignment and use of global FCV thematic trust funds,
         while boosting their agility. Options to consider include using these funds for
         co-financing small pilot programs in FCV-affected areas with potential of
         scaling-up.
        Within the new SCD/CPF model, develop a broader strategic approach to
         interventions in FCV-affected areas, expanding sector interventions beyond
         the CDD model, and improving coordination and information sharing within
         the World Bank Group, with particular attention to private sector
         development activities (through a more customized approach to risk
         assessment, project mix, policies and procedures), public financial
         management (including fiscal decentralization and broader use of diagnostic

      issues in project design and implementation). Strengthen M&E frameworks
      by including FCV-related outcome indicators.

PARTNERSHIPS

   Develop institutional incentives for collaboration and strategic thematic guidance
     on partnering—particularly with the United Nations but also with other
     partners. Introduce systematic communication and staff exchange programs
     to increase the level of collaboration.

Appendix A. History of Conflicts and Violence
A.1   Mindanao, Philippines
Moros1 live on the large island of Mindanao (mostly on the western side now) at the
southern end of the Philippine chain and on several small islands between
Mindanao and Indonesia and Malaysia to the west. Violent conflicts between the
Muslim Moro population in Mindanao and the central authorities date back to when
the Spanish took over Philippines after Magellan’s arrival (16th Century) and started
Christianity in the rest of the island chain. The conflict flared up with variations
after the United States took over from Spain in 1898 and after independence in 1946.
The military government of Marcos reignited the conflict in the 1970s with a
program of settling large numbers of Christians in Mindanao. This and the attendant
displacement of Moros from land prompted the formation of insurgent
organizations.

Four overlapping categories of groups in Southern Philippines have been fighting
with the government and with each other in recent decades: Moro separatists,
Islamist militants, Communists (operating nationwide), and bandit and kidnapper
gangs.2 These labels reflect motivations, not clear organizational distinctions, but
such categories can help discern what drives conflict and violence at different times
and places, and what might reduce it. Within the context of this evaluation, focused
on the Mindanao, there are two main drivers of conflict: ethnic/religious separatism
and criminality. Some of the local disputes between Moros and Christians are over
land titling, which also feeds into the wider political conflict. The conflicts in
Mindanao are thus multidimensional. Figure A.1.1 shows the Heidelberg Conflict
Indicators for various pairs of organizations and how they vary over time.

The MILF has been the largest among groups fighting with the government and
with each other since the late 1990s.3 All occasional truce agreements have broken
down within a year or two, with the exceptions of the 1990s-peace deal with the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which resulted in creation of the
Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao4 (ARMM) and the current deal with
MILF, in effect since 2012 and signed into formal agreement in 2014.

According to the 2014 agreement, an autonomous region will be set up, to be known
as Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, before President Benigno Aquino steps down in
2016. When implemented, it will give the Muslim-dominated area greater political
powers and control over its resources. Bangsamoro replaces the ARMM, with its
own government. The next steps would be for Congress to pass the Bangsamoro
Basic Law and to hold a referendum to decide which provinces would be part of the
autonomous region under the new law. MILF is essentially a government-in-waiting
and, notwithstanding the January 2015 shootings5 (the so-called Mamasapano
incident) usually works with the government to maintain peace. The MILF has since
the early 2000s clarified its ethic-religious identity, while disavowing any connection
with international terrorist organizations and criminal activity. At times, it has
conducted join operations with the military to suppress criminal gangs. Observers in
2015 were optimistic about implementation of the peace plan, but it is only just
starting, and the more radical and violent groups (Abu Sayyaf, BIFF, NPA, others)
have vowed to continue the fight.

Aceh is a province at the western tip of Sumatra, the western most major island of
Indonesia. Population of Aceh is Sunni Muslim, like the rest of Indonesia, but
follows a more conservative version of Islam,7 and takes pride in its distinctive
culture. The conflict between Aceh and the central government dates to 1970s, when
local elites resisted the efforts of President Suharto to bring all the country into a

relatively homogeneous national culture. The main perceived threats to Acehnese
religion and culture were from the “neo-colonial” government in Jakarta and the
rising number of Javanese migrants. Aceh is also a major producer and exporter of
natural gas, but the central government was keeping most of the revenue.

The Free Aceh Movement (GAM) raised this issue in its proclamation in 1977 and
took its first military action right after the start of liquid natural gas sales from the
Aceh region. Intermittent conflicts, punctuated with short-lived ceasefire
agreements, caused an estimated 15,000 deaths since 1977 and displaced hundreds
of thousands of civilians. GAM almost always lost the battles, and government
forces almost eliminated it in the late 1970s and again in the late 1990s. GAM
survived partly because the military’s violent intrusions and corrupt presence
increased local support for the insurgency. The fall of Suharto’s military government
in 1998 allowed GAM to revive again, as the exit of the military from Aceh left a
power vacuum, until the military came back again the next year. Temporary
ceasefires alternated with military emergencies and vows to eliminate GAM once
and for all.

In 1999 the new Jakarta government implemented a nationwide government
decentralization, which created, empowered, and funded local governments—
districts and sub-districts (Kecamatan). It deliberately by-passed and thus effectively
dis-empowered the provincial level governments—the Aceh level—leaving them as
administrative offices of the national government in Jakarta. It did not allow
regional political parties. This ‘big-bang’ decentralization, as it became known, did
not satisfy the autonomy demands of GAM.

In late 2004 GAM and the Government of Indonesia made a peace deal again, which
might or might not have survived in the normal course of events. The devastating
impact on Aceh of the earthquake and tsunami in December 2004 created a whole
new reality, attracting worldwide attention, and massive relief effort and funding.
GAM and the national government, which had recently transitioned toward
democracy and wanted international approval, both saw this as an opportunity to
reach a peaceful settlement. They signed a peace agreement in August 2005 that
allowed for some autonomy for the Aceh region, but did not go so far as
independence. The Jakarta government enacted the Aceh Government Legislation,
covering special rights agreed upon in 2002 and allowing the Acehnese to establish
local political parties to represent their interests at national and local levels. Violent
conflict between GAM and the government ceased quickly after the agreement.
Although most reconstruction funding was not specifically linked to post-conflict
assistance, the large number of well-funded post-tsunami projects provided
opportunities for many entrepreneurial ex-combatants and insurgent leaders
quickly to find gainful employment and contracts in the legal economy. GAM has
become the political party for the Aceh region. Many, although not all, victims and
ex-combatants from pre-2005 have received economic assistance.

A unique feature of Aceh’s experience is that just as the peace agreement was
signed, the tsunami reconstruction effort bought in a tidal wave of funding for that
reconstruction. Aceh’s fiscal resources have increased dramatically since 1999: after
decentralization and the Special Autonomy Status, the amount of funds managed
directly by the Acehnese province and local governments increased several-fold.
Nonetheless, Aceh remains one of the poorest provinces in Indonesia.

HISTORY OF CONFLICTS AND VIOLENCE

A.3    Northern Uganda
Northern Uganda has a protracted history of armed conflict and recurrent violence
between rebel groups and the government—the most recent civil conflict in this part
of the country started after Museveni came to power in 1986. For this analysis, the
main conflict of interest during the 2000–2014 time period is the conflict with the
LRA.8 This conflict has been well documented and researched, a brief overview and
analysis of the drivers and consequences is provided here.9

The LRA is a cult-like organization currently led by Joseph Kony. Conflict with this
group in Uganda began as a pro-Northern Uganda movement led by the Acholi
people following the civil war that led to Museveni’s rise to power in 1986. In the
late 1980s the LRA turned on the same population whose interests it purported to
advocate and the Acholi population became the target of LRA attacks, at times in
retaliation for actions taken by the Ugandan army. The LRA is notorious for brutal
tactics including maiming, torturing, raping the Acholi population and abducting
children and forcing them to serve as child soldiers, porters, or in the case of some
young women, war wives. This conflict has affected the lives of hundreds of
thousands of Ugandans in the Northern region—estimates include 20,000 casualties
and 1.6 million IDPs.

The conflict was most intense in during the 2002—2004, and during this time the
government began moving civilians into camps in conflict affection regions order to
provide better security. The count of IDPs reached its peak in 2006. There have been
no major outbreaks of violence in Uganda since peace talks started in 2006 and the
LRA was pushed out of Northern Uganda. After 2008, IDPs were gradually
transferred out of camps, this was mostly completed by 2011. After the LRA was
pushed out of Uganda they moved between the Democratic Republic of Congo, the
Central African Republic, and South Sudan.

From pre-colonial times the Northern Acholi people were characterized by a warrior
tradition, which resulted in the British government heavily recruiting among the
population to serve as army, police, and prison guards. Historical analysis suggests
that Acholi were exploited by their colonizers for uniformed services and unskilled
labor, while central Ugandans were the beneficiaries of commercial and educational
activities (Gersony 1997, ACCS 2013, Kustenbauder 2010). Post-independence there
were a series of violent conflicts between highly militarized political factions that
loosely aligned with regional and ethnic groups in a struggle for national power.
During this period, all sides committed atrocities in a tit for tat cycle. A legacy of this
violence is the residual feelings of distrust on the part of the Acholi toward the
ruling President and his National Resistance Movement Party (comprised mostly of
people from the Banyankole tribe).10 These negative sentiments contributed to initial

Some have described perceptions in Uganda of a “marginalized north—prosperous
south divide” (Gersony, 1997). Historically, this has been attributed at least in part to
the legacy of colonization described above. The status of the North was worsened by
over 20 years of conflict and as a result, the Northern region currently lags across
most income and nonincome indicators. As of 2009/2010 the Northern region
comprised 20 percent of the population, but contributed 38 percent of the share of
the population of Uganda living under the national poverty line (UBOS, 2009),11 this
did not change substantially from data collected in 2005/2006. Additionally, there
are poverty concentrations in the conflict-affected sub-region of mid-northern
Uganda.12 In 2009/2010 this sub-region comprised 9.8 percent of the population but
contributed 16.1 percent to the portion of the national population living under the
poverty line (UBOS, 2009). It is difficult to gauge how poverty has changed in the
conflict-affected regions as data from these areas was not included in the national
household survey in 1999/2000 and 2002/2003.

LRA numbers are reported to be dwindling, though as previously mentioned the
organization has been active outside of Uganda—in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Central African Republic, and Southern Sudan, where Joseph Kony is
rumored to be residing. In early 2015 a LRA commander, Dominic Ongwen,
surrendered to US troops in the Central African Republic and is awaiting trial at the
International Criminal Court. As of 2012 the numbers of the LRA were reported to
have reduced to between 200 and 700 followers, but the organization was still
considered a threat.13 There is still no official peace agreement and there remains an
International Criminal Court warrant for the arrest of Joseph Kony.

APPENDIX A
HISTORY OF CONFLICTS AND VIOLENCE

A.4    Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka was embroiled in violent conflict between the Sinhalese-dominated central
government and militant Tamil forces (the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE)
fighting for a separate state since 1984. Isolated incidences gave way to a civil war
between the government and the LTTE in 1983 and continued through 2009. Despite
attempts to solve the conflict through negotiations, it proved intractable. In 2009, the
conflict ended with a decisive victory of the government.

The consequences of the conflict remain apparent today. There are approximately
73,700 (nonresettled) IDPs14 spread throughout a country whose land and
infrastructure remain heavily damaged. The Tamil-dominated Northern and Eastern
Provinces, which saw the heaviest fighting, face considerable challenges rebuilding.
The conflict had a substantially negative impact on Sri Lanka’s economic and social
development and incurred a tremendous human cost, resulting in 40,000 civilian
deaths.15

Conflict Drivers. The tension between the Sinhalese and Tamils finds its roots in Sri
Lanka’s colonial past and the years immediately following independence. There was
a perception that the British government often “favored” the Tamil minority,
breeding resentment in the majority population. This was reinforced by policies that,
according to Sinhalese nationalists, disproportionately increased the power of
Tamils in society. After independence Sinhalese nationalists became frustrated that
independence did not immediately translate into more power and status, leading to
the promulgation of increasingly discriminatory policies. These dynamics can be
seen through the evolution of education and language policies, which differentiated
Sinhalese and Tamil interests.

Land: The Northern and Eastern Provinces, which are Tamil-majority territories, is a
sparsely populated dry zone. After independence, the government decided to settle
poor Sinhalese farmers from densely populated wet zones into this region, viewing
the process as the “reclamation and recreation in the present of the glorious
Sinhalese Buddhist past,” and a vital component of rebuilding Sri Lanka. These
irrigation settlements were directly sponsored and monitored by the state, leading
Tamils to further associate the government with Sinhalese interests and feel
increasingly marginalized. Consequently, the idea of a “traditional Tamil
homeland” became powerful in the Tamil political lexicon. A separate and
independent state soon became the objective of the LTTE and Tamil separatists.

Political Authority: Tamil political leaders were pushing for greater political
autonomy in the Northern and Eastern Provinces through a federalist structure.

                                                             HISTORY OF CONFLICTS AND VIOLENCE
Though numerous pacts had been written to define a framework for devolution,
they were never implemented. Disillusionment with the democratic process and
nonviolent politics fueled the militarization and radicalization of Tamil politics in
the early 1970s. This frustration culminated in the Vaddukoddai resolution of May
1976, calling for the Northern and Eastern Provinces to secede and form Tamil
Eelam. The LTTE was also founded at this time, sharing the platform of the
resolution. Isolated incidences gave way to a civil war between the government and
the LTTE in 1983 and continued through 2009.

Post-Conflict. The government’s focus on defense and large-sale infrastructure since
the end of the conflict has at different times inflamed the historic tensions
surrounding land and political authority. Without a sustainable political settlement
to the conflict, many of the social aspects that often accompany peace- and state-
building efforts were neglected in favor of growth-generating investments in
infrastructure.

A.5    Colombia
The literature tends to identify four major drivers of conflict and violence in
Colombia:

Political Polarization, originating in a period known as La Violencia, (1940-1950s) when
an extreme level of political polarization led to violent confrontation between the
Liberal and Conservative parties. An agreement reached in the 1960s entailed a
power-sharing strategy that excluded other political groups, which evolved into two
distinct armed groups, the FARC and the ELN (National Liberation Army). In
response, the authorities allowed the emergence of paramilitary groups to confront
those two. Conflict and tensions remained latent but intensified sharply at the end of
the 1990s.

Rural conflict, inequality and lack of property rights. Historically the level of conflict and
violence has been particularly high in rural areas. Unclear land property rights and
very high inequality in land distribution worsened over time. Drug traffickers and
paramilitaries snatched significant areas of rural land in the 1980s and 1990s to
launder their profits and contributed to the displacement of farmers. Some 70
percent of displaced farmers did not hold a formal title.

Limited state presence. Colombia has been historically characterized by a high
institutional capacity at the national level, but low levels of accountability in state
institutions and social cohesion at subnational levels. The vacuum of power has

been eventually filled by nonstate actors. It has also generated incentives for drug
producers to move into those areas.

Illegal Drug Markets. The increasing demand for cocaine during the 1980s increased
its output and Colombia became the largest cocaine exporter in the world. The
increase in drug production and trafficking encouraged organized crime and
violence that started to peak at the end of the 1990s. The long-term sustainability of
guerilla activity is closely associated with their increasing involvement in the drug
industry. It created a mutually reinforcing dynamic between guerrilla, paramilitary
groups, and drug cartels.

Recent developments and outlook. To confront the sharp escalation of violence, in 2002
the newly elected President Uribe started to reinforce the army to confront several
illegal armed groups. It resulted in a gradual reduction in the incidence of armed
clashes and related deaths. In 2010 President Santos introduced initiatives to
institutionalize the process of restitution and reconciliation. The 2011 Victims
Reparation and Land Restitution Law introduced a legal process to formally identify
the victims of the conflict and the restitution of patrimony lost due to the violence.
Peace negotiations with the FARC started by the end of 2012.

Although the level of violence has been visibly reduced, it still has significant impact
on the lives of people. In 2013 about 157,000 new families were displaced, and
thousands of displaced households are still not able to repossess their land due to
ongoing violence. According to UNHCR, the cumulative number of IDPs16 reached
about 5 million people by 2015, the highest of any country in the world. Figures A.4
and A.5 show the trend in both the number of deaths resulting from the armed
encounters and the number of displaced persons—which are correlated, not
unexpectedly.

A.6       Honduras
During the last decade, countries in the Central America’s Northern Triangle—El
Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras—experienced some of the world’s highest
crime and homicide rates. Drug trafficking through the Central American drug
corridor expanded sharply and became a major driver of crime and violence. Drug
trafficking increased the incentives for corruption in the criminal justice system and
tarnished the image of state institutions. The resulting lack of trust in institutions
encouraged citizens to take the law into their own hands. The increase in crime and
violence has been particularly sharp in Honduras during the late 2000s, when the
homicide rate rose exponentially and surpassed by a large margin the homicide rate
of the neighboring countries (see Figure A.6.1).

HISTORY OF CONFLICTS AND VIOLENCE
In 2011 the World Bank issued a major diagnostic report on crime and violence in
Central America, summarizing lessons and identifying priorities for the future.17
The study responded to the sharp increase in violence during the 2000s, when the
homicide rates doubled in all three countries. It examined major trends in the
indicators of violence, its economic costs, provided analysis of the main drivers, and
made recommendations for possible strategies across several fronts. It recognized
the interaction among the many drivers and the need to combine several of these
strategies. This evaluation takes the 2011 study as a point of departure to examine
the assistance of the World Bank to Honduras, as it was issued in parallel with and
provided the analytical basis for the 2012 CPS. The 2012 CPS also introduced for the
first time an explicit thematic pillar/objective focusing on citizen security.


 Box A.6.1. Main Drivers of Crime and Violence in Central America
 Drug trafficking is the most important single factor behind the rising violence in the
 region. About 90 percent of cocaine flowing to the United States comes through Central
 America, with its value about 5 percent of the region’s GDP.
 Youth violence and gangs. By 2011 they were 900 gangs in Central America, with estimated
 70,000 members, accounting for about 15 percent of homicides.
 Availability of firearms because of past civil wars. There are about 4.5 million small arms in
 the region—most of them illegal.
 Weak criminal justice institutions. In Honduras 65 thousand criminal complaints were filed,
 49 thousand were investigated, but only one thousand ended up in a conviction. This
 weak performance limits the efficacy of punishment and prevention. Underreporting is a
 major issue due to the lack of trust in the institutions.

A.7     Nigeria, Delta Region
Niger Delta is in Nigeria’s South-South geopolitical zone and contains 15 percent of
the country’s population (estimated 170 million in 2013). Oil was discovered in the
Delta in commercial quantities in 1956. Nearly two dozen international oil
companies operate in joint ventures with the Nigeria National Petroleum Company,
producing around 2.3 million barrels of crude oil per day, making Nigeria the
largest oil producer in Africa and the eleventh largest producer in the world. Oil
accounts for 90 percent of export earnings, 75 percent of consolidated government
revenue and 25 percent of GDP. The centrality of oil has made securing access to
and control over an increasing proportion of oil revenue the main locus of political
struggle in the Niger Delta. Violent conflict raged in the Delta from the 1990s
through 2009.

One of the main causes of the violent conflict in the Niger Delta is distribution of
revenues from oil resources. The claimants to resources are Nigeria’s federal
government and those of the states in its South-South geopolitical zone—Akwa
Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross-River, Delta, Edo, and Rivers.18 Per capita total federal
transfers (including not related to oil) to Delta states are two-and-a-half times the
national average. This, however, had little impact on the availability and quality of
public goods in the Delta, including security, education, health, infrastructure, etc.
This situation has raised questions about the lack of transparency and accountability in
the use of public funds, adding to the overall sense of disaffection among the
population of Delta states.

There is also the sentiment that the Delta population is not receiving an adequate
share of the natural resource wealth, while bearing the costs of producing it. Little
has been done to address the toxic environmental legacy of oil exploration borne by host
communities. Up to 546 million gallons of oil have poured into the ecosystems of the
Niger Delta over 50 years of production—nearly the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez
spill every year (Nossiter 2010). Soil, forests and waterways have been ravaged and
traditional livelihoods such as agriculture and fishing threatened by oil spills and
gas flares.19 In line with findings elsewhere, environmental degradation has had a
stronger deleterious impact on the poor than the rich.20

This set of issues has eluded peaceful resolution. The Movement for the Survival of
Ogoni People (MOSOP) was formed to contest environmental degradation in the
Ogoniland community of the Niger Delta. Although MOSOP espoused nonviolence,


                                                                                        107
APPENDIX A
HISTORY OF CONFLICTS AND VIOLENCE
conflict broke out between ethnic groups, the government and communities and
between oil companies and communities. The government resorted to force to crush
protests. A trial led to the hanging of the MOSOP leaders in 1995. The army, navy
and paramilitary force continued to be regularly deployed even after the restoration
of a civilian government in 1999.

Militant groups, sometimes in collusion with poorly-paid security personnel,
engaged in oil theft (known as “bunkering” in Nigeria), which is estimated at
between 70,000 and 300,000 barrels a day, or around 10 percent of Nigeria’s oil
production. The proceeds from bunkering and other criminal activities, such as
kidnapping, were used to finance the insurgency, which was targeted toward
government and the oil companies. Engaging in criminal activities was attractive for
the massive numbers of unemployed youth, who have seen little return to education
and training. Two-thirds of the population is under 30, and youth male
unemployment in the Delta states is above the national average of 20.9 percent.21
Groups organized into protection rackets were paid off by oil companies to
discourage attacks on oil pipelines.

By 2005 violent community conflicts in Rivers, Bayelsa and Delta state typically
numbered between 120 and 150 per year, and over 50 armed groups with an
estimated 20,000 to 25,000 armed youths were operating in the oil producing region
(UNDP 2007). Hostage-taking and attacks on oil facilities became increasingly
common with the formation of the umbrella militant group called the Movement for
the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND). Escalating unrest led to very
significant losses in oil production beginning in late 2005 and until amnesty was
offered to combatants in mid-2009.

Since 2009, a negotiated settlement involving amnesty and a Disarmament,
Demobilization, Rehabilitation, and Reintegration program has been in place.
Militants who handed in their weapons were pardoned and paid around $400 a
month until they found legitimate work.22 Furthermore, oil companies pay local
groups to protect pipelines and oil wells. A fragile peace, punctuated by very
occasional outbreaks of violence, currently reigns.

Historically, the reaction of the government to the periodic crises of the Delta has
been a combination of use of force, buying off militants through the redistribution of
revenue, promise of jobs for ex-combatants, and the creation of new development
institutions. Little has been done differently since the amnesty in 2009 to tackle the
multiple underlying drivers of conflict in the Delta, including (i) improving
transparency in revenue flows; (ii) tackling the problem of youth unemployment;
(iii) addressing the toxic environmental legacy of oil exploration; and (iv) reducing

criminal activities such as oil theft and kidnapping. Should the regular payments to
ex-combatants as part of the amnesty program come to an end in 2015 (as they are
currently planned to), these problems can reignite the conflict in the Delta.

A.8    Pakistan: Balochistan, FATA, and KP provinces
Along Pakistan’s western border with Afghanistan, localized conflicts have
threatened both national and regional stability in recent years. Government
engagement with militants in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA),
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and Balochistan provinces can be traced to a complex
web of issues that originate in Pakistan’s independence and complex relationship
with Afghanistan.23

FATA, KP, and Balochistan are both geographically and politically removed from
the central government. Existing on the periphery has negatively influenced the
state/citizen relationship; people in these regions report feeling disenfranchised by
the government, and seek to empower themselves by redefining their relationship
with Islamabad. As the central government has struggled to set the parameters for a
federalist state, they are also increasingly concerned with the instability posed by
war in neighboring Afghanistan. Due to the flow of Afghan fighters into Pakistan,
and the spill-over of the coalition fighting, a historically tense situation in FATA, KP,
and Balochistan has become militarized.

The conflicts in FATA, KP, and Balochistan are distinct, but they are both the result
of a failure of governance where the center has distanced itself from the realities of
the population and this has undermined the state’s legitimacy. The lack of visible
progress on a range of socioeconomic issues, coupled with a limited number of
institutions to meaningfully engage with the government, has disillusioned the
population. Militant groups have capitalized on this anger enjoying varying levels of
public support.

The conflict has resulted in considerable economic and human cost. The Post Crisis
Needs Assessment (2011) notes that the conflict in KP/FATA alone has caused 2.3
million IDPs; damage in physical and social infrastructure; decreased tourism; and
has negatively affected economic activity. These results not only constitute a
humanitarian crisis, but also undermine the Pakistani state’s ability to govern an
area with important security implications for the country and the broader region.
Armed conflict is considered as one of the key reasons for drop in foreign direct
investment from $5.3 billion in 2008 to $744 million in 2012. The annual cost of
conflict in Pakistan is estimated at no less than 2 percent of GDP.

APPENDIX A
HISTORY OF CONFLICTS AND VIOLENCE
Weak state presence is frequently cited as a key driver of this conflict and a source of
resentment in the population. Exploiting the population’s cynicism and alienation,
militant groups have (sometimes successfully) presented themselves as a viable
alternative to the state and a source of social and economic stability, particularly
through the provision of access to justice and limited civil services. FATA, KP, and
Balochistan are among the poorest provinces in Pakistan with some of the lowest
social indicator scores. FATA is consistently ranking last in the country for key
human development indicators, with KP not far behind. The government’s inability
(and perceived disinterest) to comprehensively address these problems has
frustrated residents in the region, which has few opportunities for economic
improvement. A lack of formal educational opportunities, the result of forced school
closures and a disorganized national educational system, has further constrained
employment opportunities. Poverty, the lack of jobs in the formal economy, and the
absence of courts has increased participation in criminal activity such as drug and
arms trafficking and has incentivized men to join militant outfits.

In Balochistan, one of the sources of tension has long been the sharing of resource
benefits, contributing to Balochs feeling alienated from the central government and
the democratic process. Balochs have long seen the relationship between the
province and the central government to be exploitative. Balochistan is the largest
producer of natural gas in Pakistan, and has been paid a fixed royalty for its natural
gas “exports” to other provinces, which has depreciated in real terms over the years.
Consequently, Balochistan is no longer remunerated for the full value of its exports.
The limited profits that are received go directly to plant and distribution network
owners, who frequently live outside of Balochistan—in essence, the income
generated in Balochistan is rarely returned to the community. The province remains
dependent on the center for transfers, which have shrunk in recent years because of
declining energy prices, contributing to the deterioration of the local economy. The
government has not meaningfully engaged with Balochs on how to address these
concerns. Instead, the military has cracked down on militant groups while political
leaders refuse to engage with nationalist groups, who they claim are undermining
the central government’s authority.

inaugurated in November 1990.

arrested two suspected terrorists. 44 police died in the attack, along with 18 of the MILF and 4 apparent civilians.

resulting data shows that while fragility is often associated with LICs, which only account
for half of the countries where fragility, conflict, and high levels of violence affect
development outcomes. A substantial number of countries with FCV do not currently have
access to IDA resources. Overall, FCV to various extents impact the development outcomes
of almost 2 billion people, one-quarter of which are living in extreme poverty. Of the 2
billion people, the vast majority are living in Low-MICs (38 percent) and Upper-MICs (37
percent) countries, and only 25 percent in low-income countries. (Source: FCV CCSA)

marker, we include countries with levels of intentional homicides well above the WHO level of ‘epidemic of homicides’
(i.e., 25 per 100.000 population, rather than 10 per 100,000 population). Battle-Deaths and intentional homicides are also
part of the suggested Post-2015 framework of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In addition, we include countries
with UN Department of Political Affairs (DPA) and Border missions.

Appendix D. Portfolio
Portfolio selection. This evaluation identified the World Bank Group portfolio for
review using five broad areas of intervention: (i) provision of services
(infrastructure, education, health, etc.); (ii) jobs and private sector development; (iii)
social inclusion and capacity building; (iv) security and justice; and (v) the
convening power of the World Bank Group. In reviewing each country case, the
evaluation assessed the relevance and efficacy of programs in each of these five
areas when addressing a particular form of fragility or violence. The evaluation team
then identified the portfolio to review through a “mapping exercise,” where World
Bank Group financial, analytical, and advisory instruments were classified
according to (i) a particular FCV situation they were deployed in; and (ii) the five
areas of intervention. This type of mapping was conducted for each country and
then consolidated into an overall portfolio reviewed in this report. Identifying the
portfolio for this evaluation was complicated by the fact that most of the FCV
situations in these countries were confined to certain parts of their territory, whereas
World Bank Group interventions and initiatives were often parts of broader national
programs. World Bank Group instruments selected for this report include: projects
that provided financing to address the needs of populations affected by conflict and
violence in specific regions; nationwide projects with wider objectives and
containing important components or elements relevant to conflict and violence
issues; analytical work addressing specific issues of relevance to conflict and
violence (diagnostics, political economy analyses, needs assessments, etc.) or with
potentially catalytic effect over time. Full list of projects (loans and grants) and AAA
is available in Appendix Table D.1.

Portfolio performance. The evaluation compared performance, as well as some
other features of over 56 selected projects spanning 11 countries with the rest of the
World Bank portfolio in these countries. The evaluation’s focus on localized conflicts
is reflected in the makeup of the portfolio: many of the projects were regional in
scope (77 percent) and were conflict-specific—meaning the project explicitly
addressed a driver or consequence of fragility in its design (67 percent). The content
of the projects reflects World Bank thinking on how best to operate in a conflict
environment. The CDD model was widely considered an appropriate tactic to
establish presence in conflict areas, increase community involvement in
programming, encourage community ownership of projects, and foster social
cohesion, and 60 percent of projects embraced this approach. Almost 80 percent of
all projects had capacity-building components. Close to 40 percent of projects
underwent a level 1-2 restructuring. In terms of sectoral spread, the SURR GP was
the leading originator (20 percent), followed by Education, Social Protection, and
Labor, and Governance GPs (12–13 percent).

                                                                              PORTFOLIO
Despite efforts to account for fragility in project design and implementation, they
were rarely captured in results. Only 32 percent of programs recorded fragility-
specific outcomes; 26 percent had M&E systems specifically designed to track issues
of FCV. FCV-specific indicators varied widely within the selected sample and
depended strongly on particular country and situation context, and included such
metrics as the level of social cohesion within communities (Philippines, Uganda),
reintegration of ex-combatants (Indonesia), public services in affected communities
(Jordan), impact on the well-being of internally displaced population (Colombia),
incidence of violent crime (Honduras), and others.

In terms of performance, in most cases, 8 out of 10 countries (the evaluation covers
11 countries, but performance information is collected for 10, excluding Nigeria,
where there was only one recently launched relevant project in Niger Delta,
SEEFOR) the FCV portfolio either outperformed or was on par with the rest of the
portfolio in the same country (see Figure D.1). This positive difference in
performance becomes even more pronounced if the countries are grouped by
drivers of conflict and violence (Figure D.2). This finding is consistent with the
similar conclusion of the 2014 IEG evaluation of FCS countries, where portfolio
performance in low-income FCS was higher than in low-income non-FCS. The
perceived risks to outcomes of Bank interventions in conflict-affected regions of
MICs seem to be exaggerated, whereas the development achievements in these
regions are very important as they are also related to peace, post-conflict
rehabilitation, and strengthening resilience. This could also be an indicator of
increased strategic focus within the World Bank to FCV situations in MICs and
interventions to address them. It is also notable that both cases where the FCV
portfolio was less successful (albeit not significantly) were IDA countries (Uganda
and Honduras).

IFC: For 11 case study countries, the report identified 36 IFC projects relevant to
FCV situations in non-FCS countries: 20 investment projects and 16 advisory service
projects. Many of these IFC projects are still under implementation and their
development outcomes have not been rated by either IFC or IEG. Only 10 projects (7
advisories and 3 investments) have been completed and rated by IEG for
development outcomes and effectiveness. Six out of the 10 are advisory service
projects in Aceh, Indonesia. Although the sample size is small, analysis of the
advisory service portfolio in Indonesia indicates that IFC can be equally effective in
more difficult circumstances of FCV. From 2008 to 2015, IEG assigned development
effectiveness ratings to 13 projects in Indonesia. The success rate of IFC advisory
service projects in Aceh is 50 percent, compared to 57 percent for the rest of advisory
service projects in Indonesia.
