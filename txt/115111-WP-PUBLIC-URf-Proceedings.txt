T
      he Understanding Risk and Finance Conference (URf), held on November 17–20, 2015, at the African Union
      in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, convened 450 disaster risk management experts and practitioners to discuss and
      share knowledge on how to mitigate the socioeconomic, fiscal, financial, and physical impacts of disasters in
African nations.
Organized by the African Union (AU), the European Union (EU), the government of Ethiopia, the World Bank,
and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)—and in collaboration with a number of
regional and international institutions—URf was part of the Building Disaster Resilience in Sub–Saharan Africa
program, which is an initiative of the African, Caribbean, and Pacific Group of States that is financed by the EU and
implemented by the AU, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, the African Development Bank, and
GFDRR with the World Bank.
During the four-day event, African policymakers met with members of the private sector, the multilateral
community, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and academic institutions to discuss the myriad of risks
the continent faces, as well as to outline key lessons learned to overcome these challenges. Attendees were
encouraged to address risks holistically, as the continent is highly vulnerable to droughts, floods, climate change,
forced displacement, political instability, chronic poverty, conflicts, and pandemics. The following were among the
topics and concerns they raised:
 	 The potential impacts of El Niño in the region. While some countries, such as Ethiopia, have efficient
   safety nets in place to absorb some of the shocks of weather events resulting from El Niño, preparation
   activities in others are not as advanced. A call was made by international and local actors to come together to
   intensify preparations for addressing the impacts of this weather system at the country level.
 	 The need for continued investment in early warning and risk identification systems and for the
   sharing of knowledge across institutions. Participants examined risk identification and preparedness
   capabilities with reference both to natural hazards and pandemics, with many discussions taking place on the
   challenges of the Ebola epidemic. Particularly instructive was the experience of Sierra Leone, which managed
   to end the outbreak in November 2015—the same month as the conference.
 	 The challenges associated with assessing risk in data-poor environments and communicating
   risk information. The availability of adequate data is essential to disaster risk assessment, which, along with
   effective communication of assessment findings, is, in turn, essential to disaster preparedness, risk reduction,
   financial protection, and resilient reconstruction.
 	 The growing awareness across Africa of the need for effective risk financing and management
   solutions to contribute to long-term resilience building. The general consensus among participants
   was that, by applying basic principles of financial planning and public financial management, countries can
   become more financially resilient to disasters and climate shocks.




                                                                                                                   iii
  	 Financial preparedness at both the country and individual levels. Participants saw catastrophe risk
    pools as useful in helping countries improve access to and lower the cost of sovereign insurance, which can
    empower governments to ensure a rapid response by providing liquidity immediately after a disaster. Scalable
    social safety nets have promise as a means of disseminating targeted payouts to vulnerable households at the
    onset of a shock.
  	 The importance of urban resilience as African cities rapidly expand. There was an agreement that
    building resilience requires reducing vulnerability, building capacity, and improving urban planning. As cities
    move from the diagnosis of problems to the implementation of solutions, they will need strong leadership and
    coordination across all levels of government, as well as access to public and private resources.
  	 The need for better coordination and partnership among actors and stakeholders in the field of
    disaster risk identification and financing. Participants saw the role of public–private partnerships as
    critical. This was particularly so in the case of index-based insurance, where, some argued, a multi-stakeholder
    approach to investments in data and technology is key to ensuring the sustainability of initiatives that can
    help build individuals’ resilience to disasters.
  	 The concept of thinking locally and acting globally. Participants saw that forming partnerships with
    local communities and understanding their preoccupations, vulnerabilities, and factors that affect their
    resilience is a key step in mitigating disaster risk and ensuring financial resilience. Government-to-government
    and regional coordination was also stressed.
During the conference, the power of social media to spread messages was evident, with over 950 tweets going
out containing the hashtag #URfAfrica. In addition, a youth event brought in young leaders from the region to
speak to students in person and to more online through a Google+ chat. The event demonstrated the potential
for matching the power of physically convening with the power to reach multiple audiences (including youth) and
to influence online discussions globally.
The proceedings presented here seek to convey some of the dialogues that took place during URf by providing
summaries that build on the themes listed above.
URf marked the beginning of new partnerships and innovative advances in disaster risk assessment and financing
in Sub-Saharan Africa. We look forward to continuing to work on these advances, and to collectively build
resilience against the socioeconomic, fiscal, and physical impacts of disasters on the continent.
