THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        To obtain urban development specifications and requirements, BuildCo
        submits the documents (to the Main Department of Architecture and
        Urban Planning of the Kyiv City State Administration) provided by the
        Law on Urban Planning, Order Ministry of Regional Development dated

        and restrictions land development, their structure and content" and the
        Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of December 07, 2005 № 1176.

        The architectural and technical objectives/conditions are part of the
        input data needed for designing the project.

        Procedure for Issuance of the Benchmark Data for the Designing of
        Town Planning Objects"dated May 20, 2009 develops provisions of Law

        489, the benchmark data include:
        • City planning conditions
        • Technical conditions
        • Design assignment

        The city planning conditions and restrictions are based on the
        respective city development rules (Rules of Development of Kiev City).
        These should not interfere with the engineering and architectural
        solutions of the project, unless only required by the need to protect the
        existing architectural, historical or cultural environment. The form of the
        city planning conditions and restrictions has been approved by the
        same Regulation No. 489. In order to obtain the city planning
        conditions and restrictions, BuildCo should submit to the Main

      any.

      The documents are checked for compliance with the city development
      rules (Rules of Development of Kiev City) within 10 days upon receipt of
      the documents. In case of the positive outcome of such a compliance
      check, the city planning conditions and restrictions are issued to the
      developer (BuildCo) within 2 weeks. If, however, the outcome is
      negative, the respective conclusion and recommendations on
      elimination on noncompliance is issued within a one-month term. If the
      developer's intention to construct the property does not comply with
      the city planning documentation, it can initiate the proceeding for the
      amendment of such documentation by filing a respective application
      with the Main Department of the City-Planning, Architecture and Urban
      Environment Design of the Kiev City State Administration which decides
      on the matter within 2 weeks in coordination with the relevant bodies
      (land resources, environmental and cultural protection authorities,
      sanitary and epidemiological stations) and submits its respective
      proposals to the Kiev City Council for the final approval. The
      implementation of the relevant practice of issuing city planning
      conditions and restrictions to developers has already started in Kiev.
      Upon obtaining of the city planning conditions and restrictions, the
      developer should apply for the technical conditions.

      These include the data on engineering and utility servicing of the to-be
      constructed property (the warehouse), including the sources of supply,
      connection points as well as the basic engineering parameters of the
      property.

      The city planning conditions and restrictions as well as the technical
      conditions are valid until completion of construction, but for the term
      not less than 2 and not longer than 5 years and they can be extended
      at the request of the developer. The design assignment should comply
      with the city planning conditions and terms and refine the benchmark
      for design, with account for the specific features of the project. The
      design assignment is developed and approved by the developer and is
      provided to the general designer for the project.

      Ministers of Ukraine, No. 40 which updates the Decree of Kiev City
      Council from February 27, 2003 "On shared participation (shares) of
      investors (Building Owners) creation of city social and engineering-
      transport infrastructure in Kiev City", the building which is set into
      operation will be approved only after paying the obligatory share of
      participation fees of investor into development of social, civil,
      engineering and traffic infrastructure of the city of Kyiv. The amount of
      such contribution is defined by the Chief Department of Economics and
      Investments of the Kyiv Municipal State Administration in certificate on
      approval on the stage of elaborating the project documentation.

      According to Law of Ukraine "On Alteration of Some Legislative Acts of
      Ukraine Regarding Assistance of the Construction", dated September
      16, 2008, No. 509-VI, there is a new order on paying the contribution to

      performing of works or transferring of any assets for benefits of local
      authorities.

      The Decision of Kyiv City Council, dated December 302012
      No.573/5385 stipulates special conditions for calculating contribution
      payment in paragraph 6.1:

      B o b = n j * s * k, where:
      B ob - the amount of share participation developer (investor) for the
      construction project in the j-industry and national economic complex of
      the city;
      nj - standard amount of share participation developers (investors) in
      the creation of social, engineering and transport infrastructure of the
      city of Kiev with the assessment of the socio-economic value of
      construction projects for the city in the j-industry and national
      economic complex, their function;
      s - the total area of the object for which the contribution rate is
      determined;
      k - summarizing the correction factor.
      Generalizing the correction factor (k) is calculated for the following
      formula:
      from k = kz * I i, wherein
      kz - zonal coefficient;
      I i - an index that takes into account inflation since 01.01.2009 before
      the month in which the calculation is carried out.

      It should be noted that the standard unit of investor participation in the
      construction of a warehouse in the tables in Appendix 16 is not defined.
      This structure can be regarded as "other non-residential premises" in
      the table. 2, for which the norm is 45.6 USD per 1 m. m total area, or
      "other production areas" in the table. 3, for which the standard 54.4
      USD per 1 m. of the total area.

      Zonal coefficient depending on the area of construction as shown in
      Table 4 will be from 1 to 2.5 (areas where, in practice, are built
      warehouses), however, coefficient 2 would be most likely for the areas
      where warehouses are built.

      Inflation index since 2009 (according to the State Statistics Committee)
      is 132.

      The amount of share participation in the construction of a warehouse
      area of 1,300.6 square meters will be: B ob = 54.4 * 1300.6 * 1.32 * 2 =
      186,787.

      However, since this amount exceeds the 10% of the construction value,
      the contribution would be limited to 10% of the warehouse value.

        Submit an application for connection to Kievenergo and await
        technical conditions and conclude supply contract

        The customer submits to Kievenergo an application for an electricity
        connection. Attached to the application the customer has to submit a
        number of documents: a letter with a company seal requesting the
        connection, bank details of the applicant, company statute, registration
        certificate from the tax authorities, registration certificate of the
        company, certificate stating that the company is included in the national
        company registry, document stating the appointment of the CEO,
        property ownership certificate and location plan of the property to be
        connected. After reviewing the application Kievenergo issues technical
        conditions. The technical conditions concern only the external
        connection. In general they may include instructions for construction of
        a new substation; lining of high-voltage and low-voltage cables; in a case

        actions.



        The application for technical conditions is submitted to the Department
        of Development (департамент перспективного развития) at
        Kievenergo which is then internally passed on to the Regional Office in
        the particular area of Kiev where the warehouse is located and the
        regional office determines the point of connection. Technicians in the
        Regional offices know the network and the substations in their area very
        well and usually do not need to visit the site for preparation of technical
        conditions. At this point the connection contract is concluded which
        outlines the responsibilities between the customer and the utility.

      Once the technical conditions are issued the customer hires a licensed

      external connection. As part of the project design the company prepares
      a topogeodesic plan (топогеодезическую съемку М 1:500). The
      topogeodosic plan is prepared to determine the technical aspects of
      running cable through the landscape. At the same time the project
      design firm develops a project on the protection against corrosion of 10
      kV cables if installation of a substation is required. These plans are
      developed simultaneously with the general electrical project design of
      the external connection.

      While the project is being developed the approval of the location of the
      substation connection to the network and/or the route of the cable 10
      kV and 0.4 kV has to be obtained from Kievenergo and from the Main
      Architectural Planning Organization. At this point the customer should
      have an operation permit for the warehouse or Main Plan with the
      Landscape Allocation Plan. The approvals are obtained by the project
      design firm.

      of external connection from Kievenergo it is required to attach the

      for external electrical connection works, for installing, testing and
      preparing substations 10/0.4 kV, for running 10 and 0.4 kV cable and
      which also has a certificate from an electrotechnical laboratory to take
      electrical measurements and to test high voltage equipment. If the
      customer hires a qualified electrical contractor he will have all of the
      above licenses.

      In addition, the customer or the electrical contractor should have on
      their team an employee who has special certificate (level 5) for dealing
      with high voltage equipment.

      has to visit the Main Architectural Planning Organization then Regional
      Cable Lines and then finally submit the whole package of documents to
      the Department of Development at Kievenergo and receive there the
      technical certificate.

      After the external connection works are finished electrical measurements
      have to be taken, and the cable lines, transformer and other electrical
      equipment including internal wiring have to be tested by the electrical
      contractor. After the testing the electrical contractor prepares a package
      of technical documents (more than 20 different documents).

      of the transactional value of the building. The buyer of the building will
      also pay a special assessment in the amount of 1% of building’s
      transactional value to the State Pension Fund. The buyer can make the                        1% of the building
