1. Introduction
The World Bank Financial Sector Advisory Center (FinSAC),
now in its fifth year of operation, is a dedicated technical unit
delivering financial sector reform advice and implementation
assistance to client countries in the European and Central Asia
region. FinSAC is part of the World Bank’s Finance and Markets
Global Practice and is supported financially by Austria’s Federal
Ministry of Finance.

FinSAC is a regional “knowledge center” focused primarily on
three broadly defined thematic areas: first, macroprudential
supervisory frameworks and crisis management; second, micro-
prudential supervision and regulation including the resolution
of non-performing loans (NPLs); and, finally, bank recovery and
resolution. Advisory and analytical services in these areas are
provided mainly through high quality client-specific technical
assistance assignments. Technical workshops, conferences, and
seminars are organized regularly and FinSAC also conducts
relevant and applied research projects with corresponding
outreach activities. FinSAC work streams are designed to inno-
vatively reinforce each other; bilateral technical assistance raises
important emerging policy and implementation issues that are
then distilled and disseminated in open fora, such as conferen-
ces and seminars as well as in FinSAC publications in the form

of working and research papers. In turn, these knowledge events
and publications trigger new technical assistance requests.

are designed to complement other World Bank projects and
assistance to client countries. FinSAC draws on additional exper-

hires specialized consultants to help augment implementation
of its work program. Country authorities typically are keenly           and implementation

stakeholders also active in promoting strong and stable financial
systems.

largely driven by the political and economic situation in the region and the
requirements of significant stakeholders. This section considers the broad
regional economic situation in 2016, and the key strategic priorities for the
financial sector.
