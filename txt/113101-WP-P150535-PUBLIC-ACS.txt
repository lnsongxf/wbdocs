                       Abstract

                       This study analyzes labor market performance in the Philippines from the perspective of workers’
                       welfare. It argues that pervasive in-work poverty is the main challenge facing labor policy.
                       Poverty is primarily due to low earning capacity of the poor and to their limited access to regular
                       and productive jobs. Behind these are the two interrelated root causes of in-work poverty—
                       low education of the poor, and the scarcity of productive job opportunities. The labor market
                       is segmented into “good” and “bad” jobs, with the poor working in the latter. They hold jobs
                       that are informal, temporary or casual, and low-paid. Widespread informality means that the
                       poor neither benefit from the minimum wage policy nor from employment protection legislation.
                       They do not benefit from wage growth either, because their bargaining power is weak. “Good”
                       jobs are so few, especially in rural areas, that even better educated workers are often forced
                       to take unskilled jobs and work as low-paid laborers. The reduction of in-work poverty hinges
                       on removing constraints to gainful employment in both supply side (better education and skills)
                       and demand side (better jobs). It is critical that the young poor have improved access to quality
                       education, and be equipped with skills required in the modern sector of the economy. But in
                       parallel, better jobs need to be created, which can be attained from the growth of the formal and
                       higher value added sector of the economy. The process of structural transformation should be
                       supported by effective labor policy. Labor regulations need to be made simpler and more flexible
                       to facilitate the reallocation of labor from less to more productive activities, and from informal to
                       formal sector. Targeted training programs have the potential to address the problem of low skills
                       among the poor workers, especially the young ones. Such programs should be developed on a
                       pilot basis and expanded if proven to be cost-effective.

                       Main Concepts Used in the Note

                       Bad jobs. Jobs are considered “bad” if they are low-paid and informal, and thus are not
                       covered by labor regulations. Jobs can also be bad if they are involuntarily part-time,
                       temporary or casual. As a rule, jobs that are deemed as “bad” are associated with an
                       elevated risk of poverty. “Good” jobs are jobs that pay above the low-pay threshold
                       or are formal, unless they have some characteristics that render them “bad” (e.g. are
                       involuntarily part-time or temporary). As a rule, “good” jobs are associated with low risk
                       of poverty.

job opportunities. This may give rise to a vicious circle: workers have little incentives to invest in skills because there
are few jobs requiring advanced skills. At the same time, skill-intensive jobs are not being created because workers               3

Informality looms large. Around three-quarters of all jobs, and two-thirds of urban jobs are informal. Among wage
workers, 6 out of 10 are hired informally. About 50 percent of informal workers are wage workers, 40 percent are self-                                                    The problem of low educational attainment is particularly pronounced among youth from poor families, most of

As expected, in-work poverty is closely linked with low wages.

With low paid jobs concentrated in the informal sector, in-work poverty is closely related to informality.

90 percent of all low-paid jobs are informal, and as a result, informal workers are disproportionately represented in                                                                     from the first to the second earning capacity group, the risk of poverty drops by 18 percentage points.6 However, the

However, while the majority of the working poor are informal workers, informal employment does not necessarily lead                                                                       from the first to the second earning capacity group, the employed household members would need to double their

minimum wage increases benefit many non-poor workers. At the same time, the high minimum wage may limit the

Informality limits the actual coverage of the minimum wage policy. Among employees of private firms, less than half
(45 percent) are employed in firms that are formal. Among those who are employed in formal firms, about 25 percent
are paid less than the minimum wage. Accordingly, only about one-third of workers in private firms benefit from the
minimum wage policy.

results of monitoring and evaluation should guide the policy and allocation of resources. One possible policy direction
would be to focus resources on cost-effective training programs, which equip the beneficiaries with employability skills
demanded in the labor market, and as such have the potential to enhance their long-term employment prospects.
This is particularly relevant given that poor skills of vulnerable workers are the main obstacle to their taking more
productive jobs.

Conclusions

Widespread in-work poverty is the main challenge facing labor policy in the Philippines. The working poor are poorly
educated and have informal jobs that offer no workers protection. Most of them live in rural areas, where productive
job opportunities are few. This points to two interrelated root causes of in-work poverty—low education among
vulnerable workers, and scarcity of “good” jobs. Addressing these two constraints requires reforms on both the supply
side (education and skills) and demand side (jobs) of the labor market. These reforms have four objectives:

•	 Improvement in the workforce education, especially among young cohorts entering the labor market, so that
   workers have the skills required in the modern sector of the economy.
•	 Structural transformation which entails the development of more productive formal wage and salaried employment

   The so called livelihood assistance program, which is a small business start-up support program, covered about 500 thousand persons in 2014.
Among the youth bridging programs, 180 thousand persons benefited from a hiring subsidy, and 20 thousand from government internship
program in 2014. Public infrastructure programs vary in size. They are expanded during economic downturns to act as a social safety net. For
example, about 400 thousand workers were hired under the road construction program, and 5 thousand under the road maintenance program
in 2014.

   There are over 45 implementing agencies, of which only 15 report to DOLE. About 50 direct job creation programs were reported to DOLE in
2014.
