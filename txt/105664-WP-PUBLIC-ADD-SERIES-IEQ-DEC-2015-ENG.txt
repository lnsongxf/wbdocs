Reforming amid uncertainty

December 2015
Preface
          The Indonesia Economic Quarterly (IEQ) has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past three months in Indonesia’s economy, and places these in a longer-
          term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes over the period,
          the IEQ regularly updates the outlook for Indonesia’s economy and social welfare. Second, the
          IEQ provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and policy issues, and analysis
          of Indonesia’s medium-term development challenges. It is intended for a wide audience,
          including policymakers, business leaders, financial market participants, and the community of
          analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia’s evolving economy.

          The IEQ is a product of the World Bank’s Jakarta office and receives editorial and strategic
          guidance from an editorial board chaired by Rodrigo Chaves, Country Director for Indonesia.
          The report is compiled by the Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management Global Practice team,
          under the guidance of Shubham Chaudhuri, Practice Manager, Ndiame Diop, Lead Economist
          and Hans Anand Beck, Senior Economist. Led by Elitza Mileva, Country Economist, and with
          responsibility for Part A, editing and production, the core project team comprises Arsianti,
          Magda Adriani, Masyita Crystallin, Fitria Fitrani, Ahya Ihsan, Yue Man Lee and Violeta Vulovic
          with additional editing by Edgar Janz, Matt Wai-Poi and Sinead Maguire. Administrative support
          is provided by Titi Ananto. Dissemination is organized by Indra Irnawan, Jerry Kurniawan, Gb

  Executive summary: Reforming amid uncertainty




In a challenging        Although global financial markets have stabilized since October, external conditions

committed to            is the significant increase in public capital spending by an estimated 49.8 percent
improve growth          year on year (yoy) in real terms in the third quarter, reversing the negative trend of
                        2014 and early 2015. Moreover, the 2016 State Budget calls for further
                        improvement in the composition of spending by shifting resources from energy
                        subsidies to infrastructure, health and targeted social assistance. A second signal is
                        the reform agenda initiated in September through the announcement of seven
                        policy packages of regulatory and structural reforms and fiscal stimulus.

                        revenue target could be challenging, given the revenue shortfall in 2015 and
                        continuing weak macroeconomic conditions and low commodity prices. If revenue
                        collection were to remain weak in 2016, the ongoing strong public infrastructure
                        spending momentum and its growth impulse may be at risk.

Investor risk           Emerging market assets rebounded in October after the sharp losses recorded in

moderated but           slowdown and the U.S. interest rate outlook was particularly high. Despite a more
global economic         favorable market sentiment, capital flows to emerging economies have remained
activity remains        weak and borrowing costs relatively high. In addition to tight financing conditions,
subdued                 Indonesia still faces subdued external demand for its exports in the near term and
                        persistently low commodity prices over the medium run. Recent data point to
                        subdued GDP growth across the globe for a fourth consecutive quarter.

Public spending         In the third quarter, real GDP grew at 4.7 percent yoy, the same pace as in Q1 and
supported growth in     Q2 2015. Growth was supported by an increase in public sector spending both on
the third quarter,      consumption and capital. At the same time, private sector investment is estimated to
with private            have remained subdued, with some high-frequency (leading) data pointing to a pick-
investment still weak   up in the fourth quarter, while others, in particular business sentiment indicators,
                        signaling persistent weakness. The aggregate unemployment rate increased to 6.2
                        percent, from 5.9 percent in August 2014, reversing the declining trend observed in
                        the past decade. Moreover, the sectors that are still creating jobs – construction and
                        trade – are low productivity sectors.

Man-made fire and       Another factor constraining GDP growth in the third quarter was the fire and haze-
haze cost Indonesia     related losses in several provinces. Between June and October 2015, more than
IDR 221 trillion in     100,000 man-made fires burned 2.6 million hectares of land, an area four and a half
just five months,       times the size of Bali. The World Bank estimates that the fires cost Indonesia at
contributing to         least IDR 221 trillion (USD 16.1 billion), equivalent to 1.9 percent of 2015 GDP
slower growth           and more than twice the reconstruction cost after the Aceh tsunami. Partly due to
                        the El Niño-related drought and to the forest fires, real agricultural output declined
                        at a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualized rate (qoq-saar) of 4.9 percent
                        in Q3 2015, the first significant decline in over four years. Kalimantan, where much
                        of the country’s fragile peatlands are located, was the hardest hit, with GDP
                        declining by 1.2 percent qoq-saar in the third quarter (-5.1 percent qoq-saar in East
                        Kalimantan). The government has called for a moratorium on new peatland
                        concessions, a cancellation of existing, non-developed concessions, and peatland
                        restoration. Additional efforts should focus on conserving the remaining peat
                        forests and stopping the drainage of deep peat or high biodiversity areas.

Despite a relatively    Turning to the external sector, trade continued to weaken in the third quarter, with
low current account     both exports and imports reaching their lowest levels since 2010. As in previous
deficit, external       quarters, imports declined more than exports, thus supporting a narrower current
pressures remain as     account deficit. Although this eased some of Indonesia’s external pressures,
net capital flows       declining net capital flows resulted in a balance of payments deficit. Even though
contracted further…     capital flows were resilient in the first half of 2015, owing to government bond
                        inflows, total net capital flows in the first three quarters, at USD 9.6 billion,
                        decreased by almost 70 percent compared with the same period last year. Compared
                        with its level up to October last year, net foreign purchases of Rupiah-denominated
                        sovereign bonds (SUNs) are down by 54.4 percent, while government foreign-
                        currency debt increased by 80 percent. SUNs have lost some of the appeal to
                        foreign investors, as the volatility of the Rupiah rose this year.

… constraining         Domestic credit also remains tight, though there are some signs of a pick-up in
monetary policy in     investment loan growth. Headline inflation declined below 5 percent yoy in
the very short term,   November, owing in large part to the base effect from last year’s sharp increase in
even with inflation    retail fuel prices. Nevertheless, monetary policy remains constrained in the very
easing                 short term on account of weaker capital flows and continued exchange rate
                       depreciation pressures. In response to heightened Rupiah volatility since August,
                       Bank Indonesia (BI) unveiled a set of measures to stabilize the currency. The
                       measures range from foreign exchange interventions in the forward market to
                       issuing Bank Indonesia Certificates (SBIs) in foreign currency. In addition, BI
                       renewed its bilateral currency swap agreement with China.

                        respect to current laws and regulations, it restricts in some ways the room for future
                        economic policy-making. For instance, TPP members have limited leeway to make
                        laws and regulations more restrictive towards other member countries. This could
                        be particularly important for Indonesia, the most active user of restrictive trade and
                        investment measures in South East Asia.

In the base case,             Looking ahead, the World Bank’s forecast for GDP growth remains at 4.7 percent
GDP is projected to           for 2015 and 5.3 percent for 2016 (Table 2). Although the headline projections are

percent in 2015 and           now expected to contribute slightly more to growth both this year and next, at the
5.3 percent in 2016…          expense of exports. This revision reflects the government’s commitment to higher
                              capital allocation in the approved 2016 Budget (see Section 6), which may crowd in
                              private investment and support overall growth. The growth pick-up in the baseline
                              is also based on gradually improving external conditions. The World Bank expects
                              global growth to increase to 3 percent in 2016, from 2.5 percent estimated for this
                              year.3 However, the balance of risks, both external and domestic, to the baseline
                              scenario is still to the downside (see Section 8).

                         month terms. Although retail rice prices have increased at a more subdued pace in
                         the past two months, likely on the back of higher stockpiles, the prices of other
                         food commodities, such as meat and vegetables, picked up. The moderate to severe
                         El Niño conditions have adversely affected agricultural output across Indonesia this
                         year, increasing the volatility of food prices.4

2016                     delayed as a consequence of below-average rainfall in large parts of Indonesia.6
                         Moreover, the dry weather is expected to lower the yields of early-planted crops,
                         particularly in rain-fed areas. As El Niño remains the main risk to the inflation
                         outlook, the government’s response to the supply constraints (e.g. allowing rice
                         imports to replenish stocks) is an important determinant of the near-term trajectory
                         of food prices.

               6. Higher budget execution rates supported growth in the third quarter
By October, the       Fiscal policy in 2015 features a strong tension between lower than projected revenue
realized deficit      collection and the desire to accelerate public spending disbursement to support
reached 2.5 percent   growth. As a result, by October the realized fiscal deficit reached 2.5 percent of
of GDP, as fiscal     GDP, exceeding the Ministry of Finance’s full-year target (revised in July) of 2.2
policy prioritized    percent (Table 4).11 If recent trends continue into November and December, the
growth                fiscal deficit is likely to be higher than 2.5 percent by the end of the year. The large
                      revenue shortfall is likely to constrain the implementation of the 2016 Budget, due
                      to a “base” effect, and poses a risk of another revenue shortfall next year (see
                      below).

The broad-based       Overall revenue collection in the first ten months of 2015 declined by 9.7 percent
weakening in          relative to the same period in 2014, reflecting low oil and gas prices and a weak
revenues continued    macroeconomic environment (Figure 14). By the end of October, total revenue
in October 2015       outturns reached IDR 1,099.7 trillion, which is equivalent to 66.7 percent of the
                      Ministry of Finance’s revenue outlook set in July 2015. This revenue realization
                      compares with an average of 76 percent in the last five years. Cumulative tax
                      revenue declined by 1.2 percent yoy, significantly below the targeted increase of 19
                      percent in the latest revenue outlook. Oil and gas revenues, both tax and non-tax,
                      continue to be a major driver of the 2015 revenue slowdown. In January – October,
                      oil and gas revenues contributed -10.7 percentage points yoy to the overall nominal
                      revenue decrease, mostly owing to lower international oil and gas prices. VAT
                      collection also continued to decline in line with the moderation in nominal growth
                      of private consumption (8.0 percent yoy in Q1-Q3 2015versus an average of 11.8

                             25.5 trillion next year. The government has also allocated more funds for other

                              with an increase in the working-age population by 3.1 million. As a result, the
                              aggregate employment rate declined to 61.7 percent, the lowest it has been since
                              2008. The aggregate unemployment rate increased to 6.2 percent, from 5.9 percent
                              in August 2014, reversing the declining trend observed in the past decade (Figure

                              2011. Social and personal services, on the contrary, have been one of the sectors
                              with the highest contribution to job creation during the past decade, with 1 million
                              new jobs created each year between 2006 and 2012. Therefore, its recent slowdown
                              can be particularly worrying, as informal and low-skilled workers formerly employed
                              in this sector may have difficulties finding new opportunities under weaker
                              macroeconomic conditions. An additional worrying signal is coming from the
                              manufacturing industry, where employment has been stagnant, likely reflecting
                              lower external and domestic demand.

                       2015 gross financing needs are IDR 497.2 trillion with a budget deficit of 2.2
                       percent of GDP. If the 2015 budget deficit reaches the legal limit of 2.7 percent of

                       secured IDR 510.4 trillion from securities issuance and USD 3.89 billion (around
                       IDR 53 trillion) in foreign official lending. Frontloading of government securities
                       issuances and greater reliance on multilateral financing have helped mitigate fiscal

Box 1: An important and wide-ranging reform process was initiated in September
  The Government started a significant effort of regulatory reform with seven economic policy packages announced
  between September 9 and December 4, 2015. Further packages are expected over the coming years. The recently
  announced reforms go beyond regulatory simplification and fiscal stimulus, and include structural reforms (Table 5).
  The Government’s intent is fourfold: to increase investments, revitalize domestic industry, facilitate trade and improve
  logistics, and ease the procurement of raw materials, particularly in such sectors as agriculture, marine affairs and
  fisheries, and mining products. As usual, implementation will be the crucial test. While some measures could be
  adopted immediately (e.g. the electricity subsidies), most regulatory reforms require structured and broad-based
  consultation (including with consumers, users of intermediate inputs or services and producers) to ensure policy
  consistency and economy-wide benefits and to avoid unintended consequences.1

  Most of the proposed reforms are work in progress, with some regulations already enacted, and some in the pipeline.
  For instance, as of November 4, the Ministry of Trade had revised 15 regulations, which included removing/
  simplifying 10 selected import licenses (i.e. forest products, textile and batik textile products, sodium polyphosphate,
  clove, tire, optical disks, cooling system based goods, ozone destroying materials, horticulture products). The reduced
  fuel and electricity prices for industry entered into effect immediately, with the gas price reduction to enter into effect
  on January 1, 2016. The Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board enacted regulation to facilitate a three-hour

 governments could be given incentives to participate in the ongoing reform drive. Reform champions can be identified
 and supported through a dedicated program.
 To sustain the reform effort, an institutionalized, empowered and centralized review process for new regulations
 against government objectives would be needed to manage the ongoing reform implementation and the “flow” of
 incoming regulations. The experiences of countries that successfully accelerated business climate reforms show the
 importance of a dedicated reform team with frequent reporting to the highest level of government. In addition,
 strengthened and broad-based private sector participation can promote transparency and facilitate effective
 communication of successful reforms. In some countries, such as South Korea, Sweden, Mexico, Hungary and
 Mongolia, a comprehensive inventory of all licenses has led to concrete reform actions. They introduced a “regulatory
 guillotine”, which tests the legality, necessity and business friendliness of a given regulatory requirement, with three
 possible outcomes: abolish, amend or leave as-is. International experience offers different ways in which government
 agencies can improve the quality of the “flow” of incoming regulations (e.g., relying on regulatory impact assessment),
 minimize the disruption that comes from unexpected rule-making (e.g., through notice-and-comment processes), and
 avoid unintended negative impact on the private sector (e.g., via public-private dialogue). Finally, complementary
 process improvements areimportant. For instance, in the case of easing imports, the implementation of process
 improvements, such as fully paperless electronic applications, parallel processing, and a risk-based import approval
 regime, would significantly enhance reform outcomes.

Note: 1 For instance, two newly enacted regulations (Ministry of Trade Regulation Nos. 87/2015 and 70/2015) created controversy by
making it more difficult for producers to import, and their implementation is currently on hold by virtue of Minister of Trade Regulations;

              1. Indonesia’s fire crisis: Who benefits and who pays?
Man-made fire and     According to the government, 2.6 million hectares of land burned between June and
haze cost Indonesia   October 2015,18 an area four and half times the size of Bali. Man-made fires – more
IDR 221 trillion in   than 100,000 of them19 – were used to prepare land for agriculture and to gain
just five months      access to land cheaply. The absence of controlled burning measures or sufficient law
                      enforcement meant that the fires grew out of control, fed by drought and
                      exacerbated by the effects of El Niño. This vast economic and environmental crisis
                      is repeated year after year, as a few hundred businesses and a few thousand farmers
                      seek to profit from land and plantation speculation practices, while tens of millions
                      of Indonesians suffer health costs and economic disruptions. In 2015, fires cost
                      Indonesia an estimated IDR 221 trillion (USD 16.1 billion) (see Section b). Regional
                      and global costs would be much higher. The government has pledged to prioritize a
                      response and the president has called for action. Now is the time for Indonesia to
                      address the underlying drivers of man-made fires, enforce laws and revise policies in
                      order to reduce the risk of these economic disasters from recurring.

                            peatlands, leading to noxious haze that blanketed parts of Indonesia and the region,
                            disrupting transport, trade, and tourism, forcing school closures and negatively
                            affecting health. The 2015 fires also contributed significantly to Indonesia’s
                            substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (see Box 3).
Box 2: Certification standards could encourage environmentally friendly production practices
 In 2015, the estimated economic cost of fire to Indonesia (IDR 221 trillion) was larger than the estimated value added
 from Indonesia’s 2014 gross palm oil exports (IDR 115 trillion) and the value added from the country’s entire 2014
 palm oil production (IDR 168 trillion).1 While not all fires are set to clear land for oil palm, oil palm – an important and
 growing sector of the economy – is a large driver of land conversion. Given government support for its continued
 expansion,2 coupled with the negative externalities of use of fire in some oil palm production, a consideration of the
 relative costs of both is warranted.
 Indonesia has a mandatory certification scheme – the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil Initiative (ISPO) – governing oil
 palm production on plantations greater than 25 hectares that promotes sustainably-produced oil palm. In addition, most
 large companies subscribe to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) – a voluntary certification scheme
 globally accepted as the mark of sustainability. In addition, the Indonesia Palm Oil Pledge (IPOP) is a platform where
 participating companies pledge to produce and trade only deforestation-free oil palm within their supply chains. This
 means not sourcing palm oil produced on peat or old shrub lands or from areas that were once primary or secondary
 forests. Traceability is a key element of the IPOP commitment as it mandates that the palm fruit produced or traded is
 consistent with deforestation-free and sustainable agriculture practices. Given that IPOP members represent 60-65% of
 Indonesia’s (2013) 33 million tons of annual crude palm oil production, commitment to such standards implies a
 significant part of Indonesian production should be deforestation-free. However, there are technical challenges to
 ensuring the IPOP pledge is met. Specifically, government has expressed concern that some producers, namely
 smallholders, may not be able to comply and have pushed for these producers to be exempted. Monitoring is impeded,
 in part, by the absence of a transparent, agreed-upon map of sensitive areas that are off-limits to development.
 Several steps could make certification schemes and pledges more robust, leading to more sustainable production
 practices. On the policy side, a government regulation for peatland protection, restoration, and management, including
 a roadmap for transitioning people and production off of sensitive peatland areas, should be formalized and enforced.
 Technical follow-up is also needed. Specifically, given that some certification standards, including the RSPO, call for the
 protection of lands with high conservation value and/or high carbon stock, a government-led, publically-consulted
 inventory– including on peatlands – would provide a single set of data to inform a baseline upon which policy and
 investment decisions could be made. Additionally, monitoring and implementation of responsible production standards
 would be strengthened considerably with the finalization of the OneMap initiative, which aims to integrate relevant
 land-use and boundary data into a single, publically-available database for Indonesia. Such a map could help guide
 investment decisions by demarcating forest from non-forest lands. Data could also be integrated to include additional

Few gain, many lose           Fire has long been a tool for agriculture in Indonesia. Informally, it also plays an
from repeated fire            important role in land acquisition. This means that, while many suffer extensive fire
and haze events               and haze-related losses, there are a few who make significant gains. This article
                              looks at this winner-loser dynamic, estimating the economic losses and damages
                              associated with fire and haze in 2015 from eight provinces and relating these to

Fire is a cheap way           Indonesia’s fire story is not just one of loss and damage; fires contribute to
to clear land for             significant economic upside for a diverse, if concentrated, group of actors. Fire is an
agriculture…                  integral part of the process of large-scale conversion of the nation’s rich forest
                              assets, particularly peatlands, into agricultural lands for private benefit. The growth
                              in the prevalence of fire correlates with the expansion of lucrative agricultural
                              commodities such as palm oil and acacia for wood fiber. Land conversion by fire is
                              prohibited by Law No. 32/2009 and penalties include fines and prison terms. Yet,
                              the alternative of mechanical clearing with heavy equipment can be many times
                              more expensive.20

…and an effective             There are three common uses for fire in Indonesia: (i) land clearing and preparation;
tool for land                 (ii) land acquisition; and (iii) as a mechanism to force inhabitants off the land. As a
acquisition                   tool for acquisition, landholders burn beyond their concession boundaries or those
                              with no formal claim to the land burn land and then claim it. Without effective
                              enforcement there is no control; and, given the profitability of crops such as oil
                              palm, there is a strong incentive to continue the practice.

The cashflow                  Analysis by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) provides an
generated in just             example of the role of fire in the lucrative palm oil industry. Looking at 11 sites
three years on one            outside of concessioned plantations across 4 districts in Riau, CIFOR concluded
hectare of low-               that using fire for land acquisition and clearing generates a cashflow of at least USD
productivity oil palm         3,077 per hectare of oil palm in just three years.21 While the production process
is about USD 3,000            involves illegal means for land clearing, the resulting palm oil is processed at the
                              same facilities as legally-produced palm fruit before both types are sold for
                              consumption. If every hectare burned in 2015 were converted to oil palm, the value
                              would be about USD 8 billion, highlighting the scope for high profit in a short
                              period of time. Poor land management and governance allow this ecologically-
                              destructive activity to continue. Peatlands are a target as they are generally
                              uninhabited and relatively free of overlapping claims.

pervasive fires               percent), tree cutters (3 percent), slashers (3 percent) and burners (1 percent), and
                              the oil palm farmer (5 percent). Without alternative commensurate economic
                              opportunities, it is no surprise oil palm plantation expansion (especially on peat)
                              continues. However, the rapid expansion also incurs negative impacts that carry
                              domestic, as well as regional and global losses, affecting far more people than the
                              relatively few who benefit.
Box 3: Peat fires have significant consequences for climate change
 Calculating the GHG emissions from Indonesia’s fires is difficult and hinges primarily on quantifying the amount and
 depth of peatlands burned. While all fires produce GHG emissions, the CO2 emissions from fire are usually balanced
 by regrowth after the fire. However, this is not the case for peat fires because they burn carbon that has been deposited
 over thousands of years and cannot be replaced. Peatlands have long been a target for land conversion – draining
 seemingly unproductive swamp land and then clearing it with fire for agriculture. Dry peatland is quick to burn and
 difficult to extinguish.
 Most peat is found on Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Papua but there is no agreed map nor a complete baseline of peatland
 areas. Allowing drainage and burning of peatlands has significant, even global, consequences for climate change, as well
 as on health and the economy in Indonesia and the region. In addition to contributing significantly to GHG emissions,
 peat fires also produce haze due to their high content of aerosols.
 The Global Fire Emissions Database version 4 (GFED4) provides a best, if uncertain, estimate of the GHG emissions
 impact of the 2015 fires by extending estimates of earlier years based on satellite-derived burned area and fuel
 consumption with satellite detections of active fires.1 GFED estimates that in 2015 Indonesian fires contributed
 roughly 1,750 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e) to global emissions in 2015. By comparison,
 based on its 2nd National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,
 Indonesia estimates that its annual economy-wide emissions are 1,800 MtCO2e. Indonesia has pledged to reduce
 emissions by 29 percent (or 41 percent with international financial support) compared with a business-as-usual scenario
 by 2030 as part of its contribution to keep global temperatures from exceeding 2 degrees Celsius. Fires like those in
 2015 will make reaching this target impossible.

Fire and haze are             According to the estimates, fire and haze have resulted in damage and loss values

                              companies and small-holder farmers. Costs to food crops (IDR 23.7 trillion)
                              translate into lower incomes for farmers and possible impacts on food security.
                              Forestry losses of IDR 54 trillion include the lost value of timber and the cost of
                              reforestation.

… as well as               Haze also forced school closures for up to 34 days, resulting in IDR 540 billion in
prolonged school           costs.30 In some instances, schools closed for weeks at a time, obliging teachers to
closures                   accommodate take-home assignments. Conditions were worst in October,
                           impacting 24,773 schools and 4,692,537 students. Child-care costs and foregone
                           wages increase when parents must care for children normally in school; these costs
                           are not included in the World Bank assessment. Long-term, sustained school
                           closures could contribute to weaker graduation rates if reclaiming lost school days
                           becomes burdensome.
Box 4: Other costs – the unknown cumulative impact of fire and haze on flora and fauna
 The full impact of Indonesia’s systemic fire and haze on flora and fauna is unknown. Fire destroys natural genetic
 variability, which helps species adapt resistance to parasites and infectious diseases. Burning biomass produces the
 precursors of ground-level (tropospheric) ozone (O3), which impacts plant growth and photosynthesis and leads to
 long-term effects on ecosystem structure and function. O3 has been shown to reduce yields of major food crops and to
 affect the nutritional quality of wheat, rice, and soybean. It can also reduce the capacity of land to act as a carbon sink.
 The particulate matter in haze has also been shown to reduce local rainfall, which could in turn impact recently planted
 crops.
 Sustained exposure to haze could also lead to the “volcano effect”, i.e., a decrease in plant productivity in the short
 term due to limited sun exposure and a deleterious effect on plant physiology and photosynthesis. In the longer term, it
 could lead to an overall weakening in the ability of plant species to recover from shocks as a result of cumulative
 exposure to stress. In extreme cases, haze exposure could affect a species’ ability to survive. Fire and haze also
 negatively affect pollinators, in turn affecting agricultural production. Chronic exposure to haze creates a sustained
 environment of stress, the impacts of which – on productivity and evolution – are unknown.
 The recurring nature of Indonesia’s fire crisis is of particular concern. While species can adapt, adaptations may not
 always be beneficial or possible. Fire wipes out living soil organisms, requiring years before pioneer species can
 recolonize. More concerning, however, is that long-term environmental stress will eventually lead to a tipping point,
 after which ecosystems will be altered irreversibly. How or when ecosystems will change is not known but the impact
 of this process could extend beyond Indonesia.


                      c. The case for peatland moratorium and restoration

A moratorium on            On October 23, 2015, President Widodo called for a moratorium on new peatland
new peatland               concessions and a cancellation of existing concessions that have not been
concessions, coupled       developed, thereby halting the legal conversion of peatland and peat swamp forests
with peatland              into agricultural land. He also called for peatland restoration, including re-wetting
management and             priority areas. This should be accompanied by efforts to conserve remaining peat
restoration, is            swamp forests and to stop drainage in areas of deep peat or high biodiversity. Fewer
necessary…                 fires on peat will reduce haze, which in turn will reduce the economic and
                           environmental costs.

… but short-term           The following back-of-the-envelope calculations for the two provinces that will be
impacts to revenue         most impacted – Riau and Central Kalimantan (which together have 151,471
need to be                 hectares of peatland) – could help better understand the cost of a moratorium. A
considered                 moratorium includes two primary costs: (i) lost tax and fee revenue to local and
                           national government, and (ii) a reduction in land value for concession holders. The
                           estimated loss in annual revenue to local governments (but not the central
                           government) in Riau and Central Kalimantan would amount to about IDR 2.0
                           trillion (USD 154 million) and IDR 1.2 trillion (USD 92 million), respectively. To
                           accommodate the lost land value, the moratorium could be accompanied by a
                           concession buy-back, land substitution offer, or a combination of both. At IDR 135

                      2. Realizing the potential of the Village Law
The Village Law has              Enacted in early 2014, Law 6 of 2014 (Village Law) establishes a new institutional

address rural                    The law increases the authority and responsibility of villages, while recognizing
inequality in                    traditional village government arrangements (adat). Rural areas have consistently
Indonesia                        higher rates of poverty (14.7 percent compared to 8.3 percent in urban areas),
                                 connectivity is poor, and the quality of basic services is consistently lower than in
                                 urban areas. With an average population of 2,500, villages are better connected to
                                 citizens compared to rural districts (kabupaten), which govern an average population
                                 of almost half a million. While villages are not a substitute for the delivery of
                                 effective services from district governments, they can strengthen the demand for
                                 basic services and ensure that they respond to village residents’ needs. Indonesia has
                                 an established track record of successfully delivering small scale infrastructure at the
                                 sub-district level (kecamatan), with strong community involvement, through the
                                 National Program for Community Empowerment (Program Nasional Pemberdayaan
                                 Masyarakat Mandiri, PNPM Mandiri), which was progressively rolled out to 67,100
                                 villages between 2007 and 2014.

The Village Law                  Under the Village Law, fiscal transfers to villages are substantially increased
substantially                    compared with previous years. At full implementation in 2017, an average-sized

                                 full required level over three years (Table 10), but the district allocation is expected
                                 to be financed in full from 2015. Even for 2016, transfers to villages are comparable
                                 in size to the conditional capital grants to districts (Dana Alokasi Khusus, DAK),

term                           infrastructure gaps (Figure 21) and can focus initially on filling those. In areas that
                               are better developed, villages should be encouraged to allocate funds to support
                               health and education service delivery in ways that are appropriate for their scale and
                               capacity. Given the size of village transfers, ensuring they are well used is crucial.

equitable access to            90 percent allocated on the basis of equal village shares (bagi rata). Under the equal
services by village            share component, each village receives the same amount, regardless of the
residents                      population it serves. The objective of the formula revision appears to be honoring
                               the electoral commitment to provide IDR 1 billion (satu milyar) to each village, and
                               to ensure that populous Java does not benefit unduly from a transfer that is
                               intended to address underdevelopment. However, Indonesian villages vary greatly in
                               size and treating them equally results in a significant variation in their capacity to
                               deliver services.

Although the costs of          Differences in the cost of service delivery between locations are largely driven by
delivering services            three factors, the most important of which is population size. For example, early

mainly by population           separate classroom and teacher are needed for every 40 students. So do the costs of

                               child). Two other factors drive the variable costs of service delivery: remoteness
                               (because of additional transport costs) and the number of poor people (because they
                               are more likely to rely on public services rather than pay for private services).

 Box 5: Assessing the equity of Dana Desa allocations by comparing two villages
 The impact of the 90/10 formula on the capacity of villages to deliver services is illustrated by comparing the resources
 available to two villages in different parts of Indonesia. Birang village is located in the relatively well-off district of
 Berau in East Kalimantan. The village of Senaru is in the underdeveloped district of North Lombok in the province of
 West Nusa Tenggara.
                                                                                  Village                                    Birang       Senaru

                                                                                  District poverty rate (percent)                4.8        35.9

                                                                                  Population                                    286        6,350

                                                                                                                               266.5         328.0

 than 20 people that are classified as poor.



                            33 Because information on the geographic difficulty index and poverty are not publicly available at the village level, it
                              is not possible to simulate the exact amount of DD allocations. Therefore, the analysis is based on the 90 percent
                              of DD that is distributed using the equal share component.
                            34 Districts have some discretion over the formula for distributing the district allocations to villages. Many districts

                              have chosen to apply a weighting of 60 percent or more to equal shares. Given that total transfers to villages are
                              currently dominated by the district allocation, this has a slightly equalizing effect on overall distributions. As the
                              amount of DD increases to the full required level, which will exceed the district allocation, the inequality between
                              villages will increase.
                            35 Non-fiscal factors contribute to poor service delivery, but the absence of funding is a critical constraint.

  C. Indonesia 2016 and beyond: a selective look




              1. The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement: opportunity or threat for
                 Indonesia?
Twelve Pacific Rim     In October twelve Pacific Rim economies (Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada,
countries have         Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, United States, and
signed a new trade     Vietnam) reached an agreement to strike the largest trade pact in two decades, the
agreement covering     Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). When implemented, the TPP will cover some 40
40 percent of the      percent of the global economy, over 30 percent of global merchandise trade, and
global economy         should create a new Pacific economic bloc with reduced barriers to the trade of
                       goods and services.36 Tariffs between members on the vast majority of goods will be
                       eliminated either immediately or after a transition period. The agreement also aims
                       to reduce non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and to restrict members’ ability to impose new
                       NTBs in the future. Like other trade agreements, the TPP contains general
                       provisions which apply to all members and specific provisions which apply to
                       individual countries. The latter are typically in the form of exceptions to the general
                       rules to allow countries to adjust to the agreement and maintain autonomy in areas
                       of particular domestic interest.
The agreement is far   The 30 chapters of the agreement cover a host of areas well beyond merchandise
reaching in scope,     trade, such as investments, cross-border services trade, temporary entry of business
regulating many        persons, government procurement, state-owned enterprises, intellectual property,
areas beyond trade     competition, e-commerce, labor, the environment and regulatory coherence. Many
                       of these areas have either been left outside the scope of World Trade Organization
                       (WTO) negotiations (“WTO extra” measures) or have been difficult to fully resolve
                       in the broader multilateral trading system (“WTO plus” measures). The aim of the
                       agreement is to further liberalize most of these areas so as to promote foreign
                       investments, trade in services, competition and cooperation between member
                       countries.

                       36As it allows for membership expansion, the TPP may well cover a larger share of the global economy in the
                        future.

manufacturing…                 although that share has been slightly declining in recent years (Figure 24), partly due
                               to higher commodity exports to China. The TPP bloc is even more important for
                               Indonesian manufacturing exports, although again the TPP share in these exports
                               has been stagnant or declining in recent years (Figure 25). On the other hand, the
                               share of manufacturing exports to TPP members in total merchandise exports has
                               been rising since 2011, highlighting the importance of these markets for Indonesia’s

                              of the applied rates are zero and there are only a handful of sectors in which

                        requirements, and access to government procurement. These factors may increase
                        foreign investors’ appetite towards TPP markets, thus inducing foreign investment
                        re-allocation away from third countries, including Indonesia, to TPP members. This
                        could provide further impetus for Indonesia to accelerate the implementation of the
                        ASEAN foreign investment protection agreement.
                     b. Joining the TPP will influence Indonesian economic policy-making

TPP membership is       Joining the TPP could potentially imply important regulatory changes in several
likely to influence     areas of the economy for a country like Indonesia. The spirit of the agreement is to
policy-making           make the member countries’ regulations less discriminatory vis-à-vis the other
beyond merchandise      members. Beyond the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers for merchandise
trade…                  trade, a key objective of the agreement is the equal treatment of foreign investors
                        and services providers with domestic competitors. In principle this could translate
                        into regulation that ensures that sectors be fully open to investors from TPP
                        countries; governments not favor domestic companies at the expenses of foreign
                        ones through procurement or – in the case of state-owned enterprises - through
                        non-commercial assistance; foreign investors not be subject to special performance
                        requirements, such as local content in production, minimum level or percent of
                        exports and technological transfer; temporary entry of business persons be
                        facilitated; and competition policy be transparent and non-discriminatory. The TPP
                        affects domestic legislation in other ways as well, including requiring minimum
                        periods of protection for patents and trademarks along with strong enforcement
                        mechanisms; promoting internationally recognized labor rights; and combatting the
                        illegal trade in wild fauna and flora.

…afforded by an         All of these measures are underpinned by an extra-territorial enforcement
extra-territorial       mechanism in the form of a Dispute Settlement Institution which allows members
dispute settlement      to address disputes between themselves over TPP implementation. To maximize
mechanism…              compliance, the Dispute Settlement chapter allows for the use of trade retaliation
                        (e.g., suspension of benefits), if a Party found not to have complied with its
                        obligations fails to become compliant. While such a mechanism is relatively new for
                        FTAs, it is quite common in bilateral investment treaties (BITs). In fact, foreign
                        investments in Indonesia from countries which are signatories of a BIT with
                        Indonesia can already resort to an international investor–state dispute settlement
                        mechanism if the investor believes that the treaty has been violated.39

… although              The extent to which the TPP measures may lead to changes in a country’s existing
implementation          laws and regulations depends on the will of the member country to liberalize, as well
flexibility may limit   as on the willingness of the other members to make concessions. In fact, the text of

regulations             existing domestic regulations (“non-conforming measures”) specified by members
                        in their section of the agreement. For example, Indonesia could have the option,
                        subject to the other parties’ agreement, to continue discriminating against foreign
                        investments in any of the sectors restricted in the country’s negative investment list
                        in force at the time of its eventual joining of the TPP. There are hundreds of pages
                        of such exceptions in the countries’ TPP schedules: for example, Malaysia
                        maintaining a limit of 49 percent on foreign ownership of motor vehicle production,
                        or Vietnam requiring foreign firms that win government contracts to use local labor

                        and materials. The level of flexibility, however, differs and the chapters on
                        intellectual property, state-owned enterprises and government procurement allow
                        for more limited exceptions. Those are some of the areas in which Indonesia may
                        need to implement more sweeping changes in case of joining. However, to the
                        extent that the decision to join the TPP is predicated on the desire to integrate with
                        a large trading bloc, the utilization of such implementation flexibility may well be
                        only temporary.

                        This limitation could be
                        particularly important for
                        Indonesia, which is the
