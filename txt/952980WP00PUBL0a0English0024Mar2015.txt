KEY LESSONS
Although farmers are cognizant of the potential risk of irrigating
with reused water, they do not have enough specific knowledge
about either the advantages or problems associated with using
wastewater to irrigate food products. As a result, the protection
measures they take are limited, although they report frequent use
of some types of protection. Almost 60 percent of the respondents
recognize risks and problems for health, citing primarily the strong
likelihood of rheumatic, lung, gastrointestinal, and skin diseases,
and to a lesser extent, diseases affecting their livestock. This,
however, still leaves a sizable portion of the community unfamiliar
with the risks.
Farmers in the region support water reuse schemes and are willing
to contribute to their success, but their contributfons would likely
not result much of a contribution to the construction or sustai-
nability of reuse infrastructure. The sector authorities who were
interviewed recognize that there are no criteria for setting rates
for reuse of wastewater, and payments or contributions in kind
or in labor for irrigation systems are not recognized as rates but
rather as contributions for repairs and corrective maintenance. In
the 12 municipalities that participated in the initial focus group

IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS
As noted, the informal use of wastewater for agricultural irrigation
is standard practice in Bolivia. This informal reuse often occurs
downstream of outfalls of wastewater that is untreated (La Paz) or
insufficiently treated (Puchukollo) to achieve acceptable risk levels
for the health of farmers and consumers.
Reducing health risks by increasing treatment coverage and im-
proving the performance of existing plants, while necessary, entails
large investments in rehabilitation and new construction and thus
lengthy implementation times. For this reason, and to contain the
risks inherent in consuming farm products that are already being
irrigated with wastewater, other complementary measures with
short- and medium-term impacts must be adopted in parallel,
such as those proposed by WHO.
An economic rationality principle would offer solutions under a
multibarrier approach, as proposed by WHO in its 2006 guidelines.
This approach would bring about the same degree of reduction in
health risks associated with reuse based on treatment requirements
that are less demanding and thus entail lower investment costs
than wholesale infrastructure construction. WHO proposes the
adoption of measures such as crop restrictions; use of irrigation
techniques that minimize contamination; introduction of mi-
nimum waiting periods between last irrigation and harvest;
promotion of hygienic food preparation practices; education on
