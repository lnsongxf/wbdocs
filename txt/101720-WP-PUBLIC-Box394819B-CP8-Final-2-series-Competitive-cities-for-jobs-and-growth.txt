This table is a product of a literature review, and reflects author’s interpretations of different approaches to LED strategy.

A checklist for a good city strategy
The findings of this chapter can be summarized as a checklist of 12 key elements that city strategies in devel­
oping-world cities should aim to include. While these principles are mostly intuitive, they offer a good first-level filter for
evaluating the quality of strategic documents. We group them as follows:

Concluding remarks: Improving Strategic Planning for Cities
LED, CDS and other methodologies have become widely used in developed and developing countries for strategic-planning exer-
cises. Evidence collected in this paper shows that, while the use of these approaches has been beneficial for cities, there are gaps
that need to be addressed by donors and development partners to make them more efficient.
