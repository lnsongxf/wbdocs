Data Collection Instrument Introduction
What is the purpose of this initiative?

The aim of the SABER-School Finance initiative is to collect, analyze and disseminate comparable
data about education finance systems across countries. SABER-School Finance assesses
education finance systems along six Policy Goals: (i) Ensuring basic conditions for learning; (ii)
Monitoring learning conditions and outcomes; (iii) Overseeing service delivery; (iv) Budgeting
with adequate and transparent information; (v) Providing more resources to students who need
them; and (vi) Managing resources efficiently. SABER-School Finance will document how
education is financed by national, subnational, local governments, and schools.

Your participation is important and valued. Below are answers to some general questions you
may have about this data collection instrument.

Who is leading this initiative?

The SABER-School Finance initiative is part of the Systems Approach for Better Education Results
(SABER) program led by the Education Unit of the Human Development Department at The
World Bank.

Why should you participate in this data collection instrument?

Policymakers, implementers, educational leaders and researchers will have access to the data
collected by this initiative. This will enable users to make their own diagnoses of the state of
education finance in their countries, learn about other countries’ policies, and make informed
decisions to promote effective education finance systems in their country.

Will your responses be kept confidential?

Yes. Individually identifiable responses and data will not be reported.

How will your information be reported?

The information you provide will be combined with information provided by others. It will then
be disseminated through a user-friendly website, accessible to the general public.

We hope you will participate in this initiative.

Instructions

The data collection instrument consists of 197 questions that collect information regarding the
generation, availability, use, and allocation of education resources. The data will help to assess
how well education finance systems meet six widely shared goals: (i) Ensuring basic conditions
for learning; (ii) Monitoring learning conditions and outcomes; (iii) Overseeing service delivery;
(iv) Budgeting with adequate and transparent information; (v) Providing more resources to
students who need them; and (vi) Managing resources efficiently. To facilitate consistent
responses across key informants, a few aspects of the data collection instrument should be
highlighted:
1. Please begin your interviews by reading or explaining the Data Collection Instrument
     Introduction in the previous section.
2. Please answer every question. At the close of this data collection instrument, there is a
     section to list any questions for which you could not determine an answer. If you absolutely
     cannot answer a question, leave it blank and then make a note of it at the close of the data
     collection instrument.
3. Collect quality data that are comparable across countries.
     x Glossary: Terms that are included in the Glossary have been underlined in the text.
         Please refer to the glossary at the end of the data collection instrument to be sure that
         you are collecting the correct information.
     x Primary and secondary education: Some information will be requested by school level
         (primary or secondary). SABER-School Finance does not collect information at the Early
         Childhood Development or tertiary levels.
     x Local currency: Expenditure information will be requested in monetary values.
         Denomination in local currency is preferable, but please provide information to the best
         of your ability. Unless otherwise noted in the initial section, it will be assumed that
         amounts are in current values of the year for which data are reported.
4. As requested, please provide information to support your responses.
     x Sources: Many responses require you to cite a source, which may be an interview or
         document. If a document is required, please cite and submit the specific document
         from which the data were collected.
     x Explanation of response: Responses ask that you provide a written explanation of your
         response with supporting details to accompany the data. Please share additional
         information if necessary.
     x Year of reported data: Many responses require a year of reference for the information
         provided. Please indicate the year for which data are reported. Unless a specific year of
         reference for the information is requested, please provide responses that are relevant
         for the most recent year available. Please indicate the primary year of reference and
         make note of any data that refer to different years (if not already specified in the
         response) in the Unanswered Questions/Clarifications section.

1. School Conditions and Resources Survey
The school represents the point at which educational resources are ultimately used to
improve learning outcomes. School finance systems are therefore interested in the extent to
which schools provide an adequate environment conducive to learning. This school conditions
and resources survey requests information about the school system, policies to provide basic
conditions, systems to monitor basic conditions, performance goals, student assessments, and
other topics.

2. Allocation Mechanisms Survey
The education budget is the government’s plan for allocating public resources to achieve
educational goals and objectives. Every school finance system has rules that determine the
size of the budget, distribution of resources across levels of government and schools, and in
some cases, the composition of spending toward particular resources, among other aspects.
This allocation mechanisms survey requests information on methods to determine the budget,
transfer mechanisms, allocations for disadvantaged students, and other topics.

3. Revenue Sources Survey
The stakeholders responsible for generating revenue to finance education vary by system.
Much of government funding for public services is raised through taxation—property, income,
and sales taxes. Education systems may also rely on international donors or the private
sector, including households, as additional funding sources. This revenue sources survey
requests information on public funding sources, school fees, and other topics.

4. Fiscal Control and Capacity Survey
A crucial area for understanding school finance systems is the fiscal control mechanisms used
to plan, monitor, and execute the education budget. Fiscal controls in school finance may
include budget execution reviews, reporting requirements, internal and external audits, public
information on school budgets, and enforcement mechanisms. This fiscal control and capacity
survey requests information on expenditure reporting, teacher attendance monitoring,
auditing procedures, school construction procurement, and other topics.

Countries invest very different levels of resources in education, independent of their income.
Education expenditure can differ by the amount that is spent in aggregate and per-student
terms, the actors that execute education expenditure at various government levels and in the
private sector, and the composition of education spending toward particular resources,
among others. This education spending survey requests information on the nature of
spending by the national, subnational, and local governments.

Glossary
Allocation: The process of dividing up and distributing available, limited resources to alternative
     uses that satisfy educational objectives and needs.
Audit: A formal examination of an organization’s (such as a school) accounts to check accuracy.
     Audits can be internal or external.
     Internal audits: Provide regular feedback to education authorities on management of funds.
         These reports should address reliability and integrity of financial and operational
         information; effectiveness and efficiency of operations; safeguarding of assets; and
         compliance with laws, regulations, and contracts. Internal audits may be completed by
         education authorities themselves or by a third party government entity.
     External audits: Verify whether resources have been used for their intended purposes.
Budget: A comprehensive plan of what will be spent for various programs during a fiscal year.
     Types of budgeting systems
     Formula: Funding formulas allocate education resources based on calculations with
         predetermined components (such as student headcount, number of students below the
         poverty line, weights, etc.).
     Incremental increase: Incremental budgeting allocates the budget based on the previous
         period's budget, and often contains an increase for inflation or other known changes in
         operations or conditions.
     Line item: This type of budgeting system allows greater control over expenditures. It is
         highly detailed and expresses each kind and quantity of expenditures and revenues as a
         single item on one line of the budget.
     Negotiations: In this type of budgeting, budgets are suggested by multiple parties, and the
         final budget is allocated after discussion or debate.
     Performance-based: In this type of budgeting, funds are allocated based on whether certain
         established goals and objectives (often related to student outcomes) have been met.
     Program-based: This method of budgeting is based on a program framework that uses
         specific costs associated with programs to drive budget setting.
     Project-based: In this type of budgeting, funds are allocated for a particular project, such as
         the construction of a school.
     Types of budgets
     Capital budget: A budget for assets that last longer than one year, or expenditure that is
         more than a certain amount (such as $1000).
     Current budget: A budget for goods and services consumed within the current year and
         which would be renewed if necessary in the following year.
Civil servant teacher: Persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and
     direct the learning experience of pupils and students, irrespective of their qualifications or
     the delivery mechanism, i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. Teachers are considered civil
     servants if they are hired by the government (national, subnational, or local) under a specific
     labor code for government employees. In many cases, civil servants enjoy benefits such as
     paid leave, pension or health insurance that are required by public-sector employment laws.


                                                                                                 63
Constant values: The expression of expenditure values in constant prices of a base period (real
    values).
Completion rate: The completion rate is the total number of new entrants in the last grade of
    primary (or secondary) education, regardless of age, expressed as percentage of the total
    population of the theoretical entrance age to the last grade of primary (or secondary). The
    ratio can exceed 100% due to over-aged and under-aged children who enter primary school
    late/early and/or repeat grades.
Current values: The expression of expenditure values in current prices of the reporting period.
    Unlike constant values, current values are not adjusted for a base period.
Dedicated sources: Public funds that are raised or directed for specific purposes.
Differentiated spending: Spending that is allocated separately for special purposes, such as to
    support learning conditions for students with special needs.
Differentiated payment scale: Adjustment of compulsory charges related to education for
    certain student populations (usually disadvantaged) to reduce cost of schooling.
Director: A school’s administrative head (also headmaster or principal).
Effective school days: Days for which school is actually in session, and therefore different from
    the number of official school days in a year, which may be due to events such as strikes,
    natural disasters, holidays, or other causes.
Enrollment rate: The enrollment rate shows the extent of coverage in a given level of education
    to children and youth. The enrollment rate can be calculated as gross or net. Gross
    enrollment is the number of pupils or students enrolled in a given level of education,
    regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population in the theoretical age group
    for the same level of education. Net enrollment is the total number of pupils or students in
    the theoretical age group for a given level of education enrolled in that level, expressed as a
    percentage of the total population in that age group.
Ethnicity: A group of people thought to have a common ancestry who share a distinctive
    culture.
Expenditure: The act of spending financial resources for specific purposes.
Capital expenditure: Expenditure for assets that last longer than one year. It includes
    expenditure for construction, renovation and major repairs of buildings and the purchase of
    heavy equipment or vehicles.
Current expenditure: Expenditure for goods and services consumed within the current year and
    which would be renewed if necessary in the following year. It includes expenditure on staff
    salaries, pensions, and benefits; contracted or purchased services; other resources,
    including books and teaching materials; welfare services; and other current expenditure,
    such as subsidies for students and households, minor equipment, minor repairs, fuel,
    telecommunications, travel, insurance, and rents.
Expenditure by level: Expenditure on education by level of education (primary or secondary).
    Private expenditure on education: Expenditure on education by households, private firms
         or business enterprises, or non-profit making organizations (including religious
         organizations) which, although their principal activity may be non-educational, might
         finance activities in the domain of education.

                                                                                                64
    Public expenditure on education: Expenditure on education and education administration
        made by local, regional and national/central governments, including municipalities.
        Household contributions are excluded.
Earmarked funds: Earmarked funds are required to be spent on education.
Formula: Funding formulas allocate education resources based on calculations with
    predetermined components (such as student headcount, number of students below the
    poverty line, weights, etc.).
Functional hygienic facilities: Facilities and systems for dealing with human excreta: disposal,
    collection, treatment, transfer and re-use in whatever form. Functional hygiene refers to the
    secure and effective management of human excreta, including treatment and re-use, and
    widespread usage of safe toilets. 1
Intergovernmental transfers: Transfers of funds from one level of government to another,
    which may or not be designated for education.
International actor: Non-domestic influences on education, such as a multilateral organization,
    international non-governmental organization, or other government. International actors
    contribute to revenue sources in the form of both grants and loans.
ISCED levels: A classification system that provides a framework for the comprehensive statistical
    description of national educational systems and a methodology that translates national
    educational programs into internationally comparable levels of education. The basic unit of
    classification in ISCED is the educational program. ISCED also classifies programs by field of
    study, program orientation and destination. (UIS - Global Education Digest 2004)
    ISCED 3 (Upper secondary education): This level of education typically begins at the end of
        full-time compulsory education for those countries that have a system of compulsory
        education. More specialization may be observed at this level than at ISCED level 2 and
        often teachers need to be more qualified or specialized. The entrance age to this level is
        typically 15 or 16 years.
    ISCED 4 (Post-secondary non tertiary education): Programs that lie between the upper-
        secondary and tertiary levels of education from an international point of view, even
        though they might clearly be considered as upper-secondary or tertiary programs in a
        national context. They are often not significantly more advanced than programs at
        ISCED 3 (upper secondary) but they serve to broaden the knowledge of participants who
        have already completed a program at level 3. The students are usually older than those
        at level 3. ISCED 4 programs typically last between six months and two years.
    ISCED 4A: Programs that prepare for entry to ISCED 5.
    ISCED 4B: Programs not giving access to level 5 (primarily designed for direct labor market
        entry).
    ISCED 5 (First stage of tertiary education): This level consists of tertiary programs having an
        educational content more advanced than those offered at levels 3 and 4. Entry to these
        programs normally requires the successful completion of ISCED level 3A or 3B or a
        similar qualification at ISCED level 4A.

                                                                                                65
    ISCED 5A: Tertiary programs that are largely theoretically based and are intended to provide
        sufficient qualifications for gaining entry into advanced research programs and
        profession with high skills requirements.
    ISCED 5B: Tertiary programs that are practically oriented/occupationally specific and are
        mainly designed for participants to acquire the practical skills, and know-how needed
        for employment in a particular occupation or trade or class of occupations or trades -
        the successful completion of which usually provides the participants with a labor-market
        relevant qualification.
    ISCED 6 (Second stage of tertiary education): This level is reserved for tertiary programs
        which lead to the award of an advanced research qualification. The programs are
        therefore devoted to advanced study and original research and are not based on course-
        work only.
Large-scale student achievement assessment: Designed to describe the achievement of
    students in a curriculum area aggregated to provide an estimate of the achievement level in
    the education system as a whole at a particular age or grade level. It provides data for a type
    of system-level education audit carried out to inform policy makers about key aspects of the
    system. Normally, it involves administration of achievement tests either to a sample or to a
    population of students, usually focusing on a particular sector in the system. Teachers and
    others may be asked to provide background information, usually in questionnaires.
Level of government: Division of government with jurisdiction over certain administrative or
    geographical areas (national, subnational, and local).
    National: The entire nation or country.
    Subnational: The administrative level immediately below the national level – for example,
        subnational divisions are considered states in India, Mexico and the U.S.; provinces in
        Argentina, Indonesia, Thailand and Finland; regions in France; and zones in Nepal.
    Local: All administrative divisions that fall under the sub-national level. It might include, for
        example, municipalities, communes, counties, districts and/or villages.
Less competitive methods: In these forms of competition, at least some qualified or
    responsible parties are not eligible to compete for the business of a third party due to
    informal or formal restrictions on bidding.
Library: A physical or digital place that holds books or other materials for reading or study.
Mandatory waiver: An obligatory exemption for certain student populations (usually
    disadvantaged) from compulsory charges related to education.
Native language: The first language spoken in childhood, also called mother tongue.
Non-civil service teachers: This refers to teachers who agree to work outside an employment
    relationship. As such, they receive a salary for the work they do, but have no other benefits
    (such as paid leave, pension or health insurance), such as those that apply under public-
    sector employment laws and those that apply under private-sector employment laws.
Open competition: In this form of competition, all qualified or responsible parties are eligible to
    compete for the business of a third party.
Outturn: Outturn refers to the share of budgeted resources that were spent in the previous
    year.

                                                                                                  66
Own-source revenue: Revenue raised by any level of government. Transfers from a higher level
    of government are excluded.
Parent-Teacher Association: A formal organization composed of parents, teachers and staff
    that is intended to facilitate parental participation in a school
Performance goals: Goals refer to system-wide targets for specific objectives. SABER-School
    Finance considers performance goals to be objectively measurable, government-stipulated
    targets in specific education objectives, such as 90 percent enrollment, higher completion
    rates, or other learning outcomes.
Policy: SABER-School Finance defines a policy as either 1) a law, executive order, decree or
    proclamation; or 2) a publicly available document from a governmental office (e.g. the
    Ministry of Education) interpreting or describing a required action.
Potable water source: Water that is safe to drink, free from pollution, harmful organisms, and
    impurities. The source may include running water, a well, a water pump, or others.
Primary education: The level of education that usually begins at ages 5-7 and lasts for four to
    seven years of schooling. In some countries, it may be called elementary education. It
    typically marks the beginning of systematic studies on reading, writing, and mathematics,
    although children may begin learning basic literacy and numeracy at the pre-primary level.
    (ISCED 1)
Private, government-dependent schools: Schools that are managed by a non-public authority
    (e.g., an individual owner, a corporation, a foundation, a religious organization, etc.) and
    that receive most of their funding from a public authority.
Privately-managed schools: Schools that are managed by a non-public authority (e.g., an
    individual owner, a corporation, a foundation, a religious organization, etc.).
Private sources: Revenue that is generated by non-governmental actors, including households,
    the private sector, and other institutions.
Proficient: Students are considered proficient in an academic subject if they can effectively use
    basic skills that are relevant to that subject at a particular level of education.
Progression rate: The progression or transition rate conveys information on the degree of
    access or transition from one cycle or level of education to a higher one. Viewed from the
    lower cycle or level of education, it is considered as an output indicator, viewed from the
    higher educational cycle or level, it constitutes an indicator of access. The transition rate is
    calculated as the number of students admitted to the first grade of a higher level of
    education in a given year, expressed as a percentage of the number of students enrolled in
    the final grade of the lower level of education in the previous year.
Public revenue: Revenue that is generated by governmental actors.
Public schools: Schools that are managed by a public authority – may be the national,
    subnational, or local government authority.
Restrictions: Legal requirements to use revenue only for specified expenditure purposes.
Revenue: Income received by a level of government or educational institution, which may come
    from funds raised through taxes, fees, or other sources.
Rural: There is wide international variation in how areas are classified as rural. This distinction
    may be defined by the national government, and can include criteria such as distance from

                                                                                                 67
    an urban center, small population size (sometimes less than 5,000 inhabitants), or large
    proportion of the population engaged with agriculture. 2
School board: A committee of elected local officials responsible for overseeing the
    management of education services in a particular community.
School: There is no common international definition for a school. Depending on the context, a
    school may be identified as an educational institution, a cluster of administrative buildings
    regardless of physical location, a specific building, or even a track of study within a particular
    building. Please be consistent with the definition of a school according to standards in the
    country or system of interest.
School census: An official survey involving the whole population within a defined system. For
    example, a school census involves all the schools within the education system. A school
    census presents school-level data in addition to teacher composition and student
    enrollment, including school characteristics such as access to potable water.
School council: A committee comprised of parents and community members, usually with an
    advisory role.
Secondary education (also general secondary education): The level of education that usually
    begins at ages 11-14 and lasts for three to six years of schooling. Secondary education may
    include a lower secondary period followed by an upper secondary period. In some countries,
    these are called middle school and high school, respectively. Although it generally continues
    the basic programs of study of the primary education level, teaching typically becomes more
    subject-focused, often employing more specialized teachers who conduct classes in their
    field(s) of specialization. (ISCED 2 and 3)
Special schools: Schools catering to students who have special educational needs. Students
    who attend these schools generally are not enrolled in mainstream schools.
Special needs: Students with severe learning difficulties, physical disabilities, or behavioral
    problems. This includes learning differences beyond physical or other disabilities to cover a
    wide variety of other reasons that are known to be likely to impede a child’s optimal
    progress, such as dyslexia, autism, or other learning disorders.
Stabilization funds: A special account created to provide a reserve for educational expenditures
    when necessary (i.e. an emergency savings account).
Student-teacher ratio: Average number of students per teacher at a specific level of education
    in a given school year.
Substitute teacher: any teacher hired as a temporary teacher, except for teachers who are
    already employees and are guaranteed a minimum number of hours
Training: Training is considered participation in an activity that is designed to lead to skills
    development, regardless of duration.
Urban: There is wide international variation in how areas are classified as urban. This distinction
    may be defined by the national government, and can include criteria such as a large
    population size (sometimes greater than 100,000 inhabitants for a large city, although cities
