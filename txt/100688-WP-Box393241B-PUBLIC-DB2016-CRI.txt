THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 4,937,755

by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 58

frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 79*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

      Deposit capital in the bank account, pay registration fees and
      stamp duties

      As a prerequisite for registering the company, 25% of the capital stock
      indicated in the incorporation charter (if paid in cash) must be
      deposited in a national bank. The amount deposited may be withdrawn
      once the company has been duly recorded. If founders chose to sign a
      promissory note, there is no enforceable obligation to deposit capital in
      a bank account later. In fact, the business is not even required to
      operate a bank account at any point during its existence.

      Assuming an incorporation date of June 1st, 2015, the registration fees
      are Crc. 353,559 broken down as follows:
      The registration fees are as follows:
      - Stamp duties: Colegio de Abogados, Crc. 10,000; Educación y Cultura,

      - Agrary stamp (timbre agrario): Crc. 68,850.41
      - Legalization of books: Crc. 16,000. Since December 28, 2012, the
      company books can now be registered at the National Registry at the
      time of incorporation . Furthermore, the company's accounting books
      registration is no longer necessary
      - National Archives Stamp Tax : Crc. 20,00

      In addition, a tax needs to be paid at incorporation, which represents
      50% of the amount of the basic wage of an “Office Clerk 1” if paid in
      January. If it is registered later on the year, the amount will be
      proportional to what’s left of the year. Effective as of January 2016, the
      Yearly Tax on Legal Persons was ruled unconstitutional. It will not be
      required to pay the tax upon incorporation and subsequently every year
      thereafter. The obligation to pay the tax remains in effect during 2015.

      differences annually. But the complexity of the process
      discourages its use. Most construction companies purchase
      individual insurance on a case-by-case basis for projects instead
      of globally for annual activities. This system is likely to be
      changed because of private sector complaints.

      Insurance premiums are based on the amount of coverage. The
      cost can range from 4.23% to 5.53% of the coverage amount.
      The completed form must be presented with copies of the
      workers’ identification cards or (for underage employees)
      working permits.

      BuildCo must obtain approval from the National Environment
      Technical Secretary (Secretaría Técnica Nacional del Ambiente,
      SETENA), using two forms (in Spanish) available on SETENA’s
      Web site (www.minae.go.cr /setena.html). BuildCo would use
      Form D-1 which costs anywhere between CRC 1 million to CRC
      1.5 million. The response generally takes 60 -- 90 days. This

      * Request and obtain approval of blue prints by College of
      Architects and Engineers

      BuildCo should submit the property survey map and a contract,
      signed by two members of the College of Architects and
      Engineers: an electrical engineer and either a civil engineer or an
      architect. It is preferred that at least four blueprint copies be

      project value, plus a fixed fee of CRC 1,500.00 for two
      construction log books.

      After the inspection the utility will issue a technical report. The client is

      connection works.
      The design itself is prepared by CNFL -indicating the works and materials
      required. Should the installation of a transformers be required the design
      is prepared by the Section for the Design of Electrical Networks of CNFL.

      issued; if the connection can be done with underground cables, the work
      can be designed by an outside electric engineer, who is registered with
      the Colegio de Ingenieros Electricistas, Mecánicos e Industriales (CFIA). In
      that case, the designs are presented to CNFL for approval. Until they are
      approved and the Engineering Study is issued, no works can be done.

      Hire private company to carry out works in accordance with CNFL's
      plans

      The external connection works have to be done by a firm that has been
      authorized by CNFL to do medium voltage network construction work.
      There are 21 firms with such authorization in the capital city. Once the
      supply contract between the client and the authorized provider has been
      signed, it is filed with CNFL. It takes approximately 3 days to start the
      works and, once supervised, the construction can start. The construction
      cannot start if no initiation date has been determined by the CNFL.

      The internal wiring installation can be done by any electrician hired by
      the client, but it has to be supervised by the engineer responsible for the
      design of the electric installation. CNFL does not conduct any inspections
4     of the internal wiring. The internal wiring installation requires previous   26 calendar days     USD 17,500
      plans approved by an electric engineer authorized by Colegio de
      Ingenieros Electricistas, Mecánicos e Industriales (CFIA) and the works
      have to be supervised by the CFIA or by another electric engineer. No
      certificate of compliance with NEC rules is emitted nor can it be
      requested. The plans approved by CFIA will have to be filed with the
      CNFL by the time the meter installation is requested. Three transformers
      of 50 kVA have to be installed inside the client's private property. The
      client has to pay for them. They can be installed in a post inside the
      private property (it's not allowed to install them in public places) or in a
      transformers vault.

        Receive meter installation and final connection from CNFL

        The client has to request the meter. A donation document for the
        transformers (transferring ownership to the utility) is prepared and
        confirmed that no money is owed by the client. The payments that the
        customer has to make to CNFL have to be done in the Section of Electric
        Networks Design. The payment receipt has to be shown later in the
        office of Engineering Study to be able to go to this step (the Engineering
        Study).
         There is a guarantee deposit that is calculated according to the
        consumption. It represents one month consumption. The minimum
        amount of guarantee for the residential customer is ¢ 15.500, and for
        businesses the minimum amount is ¢ 25.000. This deposit is required for
        all clients requesting a new service. The deposit is refundable and after
        five years it begins to generate interests. It is reimbursed when the client
        terminates the service. The deposit covers the installation of the meter
   5    equipment with its materials. Additionally it covers the operation costs        3 calendar days   CRC 607,948.4
        and the service maintenance.
         Normally CNFL tries to both inspect the works and install the meter at
        the same time. CNFL charges between 2 and 3% of the cost of the works
        only for the reception and the powering. The responsible to pay this fee
        is the client. Therefore, this cost is normally included in the estimation of
        costs sent to the client. If the service requires power transformers or a
        specific meter, they are installed by CNFL without extra costs.
           The installation of the meter is exclusive responsibility of CNFL. The
        internal installation planes approved by the Engineers Association and
        the electrician's certification have to be sent to CNFL before the final
        powering.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
