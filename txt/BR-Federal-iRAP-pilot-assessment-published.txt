1 Executive Summary
As part of efforts to curb road deaths and serious injuries, the World Bank Global Road Safety Facility (GRSF)
invited the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) to work with the National Department of
Transport Infrastructure (Departamento Nacional de Infraestrutura de Transportes, DNIT) to assess the safety
of Brazilian roads. During this second assessment of Brazilian roads, approximately 3,400km of roads were
assessed. This technical report describes the road assessment project and includes details on data collection,
the methodology used and a summary of the results.
The infrastructure-related risk assessment involved detailed surveys and coding of 50 road attributes at 100
metre intervals along the network and creation of Star Ratings, which provide a simple and objective measure
showing the level of risk on the road network. The star ratings show that 1% of road length is rated as 5-star,
9% is rated as 4-star, 58% is rated as 3-star, and the remaining 32% is rated as 2-star and below for vehicle
occupants. For motorcyclists, no roads were rated as 5-star, only 3% of road length is rated as 4-star, 47% is
rated as 3-star, and the remaining 50% is rated 2-star and below. For pedestrians less than 1% is rated as 4-
star and 5-star, 2% is rated as 3-star and the remaining 13% is rated 2-star and below. For bicyclists less than
1% is rated as 5-star or 4-star, 5% is rated as 3-star and the remaining 14% is rated 2-star and below.

Note: the table shows ‘smoothed’ Star Ratings.

The road attribute data show that the vast majority of the survey was conducted on single carriageway roads,
with infrequent physical separation between opposing flows. Roadside hazards are numerous, with over half
of the survey length having hazardous objects within 5m of the running lane and limited road side protection
(such as safety barriers). In locations where safety barriers were present, unprotected safety barrier terminal
ends were identified as the key hazard in almost 750 instances. Provision for vulnerable road users is variable
with limited, bicycle facilities present and often insufficient footpath provision and crossing facilities where
pedestrian numbers are high.
The project also involved the creation of a Safer Roads Investment Plans, which draws on more than 90 proven
road safety treatments, ranging from low cost road markings and pedestrian refuges to higher cost intersection
upgrades and full highway duplication.
The Safer Roads Investment Plan in this report prioritises countermeasures that could maximise the prevention
of deaths and serious injuries within the available budget. The plan largely focuses on:
         reducing the likelihood of vehicles running off the road and reducing the risk associated with run-off
          road crashes by improving shoulders, installing rumble strips and reducing the severity of roadsides,
          and
         providing facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists.

Table 2 below shows that an investment of R$1.71 billion could reduce the number of deaths and serious
injuries on the road by 46%, preventing over 56,000 deaths and serious injuries over 20 years. The overall
benefit cost ratio of this approach would be 7.6:1. The SRIP was produced using a threshold BCR of 3 (that
is, the economic benefit of each countermeasure had to be greater than or equal to 3 times the cost).

The selection of an appropriate level of investment is open for decision by the DNIT. Final implementation of
the plan will preferably include the following steps:
       local examination of proposed countermeasures (including a ‘value engineering’ type workshop
        including all relevant stakeholders),
       detailed analysis of traffic survey and crash data (if available),
       preliminary scheme investigation studies, including site surveys and preliminary design,
       detailed design, star ratings of the designs, road safety audit, detailed costing and procurement, final
        evaluation and construction, and
       post-construction evaluation and road safety audit, including Star Ratings for the upgraded road and
        analysis of crash data (if it is available).
The detailed results of the project and online software that enabled the iRAP analyses to be undertaken are
available to stakeholders for further exploration and use.
However, in order to achieve the best road safety gains on the network, efforts that go beyond the engineering
improvements discussed in this report will be necessary. Significant benefits could be realised through the
coordinated improvement of road user behaviour (such as speeding, seat belt and helmet wearing and driving
under the influence of alcohol or drugs) and vehicles, as well as road infrastructure. The Road Safety Toolkit
(http://toolkit.irap.org) and United Nations Road Safety Collaboration Good Practice Manuals provide further
information on these issues.
The use of star rating targets would provide an objective measure of infrastructure safety and simplify road
safety policy management, communication and accountability. The star rating can be used for network level
targets, corridor and road hierarchy specific performance targets, or linked to maintenance and operational
management of the road asset. Examples include targets for 4-star roads of national significance (New
Zealand), 4-star roads for pedestrians and cyclists in linear settlements (Asian Development Bank) and 90%
of travel on 3-star or better by 2020 (UK).
For newly constructed roads the star rating target can be specified at the planning and design stage (e.g. the
new road shall be 4-star standard for pedestrians and vehicle occupants at the desired operating speed of
60km/h). The improved star rating can also be confirmed prior to opening and the outcome celebrated within
the project team, road agency and the public.
The appropriate star rating target for an individual road network or project will reflect the existing standard of
the road, the strategic purpose of the route and the volume of particular road users, available funding and
political will. In principle targets should seek to maximise deaths and serious injuries saved per unit of
investment and therefore in general higher volume roads will have higher star rating targets. iRAP encourages
the setting of a minimum 3-star performance management goal for new projects and targets linked to vehicle
travel for existing networks.

2 Introduction
Around the world 1.24 million people die as a result of road traffic crashes each year, that’s 3,400 deaths per
day, or one every 25 seconds.1 Although several high income countries are reducing the number of deaths on
their roads, many low and middle-income countries are experiencing an increase in the numbers of fatal and
serious injuries.
With road traffic fatalities now the leading cause of death for young people aged 15 to 29 worldwide and 92%
of road traffic deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries, key partners in global road safety have
come together in an attempt to tackle this rapidly worsening public health crisis through accelerated investment
in road safety and by fundamentally changing the way we design, build and maintain our road infrastructure
networks around the world. As such, the United Nations has declared 2011-2020 the Decade of Action for
Road Safety. It is expected that during the decade, significant efforts will be made to stabilise and then reduce
the death toll through systematic improvements in road infrastructure, road user behaviour and vehicle safety.


2.1 Road safety in Brazil
It is recognised that investment in the transport network plays an important role in a country’s economic
development and poverty reduction. To this end, the Government of Brazil has invested heavily in road building
programmes in recent years in order to improve mobility and reduce journey times2. However, it is of paramount
importance that every opportunity be taken to ensure that these new roads and rehabilitation projects focus
on the need for safe road infrastructure for all road users, particularly the young and vulnerable.
Each year road crashes in Brazil result in unprecedented levels of death and serious injury. The 2009 WHO
Global Status on road safety reported that in 2006 35,155 people were killed in Brazil with an estimated
407,685 seriously injured. In the 2013 WHO Global Status report on road safety official figures showed that
37,594 people were killed in Brazil in 2009. The underreporting of fatalities due to road trauma in Brazil is also
concerning. The World Health Organization estimates that the official figures understate deaths by almost 20%
in Brazil, with a true number of deaths per annum due to road trauma being of 43,8693. This World Bank
estimate equates to 22.5 deaths per 100 000 in Brazil – a figure over 6 times higher than that attributable to
road trauma in the UK.


2.2 The DNIT Road Network
In 2014 the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) was invited by the Global Road Safety Facility
(GRSF), funded with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, to carry out an assessment on the DNIT road
network. The project was designed to assist DNIT assess road infrastructure-related risk on 3,400km of high-
risk roads and identify economically viable road safety countermeasures. The DNIT federal road network
comprises over 55,000km of roads.

2.3 Methodology
The production of Star Ratings and Safer Road Investment Plans involve a number of data collection, survey
and analysis processes, as illustrated in Figure 2. The iRAP assessments make use of road attribute data for
78 variables at 100 metre intervals along a road. Thus, the data collection task is huge; in this project in Brazil
for example, a total of 2,648,412 data points were recorded. These data were compiled through road surveys
that collect digital images of the road using multi-view high-resolution cameras as it is driven. After the images
were collected, they were viewed by coders using specialised software in the office to record the road attributes.

3 iRAP and the Safe System Approach
Road deaths and injuries are the result of a complex interaction between the way people behave on the roads,
the types of vehicles in use and the speed they are travelling, and the design of the roads themselves. Despite
this complexity, the process of creating a road system that is genuinely safe is now well understood.
Experience in implementing the well-established ‘safe system’ approach, which recognises the mutual
importance of safe road users, safe vehicles and safe roads, shows how death and serious injury can be
prevented on a large scale.4 The following principles broadly underline the safe system approach and inform
the iRAP process:
       mistakes, errors of judgment and poor driving decisions are intrinsic to humans. The road safety
        system needs to be designed and operated to account for this,
       humans are fragile. Unprotected, we cannot survive impacts that occur at even moderate speeds,
       people who behave with criminal disregard for the safety of themselves and others should expect
        tough policing and tough penalties,
       safety can be built into the road system in a comprehensive and systematic fashion, not just having
        the apparent problem areas patched up, and
       the ‘engineered’ elements of the system - vehicles and roads - can be designed to be compatible with
        the human element, perhaps taking lessons from motor racing that while crashes will occur, the total
        system is designed to minimise harm.
The role of iRAP is to focus specifically on the ‘safe roads’ element of the safety equation, in the context of
safer road users, safer vehicles and safe roads. iRAP builds on the experience of developed countries that
have a proven track record in infrastructure safety and, with the support of local engineers and researchers,
applies knowledge and technical processes that are applicable for low and middle-income countries.
A safe road will recognise and make provision for the limitations of humans within the transport system. The
network should be designed to limit the probability of crashes occurring and minimise the severity of those
crashes that do occur.
Evidence shows that affordable, safe road infrastructure can cut vehicle occupant, motorcyclist, pedestrian
and bicyclist deaths dramatically. Few infrastructure investments can match the economic benefits of those
generated by targeted road safety measures (see Figure 4 below). Research from Australia, the United States,
the United Kingdom, Norway, France, Canada, Netherlands, the Nordic Countries and New Zealand shows
that targeted road safety projects generated crash cost savings of up to 60 times the cost of construction.5
That is, for each $1 invested, there was a return of up to $60 in terms of crash costs avoided. Other research
has shown that low-cost improvements at specific high-risk sites have shown first year rates of return of 300%.6
With adequate maintenance, road infrastructure investment can last decades, so the safe roads built today will
continue saving lives and preventing injuries long into the future.

An important principle for iRAP is the application of countermeasures on a large scale. Experience from the
health sector has taught us that large-scale application of proven treatments is essential in eradicating wide-
spread epidemics. Operation Smallpox Zero for example, was responsible for eradicating this deadly disease
in just ten years. The programme of Smallpox vaccinations was described as a triumph of World Health
Organization management, not of medicine. Likewise the systematic safety upgrading of the Brazilian road
network over the Decade of Action can make a significant contribution to the eradication of road traffic death
and injury.

4 Road Surveys and Coding
The road network was surveyed using a specially equipped vehicle which recorded digital images at 10m
intervals to enable the coding of more than 50 road attributes relating to the likelihood and severity of a crash.


4.1 Road Surveys
The surveys were undertaken by Servicios Mexicanos de Ingenieria Civil (SEMIC) between December 2014
and January 2015 using a proprietary digital imaging system. The features of the inspection system were:
       use of five high-resolution digital cameras (1624 x 1224 pixels).
       digital images collected with more than a 180 degree field of view at 10m intervals.
       geo-reference data collected for each digital image, including distance along road (from an established
        start point) plus latitude and longitude coordinates.
       calibrated images that enable detailed measurements of the road features.
       the capability to provide automated measurements of radius of curvature for horizontal curves,
        gradient for vertical alignment and vehicle travel speeds.

4.2 iRAP Coding
Upon completion of the surveys, trained and experienced SEMIC coding teams recorded road attributes from
digital images using the proprietary SEMIC VISOR Processing Toolkit software, in accordance with the iRAP
Star Rating Coding Manual v3. The coded data were subject to quality assurance checks in accordance with
the iRAP Road Coding Quality Assurance Guide, to ensure the highest standards of quality and consistency
during the road coding process and subsequent quality reviews prior to data processing.

The Detailed Road Condition tables within ViDA provide the length and percentage of the filtered network for
each category of recorded road attribute. They can be used to compare the infrastructure attributes of different
roads or road sections and can help to provide an understanding of the Star Ratings of a given road section
and the proposed countermeasures that will potentially alter the road attributes and reduce risk.

5 Supporting Data
Although the iRAP Star Ratings and Safer Roads Investment Plans use a standardised global methodology,
the models are calibrated with local data to ensure that the results reflect local conditions. The following section
outlines the supporting data and how it was used in the iRAP analysis.


5.1 The role of speed
The issue of speed management is of paramount importance in road safety and in-turn traffic speeds have a
significant bearing on the iRAP Star Ratings.

The risk of death or serious injury is minimised in any crash, where:
       vulnerable road users (e.g. motorcyclists, bicyclists and pedestrians) are physically separated from
        cars and heavier vehicles, or traffic speeds are 40km/h or less,
       opposing traffic is physically separated and roadside hazards such as trees and other fixed objects
        (including concrete guard posts) are well managed, and
       traffic speeds are restricted to 70km/h or less on roads where opposing traffic flows are not physically
        separated, or where roadside hazards exist.

The safety of infrastructure is heavily influenced by the speed of traffic and without an understanding of the
operating speeds it is difficult to assess the safety performance of infrastructure at a given location. All iRAP
assessments are based on vehicle operating speeds to ensure that the Star Rating is based on how the road
is actively functioning, which in some cases can be above the posted speed limit. For further details of the
iRAP specifications in relation to vehicle speeds see Vehicle Speeds and the iRAP Protocols, which can be
found on the iRAP website http://irap.org/about-irap-3/research-and-technical-papers.

In many countries there can be a marked difference between the posted speed limit and the actual speed of
vehicles using the road. This is a function of local behaviour, local enforcement practice and whether the
engineering features of the road are designed in accordance with the speed limit, for example the use of traffic
calming measures to help manage speeds.


5.2 Speed data
Due to the lack of comprehensive speed data across the network an estimate of vehicle operating speeds was
made. The method adopted to estimate the 85th percentile operating speeds, the median operating speed and
the assumptions made are detailed below. Posted speed data collected during data coding were used as a
basis for estimating operating speeds and 85th percentile operating speed. Assumptions were based on the
analysis of speed surveys from data provided by the DNIT, and are contained in the following table.

Operating speeds were then adjusted based on a review of the images to take into account traffic flow, land
use, curvature and road surface quality, plus other attributes that could influence the operating speed.


5.3 Traffic volumes
Total traffic flow (or volume) for all motorised vehicles is required for each road section and is used in the
estimation of the distribution of the numbers of deaths and serious injuries that could be prevented on the
network. The data are required to be in Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) format and should not be adjusted
to passenger car equivalent (PCU) volumes.
The AADT for the road sections within this assessment were provided by DNIT. However, data were not
provided for all road sections within this assessment therefore where data have not been supplied estimates
have been made based on observations made during the analysis phase of the project based on survey images.


5.4 Motorcycle volumes
Detailed data on motorcycle traffic was not available for all roads included in the assessment. Estimates have
been made based on other data sources such as observed flow during coding. Due to the interurban nature
of the majority of roads assessed, motorcycle volumes were recorded as not exceeding 5% of the vehicle flow.


5.5 Pedestrian and bicycle flows
Pedestrian and bicycle flows were recorded during the coding process. It is possible to rely solely on this data
for processing, though it is not recommended. This is because pedestrian and bicycle flows can be transitory
and a one-off visual inspection is unlikely to provide a strong basis for determining overall flows. In this project,
pedestrian and bicyclist flows were estimated based on observed flows and the surrounding land use and road
attributes. The approach used for estimating pedestrian along and crossing flows and bicyclist flows was as
follows:
         An estimate was made for each 100 metre segment of road based on adjacent land use and road
          attributes. See iRAP 310: A Guide to Producing iRAP Star Ratings and Safer Roads Investment Plans
          for further information on estimating flows based on adjacent land use.




                                                                                  iRAP DNIT Technical Report | 24
          If the estimate was less than the observed flow, then the observed flow was selected. It is noted that
           from time to time, this step could cause create an artificially high number if an unusually large number
           of people or bicycles happened to be observed.
          The pedestrian and bicyclist flows along the road were ‘smoothed’ across 500 metre lengths for
           pedestrians and 1km for bicyclists by taking the highest value in that length (pedestrian crossing
           volumes were not smoothed).


5.6 Number of deaths and serious injuries
As part of the iRAP model calibration, an estimate of the number of deaths and serious injuries that occur on
the road was required. In order to allocate deaths and serious injuries to the network, the iRAP model requires
an estimate of the distribution of deaths by road user type.
DNIT provided road trauma fatality data for the majority of sections included within this analysis with fatalities
on all sections shown in the link below. A fatality estimate for the roads on which no fatality data is collected
was undertaken.
The number of serious injuries was estimated using the standard iRAP assumption that for each death, 10
serious injuries occur.8

5.7 The economic cost of a death and serious injury
The document Safer Roads Investment Plans: The iRAP Methodology describes the process used to estimate
the economic cost of a road death and a serious injury for iRAP projects. This approach is applied globally by
iRAP and is based on research undertaken by McMahon and Dahdah (2008).


The key equations used are:
       the economic cost of a death is estimated to be: 70 x Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita
        (current prices)




                                                                                    iRAP DNIT Technical Report | 26
         the economic cost of a serious injury is estimated to be: 0.25 x economic cost of a death.
On this basis:
         the economic cost of a death is estimated to be 70 x R$ 27,777 = R$1,944,390 (US$ 622,205)9
         the economic cost of a serious injury is estimated to be: ¼ x R$1,944,390 = R$486,097 (US$155,551).
Based on the 2010 total recorded road deaths on all 66,245 km of DNIT roads, the economic cost of road
deaths and serious injuries on the DNIT network alone is a staggering US$18.7 billion per year.
To calculate net present costs and benefits, a discount rate of 12% was used.


5.8 Countermeasure costs
The iRAP model requires the input of local construction and maintenance costs for each of the 93
countermeasures that are considered in the development of the Safer Roads Investment Plans. The estimated
costs are categorised by area type (urban and rural) and upper and lower costs (low, medium and high), based
on the extent to which the surrounding land use and physical environment impacts upon the construction cost
of major works.
The countermeasure costs used in this study were based on estimates calculated by engineering staff at the
DNIT and approved for preliminary use by Ivone Catarina Simões Hoffmann. The full data set for each study
is provided in Appendix A.

                                                                                iRAP DNIT Technical Report | 27
6 Star Ratings
iRAP Star Ratings are based on road infrastructure features and the degree to which they impact the likelihood
and severity of road crashes. The focus is on the features which influence the most common and severe types
of crash on roads for motor vehicles, motorcyclists, pedestrians and bicyclists. They provide a simple and
objective measure of the relative level of risk associated with road infrastructure for an individual road user. 5-
star (green) roads are the safest, while 1-star (black) roads are the least safe. Star Ratings were not assigned
to roads where there was very low use by that type of road user. For example, if no bicyclists use a section of
road, then a bicyclist Star Rating is not assigned to it.
The Star Ratings are based on Star Rating Scores (SRS). The iRAP models calculate an SRS at 100 metre
intervals for each of the four road user types, based on relative risk factors for each of the road attributes. The
scores are developed by combining relative risk factors using a multiplicative model. More information on the
risk factors used within the model can be found at http://irap.org/about-irap-3/methodology.


6.1 Smoothed Star Ratings
A Star Rating Score (SRS) is calculated for each 100 metre segment of road for vehicles occupants,
motorcyclists, pedestrians and bicyclists. These scores are then allocated to Star Rating bands to determine
the Star Rating for each 100 metre of road. However, for the purposes of producing a network level map
showing Star Ratings, 100 metres is too much detail. Hence, Star Ratings are smoothed (or averaged) over
longer lengths in order to produce more meaningful results. The effect of smoothing is illustrated in the chart
below, which shows unsmoothed (raw) Star Rating Scores (SRS) in blue and smoothed SRS in white for a
stretch of the Adhemar Pereira de Barros, Governador Doutor Highway.

6.2 The Star Rating Results
The combined Star Rating results for all road sections surveyed within the DNIT pilot study demonstrate that
there is potential to improve the safety of road infrastructure for all users. High risk road sections feature
significantly in the results with almost half of the surveyed network rated 2-stars or less (out of a possible of 5-
stars) for all road user types.


The star ratings show that 1% of road length is rated as 5-star, 9% is rated as 4-star, 58% is rated as 3-star,
and the remaining 32% is rated as 2-star and below for vehicle occupants. For motorcyclists, no roads were
rated as 5-star, only 3% of road length is rated as 4-star, 47% is rated as 3-star, and the remaining 50% is
rated 2-star and below. For pedestrians less than 1% is rated as 4-star and 5-star, 2% is rated as 3-star and
the remaining 13% is rated 2-star and below. For bicyclists less than 1% is rated as 5-star or 4-star, 5% is
rated as 3-star and the remaining 14% is rated 2-star and below.

6.4 Example Star Ratings
The following images illustrate sections of roads, their Star Ratings and the road attributes that influenced the
Star Rating. The figures show Star Ratings for vehicle occupants and pedestrians, as these road users account
for a significant number of deaths and illustrate typical road layouts. However, similar examples can be
produced for motorcyclists and bicyclists.


In the figures:
                 coloured attributes are associated with a reduced level of risk
                  coloured attributes are associated with an intermediate level of risk
               coloured attributes are associated with an increased level of risk
                 coloured attributes are associated with an extreme level of risk
The figures help to illustrate the fact that the level of risk associated with a road’s infrastructure, and hence its
Star Rating, is a function of numerous attributes, including travel speeds.

7 Safer Roads Investment Plans
iRAP considers more than 90 proven road improvement options to generate affordable and economically
sound Safer Road Investment Plans (SRIP) that will save lives. Road improvement options range from low-
cost road markings and pedestrian refuges to higher-cost intersection upgrades and full highway duplication.
Plans are developed in three key steps:
    1. Drawing on the Star Ratings and traffic volume data, estimated numbers of deaths and serious
       injuries are distributed across the road network.
    2. For each 100 metre segment of road, countermeasure options are tested for their potential to reduce
       deaths and injuries. For example, a section of road that has a poor pedestrian Star Rating and high
       pedestrian activity might be a candidate for a footpath or pedestrian crossing facility.
    3. Each countermeasure option is assessed against affordability and economic effectiveness criteria.
       The economic benefit of a countermeasure (measured in terms of the economic benefit of the deaths
       and serious injuries prevented) must, at a minimum, exceed the cost of its construction and
       maintenance (that is, it must have a benefit cost ratio (BCR) greater than one). In many
       circumstances, the ‘threshold’ BCR for a plan is lifted above one, which has the effect of reducing
       the overall cost of the plan. This helps to ensure that the plan is affordable while representing a
       positive return on investment and the responsible use of public money.
A SRIP shows a list of affordable and economically sound road safety treatments, specifically tailored to reduce
risk on the corridors assessed in this DNIT pilot study. Each countermeasure proposed in the SRIPs is
supported by strong evidence that, if implemented, it will prevent deaths and serious injuries in a cost-effective
way). Nevertheless, each countermeasure should be subject to additional prioritisation, concept planning and
detailed design before implementation.




                                                                                iRAP DNIT Technical Report | 37
The SRIP produced aims to maximise the prevention of deaths and serious injuries within the available budget.
The plans largely focus on:
         reducing the likelihood of vehicles running off the road and reducing the risk associated with run-off
          road crashes by improving shoulders, installing rumble strips and reducing the severity of roadsides,
          and
         providing facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists.

Table 9 below shows that an investment of R$1.7 billion could reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries
on the road by 46%, preventing over 56,000 deaths and serious injuries over 20 years. The overall benefit cost
ratio of this approach would be 7.6:1. The SRIP was produced using a threshold BCR of 3 (that is, the economic
benefit of each countermeasure must be greater than or equal to 3 times the cost).
Note that the details shown in the tables below are a summary of the plans for all roads surveyed in the DNIT
Pilot Study, individual plans for each road corridor within the project are available within the iRAP online
software.

The list of countermeasures in the plan suggest that significant safety improvements can be made to the
surveyed DNIT road network through the implementation of several key road safety and mass action
treatments. Installing roadside barriers or clearing roadside hazards, and installing rumble strips are estimated
to prevent over 20,400 fatalities and serious injuries over a 20 year period. Countermeasures focused on
reducing risk for vulnerable users also show promise. Countermeasures aimed at improving pedestrian safety
alone, such as pedestrian footpaths and crossings, pedestrian fencing, lighting and traffic calming could
prevent 16,121 fatalities and serious injuries over the 20 years.
The countermeasures identified are shown in Table 10 below.

Analysis of the projected Star Ratings after implementation of the SRIP shows that it is economically viable to
increase all bar 4% of the roads surveyed to a level of 3-stars and above for the vehicle occupants and for all
bar 10% for motorcyclists. There is the potential to significantly increase the star ratings for pedestrians and
cyclists across much of the network on which vulnerable roads users are likely to be present.


7.2 Economic Assessment
Using actual crash data where available, an estimate of the number of deaths and serious injuries that occur
on the surveyed network is made. Crash modification factors are then used to provide an estimate of the
number of road deaths and serious injuries that are likely to be prevented through the infrastructure
improvements that are proposed in each SRIP. More information on the crash modification factors used in the
model is available in the iRAP Road Attribute Risk Factor factsheets in the Documents section of the iRAP
website at: http://irap.org/about-irap-3/methodology.
It is important to ensure that improvements such as lane widening, resurfacing, additional lanes and paved
shoulders do not result in excessive vehicle speeds, particularly where vulnerable road users such as
pedestrians and bicyclists are present. In such cases vehicle speeds must be effectively managed in order to
minimise risk.
Assuming that the proposed countermeasures do not lead to an increase in vehicle operating speeds, it is
estimated that fatal and serious injuries (FSIs) are likely to reduce by 46%, preventing 3,546 deaths and serious
injuries each year and almost 71,000 deaths and serious injuries over the next 20 years by implementing the
countermeasure recommendations put forward in the SRIP.

8 Implementation and recommendations
The iRAP DNIT Pilot study successfully assessed 3,395 kilometres of road and generated Star Ratings for
vehicle occupants, motorcyclists, bicyclists and pedestrians. The Star Rating results show that road
infrastructure poses a relatively high risk for all users across the surveyed network. High risk roads feature
significantly in the results, with almost a third of the network rated 2-stars or less (out of a possible of 5-stars)
for vehicle occupants, 41% rated as 2-stars or less for motorcyclists and the majority of the network rated as
2-stars or less for bicyclists and pedestrians.
The road attribute data shows that the majority of the survey was conducted along a single carriageway
network, with only 22% being conducted on dual carriageway roads. Roadside hazards are numerous across
the network. 81% of curves where traffic flows at 80km/h or more have hazardous roadsides. Also of concern
is the extent of unprotected safety barrier ends on the network, with over 700 unprotected safety barrier ends
recorded across the road network. Due to the rural nature of much of the road network, provision for vulnerable
road users is low with only 1% of the network having pedestrian facilities present. No motorcycle facilities were
recorded.
The available data from a Road Assessment such as this provides extensive planning and engineering
information such as road attribute records, road user risk, countermeasure proposals and economic
assessments for 100 metre sections of road network. The assessments are supported by the iRAP online
software which makes this information highly accessible. Each countermeasure proposed in a SRIP is backed
by strong evidence that, if implemented, it will prevent deaths and serious injuries in a cost-effective way, with
engineering improvements that all have a BCR > 3. Review of speed limits, enforcement and ultimately
reductions in 85th percentile operating speeds at locations where engineering improvements are not
economically viable can ensure most, if not all roads reach 3-star operating conditions.
In interpreting the results of this report, it is important to recognise that iRAP is designed to provide a network-
level assessment of risk and cost-effective countermeasures. As such, a SRIP should be considered just the
first step in building a safe road. For this reason, implementation of the proposals in this report will ideally
include the following steps:
       local examination of proposed countermeasures (including a ‘value engineering’ type workshop
        including all relevant stakeholders),
       detailed analysis of traffic survey and crash data (if available),
       preliminary scheme investigation studies, including site surveys and preliminary design,
       detailed design, star ratings of the designs, road safety audit, detailed costing and procurement, final
        evaluation and construction, and
       post-construction evaluation and road safety audit, including Star Ratings for the upgraded road and
        analysis of crash data (if it is available).
The detailed results of the project and access to the iRAP online software (http://vida.irap.org) have been
provided to key stakeholders for further exploration and use. Detailed briefings are also able to be held with
key funding bodies, elected members, government officials, design engineers and planners to ensure a
common understanding of the investment priorities and potential to save lives and reduce serious injuries.
In the following sections, key issues that should be taken into consideration during the implementation process
are discussed.

8.1 Prioritisation
Previous projects have shown that when presented with a large-scale plan of proposed countermeasures,
potentially requiring hundreds of millions of dollars of investment, the decisions about what to do first and how
to prioritise can be challenging.
In order to prioritise work on the remaining network the Predicted Casualty Reduction map can be used to
show the annual number of fatal and serious injuries that are likely to be prevented per kilometre if the complete
Safer Roads Investment Plan was implemented. This map can help to prioritise the implementation of
countermeasures by identifying specific locations or road sections where the potential to save lives is greatest.

Countermeasure implementation might be undertaken according to each countermeasure’s likely source of
funding and the ease with which it can be built. This was the approach taken by the Directorate General of
Highways and VicRoads during crash reduction investigations on major roads in Indonesia. Their approach
involved assigning countermeasures to one of four categories, as illustrated in Table 13. By doing so, the
responsibilities and procedures in implementing the countermeasures was clarified, with patterns emerging
about what can be done in the short-term and which countermeasures require further work.

Having identified a priority location or section of road, it is possible to further tailor the countermeasure plan to
suit specific circumstances. This is especially useful if budget constraints have changed. Figure 18 below
provides an example of the way in which cost-effectiveness may be used to generate a list of priority
countermeasures within a limited budget. In this example the SRIP was used to produce a list of all
countermeasures that could feasibly be built on the road, sorted in order of descending BCR. The
countermeasure download file, available online, was used to generate this list.
The initial SRIP for the Indonesian project showed that the cumulative cost of investments with a BCR of 1 or
more was slightly over $100 million, as indicated by the red line in Figure 18, which was considered to be
unaffordable by the local authorities. As an alternative, an initial budget was set at $2 million. This is indicated
by the green line in Figure 18. For this budget, all countermeasures with a BCR of 45.6 or more could be
implemented.

8.2 Commit to a Safe System approach
The investment plans contain infrastructure improvements that can be set in place immediately. To
complement those improvements, a series of additional measures need to be implemented, and a longer-term
safety strategy set in place.
The Safe System approach is based on the theory that all humans make mistakes, but that a mistake made
on the highway should not result in death or serious injury. It recognises that the human body is vulnerable
and is unlikely to survive an uncushioned impact at speeds of 30km/h or more.
When these occasional, but inevitable mistakes occur on our busy roads, it stands to reason that collisions or
crashes will result. Currently some of these collisions have fatal consequences, and others are less severe.
The Safe System provides a forgiving highway infrastructure, one which recognises that mistakes will be made
and attempts to minimise their occurrence, and the forces involved in a resulting crash, to reduce its severity
to survivable levels.
The Safe System approach includes engineering measures such as the removal or protection of roadside
hazards, the re-design of roads, roadsides and intersections to reduce risk to a minimum and the setting of
appropriate speed limits according to the existing levels of infrastructure safety. The adoption of this approach
is recommended.




                                                                                iRAP DNIT Technical Report | 47
8.3 Engage with local communities
It is recommended that public participation be encouraged, in order to maximise the benefits from road safety
projects. Community engagement and cooperation between road authority and local interest groups is
regarded as providing a useful two-way flow of information that will not only educate and inform local road
users and communities on how they are expected to use the road network, but can also provide designers and
decision makers with an understanding of the needs and requirements of affected groups.
Star Ratings can be used to effectively communicate the need for safe road design, not only within DNIT, but
also to local residents and other stakeholders. Using Star Ratings will allow opportunities to celebrate success
i.e. Ministers, local politicians, and/or road authorities can celebrate road safety upgrades “1-star road
upgraded to 3-star standard” etc.
In addition to the road safety engineering upgrades, significant benefits could also be realised through the
coordinated targeting of behavioural risk factors for road users (such as speeding, seat belt wearing, helmet
use, the adherence to traffic regulations and alcohol use ) and road vehicle safety (i.e. ABS brakes, side-
impact bars and airbags). This would be consistent with taking a Safe System approach to the programme.
The Road Safety Toolkit (toolkit.irap.org) and United Nations Road Safety Collaboration Good Practice
Manuals provide further information on these issues.10


8.4 Review road safety data collection procedures
For more informed road safety management, it is highly recommended that DNIT reviews and where
appropriate improves its databases and collection procedures with regards to crash data, traffic flow data, and
operating speed data on its network. The improvement in quality and access to this data will provide benefits
across the entire DNIT asset management and network management operations. This will improve investment
and policy decision making in regard to the safety performance of the road network. The further integration of
the iRAP data with the improved and existing asset data as part of a holistic road safety database would allow
decision makers to better manage investments in road safety and to target high risk locations across the DNIT
network.


8.5 Set policy targets
It is strongly recommended that the Federal Government sets policy targets to reduce the level of road traffic
fatalities in line with the recommendations discussed in the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road
Safety 2011-2020. Recommendations include:
          Set a target to maximise travel (vkt) on 3-star or better roads by the end of the Decade of Action for
           Road Safety (2020). Based on the current analysis and road network a target of 90% of travel on 3-
           star or better appears cost effective and feasible.
          Set minimum Star Ratings for all new road designs to ensure that no more ‘killer roads’ are built. For
           example, adopt the policy that all new roads shall be built to a minimum 3-star standard for all road
           users.
          iRAP Star Rating and Investment Plans for the highest risk or highest volume 10% of roads on the
           network.
          Institutionalisation of the iRAP methodology as an asset management tool within DNIT and its rollout
           across the entire national road network.

The use of star rating targets provide an objective measure of infrastructure safety and simplify road safety
policy management, communication and accountability. The star rating can be used for network level targets,
corridor and road hierarchy specific performance targets, or linked to maintenance and operational
management of the road asset. Examples include targets for 4-star roads of national significance (New
Zealand), 4-star roads for pedestrians and cyclists in linear settlements (Asian Development Bank) and 90%
of travel on 3-star or better by 2020 (UK).
For newly constructed roads the star rating target can be specified at the planning and design stage (e.g. the
new road shall be 4-star standard for pedestrians and vehicle occupants at the desired operating speed of
60km/h). The improved star rating can also be confirmed prior to opening and the outcome celebrated within
the project team, road agency and the public.
The appropriate star rating target for an individual road network or project will reflect the existing standard of
the road, the strategic purpose of the route and the volume of particular road users, available funding and
political will. In principle targets should seek to maximise deaths and serious injuries saved per unit of
investment and therefore in general higher volume roads will have higher star rating targets. iRAP encourage
the setting of a minimum 3-star performance management goal for new projects and targets linked to vehicle
travel for existing networks.
While it is encouraging that Brazilian authorities have set themselves the challenging fatality reduction target
of 11 fatalities per 100 000 inhabitants by 2014 as part of the Decade of Action, it is also important that goals
have a realistic timeframe. For further information on the setting of road safety policy targets, the development
of local and national action plans and implementing sustainable road safety strategies, refer to the Global Plan
for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020.


8.6 Institutionalisation of the iRAP Methodology in DNIT
Governments and road authorities can benefit from measuring and reporting on the road safety outcomes of
their investments. Star Ratings provide objective measures that can be used to track road safety performance
and establish policy positions, while iRAP Safer Road Investment Plans provide a blueprint for local engineers
and decision makers when considering how to implement upgrades on their network.
The DNIT Pilot Study was, in many respects, a proof-of-concept for the national road authority. It is anticipated
that the results of this study will not only be used to focus investments in road infrastructure safety on the
highways assessed, but will also demonstrate the utility and potential of the iRAP methodology and ViDA
software for DNIT. With a network of over 55,000km, a full-scale rollout of the iRAP methodology, accompanied
by road safety focused spending in road infrastructure, could prevent tens of thousands of deaths and serious
injuries each and every year in a cost effective manner.
Mexico provides an excellent example as to how DNIT could implement a network wide iRAP programme. In
Mexico, the iRAP methodology has been institutionalised by the SCT, the national road authority. To date over
100,000km of roads have been assessed using iRAP’s methodology. This figure includes the assessment of
entire national network of 45,000km in 2012 and again in 2015, allowing the SCT to performance track
investments in road safety. Additionally, hundreds of key stakeholders throughout the country have been
trained in the use of the iRAP methodology. These capacity building exercise range from establishing an iRAP
Centre of Excellence at the Mexican Institute of Transport (IMT) to training field engineers in the use the results
in ViDA as a means of in planning and prioritising local road upgrades, to training high level SCT and treasury
staff members in the use of the iRAP methodology and ViDA software as an asset management tool.
An important aspect of all iRAP programmes globally is the building of local capacity within the road agency
and associated research, technical and communication partners. This ensures high levels of local ownership
and expertise is developed while being supported as part of the global iRAP community that covers over 70
countries worldwide.

8.7 Training and support for a national BrasilRAP programme
It is recommended that the DNIT encourages and supports the training needs of employees and external
stakeholders to maximise the use and impact of the iRAP methodology as an integrated road safety and asset
management tool within the road authority. This can be encouraged by:
   1. Developing a regional workshop series and training programme to ensure that all DNIT regional and
      district engineers are trained in the use of the iRAP DNIT Pilot study software and results.
   2. Conducting further formal training sessions with design staff and consultants likely to be undertaking
      road construction and maintenance operations in. In 2015 several training session, conducted by
      iRAP, were carried out in order to introduce the ViDA platform to key DNIT personnel.
   3. Conducting an equivalent of the IRF Safer Roads by Design course, integrated with iRAP DNIT Pilot
      study results that will build local engineering knowledge.
   4. Investigating options to integrate iRAP training into Government and University level qualifications
      and professional training.
   5. Taking a lead role in building and supporting the development of a national BrasilRAP programme,
      run locally. Work with states to develop opportunities to undertake assessments of high risk roads
      across all road networks in Brazil and explore options to utilise local research and practices to
      enable the localisation of the risk model and software.
   6. Support the establishment of an IRAP Centre of Excellence at the University of Santa Catarina’s
      Transportation and Logistics Laboratory (LabTrans).
   7. Consider the launch of BrasilRAP and associated star rating targets at the upcoming global
      Ministerial Conference being hosted by Brazil
