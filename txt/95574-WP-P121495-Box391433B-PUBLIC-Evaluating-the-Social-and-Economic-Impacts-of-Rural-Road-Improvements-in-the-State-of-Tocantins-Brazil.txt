This study was undertaken at the initiative of Aurelio Menendez, Program Manager in
the Transport Global Practice of the World Bank. The main author of the report is
Atsushi Iimi, Senior Economist (GTIDR) at the World Bank. The study was prepared
under the leadership of Eric Lancelot, Senior Transport Specialist (GTIDR) at the
World Bank, and benefited from contributions by Isabela Manelici, JPA (TWITR at that
time) at the World Bank, and Satoshi Ogita, Transport Specialist (GTIDR) at the World
Bank.

The study builds on the work carried out by the team formerly in charge of the World
Bank-funded project Tocantins Sustainable Regional Development (P060573) in Brazil,
led by Aymeric Meyer and Jacques Cellier, both former World Bank employees, during
the preparation and early execution of the project in 2001–2005. This is when the
surveys’ methodology was conceived and initial steps of the surveys were undertaken.
The methodology used was mainly based on a precedent impact analysis conducted in
2002 for a similar type of project in Vietnam.

Assistance from the Government of the State of Tocantins in Brazil, especially its
Secretariats of Planning and Transport and the State Road Agency, is gratefully
acknowledged. This assistance was provided in the context of a long-term partnership
between the Bank and the State for over 20 years. The commitment and long-standing
efforts of the State Secretariat of Planning ’s Statistics Unit , and particularly the efforts
of its head, Joaquín Cifuentes, are highly recognized. This team undertook all field
surveys needed for the study both prior to the commencement of road works in 2005–
2008, and after the works’ completion in 2011–2012, and provided extremely valuable
hindsight on both the methodology and the surveys’ design and implementation.

Finally, this paper benefited from comments and advice from peer reviewers,
including Luis A. Andres, Lead Economist (GWADR), and Kirsten Hommann, Senior
Economist (GSURR), as well as from the World Bank’s Brazil Country Office . The
execution of this study would not have been possible without the kind financial
support of a number of initiatives, including a DEC research grant, an LCR Sustainable
Department (LCSSD) fund, and a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) grant.

Foreword
Infrastructure interventions have traditionally been underserved by robust impact
evaluations (IEs), compared to social sectors such as health and education. Partly at
stake is the complexity of measuring the impact of large transport projects, such as
roads and development corridors or public transport systems, due to the length of the
project construction cycle, the time needed for induced effects to materialize, and the
challenges posed by the identification and maintenance of beneficiary populations and
control groups over time. The assessment of investment programs’ relevance in the
transport sector has traditionally relied on standard economic analyses, rather than on
impact evaluations, for which robust methodologies have been lacking. As a result,
there are only a handful of methodologically full-fledged socioeconomic impact
evaluations in the sector. This study is part of an overall effort of the World Bank’s
Transport and ICT Global Practice to integrate impact analyses more systematically in
project design and optimize policy interventions.

With over 20 million people raised from below the poverty line in the past 10 to 15
years, Brazil has achieved spectacular results in the eradication of extreme poverty and
the improvement of the wealth of the poorest. As such, the country is often cited for
innovative flagship programs such as the bolsa família. Other types of initiatives have
also contributed to a sustainable improvement in the living conditions of the poorest.
Investment programs aimed at improving rural road transport are among these
initiatives. By targeting remote poor populations, these investments are aimed at
improving people’s access to services, jobs and markets. In turn, these investments are
expected to boost local economies while at the same time directly improving rural
dwellers’ quality of life.

The present paper, Evaluating the Social and Economic Impacts of Rural Road
Improvements in the State of Tocantins, Brazil, builds on an impact evaluation initiative
launched during the preparation of the Tocantins Sustainable Regional Development
Project in 2001–2003. It investigates and details the results of nearly 10 years of
continuous effort to measure the impact of a Bank-supported rural road investment
program that targeted the remote poor population of the Brazilian State of Tocantins.
It also identifies some of the challenges faced in undertaking the study.

Abstract
The aim of this paper is to provide feedback on the question of socioeconomic benefits
from rural road development and the impact of transport infrastructure on the poor,
particularly the poorest and the bottom 40 percent of the population. This study relies
on impact evaluation methodologies, which are traditionally used in social sectors but
less so in the transport sector. These methodologies were launched in 2003 under the
Tocantins Sustainable Regional Development Project (P060573).

This paper highlights the context that led to the project’s design, which included an
impact evaluation of the works envisaged under the project. It also highlights some of
the main challenges faced by this impact evaluation and how th ese challenges were
addressed for the present study. It then provides details about the data collected
during the surveys and the key relevant characteristics of the population targeted by
the surveys. It discusses the possible estimation methods envisioned to undertake the
study and provides the main results of the assessment based on these methods.

The analysis shows that improved rural roads changed people’s transport modal
choice. People came to use more public buses and individual motorized vehicles after
the rural road improvements. The paper also finds that the project increased school
attendance, particularly for girls. Although the evidence is relatively weak in statistical
terms, it indicates that the project contributed to increasing agricultural jobs and
household income in certain regions.

                  I. Introduction
                  1.      Rural accessibility remains a major challenge in developing countries. About
                  900 million rural dwellers worldwide lack access to all-season roads because theyare
                  located farther than two kilometers (km)—a 20- to 25-minute walk—from main
                  roads (Roberts, Shyam and Rastogi 2006). 1 Time wasted in transit between home and
                  school or hospital or market (which may in many cases even preclude travels) results
                  in missed and reduced economic and social opportunities.

                  2.      It is widely recognized that improved rural roads have a positive impact on
                  rural inhabitants. Such improvements are expected to enhance their ability to access
                  social services, markets and jobs, and therefore contribute to improving their living
                  standards. Although the short-term impacts of such an undertaking are relatively
                  clear—because transport costs and travel time can be reduced by improved road
                  conditions (Jacoby 2000; Khandker, Bakht and Koolwal 2009; Khandker and Koolwal
                  2011)—longer-term impacts such as increased profitability of firms (Chandra and
                  Thompson 2000) or increased employment in the agricultural and non-agricultural
                  sectors (Lokshin and Yemtsov 2005) may take time to materialize (up to 10 or 15
                  years) and could depend on other conditions, such as the level of motorization
                  (Escobal and Ponce 2002).

                  3.      However, while ex ante and ex post economic evaluations of infrastructure
                  projects have been used commonly for years to both justify and monitor the relevance
                  of infrastructure investments based on recognized methodologies,2 only a handful of
                  rigorous studies have been conducted to measure the socioeconomic impact of rural
                  road improvements on living standards. 3 This is partially due to the difficulties,
                  inherent in transport projects, in undertaking impact evaluations: (a) the
                  identification of an appropriate comparable control group is a challenge because the
                  characteristics and surrounding conditions often differ from one group of
                  beneficiaries to another, and investment decisions often rely on specific strategies
                  that may introduce bias to perfectly randomized experiments; (b) beneficiaries may
                  be geographically spread out over a large area, especially in cases of long-haulage
                  transport projects, thus making it harder to define not only who the beneficiaries are
                  but also the expected benefits; and (c) redistributed benefits to households may be
                  diluted or mixed with other social and economic development factors, and may be
                  over- or under-estimated, particularly in the short run.



1 The Rural Access Index (RAI) is a key transport headline indicator that was developed as part of the Results
Measurement Framework for IDA (the International Development Association) in 2005. In practice, the RAI measures the
number of rural people living within two km (typically equivalent to a 20- to 25-minute walk) of an all-season road as a
proportion of the total rural population. An “all - season road” is a road that is motorable year -round by the prevailing
means of rural transport (typically a pickup or a truck that does not have four-wheel-drive). Occasional interruptions of
short duration during inclement weather (e.g., heavy rainfall) are accepted, particularly on lightly trafficked roads.

2 For example, assessments of surplus to consumers and to producers, as well as tools such as Highway Development
Management (HDN), a type of software initially developed by the Bank in the late 1970s and aimed at assessing the
economic return of road investments.

3 For example, in Papua New Guinea, household consumption, which is used as a general welfare measurement, increased
relative to the poverty line (Gibson and Rozelle 2003). Per capita expenditure was also found to increase due to rural road
construction and upgrading in Bangladesh (Khandker, Bakht and Koolwal 2009). Poverty incidence declined and
consumption increased in Ethiopia (Dercon, Gilligan, Hoddinott and Woldehanna 2008).

                                                            1
                 4.     With respect to road investments planned under the Tocantins Sustainable
                 Regional Development Project (P060573), some of these constraints were levied;
                 investments specifically targeted unpaved rural feeder roads and sought to benefit
                 rural dwellers in the poorest regions of the state who lacked any alternative access to
                 the main transport networks. Moreover, the selection process of roads to be
                 improved was essentially left to rural dwellers, based on a participat ory selection
                 process involving all interested dwellers.

                 5.      The main objectives of the present paper are twofold: (i) to describe the
                 methodological challenges related to road-sector impact evaluation activities and
                 lessons learned from the Tocantins experience; and (ii) to document the evidence that
                 emerged in order to demonstrate the impacts of rural road improvements in the state,
                 given the available survey data. The evaluation first focuses on direct outcomes to
                 determine the existence of relatively short-term impacts resulting from the project.
                 Thereafter, traditional social and economic impacts are measured. Two different
                 methods are used —difference-in-differences (DID) matching and DID regression—to
                 minimize issues observed in the control group through the execution of the surveys.
                 In addition, instrumental variable (IV) estimators are also used to verify the
                 robustness of the results.

                 6.     The paper is organized as follows: Section II provides a context for the study.
                 Section III discusses methodological challenges and lessons learned from the
                 experience. Sections IV and V, respectively, present available data and describe the
                 methodology used. Section VI summarizes the main findings. Section VII discusses
                 various empirical issues and policy implications. Section VIII presents t he study’s
                 main conclusions.



                 II. Context of the study
                 7.       Brazil has made impressive gains in terms of socioeconomic development in
                 recent years. A steady gross domestic product (GDP) growth of one to six percent over
                 the last decade, combined with sustained social policies, contributed to increasing the
                 GDP per capita (constant 2005 US$) from US$4,400 in 2000 to US$5,700 in 2012. 4
                 This allowed more than 20 million people to rise above the poverty line in the past
                 decade. However, these overall positive figures mask a wide range of realities on the
                 ground. For instance, depending on the region, inequality remains persistently high
                 in Brazil, with a Gini index of about 0.55 in 2009, even though it decreased from 0.66
                 in 2001. Many poor live in rural areas (rural dwellers total 27 million in Brazil) and
                 lack access to services, markets and jobs, due to the lack of appropriate transport
                 infrastructure and services.

                 8.      The State of Tocantins is among the least-developed but fastest-growing
                 regions in Brazil. Created under the 1988 Constitution, it is the country’s newest state.
                 With a population of 1.38 million on 277,000 square kilometers (km2) of land, the
                 population density is low at five persons per km 2. Urbanization has accelerated at a
                 fast pace since the state’s creation and is now aligned with the national trend in Brazil,
                 where 79 percent of the population lives in urban areas. Tocantins’ urban population
                 is concentrated in 10 major cities. Most of its other cities are small: over half of the

4 World Development Indicators.

                                                     2
                    state’s 139 municipalities contain fewer than 5,000 inhabitants, often scattered
                    throughout the municipal jurisdiction ’s territory.

                    9.       Although the state’s GDP per capita has nearly doubled in the past six years,
                    (a) it currently stands at a relatively low R$12,891 (2011) 5 (equivalent to US$7,400,6
                    using the 2011 average exchange rate), placing Tocantins 16 th among Brazil’s 27
                    states; (b) the Human Development Index (HDI) was 0.756 in 2005 (vs. 0.61 in 1991), 7
                    but about 11 percent (2008) of the population remains below the poverty line; (c) the
                    infant mortality rate (2010) is 20.5 deaths per 1,000 children under the age of one
                    (14.5 on average in Brazil); and (d) the literacy rate has improved significantly, from
                    62 percent in 1991 to 85 percent in 2007, but test scores remain well below Brazil’s
                    average at both the primary and secondary levels, as does access to early childhood
                    education. Finally, two vulnerable groups live in Tocantins, including (a) 13,100
                    indigenous peoples who reside mostly in six main indigenous territories (as per
                    FUNAI, 8 IBGE 2010), and (b) about 7,500 residents of quilombos, 9 grouped in 15
                    dispersed rural communities.

                    10.     Long-term development strategies aimed at promoting sustainable
                    development and quality of life for citizens, under a state modernization approach,
                    have been prioritized consistently under successive four-year, multi-annual plans
                    (Planos Plurianuais, PPAs) adopted by different government administrations over the
                    last 20 years. During the early stages of the state’s development, this translated into
                    a strong focus on building core infrastructure, due to the state’s relative remoteness.
                    While continuing to work on major infrastructure, in the early 2000s policy makers
                    then focused on increasing accessibility to services, jobs and markets for the state’s
                    remote poor populations.

                    11.     In this context, the World Bank’s Board approved the Tocantins Sustainable
                    Regional Development Project in December 2003. The project aimed to foster the
                    improved effectiveness of road transport and the enhanced efficiency of selected
                    public services. It included three components: (i) Participatory planning and
                    management of regional and municipal development (US$6.5 million); (ii)
                    Environmental management (US$10.2 million); and (iii) Rural road improvements
                    (US$42.7 million). An impact evaluation was designed as a means to assess the impact
                    of rural road improvements aimed at providing all-season accessibility to selected
                    rural populations of the State of Tocantins.

                    12.     The rural road improvement component targeted 67 municipalities within
                    the four poorest regions in the eastern part of Tocantins: Northeast, Bico do Papagaio,
                    Southeast and Jalapão (see Figure 1). Road improvements mostly comprised the
                    construction of concrete bridges and culverts crossing rivers and streams, to allow
                    year-round passage especially in rainy seasons. A participatory process, through
                    forums open to the population of each municipality, was used to prioritize road

                  interventions. Typically, 3 to 10 rural road sections were upgraded in each
                  municipality, each representing 3 to 15 km of road length. At the outset, 63,000 rural
                  dwellers 10 were expected to benefit from the road improvements. After having
                  identified the roads, engineers identified the type of intervention needed at each
                  location.

                  13.     The civil works were implemented between 2006 and 2011. The timing of
                  project implementation varied from one region to the next: most of the works were
                  completed in the first region (Southeast) by 2010, and in the second region (Bico do
                  Papagaio) by early 2011; works in the Northeast and Jalapão regions were completed,
                  for the most part, only in late 2011. In total, close to 700 bridges and 2,100 culverts
                  were built on about 4,400 km of unpaved municipal roads between 2006 and for all
                  but six municipalities.11

                 III. Methodological challenges
                 14.      The conduction of rigorous impact evaluations is generally challenging in the
                 transport sector. The main reason is that, typically, transport projects are not
                 randomly assigned, but rather targeted. There must be good reasons for selectingand
                 implementing a particular project at a specific site, and each location has unique
                 underlying characteristics. The identification of an appropriate comparable group is
                 not a simple proposition. In addition, transport projects often generate a wide range
                 of direct and indirect benefits that impact a large number of people. Of particular note,
                 roads are typical public goods (with the exception of toll roads). This compounds the
                 difficulty in identifying a comparable group.

                 15.     Maintaining a control group as intended is another challenge in conducting
                 impact evaluations of infrastructure projects. Even if a good control group is defined
                 at the outset, many unanticipated events can occur during the project’s
                 implementation. Unlike relatively simple health interventions, the preparation and
                 implementation of infrastructure projects take considerable time, during which the
                 specifications and schedule might be revised. As a result, the intended control group
                 may ultimately become another “treatment” group. Close collaboration and
                 communication between the project implementation and evaluation teams are
                 essential in designing and modifying the evaluation framework, if necessary.

                 16.     The road project evaluation in Tocantins was initially designed following one
                 of the pioneer studies in this subject conducted by Mu and van de Walle (2011). This
                 team surveyed 100 project communes and 100 non-project communes in six selected
                 provinces of Vietnam and, to compare the two groups, applied the difference-in-
                 differences (DID) technique with score matching. With respect to Tocantins, however,
                 before starting the surveys the State Government decided not to interview rural
                 dwellers who would not benefit from the project (the control group), because it was
                 feared that (a) they would be reluctant to answer the survey, and (b) it would trigger
                 frustration and dissatisfaction, thus placing the government in a politically difficult
                 situation.

                 17.     Despite the absence of a control group stricto sensu, the following analysis
                 relies on some naïve definitions of this group. The first approach is a retrofit pipeline
                 comparison thanks to the above-detailed staggered execution of the works depending
                 on the region. All road improvement works had been completed in the Southeast
                 region by the time of the follow-up survey, while only 30 percent of the communities,
                 or 228 households out of 540, had benefited from the completed works in the Bico do
                 Papagaio region. 12 In the remaining communities, works were ongoing or had just
                 been initiated. Using this time difference in project implementation, certain
                 comparisons can be made between these two regions.

                 18.     The second possibility relies on the fact that some road improvement works
                 were postponed, although they had been planned. In Bico do Papagaio, works were
                 postponed in seven communities belonging to three municipalities. In addition, in
                 turned out that five other communities never benefited from the project because of
                 the relocation of the planned works from the original sites. In the Northeast and
                 Jalapão regions, all communities saw the completion of project works before the


12 The completion of the project works was confirmed by households that were surveyed.

                                                         5
follow-up survey was conducted, with the exception of 11 communities in which
projects were postponed.

19.    For the purposes of this study, these communities with uncompleted or
postponed works were defined as a control group because: (a) these changes were
mainly due to the community’s di fficulty in paying counterpart funds for the works,
which was somewhat linked to the socioeconomic or geographical characteristics of
households/municipalities, resulting in little endogeneity when the control group
was chosen; and (b) all communities surveyed in the evaluation —including control
and treatment groups —were selected through public consultations in order to be
treated at the beginning of the project and therefore to mitigate risks of
incomparability between the two groups.

20.     Although the manner in which the control group is defined may be practical,
it may still be potentially controversial. In particular, it leaves reservations about the
comparability of the two groups. As discussed below, the Southeast and Bico do
Papagaio regions are different in certain aspects. From a statistical point of view,
unbalanced sample sizes may also be a matter of concern. In the case of the Northeast
and Jalapão, the control group is much smaller than the treatment group. The
difference in means between the two groups is still an unbiased estimator of the
project’s impact, but the standard errors tend to be larger.

21.     A useful and practical remedy, although not perfect, is score matching. As
discussed in the literature (e.g., Mu and van de Walle 2011), score matching can
ensure comparability between two groups in a quasi-experimental evaluation. Our
data suggest that the two groups in question are comparable at least in a statistical
sense, excepting several outliers.

22.    Impact evaluation in the transport sector is also challenging due to the
complexity of results chains. The theory of change is critical when the possible causal
chain that links inputs, outputs, outcomes and impacts is considered. However, a
transport project can generate multisectoral and multidimensional benefits. In
addition, there may be other interventions that could affect outcomes and impacts of
interest. Notably, project life is long in the transport sector. Thus, the causality
between interventions and results might become complicated over time, and
measured impacts might be either over- or underestimated.

23.    With regard to the Tocantins road project, a wide range of outcomes and
impacts will be measured based on the following results chain (Figure 2). First,
bridges and culverts will be rehabilitated, and are project outputs. When the works
are completed, local residents are likely to feel some benefits from the project,
although these may not be quantifiable. Subjective assessment can include, for
example, whether personal travel became easier than before, and whether the living
conditions, in terms of roads, improved in the last 12 months.

24.     As people actually pass through the areas with the rehabilitated bridges and
culverts, subjective as well as objective outcomes are likely to emerge over time. The
bridge and culvert works might well change physical accessibility in rural areas,
especially during the rainy season. Accessibility to certain locations should be
improved, particularly in terms of travel time. Thereafter, improved accessibility will
likely affect transport demand. People might travel more frequently, and available
transport modes and services can also be expected to change as a consequence.

                                    6
25.     In the long run, an even wider range of economic and social benefits may be
measured. In theory, improved accessibility may increase school attendance. Health
conditions are also expected to improve thanks to enhanced road accessibility.
Similarly, such changes might stimulate new local businesses (e.g., Lokshin and
Yemtsov 2005; Mu and van de Walle 2011) and encourage farmers to sell their
agricultural products in the market, eventually resulting in job creation and
household income growth.

26.     Due to the limited timeframe of the evaluation in Tocantins (see Figure 2
below), it is unlikely that all of the above outcomes and impacts could be captured in
the surveys. It is also less likely that the individual impacts will be clearly separated;
some may be overlapped and intermixed, possibly complicating the interpretation of
results. Nonetheless, the following analysis will detail various ways in which the
populations concerned are benefiting from the project works.

27.     Finally, it is also noteworthy that impacts are not always measured. Whether
or not they are captured depends largely on the questionnaire design, which always
presents a challenge. The surveys must include well-conceived questions capable of
capturing the intended impacts. People may feel benefits only under particular
circumstances. For instance, they may not perceive benefits from improved
accessibility during the dry season, because they experienced few difficulties even
before the project’s launch. Fur thermore, many members of these communities may
not travel frequently; as such, it may be difficult to measure increased demand for
transport by asking how many times a respondent traveled in the last two weeks.

                  IV. Data
                  Sampling and Surveys

                  28.    To understand the project’s development impacts, the State Government and
                  the World Bank designed a comprehensive impact evaluation survey in 2004, with
                  the aim of quantifying the project’s social and economic benefits and identifying the
                  underlying causal chains between the project and potential outcomes. The surveys
                  were administered at different times, due to the variation in project execution
                  schedules. The analysis has thus been divided to reflect these differences and to
                  exclude different time-fixed effects, pairing the Southeast and Bico do Papagaio
                  regions, and the Northeast and Jalapão regions.

                  29.     Surveys in the Southeast and Bico do Papagaio. For the first group, baseline
                  data were collected between September and December 2005 from a total of 1,069
                  households in 110 communities (Table 1). 13 Works were completed in the Southeast
                  by 2010 and in Bico do Papagaio by early 2011. The follow-up survey was conducted
                  between June and July 2011 and covered 1,001 households in the same
                  municipalities.14 The sample size was determined based on the preliminary survey of
                  population distribution in the project areas. The sample size was similar for both
                  regions: 529 households were surveyed in 41 communities of the Southeast region,
                  and 540 households in 69 communities were covered in the Bico do Papagaio region.
                  The total sample size was determined based on the standard power calculations,
                  which indicate that a sample of 1,500 households would be sufficient. The baseline
                  survey is supportive of this. For instance, the average travel time was 84 minutes,
                  with a standard deviation of 87.1. Under standard assumptions (power=0.8; Type I
                  error=0.05), it should be enough to detect a more than five percent improvement in
                  travel time. The sample size of each region was decided based on population data.
                  The subsample size of each community was then determined in proportion to the
                  number of households that it contained.

                  30.     Surveys in the Northeast and Jalapão. For the second group, the baseline data
                  were collected between May and November 2008. The sample was relatively smaller
                  than in the first group because the density of population is lower in these regions. In
                  total, 422 households in 110 communities were interviewed (Table 2): 170
                  households in 27 communities of the Jalapão region and 252 households in 46
                  communities of the Northeast region. Works in the Northeast and Jalapão were
                  completed, for the most part, in late 2011. Accordingly, the follow-up survey,
                  conducted from October to December 2012, covered 319 households: 290 in the
                  Northeast and 29 in Jalapão.




13 The term “community” does not cover an administrative or jurisdictional reality. For the purpose of the survey, the
term “community” covered the cluster of residents along a road segment where the works were executed. It often
corresponds to the boundaries of local business associations, if any.

14 The follow-up survey does not cover 11 relatively small municipalities that were included in the baseline survey.

31.     The baseline and follow-up surveys were conducted in different months of the
dry season. However, this would not affect measuring the envisaged impact during
the rainy season because: (a) most items in the questionnaire asked about the general
conditions of households or infrastructure, which were little affected by month or
seasonality; (b) it is expected that accessibility during Tocantins’ long rainy season
(almost six months) will affect basic welfare over the entire year, including the dry
season; and (c) it is impractical to conduct interview surveys during the rainy season
due to access difficulty, especially in the case of the baseline survey before the works.


Basic Characteristics of the Population

32.     The baseline survey provided an overview of household characteristics in the
State of Tocantins (Table 3). The average household size is roughly four, and
household heads are mostly male. The adult literacy rate is approximately 70 to 80
percent across the regions. A household has, on average, 1 to 1.5 school children. The
survey data indicated that some children could not attend school due to illness, but
few children were prevented from attending because of transport difficulties.

33.     Every two or three households had at least one person who had been ill in the
previous two months. Doctors and nurses appear to be available: they are present five
to six days per week at the nearest health centers. Transport does not pose a major
constraint for those seeking to reach a health center or hospital. Meanwhile, the
infrastructure access of households varies across regions. The Southeast in particular
appears to lag behind other regions.

34.     The average household income ranges from R$370 in the Southeast to R$540
in the Northeast. Notably, there is significant variation within each region, ranging
from nearly R$0 to R$6,000.

35.     The economic structure does not differ significantly across regions. Although
agriculture is the main sector, land distribution is highly skewed. Most households
own fewer than 5 ha of land; 90 percent of households own fewer than 20 ha; and
only 1 percent of the total number of households uses more than 100 ha of land for
                                   9
agricultural production. About 20 percent of households are engaged in some form of
cottage industry, of which half are selling a portion of these products in the market.

36.   People appear to be lightly indebted. About 50 to 60 percent of households
borrow money. The average debt varies from household to household but represents
between two and six months of household income.

Selected variables

37.     First, to assess local residents’ perception of and satisfaction with the project,
the survey asks how each household benefited in the following domains: access to
health, access to schools, access to work, and ease of personal travel.

38.     To measure improved physical accessibility, two measurements are
considered: distance to a certain destination, and travel time required to reach it.
Although the former may measure a more direct outcome of the project, the latter
may be affected by other factors, such as available modes of transportation. Trips with
the following four destinations are examined: populated area, municipal center,
health center, and elementary school.

39.     In theory, improved accessibility is expected to increase demand for
transport. To measure such effects, the frequency of trips with the following five basic
purposes is examined: purchasing food, purchasing other goods, going to work, doing
business, and visiting friends and relatives. Improved accessibility is also expected to
change people’s transport behavior . Although the provision of public bus service
normally depends on a policy or regulatory decision, the regularity of public
transport services may be improved thanks to improved road accessibility. As a
result, the number of people using public buses may increase. The individual
motorcycle and vehicle ownership rate may increase directly due to better road
conditions and indirectly due to income increases resulting from improved transport
accessibility. This, in turn, may result in increased numbers of people using cars to
reach particular places.

40.     To capture longer-term economic and social benefits, the following impacts
are considered: Improved accessibility may increase school attendance, although
such an impact may be difficult to observe in the present case, given the low level of
school non-attendance due to difficult transport conditions even before the project’s

                                   11
                  launch (as mentioned above and shown in Table 3). Health conditions are also
                  expected to improve in the long run. Although it is recognized that survey
                  respondents did not generally consider transport to be a critical constraint when they
                  visit hospitals, according to the baseline survey (Table 3) the level of difficulty in
                  reaching a hospital due to road conditions is factored in, along with the number of
                  sick household members. The reduction in travel time may increase competitiveness
                  because people may use saved time for more productive activities. Improved rural
                  accessibility may also allow farmers to sell their agricultural products more easily in
                  the market, and may result in job creation in the agricultural sector. Moreover, new
                  businesses, such as retailers and agro-businesses, may also be fostered.

                  41.    Finally, household income was examined in order to evaluate the
                  intervention’s overall development impact.15 All of the direct and indirect benefits
                  mentioned above are expected to contribute to improving these rural populations ’
                  welfare, which is theoretically measured by household consumption. Although
                  household consumption is generally difficult to gauge, household income was used as
                  a proxy for welfare improvement. The summary statistics of all these variables are
                  presented in Table 4 below.

                  V. Methodology
                  Self-selection and comparability between treatment and control groups

                  42.     As previously mentioned, the fundamental challenge when impact
                  evaluations in the road sector are conducted is that the localization of the
                  road/prioritized work is not randomly assigned and is likely to cause bias in the
                  evaluation (van de Walle 2009; Rand 2011). In general, the prioritization of works —
                  whether they involve construction, rehabilitation or upgrading—depends on public
                  policies based on the socioeconomic environment particular to each project area. For
                  example, rural roads may be relatively abundant in productive agricultural areas
                  (Jacoby 2000). Transport policy makers may also wish to develop or favor particular
                  areas of the state in view of land-use planning and management.

                  43.     In the case of the Tocantins Sustainable Regional Development Project, this
                  self-selection problem is further compounded by the mechanism through which road
                  sections are selected for improvement, that is, through a participatory approach that
                  involves public consultations with local residents of each municipality. As a result, the
                  process of selecting priority roads may be based on different perspectives and
                  strategies, depending on the municipality (e.g., some municipalities may have given
                  priority to social perspectives, focusing on the poorest, while others may have
                  prioritized economic aspects, such as agricultural production).

                  44.     Our definition of the control groups, defined as the communities that were
                  given priority but in which actual work had not been executed or had been postponed
                  at the time of the survey, makes it possible to attenuate this bias. In reality, the
                  communities in the treatment and control groups differ both explicitly and implicitly
                  from one another, no matter how these groups are defined. Although they are equally
                  poor and, by and large, share similar demographics and social characteristics
                  according to the survey data (Tables 5 and 6), 16 some differences between the two
                  regions of the first analysis—Bico do Papagaio and the Southeast—remain significant
                  in specific areas, such as infrastructure access. The control group, which is essentially
                  composed of communities in the Bico do Papagaio region, has better access to basic
                  infrastructure services, such as gas, electricity and water supply. As a result, the
                  diffusion rates of certain home appliances also look different from one group to the
                  other. For example, with better access to grid power, 54 percent of households in the
                  control group own refrigerators, while the same is true of only 34 percent in the
                  treatment group. About 68 percent of households in the control group were using
                  electricity for lighting, but this figure reached only 22 percent in the treatment group.




16 According to the FIRJAN Index of Municipal Development ( Índice FIRJAN de Desenvolvimento Municipal, IFDM), there
was no significant difference in the 2005 data between the two groups. IFDM is a municipal-level human development
index prepared by the FIRJAN System (Rio de Janeiro State Federation of Industries [Federação das Indústrias do Estado
do Rio de Janeiro] ) based on the following three areas: Employment/Income, Health, and Education.

                   Estimation methods

                   45.     To deal with the abovementioned self-selection problem, two estimation
                   techniques were primarily applied: (i) simple DID matching, and (ii) DID regression
                   with covariates included. Subsequently, to verify the statistical robustness of the
                   estimation results, the instrumental variable (IV) estimation was also partly used.
                   The rationale behind the use of these different methods is that the impact evaluation
                   is often sensitive to the estimation methods used. Different identification
                   assumptions are required for different methods. In addition, each method has
                   advantages and disadvantages. For instance, some methods —such as DID
                   matching—are relatively simple to perform, while others —such as IV estimation—
                   may require careful construction of the empirical model, because the validity of the
                   model is examined on a case-by-case basis.


                   46.       DID matching estimator. The DID matching estimator simply compares the
                   outcome averages in the treatment and control groups in two separate periods
                   (before and after the intervention). One advantage of the DID estimator is that it can
                   control the unobserved heterogeneity between the treatment and control groups by
                   mitigating the self-selection bias, as long as the time-variant factors of the selected
                   outcome indicators are negligible (e.g., Todd 2008). As often discussed, however, it
                   may be a strong assumption that no time-variant factor affects the outcome indicators
                   (e.g., Jalan and Ravallion 1998). For instance, if the initial conditions between the
                   treatment and control groups vary significantly, the development paths of the
                   outcomes may also differ in important ways. Unfortunately, there is not much
                   freedom to test this trend assumption in the data, because the data were only
                   collected at two periods of time and there is no possibility to compare the time trends
                   prior to and following the intervention.


                   47.     To mitigate the risk of unbalanced characteristics, propensity score matching
                   was combined with DID. This combination is normally expected to perform well in
                   obtaining an experimental benchmark (Smith and Todd 2005; van de Walle and Mu
                   2008). 17 Propensity score matching is a useful technique to ensure comparability
                   between the two groups, at least in a statistical sense, and is often used in the impact
                   evaluation literature for the road sector (e.g., Lokshin and Yemtsov 2005; Mu and van
                   de Walle 2011).


                   48.      Since there are cross-section data from two periods of time, rather than panel
                   data,18 the simple DID matching estimator is arrived at in this manner:

17 Propensity score matching is a statistical technique to match each treatment unit to a control unit that does not benefit
from a program but has a similar probability of receiving the program, given all observed characteristics. It ensures that
the treatment unit and control unit are comparable in a probabilistic sense.

18 It is not possible to match the observations between the baseline and follow -up surveys because no household
identification was recorded in the surveys.

     where Y is outcome of household i at time t. Time t is set at zero before project
     implementation (baseline) and unity after project completion (follow-up). D denotes
     a dummy variable for treatment, which is set as unity if household i received an
     intervention. w is the weight given by kernel matching (Heckman, Ichimura and Todd
     1997). n is the number of households in the treatment group under the common
     support.

     49.     The kernel propensity score matching was performed with the initial
     observable characteristics presented in Tables 4 and 5. It ultimately corresponded
     well to the balancing property of the propensity score met, meaning that households
     with the same propensity scores have indifferent distributions of all relevant
     covariates. In the baseline data for Bico do Papagaio and the Southeast, four
     observations were located outside of the common support and were excluded from
     the sample. Twenty-nine observations were not supported in the case of Jalapão and
     the Northeast (Figure 3). These were also excluded from the analysis because they
     cannot be matched to any of the non-beneficiary households.

     DID regression with covariate included. The second estimation method is the DID
     regression with covariates included (after restricting the analysis to the common
     support). As mentioned above, one potential limit of the DID estimator comes from
     its assumption that there is no time-variant, group-specific effect, meaning that the
     development trends would be the same regardless of the intervention. Should this
     not be the case, the DID estimator would not be valid. To mitigate this risk, time -
     variant household characteristics can be included on the right-hand side of the
     regression equation (e.g., Jalan and Ravallion 1998).

     X is a time-variant observable that can control potential differences in development

     50.     Two methods are used to estimate Equation (2) when the outcome variable
     is a binary variable, as in the cases of car ownership and public bus use. One approach
                                                                 17
     is the linear probability model in which the dependent variable is treated as
     continuous, although it takes either 0 or 1. A potential problem is that the predicted
     probabilities may be greater than 1 or less than 0.

     The other approach is to use a probit model. An advantage of this model is that the
     predicted values are between 0 and 1. However, a disadvantage is that the evaluation
     of the coefficient αDDREG becomes complex. The magnitude of the interaction effect, i.e.,
     Ditt, in a probit model is not merely the coefficient of the interaction term; it also
     depends on the independent variables (Ai and Norton 2003). Since both Dit and t are
     discrete variables, the interaction effect is estimated by:


      
      ˆ DDREG 
                         ˆ
                  2 F X , 
                                                                                       (3)
                    Dt




     VI. Main estimation results
     51.     Both simple DID matching and DID regression have been performed. The
     estimation results, by and large, turned out to be similar to each other. See the Annex
     tables for the full estimation results of the DID regressions. The main findings are
     detailed below.


     Perceived benefits from the project

     52.    On the subjective level, people perceived various benefits from the project.
     Not surprisingly, in the Bico do Papagaio and Southeast regions, the proportion of
     households that confirmed they had benefited from the project is 18 to 20 percentage
     points higher in the treatment group (Table 7). In the case of Jalapão and the
     Northeast, evidence is less clear, although people consistently perceived benefits in
     terms of improved access to schools and workplaces.

     53.     The DID regression shows similar results, particularly for the Bico do
     Papagaio and Southeast regions. Households responded that they benefited from the
     project thanks to improved accessibility. In Jalapão and the Northeast, the results are
     less conclusive, but access to work seems to have improved significantly.

        Rural accessibility

        54.      As expected, rural accessibility was found to have improved, particularly in
        terms of distance and travel time to the nearest populated area and municipal center.
        In the Bico do Papagaio and Southeast regions, the distance to the nearest populated
        area is estimated to have been shortened by 6 km, and the travel time reduced by 13
        minutes (Table 8). The distance to the nearest populated area in the Jalapão and
        Northeast regions was also found to have decreased by 25 km. The differen ce in the
        measured impacts seems attributable to the dramatically deteriorated rural
        accessibility in areas of the Jalapão and Northeast regions where the project was not
        implemented (Figure 4). Because the sample size of the control group in these regions
        is very limited, statistical concerns may be raised with respect to the results.

        55.      Results are mixed regarding the distance and travel time to reach school s:
        they increased in the Bico do Papagaio and Southeast regions, and decreased in
        Jalapão and the Northeast. One possible factor may be related to the government’s
        recent policy involving the consolidation of many rural schools into larger schools,
        while providing for improved school bus services enabled by better roads. In fact, the
        use of public school buses has indeed increased in the Bico do Papagaio and Southeast
        regions. This has resulted in an increase of both distance and travel time to reach
        schools between the baseline and follow-up surveys. This assumption is also
        consistent with the fact that the average speed en route to schools increased from 9.7
        to 16.8 km per hour in the project areas of these regions, as opposed to a smaller
        increase from 10 to 14 km per hour in the comparison group (Figure 5). The surveys
        do not indicate any impediment to reaching schools due to transport difficulties.

        56.     The positive results mentioned above may be tempered by the fact that the
        project did not aim to construct new road infrastructures, but rather to ensure year-
        round trafficability on existing roads. One possible explanation factor is that
        impassable roads in rainy seasons may have obliged road users to take alternative
        longer roads.

          Demand for mobility

          57.     The estimated impacts on transport demand remain unclear. Although the
          number of trips to buy food increased in the Jalapão and Northeast regions, they
          decreased in the Bico do Papagaio and Southeast regions (Figure 6). After the
          intervention, inhabitants traveled less to buy food but more to purchase other goods
          in the Bico do Papagaio and Southeast regions (Table 9).

          58.     Possible explanation factors of these mixed results include: (a) potential
          seasonal sensitivity of demand for mobility. In fact, baseline and follow-up surveys
          were implemented during two different seasons; and (b) a bias may have been caused
          by the wording of the question, which was focused on the number of trips during the
          seven days prior to the survey.

     Modal choice

     59.     The impact of road improvements on respondents’ modal choice of transport
     is much clearer. More people began to use public buses and individual cars following
     improvements (Table 10), possibly because more public transport services were
     provided or because the regularity and reliability of these services improved.
     Individual car ownership also increased. Similarly, people came to own more bicycles
     in both pairs of regions. This development may be interpreted as a combination of the
     direct effect of improved roads and the indirect impact of income growth induced by
     road improvement. Motorcycle ownership increased only in the Jalapão and
     Northeast regions.

     60.    Evidence shows that more people also began to use public buses to reach
     schools, in particular in the Bico do Papagaio and Southeast regions. This is consistent
     with the abovementioned result that the distance to the nearest school grew longer.
     No impact on bus use was observed in the Jalapão and Northeast regions.

                  Social benefits

                  61.      The educational impact of improved roads is found to be partially positive in
                  the Bico do Papagaio and Southeast regions. The number of girls attending school in
                  these two regions has increased by 0.03 and 0.59, respectively, based on the simple
                  average DID model and the DID regression model. 19 The number of households with
                  children who cannot attend school due to poor road conditions experienced a
                  statistically significant decline, although the number was very small even before the
                  project’s launch (Table 1 1).

                  62.     In contrast, the impacts on school attendance are all negative in Jalapão and
                  the Northeast; some of them are statistically significant. The main reason for this
                  evolution is the substantial increase in the control group ’s school attendance , while
                  the treatment group (Figure 7) remained stable for the most part.

                  63.    The health impacts are inconclusive in all regions. Most of the estimated
                  impacts are not statistically significant. The number of households that have
                  experienced transport-related difficulties in visiting hospitals declined in Bico do
                  Papagaio and the Southeast, but increased in the Northeast and Jalapão. The number
                  of household members who were sick during the two months prior to the survey
                  declined from about 0.3 –0.4 to about 0.15 –0.2 across the regions. However, the trend
                  was similar among both the treatment and control groups. This prevented the
                  perception of any net impact resulting from the road project.

19 In fact, the absolute number of girls attending schools has decreased in both the treatment and control groups, but the
reduction was smaller in the treatment group than in the control group. This may be related to the fact t hat the total
number of children aged 5 to 9 years has been declining in the State of Tocantins (IBGE 2012).

                  Economic benefits: jobs and income

                  64.     Rural road intervention is found to have had positive impacts on job creation.
                  But the statistical significance of these impacts varies depending on estimation
                  methods, and the economic sector benefiting from the project varies depending on
                  the regional economic structure. The simple average DID matching shows that
                  agricultural employment increased 17 percent in Bico do Papagaio and the Southeast
                  (Table 12). 20 This specific trend may be linked to the relatively large number of
                  people involved in agriculture in these regions. 21 Numerically, it means that the
                  project contributed to the creation of about 220 jobs in 110 communities with about
                  4,500 people. The statistical significance of this development disappeared in the DID
                  regression, but the p-value of the coefficient of agricultural employment remains
                  relatively high at 0.113, indicating a likely positive impact of improved roads on
                  agricultural employment in Bico do Papagaio and the Southeast. There is no clear
                  indication of job creation in other sectors in these regions.

20 Although the estimated marginal effect is 0.206 people, the sample average of the number of household members
engaged in agriculture is 1.13.

21 Although the number of household members engaged in agriculture was 1.2 in Bico do Papagaio and the Southeast, it
was about 0.9 in Jalapão and the Northeast.

                                                         24
                  65.     In the Jalapão and Northeast regions, the number of jobs increased in the
                  service and public sectors, which are relatively large in these regions.22 Again, theDID
                  regression results have no statistical significance at the conventional level. Similarly,
                  however, the p-value is relatively high for public sector jobs at 0.162.

                  66.     According to the average DID matching, the monthly household income is
                  estimated to have increased by R$100, or about US$67, in the Bico do Papagaio and
                  Southeast regions due to improved rural accessibility. The DID regression shows a
                  smaller impact with a coefficient of 0.17, of which the marginal impact is estimated at
                  R$72.4, or US$48. In fact, household income has tended to increase regardless of the
                  project, but the increase was larger in areas where the project was implemented
                  (Figure 8).

                  67.    In contrast, the impact on income is unclear in Jalapão and the Northeast. The
                  measured net impact is negative. The income change was smaller in the treatment
                  group than in the control group, with no statistical significance.

                   VII. Discussion
                   Robustness check

                   68.     As mentioned previously, verifying the robustness of the above results
                   through the use of different methods is important because impact evaluations are
                   sometimes sensitive to empirical specifications. For the present evaluation, the
                   instrumental variable (IV) estimator was used to check such robustness, 23 but was
                   applied only for the first group (the Bico do Papagaio and Southeast regions) in cases
                   where the required information was available (notably, the detailed location of the
                   project works). The main challenge in estimating Equation (2) is the endogeneity of
                   the project’s localization, i.e., Dit. In theory, the instruments must be independent from
                   the outcome variables but relevant to the project localization decision.

                   69.     Several ways of constructing instruments exist in the literature. When
                   Chandra and Thompson (2000) examined the impact of the U.S. interstate highways
                   on earnings of firms, they argued that the non-metropolitan counties served by
                   highways were thought to have received the new highway as an exogenous benefit,
                   because the interstate highway’s first aim was to connect metropolitan areas.
                   Banerjee et al. (2012) applied the same concept to the Chinese railways case,
                   calculating the distance from counties to straight lines connecting historic cit ies and
                   ports.24 Gibson and Rozelle (2003) used, as an instrument, the timing in which the
                   national highway system penetrated into each district in Papua New Guinea,
                   demonstrating that a community’s proximity to a highway resulted in a higher
                   likelihood of receiving a feeder road.

                   70.     Two instruments were constructed to verify the robustness of the above
                   results in the present evaluation, so as to assess whether there could be a correlation
                   between the localization of the works on the rural roads and the proximity to existing
                   paved federal and state road networks, as discussed by Gibson and Rozelle (2003):
                   (i) the distance from each community to the nearest paved state road before the
                   project; and (ii) a dummy variable representing the existence of a paved state road in
                   each municipality. The data are based on information about the state road network
                   prior to 2005, just before the civil works got under way, to avoid further endogeneity
                   between the works localization and the outcome variables. Notably, during the
                   intervention period the government was not only investing in rural roads but also
                   upgrading state highways.

                   71.    Both (i.e., distance to the nearest paved state road before project
                   commencement and the dummy variable representing the existence of a paved state
                   road) were found to be valid, with signs contrary to prior expectations. Table 13
                   shows the first-stage regression result with household income used as an outcome
                   variable. All indications are that a community is more likely to receive rural road
                   intervention if it lacks good access to the state’s main road network. This may be
                   consistent with the objective of the project in Tocantins, which focused in particular
                   on lagging, remote communities situated in critical spots along the municipal road



23 When the outcome variable is a binary, the instrumental variable probit model is used.

24 In the context of dynamic panel estimation, lagged variables of household characteristics may also be used as a set of
instruments (Dercon et al. 2008).

                                                            26
 network. This result tends to demonstrate that rural road improvement localizations
 are likely to be based on the level of their connectivity to state or federal roads.

 72.     Statistically, both instruments have significantly negative coefficients,
 possibly suggesting that the civil works were implemented earlier in the areas where
 road connectivity was worse. The evidence indicates that the probability of having
 civil works executed at the earlier stage of the project was high when a municipality
 did not have any paved state road. The work was also likely to get under way early if
 a community was located far from the paved state road network. These instruments
 are found to be valid in the sense that they can be treated as excluded variables and
 are not correlated with the error terms. Both the Sagan overidentifying restriction
 test and the Hausman exogeneity test statistics are shown for each regression result
 in the Annex tables.

 73.      The IV estimation results are broadly consistent with the DID regression
 results (Table 14). Rural accessibility to a populated area would likely be improved,
 but not to a school. Overall use of public transportation increased, as did the use of
 individual cars. However, the impact on individual car ownership disappeared. There
 was a visible positive impact on girls’ school attendance. In contrast to the above DID
 result, the IV estimation indicates that the project might have resulted in increased
 jobs in both the service and public sectors.

 74.    Although economic impacts exist, they may be statistically weak. The DID
 regression estimated a significant coefficient of household income increase only in
 the Bico do Papagaio and Southeast regions. When evaluated at the sample means,
 the marginal effect is appraised at R$59.8, with a standard error of 36.5. This is
 smaller than the previous estimate, but is more or less consistent.

 75.     In terms of employment, the significance of the impact on agricultural jobs
 disappeared in both pairs of regions. However, the p-value of the coefficient of
 agricultural employment remains relatively high, at 0.113, in the Bico do Papagaio
 and Southeast regions. Similarly, in the Jalapão and Northeast regions, the p-value is
 relatively high for public sector jobs, at 0.162. These figures are consistent with the
 above simple DID matching estimates.

                    Investment policy implications

                  76.    The above estimation results have several important policy implications. First,
                  they indicate that improved rural roads have had a certain impact on development
                  outcomes in some areas, as exemplified by the shift in transport modal choice or
                  increased school attendance by girls. Meanwhile, economic impacts on households—
                  such as job creation and household income —have proved to be weaker, although
                  with an overall positive impact.

                  77.     Furthermore, the impact evaluation results could be used for the cost –benefit
                  analysis of rural road interventions, for which the suitability of the traditional
                  evaluation approach with respect to road-user benefits is limited. In the case of
                  Tocantins, household monthly income increased by an estimated US$40 –$70 on
                  average. At a US$40 increase per household and month, under a conservative
                  approach and a reasonable economic assumption, 25 rural road investment becomes
                  justified when it serves more than 80 households, reaching a 12 percent internal rate
                  of return (IRR). The graph below (Figure 9) illustrates the IRR in relation to the
                  number of beneficiaries along each road section. Although this finding is interesting,
                  it should not be seen as the only driver for designing a policy on transport
                  investments, because other elements—for instance, economic development and
                  social benefits perspectives, which are often not measured quantitatively —can also
                  be taken into account to justify particular investments.




25 The project life is assumed to be 30 years. The average investment cost is about US$267,000 per intervention road.
Note that each road may have four to five civil works, including bridges and culverts. The maintenance cost is assumed to
be 1.5 percent of the initial investment cost.

                   78.    Finally, the impact evaluation results show that the improvement of transport
                   should be coordinated with other sectoral policies. For example, the project was
                   found to have increased the number of children attending school, with an estimated
                   300 children in 1,100 households surveyed 26 (with the DID matching result, the
                   magnitude of the impact is estimated at 0.284 per household). School capacity should
                   be increased accordingly, because without such adequate capacity, social benefits
                   from improved rural roads would likely be offset by lower quality of education.
                   Similarly, improved public transport policy should be coordinated: evidence shows
                   that people’s use of public buses increased following project completion. According
                   to the simple DID matching estimates, the probability of using a bus to reach a
                   populated area would increase by 3.2 percent.


                   Lessons learned for improving impact evaluation design

                   79.    The implementation of this impact evaluation raised methodological and
                   practical lessons. First, it is essential to define and maintain a representative control
                   group to carry out a rigorous evaluation of a project or program. In the present
                   exercise, household surveys have been carried out only where civil works were
                   planned, for the reasons mentioned above. The retrofit pipeline comparison only
                   worked partially, resulting in an unbalanced sample size between the treatment and
                   control groups. In Jalapão and the Northeast, the control group had only 60
                   households, far fewer than the treatment group composed of 360.

                   80.     Maintaining the comparability between the treatment and control groups is
                   also essential to avoid bias in the comparison. At the design stage, each treatment
                   community should be paired with one control community located within the same
                   municipality and sharing similar characteristics, for the sake of comparability.
                   Important loopholes may appear in the course of the evaluation if, as is likely to occur
                   in such exercises over the long term, the control groups end up benefiting from road
                   improvements. In addition, it is important to collect as many observables as possible
                   in an effort to control the potential heterogeneity of the two groups. In the case of
                   Tocantins, the data clearly show significant differences in household characteristics
                   between the treatment and control groups, mainly because the sample of the control
                   group was limited to one of the two regions in both the first and second groups. In the


26 With the DID regression result, the marginal effect is estimated at 0.147 per household.

                                                                                  30
present case, a matching DID method was used to control difference s in
characteristics between groups.

81.     It is similarly important to ensure comparability between baseline and
follow-up surveys. In theory, identical households or communities should have been
interviewed before and after interventions to develop panel data. In the present
evaluation, the follow-up surveys could not be implemented in the same households
because the location of the households interviewed for the baseline was not
documented. As a result, the evaluation is not based on panel data. This is considered
a significant design flaw because it complicates intertemporal comparability.
Improvements in future impact evaluations may be achieved by recording household
identification and/or geo-references of surveyed households.

82.    The timing of the follow-up survey(s) is also a critical aspect: although direct
and physical outcomes, such as travel time to the nearest hospital, can be observed
immediately after project completion, it may take some time to observe other indirect
socioeconomic impacts, such as job creation and health outcomes. It would be useful
to carry out multiple follow-up surveys over the long run, although longer-term
evaluations also run the risk of losing part of the control group for the reasons
mentioned above.

83.     Coordination among the managers of the works and the team in cha rge of
impact evaluation is essential to ensure appropriate timing and location of the
surveys. In fact, the timing of the works must often adapt to particular field
constraints (delays due to administrative procedures or weather conditions,
relocation of works, etc.). In the present evaluation, even basic information, such as
the works’ location and schedule , have not always been made available on time.

84.     The questionnaires used for the interviews must be extremely well conceived
and customized to the proje ct’s particular design and context. For example, although
questions about the transport distance or time traveled for a particular activity
seemed pertinent a priori, with hindsight the questionnaire should rather have
focused on the number of impediments to travel due to inclement weather over the
past 6 to 12 months (to cover seasonality). This type of question would have been
more effective in view of achieving spot improvement works on rural roads, thus
allowing for year-round transport. Moreover, in retrospect, interviewees offered very
subjective responses when asked about distances. Other questions, such as those
related to illness, seem to have little bearing on the project. Alternatively, a question
about the frequency of foregone medical care due to transport problems would have
been more pertinent.

85.     Finally, at the analytical stage, it is worthwhile to test several different
estimation techniques to verify the robustness of the results. In certain cases,
different techniques may potentially generate different results, whereas in other
cases results may not differ regardless of the applied method. It is important to
maintain flexibility in data collection to permit the application of several analytic
techniques. In the case of Tocantins, it was worth the effort to find appropriate
instruments to perform the IV estimation, which is based on completely different
empirical settings from those of the DID estimators.

86.    The present exercise demonstrated that impact evaluations of transport
projects aimed at improving accessibility are feasible but difficult to implement.
Looking ahead, the challenge of designing an impact evaluation methodology for
                               31
projects that seek to improve major existing road works (such as rehabilitation
and/or upgrading of national roa ds, which constitute an important part of the Bank’s
portfolio in the transport sector) remains on the agenda.



VIII. Conclusion
87.     Many rural residents still have only limited access to good road infrastructure
in the developing world. A wide range of social and economic impacts can emerge
from rural road development, from physical connectivity improvements (i.e., shorter
distances and travel times) to long-term economic impacts, such as job creation and
welfare improvement.

88.     The current paper revisited the question of the economic and social benefits
related to rural road development. Using household survey data from the State of
Tocantins, Brazil, three different estimation techniques are applied to check the
validity of the results: DID matching, DID regression, and IV estimators.

89.     Overall, the analysis shows that improved rural road connectivity changed the
population’s choices with respect to modes of transportation. Following the rural
road intervention, members of the impacted communities increasingly began to use
public buses and individual cars. Furthermore, evidence indicates that the project
increased school attendance, particularly by girls. Although statistically weak in
relative terms, the evaluation indicates that the project contributed to increasing
household income and creating more agricultural jobs in certain regions. Because
some impacts require longer gestation periods, follow-up surveys and analyses will
be required to more precisely capture the values of the entire set of impacts.
