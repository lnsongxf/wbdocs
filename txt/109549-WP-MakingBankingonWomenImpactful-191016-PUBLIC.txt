DISCLAIMER
IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, creates opportunity where it’s needed most and delivers lasting
solutions for development. This report was commissioned by IFC through its Financial Institutions Group

and IFC’s Gender Secretariat. FIG IFC works through financial institutions to provide much-needed access
to finance for millions of micro, small, and medium enterprises – including those owned by women. The IFC
Gender Secretariat in turn works with firms – including banks - to reduce the gap between men and women
as entrepreneurs, but also as employees, corporate leaders, suppliers, consumers, and community stakeholder.

    things differently and strengthen program results, this section focuses on presenting a summary of the leading
    practices and success driver that we were able to identify in the three banks’ Banking on Women programs.

III. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Each of the three banks is at a different stage of their Banking on Women program. Each study included
in this publication has produced a rich and diverse set of learnings and recommendations. Some of the
recommendations below speak to banks with relatively new banking programs, such as Garanti Bank Romania.
Other recommendations are relevant to those who have been in the market with a Banking on Women program
for a decade, such as Garanti Bank Turkey. Regardless of where banks are on this spectrum, they may find the
recommendations below relevant to their specific case and aspirations:

  to support this segment, better business impact           based on research into segment preferences.

  share; 2. cost/benefit analysis of the financial          Customer Value Proposition (CVP) based on
  impact to the bank; 3. regions and industries             in-depth market research of this segment.

     1.	 LESSONS LEARNED: WHAT IFC AND OTHER BANKS HAVE LEARNED FROM BLC BANK
     BLC Bank’s We Initiative has seen a lot of success. BLC Bank’s We Initiative has also provided several valuable
     lessons for IFC and for banks interested in establishing their own programs to bank women.


      KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER: Successful first-movers such as BLC Bank are critical
      in transferring knowledge, creating a blueprint and inspiring other banks


     •	 Knowledge creation: The success of BLC Bank                   of the GBA, became a board member of GBA in 2014
        informed the development of IFC’s standard Women's            and Chair of the GBA since September 2015. BLC

     2.	RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE WAY FORWARD
     Building on this success, there is an opportunity for BLC Bank to further expand its We Initiative. In the SME
     banking space, the risk-sharing facility with IFC with a carve-out for women entrepreneurs, launched mid-2016,
     offers great momentum for further program expansion and deepening. A greater expansion into the women's SME
     market will allow BLC Bank to capitalize on the higher portfolio-growth and better NPL rates of the Bank's female
     SME borrower segment. There are several aspects to consider in order to deepen the Bank’s engagement with female
     SME borrowers as well as expand into other female customer sub-segments, including in retail banking.

          Garanti Bank Romania has a vision for growth in which SME banking, including banking for women-led SMEs,
          plays a critical role. The Bank is, however, faced with a number of external market challenges pertaining to the
          Romanian SME segment. To better understand the business rationale and strategic relevance for the Bank’s
          interest in the SME – and in particular of the women-led SME – banking segment, it is important to take a look at
          the overall Romanian market – and in particular the women’s – entrepreneurship space. In 2010, the Bank set up
          a program to reach women-led SMEs, largely leveraging its product menu for SMEs. It is, however, mostly Garanti
          Bank’s products for individuals that have gained the Bank market recognition. Over time, the bank has received
          numerous awards and distinctions, proving customers and general public confidence in our products and services:

                                                            Further, women customers expect a clear
                                                            product differentiation for the financial

                                                            well as non-financial services that help

                                                            pressing challenges, such as enhancing
                                                            cost-efficiencies through energy savings.



Indeed, the company has tapped into other sources
of financing since Garanti Bank launched its BoW
Program and did obtain a €1.5 million loan from the
Bank of Cyprus. This funding was however unrelated
to the financing the company received from Garanti
Bank and the loans it has from Garanti Bank did not
in any way help obtain financing from other banks.
   In spite of its beginning as a start-up, the company
has never used personal loans for its business. Ovo
Design is growing fast and with that have come further
financing needs. The company plans to apply for further
financing in the coming two years, mostly to upgrade and
purchase new equipment. Given Ovo Design’s growth
and expansion, the company would direct any additional
financial resources into upgrading its equipment and
training its employees. It would also consider purchasing
new equipment and hiring more qualified staff. Ms.
Felicia further offers some insight into the challenges
that small businesses in Romania, including women-
led firms, face and the specific finance and non-finance
needs they typically have. The biggest challenge to
the company is tax and labour regulation, in addition
to access to reliable electricity/power. This includes
costs associated with power as well as compliance
with labour regulations. The company considers that
two most pressing needs that can be addressed by the
Bank are lower interest rates for women-led firms, and
customized business consulting services for women
clients. Because of the costs associated with accessing
power, the company is further interested in energy
efficiency financing and energy efficiency audits.

between “mass” (non-borrowing clients4), “small,”                                        and the size of credit limits) to establish three

     are Garanti Bank’s in-depth customer knowledge                            divisions, such as retail and corporate banking.
     and its ability to focus all customer services

    	 Under the Technical Assistance of the World Bank, KAG DER (the Women Entrepreneurs Association of Turkey) has been developing the Gender Equality Model for Turkey
      since 2010. The Turkish version of the model (FEM) focuses on equal opportunities in the work place. The objective of the certification under this program is to help the
      private sector focus on key elements integral to promoting gender equality in the workplace, marketplace and community. The project also aspires to promote gender
      equality in employment and earnings, enhance the productivity of women in the Turkish labor force and promote equal opportunity procedures in the business world.
