                                              Highlights
In 2015 Russia’s financial sector has remained under pressure. Sanctions and market turbulence
raised concerns over financial stability. Prior to the sharp ruble depreciation in 2H2014, banks’ capital
and income positions were already deteriorating due to the economic slowdown. The situation
worsened in mid-December 2014 as retail deposit outflows created liquidity pressures, asset prices
declined and the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) raised policy interest rates, worsening banks’ net
interest margins. Finally, the ruble depreciation put pressure on banks’ risk-weighted capital.
Anti-crisis measures taken by the authorities helped stabilize the financial system. To support
the financial sector the Government and CBR adopted a comprehensive set of measures in late 2014
to protect financial stability through, inter alia: (i) adopting forbearance policies on F/X denominated
securities and loans, restructured loans and loan loss provisioning requirements; (ii) making available
up to RUB 1 trillion to recapitalize banks, and (iii) doubled the level of deposit insurance.
Due to the strong government support, a banking crisis was avoided, but weaknesses in the
sector persist. The 650 bps policy rate hike in December 2014 was accompanied by a temporary
drying up of liquidity in the interbank market, which abated after the authorities announced measures
to stabilize the financial system. Higher deposit interest rates and ruble stabilization resulted in an
overall increase in retail deposits from February 2015, thereby reducing the liquidity pressures the
system faced. The strengthening of the ruble and declining spreads have reduced pressure on bank
capital, which has been further supported by the authorities’ bank recapitalization program (as
described below) and regulatory forbearance (as described in Box 1). However, the banks’
profitability has continued to deteriorate as credit growth has declined sharply, interest margins have
fallen, and credit quality has deteriorated.

Under the state recapitalization program in 2015 banks received capital injections for RUB
728.6 billion. In early 2015 the government provided RUB 1 trillion (ca. $15 billion) – approximately
15% of banking sector total capital - under the state capital injection program to 27 nationwide and
regionally important banks. Out of this list, 20 banks already received capital injections in the total
amount of RUB 728.6 billion. Seventy percent of this amount went to the state owned banks – VTB,
Gazprombank and the Russian Agriculture Bank. The Ministry of Finance plans to phase out the
capital support program by the end of 2015.
CBR estimates that regulatory forbearance sheltered bank’s capital position by up to 2
percentage points. The CBR introduced the forbearance measures in December 2014 in order to ease
pressure on banks’ prudential ratios from the sharp depreciation in the Russian ruble and the spike in
local interest rates at that time (Box 1). Under forbearance, banks were (i) granted a moratorium on
recognizing negative valuation changes for securities portfolios; (ii) allowed to price foreign currency
(FX)-denominated assets and liabilities at October 1st 2014 exchange rates; and (iii) allowed
flexibility in loan classification and provisioning.
Historically, the willingness of the Russian government to support the banking system has been
strong and is expected to continue if needed (Table 2). In 2008-09, the state support package for
banks was one of the largest among emerging markets, exceeding 10% of GDP ($170 billion). The
current support package, including the CBR funding, amounted to 11% of GDP (c. $180 billion),
which is comparable to the level of previous government assistance to the banking system. These
support measures were provided from non-budgetary sources (e.g. Deposit Insurance Agency,
National Stabilization fund). Given this, the government's capacity to support the banking system is
considered to remain high given low levels of sovereign debt relative to GDP, debt affordability and
large, although shrinking, fiscal buffers.

                                 2015 Banking Sector Performance
Macroeconomic instability and geopolitical tensions have impacted the banking sector
primarily through an increase in NPLs and a reduction in profitability. Most Russian banks will
be loss-making in 2015 and 2016 due to increased loan-loss provisions (Figure 2). Key financial
sector indicators at October 1, 2015 (Table 1) reflect a substantial overall deterioration of performance
in the Russian banking sector since 2012, with a sharp drop of ROE and ROA levels and a rise of
NPLs. However, banks’ reported capital to risk weighted asset level declined less owing to above
referenced systematic forbearance and selected bank capital injections made by the Russian
authorities.

The challenging economic environment and asset-quality risks continued to exert pressure on
banks’ capital, but banking system remains moderately capitalized due to the government
support. According to the CBR, the average capital adequacy ratio (N1.0) for the Russian banking
system was 13% as of October 2015, and almost all banks met the 10.0% current requirement (Figure
2). The ratio has largely remained stable since the beginning of 2015 as a result of the CBR and the
Russian government introducing forbearance measures and providing capital injections to Russia’s
largest and most systemically important banks, out of RUB1 trillion allocated under the bank capital
support program. In order to strengthen the system's capitalization, the CBR announced the
introduction of additional capital requirements for all Russian banks in line with Basel III standards
over a three-year phase-in starting in January 2016, as described below.

To preserve financial stability CBR intensified its supervision of the sector, strengthened its
bank resolution framework and introduced additional capital requirements. A total of 156
credit institutions were closed between 2014 and year-to-date 2015, while 25 credit institutions have
been through ‘insolvency prevention measures’ during the same period. In October 2015, CBR
officially designated 10 banks as systemically important banks (SIBs) for the purposes of regulation
in line with the Basel III framework. The ten banks together account for more than 60 percent of total
assets in the banking system. Moreover, the CBR announced the introduction of additional capital
requirements for all Russian banks in line with Basel III standards over a three-year phase-in starting
in January 2016. The requirements consist of a capital conservation buffer and countercyclical buffer
for all banks, plus an additional surcharge for the 10 designated SIBs.
Asset quality has weakened, more visibly in retail and less so in the corporate segment, although
pressures are likely to build up further. At October 2015, reported NPLs were at 8.2% of total
loans, while the expectations are that these could hit double digits in the next 12-18 months.
Unsecured consumer finance has suffered the most with specialist retail banks reporting average
credit losses (defined as an increase in loans more than 90 days overdue plus write-offs in the
reporting period, divided by average gross loans) at around 20% in 1H15. A drop in real disposable
incomes and public spending driven by the weaker economic environment is contributing to
additional asset quality pressure, even though banks have reduced their risk appetite in new lending.
Tentative signs of asset-quality improvement were evident in 3Q15 (compared to 1H15), as newer
loan generations with better asset quality are gradually diluting the older portfolio, although the
sustainability of this trend is untested.
Given the systemic forbearance authorized, the scope of NPLs is believed to actually be higher
than reported, thus driving the very low published ROE and ROA results. The risk is that both NPLs
and non-reported NPLs will likely continue to adversely impacting the quality of banks’ balance sheet
and earnings, thus suppressing capital accumulation and selected banks’ capacity to lend.

      Box 1: Features and Estimated Impact of the Regulatory Forbearance Measures

The CBR introduced a series of forbearance measures in December 2014 through end-June 2015
to ease pressure on banks’ prudential ratios from the sharp depreciation in the Russian ruble and
the rise in local interest rates. Under forbearance, banks were: (i) granted a moratorium on
recognizing negative valuation changes for securities portfolios; (ii) allowed to price foreign
currency (FX)-denominated assets and liabilities at the October 1st 2014 exchange rates; and (iii)
allowed flexibility in loan classification, provisioning and towards restructured loans. Importantly,
the CBR has publicly estimated that regulatory forbearance sheltered bank’s capital position by up
to 2 percentage points.
Subsequently, the CBR extended the forbearance measures twice (in June and September 2015)
through January 2016. Although interest rates have declined and exchange rate has become less
volatile, the CBR’s extensions imply that the asset quality and capital positions of Russian banks
remain vulnerable to exchange-rate volatility and the economic downturn. However, the measures
are expected to be removed once the regulator judges that the banks’ vulnerability has lessened.
Through 2015 the CBR has gradually reduced the gap between prevailing market rates and the
exchange rates it allows banks to use under the measures to RUB55 to the dollar starting Oct 1,
from RUB45 when the measures were first extended by three months in June, and from RUB39
initially. This rate is used in capital ratio calculations. It is estimated that the smaller gap will reduce
the degree of capital ratio overstatement to around 60 basis points on average in the latest extension,
from around 100 basis points earlier this year, although most banks would be in compliance with
the 10% N1 regulatory minimum capital adequacy ratio even in the absence of the measures.
The removal of the forbearance on provisioning for restructured loans is likely to be a larger
negative factor for banks’ credit profiles than the lifting of the FX allowance. There has been only
very limited public disclosure of how many loans are restructured, but given pressures on bank
borrowers from currency depreciation, higher interest rates, and the economic downturn in the past
12-18 months, banks likely increased loan restructurings where practical. With the CBR waiver in
effect, newly restructured loans are likely to be only thinly provisioned. Finally, given that FX
assets are about 30% of total assets (in the corporate segment), the removal of this forbearance
would likely have a major impact on banks’ capital ratios.
