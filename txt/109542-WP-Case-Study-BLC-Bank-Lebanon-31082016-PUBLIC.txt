BLC BANK - LEBANON:
LEADING IN BANKING
ON WOMEN - A STUDY
LEARNING STUDY ON IMPACT OF BANKING ON
WOMEN PROGRAMS IN EUROPE, CENTRAL ASIA,
MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA
DISCLAIMER
IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, works wherever it can achieve the greatest impact, to create
much-needed opportunities and deliver lasting solutions for development. This report was commissioned
by IFC through its Financial Institutions Group (FIG) in Europe, Central Asia, Middle East and North
Africa (EMENA), IFC’s Development Impact Unit and IFC’s Gender Secretariat. FIG IFC works through
financial institutions to provide much-needed access to finance for millions of micro, small, and medium
enterprises – including those owned by women. The IFC Gender Secretariat in turn works with firms –
including banks – to reduce the gap between men and women as entrepreneurs, but also as employees,
corporate leaders, suppliers, consumers and community stakeholders. The conclusions and judgments

     E. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
     1.	 LESSONS LEARNED: WHAT IFC AND OTHER BANKS HAVE LEARNED FROM BLC BANK
     BLC Bank’s We Initiative has seen a lot of success. BLC Bank’s We Initiative has also provided several valuable
     lessons for IFC and for banks interested in establishing their own programs to bank women.


      KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER: Successful first-movers such as BLC Bank are critical
      in transferring knowledge, creating a blueprint and inspiring other banks


     •	 Knowledge creation: The success of BLC Bank                   of the GBA, became a board member of GBA in 2014

        in 2013. The IFC WM Value Proposition, designed               Etihad, Bank of Palestine, Access Bank and HBL to

        with best-in-class banks with successful WM operation,        beyond project implementation to secure sustainability

      CUSTOMER VALUE PROPOSITION: Don’t just ‘pink-wash’ – offer real solutions to female borrowers

 HOLISTIC STRATEGY: Aligning internal and external gender-smart approaches and following a

     2.	RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE WAY FORWARD
     Building on this success, there is an opportunity for BLC Bank to further expand its We Initiative. In the SME
     banking space, the risk-sharing facility with IFC with a carve-out for women entrepreneurs, launched mid-2016,
     offers great momentum for further program expansion and deepening. A greater expansion into the women's SME
     market will allow BLC Bank to capitalize on the higher portfolio-growth and better NPL rates of the Bank's female
     SME borrower segment. There are several aspects to consider in order to deepen the Bank’s engagement with female
     SME borrowers as well as expand into other female customer sub-segments, including in retail banking.
