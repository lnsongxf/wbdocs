THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

       To register a Pty Ltd company, the applicant must complete and submit
       an ASIC Form 201 (""Application for Registration as an Australian
       Company"") and pay the prescribed fee of AUD 457.

       Any person to be appointed as a director or secretary of the company
       must have consented in writing to that appointment. Similarly, each
       shareholder of the company must have consented to become a
       shareholder.
       At least 1 director (and, if the company has appointed secretaries, at
       least 1 secretary) must ordinarily reside in Australia. The registered
       office of the company must be an address in Australia.

       The company may adopt its own constitution or rely upon the
       Replaceable Rules in the Corporations Act 2001.

       Prior to lodging the application for registration, the applicant should
       confirm the availability of the proposed company name. If no name is
       specified, the company will simply be referred to by its Australian
       Company Number (""ACN"").

       Upon incorporation, ASIC will issue to the company a certificate of
       incorporation, which evidenced that the company has been
       incorporated on and from the date of issue.

      This procedure is required under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
      and the New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act of 1999.

      Depending on the company's circumstances and location, it must
      comply with different taxation requirements:

      - If the annual company turnover is AUD$75,000 or more, the company
      must register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) by obtaining an 11-digit
      Australian Business Number (ABN). The annual company turnover
      represents its gross business income (not its profit). Companies with
      lower annual turnover may also choose to register for the Goods and
      Services Tax.

      - The application to ABN can be submitted electronically at the Business
      Entry Point, www.abr.gov.au. If the electronic submission is successful,
      the applicant will be provided with an ABN at the end of the Internet
      session. Alternatively, a hard copy application may be submitted to the
      ATO. The ATO will then mail the ABN within 28 days of receiving the
      application.                                                             Less than one day

      -The company must deduct taxes from employee pay, provide payment
      summaries, contribute to employee superannuation and report and
      issue payments to the ATO. Companies may also register for Pay As
      You Go (PAYG) at www.abr.gov.au. Otherwise, they may register with
      the ATO by postal mail or phone or through a tax agent. State and
      territory taxes (e.g., stamp duty, payroll tax, and land tax) may also be
      imposed, with requirements differing according to company location.

      - Companies with annual turnover of AUD$75,000 or more must
      register for an ABN. Failure to do so will result in GST being levied on
      all company sales since the required date of registration even if the sale
      price of any goods or services has not been grossed up to include the
      tax. Furthermore, the company may incur penalties and interest charges
      for any overdue payments.

      registration may be found on the ATO website (www.ato.gov.au).

        Verify if a development application is required

        It is the responsibility of the applicant to contact a planner at the
        nearest Council Location before preparing a Development
        Application (DA), to check:
        * whether the proposed development is permissible;
        * whether a DA is required; and
        * how the City's planning instruments - plans, codes and policies
        - affect the proposed development.

        BuildCo should ensure that the relevant planning controls have
        been identified and satisfied.

        There are a range of planning instruments that apply to various
        types of development and locations within Sydney.

        Most environmental and planning law in Australia varies from
        one Australian state to another. In Sydney, in the state of New
   1    South Wales, development will generally be assessed under one               1 day               no charge
        of the regimes in the Environmental Planning and Assessment
        Act 1979 (Planning Act).

        The warehouse to be constructed by BuildCo is most likely to fall
        under Part 4 of the Planning Act and will most likely require
        development consent from the relevant local council. The
        Planning Act provides that, for certain types of development, the
        concurrence of an authority other than the consent authority
        must be obtained. The conditions for approval of development
        assessed under Part 4 may also require the developer to obtain
        further certificates or approvals. These will add cost and time.

        The council's local environment plan (LEP) usually identifies
        whether development consent is required. The LEP categorizes
        development as requiring consent, not requiring consent, or
        prohibited. In most cases, the zoning of the site determines the
        types of development permitted on the land. Note that the
        construction of a warehouse is a type of development that

      almost always requires consent. If the development requires
      development consent, the local council will usually be the
      consent authority. However, in some cases, another authority
      (such as a State minister) may be the consent authority.

      File development application with consent authority

      It is a legal requirement to submit digital copies of plans and
      supporting documentation.

      A minimum of six sets of drawings of the proposed
      development, plus one A4 set and a digital copy, should be
      submitted. These must include:
      • A site plan showing the location of the development within a
      building or within the locality. The site plan should also identify
      the site, streets, and adjoining properties, and include a north
      point.
      • Floor plans of the proposed buildings showing the layout,
      partitioning, room sizes and intended uses of each part of the
      building. Existing floor plans would also be useful.
      • Elevations and sections showing proposed external finishes and
      heights (not required where there is no new work proposed).
      • Drawings must be to scale, normally at 1:100.
      • Drawings are to be suitably numbered and dated.
      • Sign applications require plan and elevation details of the
      location, size and width of the sign, height above ground,
      materials, coloring, text including size of lettering, graphics and
      logo, and illumination. Council’s Signage and Advertising             60 days      AUD 7,021

      • Drawings are to be folded to A4 size with the title block to the
      front.
      • Digital copies of plans and supporting documentation must be
      submitted with every application in Portable Document Format
      (PDF) files no more than 1 MB size.

      The consent authority reviews the environmental impact
      assessment for this proposed work and considers the following:
      • Relevant planning controls
      • Likely environmental impacts
      • Suitability of the site for development
      • Submissions received
      • Other prescribed matters
      • The public interest

      If the assessment is satisfactory, the consent authority will grant
      BuildCo development consent, which may be subject to
      conditions. The Development Application will be advertised for
      approximately 21 days to give the surrounding neighbors the
      opportunity to contest the planned development in that area.
      Once the advertising period is over, it will typically take 6 weeks

      for the development certificate to be issued.

      The fee for a Development Application is governed under the
      Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2000.

      For a development with a cost over AUD 1,000,000 the
      Development Application fee will be calculated as follows:
      - Base fee = AUD 1,975
      -PlanFirst fee = AUD 640
      - Additional AUD 1.44 per AUD 1000.00 (or part thereof) by
      which the estimated cost exceeds AUD 1,000,000.00
      - Advertising fee = AUD 1,105

      Apply for a construction certificate

      After a Development Consent has been issued by the Local
      Council and before any building work is carried out, the owner
      must apply for a Construction Certificate. This certificate shows
      that the proposed development satisfies the Environmental
      Planning and Assessment Regulation 2000.

      This includes:
      • The construction plans and specifications must comply with the
      relevant standards (ie Building Code of Australia).
      • The construction plans and specifications are consistent with
      the development consent; and
      • All conditions of the development consent requiring
      compliance prior to the issuance of a construction certificate are
      finalized (i.e., payment of the long service levy has been made,
      the fire protection and structural capacity of the development is
      adequate, etc.).

      The Principal Certifying Authority (PCA) can be a Council or a          21 days      AUD 5,907

      private accredited building surveyor. If BuildCo chooses the
      Council as the PCA, an appointment form must be completed
      after the Construction Certificate is obtained. BuildCo must
      confirm with the PCA what work will be done, the fee, and any
      other requirements.

      When the City of Sydney is the PCA, the developer submits a
      Notice of Commencement of Work 2 days before work begins
      (Under Sections 81 A(2)(b)(i),(c), or (4)(b)(i),(c), 86(1)and (2) and
      109E of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979).

      The PCA will also provide a list of mandatory inspections that
      need to be carried.

      Some councils may charge a standard fee for appointment as the
      PCA. Otherwise, the fee for obtaining a construction certificate
      for a development such as a new warehouse will vary by council,
      for example:

      Additional charge = AUD 1.43 for every AUD 1,000.00 for cost
      over AUD 1,000,000.00

      Additionally, some councils, such as the Hills Shire Council, offer
      combined fees for a development application and construction
      certificate, which can help streamline the process and potentially
      reduce time and cost.

      Apply for approval of building/development plans by
      Sydney Water Quick Check Agent

      Before any construction work can be done, BuildCo must have
      the approved construction certificate plans assessed and
      stamped by a Sydney Water Quick Check Agent to verify that the
      proposed building work will not affect a Sydney Water asset
      (water supply pipe and/or drainage pipe).

      A copy of the stamped plans must be provided to the principal
      certifying authority before work commences.

      Once a PCA is appointed, it is his responsibility to provide to the
      applicant a list of the mandatory critical stage inspections (in
      accordance to Clause 162A of the Environmental Planning and
      Assessment Regulation 2000) and any other inspections
      (determined by the PCA) that will be required during
      construction of the building. The builder needs to be aware of
      these inspections as they need to be carried out at the
      appropriate time. It is the responsibility of the builder to contact
      the PCA at least 48 hours before an inspection is required.

      Inspections during construction ensure that the construction is
      consistent with what has been approved in the development
      consent and construction certificate, and that the building will
      meet acceptable standards of health, safety and amenity.

      Mandatory critical stage inspections are set according to the            1 day        AUD 281

      building class. For the case study of Doing Business, the
      warehouse is a class 7 building.

      In the case of a class 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 building, the building work on
      the development site must be inspected:
      • At the commencement of building work
      • Prior to covering any storm water drainage connections
      • After the building work has been completed and prior to any
      occupation certificate can be issued in relation to the building

      The cost of inspection when Sydney City Council is the PCA is
      AUD 309.00 per inspection including 10% GST. However, Doing
      Business does not include GST in its calculation.

      A second mandatory inspection prior to covering any storm
      water drainage connections is conducted by the PCA to ensure
      compliance with the Construction Certificate.                            1 day        AUD 281

      within 10 days of application receipt (or longer if the
      development is complex). The notice specifies charges to be paid
      and the project to be built. If construction is required,
      certification will depend on the time required for the project to
      be built and taken over by Sydney Water. BuildCo pays the fees,
      builds the project, and receives the certificate.

      Request the occupation certificate

      The authority that has approved the development may monitor
      the finished development to ensure compliance with laws and
      local planning policies. If the development does not comply with
      the development consent, the applicant can be fined (with a
      penalty notice), ordered to make changes to the development, or
      taken to the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales.
      The court may issue orders to remedy or restrain breaches of the
      development consent (e.g. orders to carry out works, cease
      certain uses of the premises, or remove the development). In
      addition, breaches of planning laws may be criminal offences.

      New South Wales planning legislation allows any person to bring
      an action to remedy or restrain a breach of development
      consent. Thus, in theory, any person may commence
      proceedings to enforce compliance with the law (a) if a relevant
      approval (such as a development consent or construction
      certificate) has not been obtained where required; or (b) if there
      has been non-compliance with the conditions of a relevant
      approval.

      Receive final inspection by PCA and obtain the final
      occupation certificate (OC)

      An occupation certificate is issued by the appointed Principal
      Certifying Authority (PCA) under the Environmental Planning and
      Assessment Act 1979 allowing a building to be used and
      occupied.
10                                                                            15 days       AUD 281
      This certificate verifies that the PCA is satisfied that the building
      is suitable to be occupied and used according to the
      requirements of the Building Code of Australia (BCA). That Code
      sets required standards for the design and construction of
      various classes of building to protect health, safety and amenity.

      There are two types of occupation certificates:

        • A final occupation certificate allows commencement of either
        the occupation or use of a new building (including alterations or
        extensions), or the new use of an existing building resulting from
        a change of its use
        • An interim occupation certificate allows the commencement of
        either the occupation or use of partially completed building, or
        of a new use of part of an existing building resulting from a
        change of use for the building

        An occupation certificate is required for any new building work
        or change of use of a building that has a development consent
        or a complying development certificate under the EP&A Act.

        Electrical contractors and ASPs should not proceed with the electrical
        installation works unless they have received a Job Number. Along with
        the Job Number, the utility will notify the customer that a Site
        Establishment fee applies (in our case, a site establishment fee will apply,
        because it is a new installation and will require a National Metering
        Identifier (NMI)). The utility also augments its network as the connection
        is 150 meters (this time estimate for augmenting network ranges from 30

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

                    Australia strengthened its secured transactions system by
                    adopting a new national legal regime governing the
DB2013
                    enforceability of security interests in personal property and
                    implementing a unified collateral registry.
                    Australia improved its credit information system through the
                    Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection)
DB2014
                    Act 2012, which permits credit bureaus to collect account
                    payment history with improved privacy protection.

 A shipment is a unit of trade. Export

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
