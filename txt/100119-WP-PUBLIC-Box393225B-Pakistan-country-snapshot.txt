     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     By mid-2013, Pakistan faced a serious economic situation. Unprecedented floods in 2010 and 2011, coupled with continuing security issues, stalling economic reform,
     falling investment and external financial inflows, increased devolution of responsibilities to the provinces, and fiscal disarray preceding elections in May 2013 posed
     critical challenges that have severely affected two major macroeconomic imbalances: by the end of the 2012/2013 international reserves were below 1.5 months of
     imports, and the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) reached 8 percent of GDP, a very high level for the third year in row. As a result of weak fundamentals, the economy also
     featured borderline stagflation: modest growth coupled with, until recently, double-digit inflation. As soon as it took office in mid-June 2013, the new government had
     to articulate an ambitious emergency response so as to prevent a balance-of-payments crisis, correct fiscal imbalances and put the economy on the road to stabilization
     and rapid recovery. This is the second in a proposed series of two development policy credits to Pakistan supporting Pakistan’s fiscally sustainable and inclusive growth
     enhancing reforms. The programmatic Development Policy Credit (DPC) is structured around two development objectives: (i) increased private- and financial-sector
     development; and (ii) expanded social protection and revenue mobilization. The program development objective is also supported by a parallel DPC in the power
     sector. The project has two components:
     ■■     Component 1 addresses these policy actions: (i) reforming SOEs with private-sector participation; and (ii) promoting access to finance and business registration.
     ■■     Component 2 addresses these additional policy actions: (iii) expanding social protection; and (iv) mobilizing revenue.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     To measure results, the following outcome indicators will be used:
     ■■     By June 2016, at least five entities privatized through strategic or equity sale from a baseline of no privatization transactions.
     ■■     By June 2016, consumers will have 100 percent access to their credit information.
     ■■     By 2016, the simple average statutory Customs tariff rate is at or lower than 10 percent, and no special (concessionary) SROs granting tax exemptions are issued.
     ■■     By June 2016, the number of unconditional cash transfer beneficiaries reaches at least 5.5 million.
     ■■     By June 2016, the overall tax collection is at least 11.5 percent of GDP.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Salient among the critical constraints to improving service delivery in Punjab is the weak performance management of departments responsible for providing public
services. Without good administrative data, it is difficult to assess whether government programs are achieving their goals, learning lessons and holding government
agencies to account. Citizens also face significant challenges to access government services due to the strongly entrenched position of field officials and other structural
handicaps, such as distance, language, cultural practices, and a lack of information about services. The instrument used for this operation is a Program for Results
credit, which by design provides financial and non-financial incentives to deliver envisaged results, and supports counterparts along the reform process through the
agreed results targets linked to disbursements. The program development objective is to improve transparency and resource management of targeted departments
of the province of Punjab. The project has the following three result areas:
■■     Result Area 1. Transparency and access to services to improve citizens’ access to information provided by targeted departments and facilitate access to key services.
■■     Result Area 2. Performance monitoring to support performance monitoring and make performance information available for decision-making.
■■     Result Area 3. Resource mobilization and value for money to improve the province’s capacity to mobilize resources and better manage expenditure through better
       urban immovable property tax collection.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Targeted government websites have been updated successfully to make more information available to citizens. The target of 25 websites for the first year was
       successfully achieved by June 30, 2014, whereas the target of 50 websites for the second year has also been overachieved. The 56 live websites for the second
       year include 25 websites of the first year, which have been duly updated over the last six months to fulfill the stipulated compliance criteria, as affirmed by third-
       party validation.
■■     For facilitation of citizens, call center services have been hired to provide information on accessing different services. Respective targets for first and second year
       have been achieved.
■■     Use of smart-phones for collection of data in the field has been expanded to more services. The target for the second year has been achieved through an expan-
       sion of the new technology in the livestock department and the addition of monitoring officers of education (i.e. the regular monitoring and data collection of
       administrative data of teachers’ and students’ attendance in schools, across all 36 districts of the province). All vaccinators are using smart phones to report their
       field activities.
■■     A functioning Punjab Procurement Regulatory Management Information System has been deployed in the field to support targeted departments in tracking their
       procurement activities. To date, 46 organizations have been trained by the Public Procurement Regulatory Agency (PPRA), whereas 30 of these organizations have
       commenced the use of PPRA MIS for targeted contracts.
■■     Work on digitization of property records for better tracking and management of Urban Immovable Property Tax has been completed in five large districts and is
       aimed to be expanded in remaining districts.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Sindh, the most industrialized and second largest province with an estimated population of 42 million, is facing important development challenges and has yet to
     realize its full potential. Improving revenue mobilization and expenditure management performance is necessary to shift upwards the provincial curve of economic
     and social growth. While federal transfers, which constitute 70 percent of the revenues of the province, provide a significant base for provincial expenditure, the total
     quantum of federal transfer revenues is not adequate to finance the existing infrastructure and social development needs. The development objective of the project is
     to strengthen public-sector performance in the province of Sindh through improved revenue generation and expenditure management. The success of the project is
     to be measured by the following outcome indicators: improved collection of sales tax on services; improved credibility of budget execution; and increased timeliness
     of contract execution. The project consists of two complementary components:
     ■■     Component 1: Results-based financing to provide an incentive for achieving selected public sector management (PSM) reforms ($40 million). The results-based
            component includes the following four focus areas: increasing tax revenue mobilization; enhancing performance of PFM systems; strengthening of public pro-
            curement performance; and improving management of the development portfolio.
     ■■     Component 2: Technical assistance (TA) to support capacity building and institutional strengthening associated with achievement of eligible PSM reforms ($10
            million). This will be used to support achievement of results in all the above eligible PSM reform areas. The TA component supports capacity building and insti-
            tutional strengthening activities related to improvement of tax collection, PFM, and procurement.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     The project became effective in April 2015.
     ■■     Sindh Tax Reform Strategy and Public Financial Management Strategies have been approved.
     ■■     The Sindh Sales Tax to Services target for 2013-2014, PKR 39 billion, was achieved. The target for 2014-2015 has also been achieved.
     ■■     Internal Audit Charter has been approved.
     ■■     Quarterly budget execution reports have been prepared and submitted to the provincial assembly.
     ■■     The government has developed a prototype dashboard for monitoring of development schemes that can serve as a strategic tool for improved monitoring of the
            development portfolio. The process of hiring a technical firm that can put this idea to practice is underway. A pilot to collect geo-tagged information on monitoring
            of around 100-200 development schemes is underway. The government has developed an experimental design to test and implement a novel information and
            communications technology-based photo monitoring system to improve construction quality of development schemes. The government is in process of finalizing
            the design and hiring a technical consultant to fine-tune and implement the aforementioned monitoring system.
     ■■     The government is hiring a call center to initiate a citizen feedback engagement process in multiple departments. The model has already been piloted in the
            Treasury Department within the Finance Department but will be scaled to other departments following hiring of the call center.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
This project is designed to support the recovery and rehabilitation needs identified by the government’s PCNA in KP, FATA and the Balochistan Development Needs
Assessment with a strategic focus on peace building. The project development objective is to strengthen the capacity of government departments in KP, FATA and
Balochistan to help support efficient delivery of the PCNA program in KP and FATA and related development programs in Balochistan.
■■     Component 1: Strengthening of the PCNA Implementation Support Units (ISUs), provision of technical assistance, and institutional building of government de-
       partments: The KP and FATA ISUs effective engagement with the line departments, development partners and civil society exhibit enhanced capacity in targeted
       development sectors responding to the PCNA and related development programs in Baclohistan.
■■     Component 2: Rapid Response Facility: Increase in the disposal of grievances and complaint resolution by specific departments in KP, Balochistan, and FATA.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Transparency: The KP Right to Information (RTI) Commission has commenced service delivery, addressing 1,193 of 1,252 information requests from citizens in
       13 of 25 districts.
■■     Accountability: In Balochistan, on the supply side, seven Citizen Facilitation Desks have been set up, one each at the Balochistan Ombudsman’s Divisional Offices,
       to make it easier for citizens to register complaints/grievances in the context of high illiteracy and low access. On the demand side, an increase in the proportion
       of funds directed to priority sectors in response to citizen opinion by 1.73 percent (Rs. 880 million or $8.7 million) shows the impact of the citizen pre-budget
       consultation on the Government of Balochistan’s budget policy FY 2014-2015. More importantly, the Government of Balochistan has made special efforts to
       increase womens’ participation in consultations on the FY 2015-2016 budget.
■■     Citizen Engagement: The KP Ehtesab Commission (new anti-corruption entity) was operationalized (September 2014) by the Search and Scrutiny Committee fully
       comprised of citizens. Furthermore, the KP Right to Public Service Commission, in collaboration with the KP RTI Commission, has inaugurated the KP Citizens
       Public Services Forum – the first in Pakistan – to deliberate on how civil society organizations can play an intermediation role Similarly, FATA and Balochistan have
       successfully piloted monitoring by citizens (mostly youth-university students).
■■     Service delivery and citizen satisfaction: KP Judicial Academy contributed to quality judgments, demonstrated by increased satisfaction – 88 percent of benefi-
       ciaries responded with a 4 rating on the sale of 1 to with 5, with 5 being maximum satisfaction. Moreover, the KP RTPS has set standards for 19 public services,
       and there are early signs of improved responsiveness in 19 pilot districts (out of 25). Similarly, the FATA Secretariat has initiated service delivery e-monitoring
       starting with delivery of domicile service as a pilot throughout FATA. Balochistan service delivery e-monitoring identified seven schools “closed,” and provided the
       information to the relevant authorities for follow up. The information is proactively disclosed (www.gsp-pmc.org.pk) by the Balochistan Monitoring & Evaluation
       (M&E) Directorate in collaboration with BUITEMS (a local academia).

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Punjab is one of the most urbanized regions of South Asia. Institutional and systemic obstacles pose significant challenges to the governance and management of
     urban areas. The project builds on the policy reforms already undertaken by GoPunjab, and focuses on supporting the management and accountability improvements
     envisaged under the second stage of the government’s urban agenda. The principal beneficiaries of the project are the five largest cities (city district governments,
     or CDGs, and their agencies) in Punjab. The project development objectives are to support Punjab’s cities in strengthening systems for improved planning, resource
     management, and accountability, and to improve the province’s capacity to respond promptly and effectively to a crisis or emergency. Project components are:
     ■■   Component 1. Performance Grant focuses on two areas of urban governance: (i) resource planning and management, seeking to improve decision-making,
          consolidate revenue sources, and strengthen resource mobilization; and (ii) transparency and voice in the preparation, monitoring, and evaluation of plans and
          programs in urban areas. This component will provide an annual grant to the project cities, based on achievement of specified annual targets against a set of
          Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) in selected governance areas.
     ■■   Component 2. Project Implementation and Capacity Building supports the cities and province to achieve the annual DLIs.
     ■■   Component 3. Contingent Emergency Response (with zero allocation) will support rapid response to disaster events by allowing for rapid reallocation of credit
          proceeds from other components under streamlined procurement and disbursement procedures, or by channeling additional funds, should they become avail-
          able as a result of the emergency.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   Resource Planning: Annual Development Plans are being consolidated each year across CDGs and entities. The mechanism for integrated development and asset
          management planning has been developed by CDGs and their entities, and approved by concerned provincial departments. It is now being operationalized.
          Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based asset inventories have also been completed.
     ■■   Procurement: Standard operating procedures for procurement and contract management to standardize these processes across the cities and their entities have
          been approved and operationalized.
     ■■   Intergovernmental Finance System: All transfer of funds from provincial government to city entities are being reported to CDGs, and are being updated on CDGs’
          and Water and Sanitation Agencies’ (WASAs) websites.
     ■■   Revenue Enhancement: Action plans for enhancing self-collected own-source revenues of CDGs and WASAs have been operationalized. Automation of Urban
          Immovable Property Tax including digitization of property ownership records and field validation has been completed for the five project cities and Sialkot (pilot
          city).
     ■■   Boundary Alignment: Action plans for the phased alignment of service delivery area up to updated city boundaries have been developed by city entities and
          approved by provincial departments.
     ■■   Public Disclosure and Access to Information: Improved mechanisms for public disclosure and access to information have been developed, adopted, and opera-
          tionalized by CDGs and WASAs.
     ■■   Accountability: Improved electronic mechanisms for telephone and web-based registration and resolution of complaints and grievances have been developed
          and operationalized at CDGs and WASAs.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Background and Objectives: Building on the initial results of the Economic Revitalization of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA Project, the government of KP asked the
MDTF for support to strengthen the province’s critical value chains in two economic sectors: marble and horticulture (food processing). These were picked following
analysis and stakeholder consultation that highlighted their potential for growth, job creation, and contributions to the provincial economy, given KP’s natural
endowments and climate. Despite this promise, the two sectors only operate at a basic level, relying on primitive technology that results in high degrees of waste (80
percent in marble and 40 percent in horticulture).
The development objective is to improve the competitiveness of the marble and food processing sectors in KP by providing shared infrastructure and relevant skills
along the marble-sector value chain and by addressing knowledge and coordination gaps along the food processing-sector value chain. There are three components:
■■   Component 1: Increasing productivity and employment in the marble sector. The objective of this component is to increase the economic value added of the

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     This project was prepared to support the creation of employment opportunities and sustainable jobs in the conflict-affected KP and FATA region. The region ranks
     considerably lower in socio-economic indicators than most parts of the country. Rates for both literacy and the participation of women in the labor force are low.
     Economic activity in the region is mostly dominated by SMEs, which suffered tremendously during the militancy crises and 2010 floods: almost 9,000 enterprises were
     damaged, rendering 40,000 people jobless. The project therefore aims to address the core strategic objective of stimulating employment and livelihood opportunities,
     as highlighted in the 2010 PCNA done jointly by the Bank and development partners. It also promotes the economic empowerment of women by assigning priority to
     eligible enterprises owned and managed by women.

     The project aims to support the creation of employment opportunities and sustainable jobs for the people of KP and FATA. It has three components:
     ■■   SME Development. This component includes a matching grants program with TA to support SMEs that have been adversely affected by the ongoing crisis in order
          to enhance their productive capacity and restore lost employment. This component will also promote economic empowerment of women by assigning priority to
          eligible enterprises owned and managed by women.
     ■■   Attracting Investments from the Diaspora. The main objective of this component is to mobilize private investment to jumpstart the rehabilitation of businesses
          and reconstruction of infrastructure, thereby creating employment.
     ■■   Institution Building to Foster Investment and Implement Regulatory Reforms. This component will support capacity building of both KP and FATA governments
          to improve the business climate and attract investment to the region.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   $8.1 million disbursed in matching grants to 1,078 SMEs across the project area, including 24 women entrepreneurs.
     ■■   Around 3,234 direct and 19,800 indirect jobs created through the rehabilitation and upgrading of SMEs.
     ■■   Four investment road shows and conferences in Karachi, Islamabad, and Dubai to showcase investment opportunities for the private sector in KP and FATA. The KP
          government succeeded in signing letters of intent worth $1.2 billion for investment in KP while in Dubai.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Dasu Hydropower Project (DHP) is part of the Indus Cascade and is also a part of least-cost solution to mitigate power shortfall and reduce cost of generation in the
country. It is a run-of-river greenfield project about 240 km upstream from Tarbela Dam. The total size of the project is 4,320 MW. However, it is optimal to develop the
project in two stages – each stage further divided into two phases of 1,080 MW each. DHP Stage 1, including six generating units of 370 MW each and 350-km, high-
voltage transmission line from Dasu to Islamabad, would cost $4.24 billion and its expected rate of return is 25 percent. It will reduce average generation cost and the
shortfall in electricity supply. Estimated cost of generation from Stage 1 is less than 3 cents/kWh compared to current average cost of 11 cents/kWh. At present, about
one-third of the demand is not being met, which is thought to have reduced GDP growth by 2 percent per annum for the past several years.

The overall project development objective is to facilitate the expansion of electricity supply of hydro-power in Pakistan. The project would also improve access to socio-
economic services for local communities in the project area and build the Water and Power Development Authority’s (WAPDA’s) capacity to prepare future hydropower
projects. This would be achieved by installing a 2,160 MW hydropower plant on the main Indus River, which can be expanded to 4,320 MW in future at very low cost.
The project is a “high-risk-high reward” operation aimed at providing low cost non-carbon renewable energy.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■    DHP-I will supply 12,225 gigawatt hours (GWh) annually (~12 percent of total existing supply) at a very low cost. It will improve socio-economic services in the
      project area directly benefiting more than 20,000 people. The project will also strengthen WAPDA to develop other large hydropower projects.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Pakistan’s electricity sector faces a large gap between supply and demand. Widespread load shedding – disconnecting the electric current when demand is greater
     than supply – is prevalent, affecting economic growth. A shift over the past decade towards expensive fuel oil has also increased the cost of electricity generation.
     Expanding hydropower generation is therefore fundamental to address Pakistan’s long-term energy issues. The project is an important element of the Bank’s energy
     sector strategy of supporting strategic investment projects in generation and transmission infrastructure that contribute to the structural shift to a low-cost, low-carbon
     fuel mix. The project involves constructing a power house, modifying a tunnel, and installing three 470 MW power units (1,410 MW) on an existing dam located 60
     km north-west of Islamabad on the River Indus. It will add 3,840 GWh of low-cost renewable energy by June 2017 during peak summer months when shortages are
     at their worst.

     The project development objective is to facilitate a sustainable expansion in Pakistan’s electricity generation capacity. The project would also strengthen WAPDA’s
     capacity to develop the country’s hydropower resources. The project has five components:
     ■■   Component 1. Construction of Power House: Covers civil works, including a power house, a penstock, and modification of intake tunnels (Number 3 and 4).
     ■■   Component 2. Power Units: Covers cost and installation of turbines, generators, transformers, ancillary electro-mechanical equipment, and a short transmission
          line.
     ■■   Component 3. Social Action Plan (SAP) & Environmental Management Plan (EMP): Covers implementation of SAP, EMP, dam safety and monitoring, and glaciers
          monitoring.
     ■■   Components 4 & 5 are for construction supervision monitoring and evaluation and for project management support & capacity building respectively.

     EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Electricity supply of 3,840 GWh of renewable energy annually to the central grid.
     ■■   Availability of 1,410 MW of additional power generation capacity during peak summer demand period.
     ■■   Reduction in the overall production cost of energy due to low-cost, low-carbon energy by 2.3 percent.
     ■■   Preparation of a large hydropower project on the Indus River and successful completion of an agreed capacity building program for WAPDA.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Natural gas is a vital source of energy in Pakistan, representing 49 percent of the country’s total primary energy supply. Natural gas is transmitted and distributed by
two companies, Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd. (SSGC) and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. (SNGPL), in the southern and northern parts of the country. Pakistan has
high levels of unaccounted for gas (UFG – the difference between metered gas received by a gas utility and volume of gas delivered to its consumers). UFG is a major
contributor to the gas supply crisis. It is typically 1-2 percent in OECD countries, compared to around 11 percent in Pakistan. UFG is mainly a result of the dilapidated
gas distribution network, inaccurate metering, and theft. Most recent FY2014 data records the UFG number at about 127 billion cubic feet in volumetric terms, or
about 11.7 percent, for both the northern (SNGPL) and southern (SSGC) networks combined For the SSGC system, the UFG for FY2014 was at 11.47 percent. The value
of country-wide UFG at the current gas prices is about $212 million. The value of LNG imports that could be avoided if all UFG was available for power generation in
FY2014 is about $ 414 billion. Additionally, the UFG problem is becoming increasingly intolerable in view of the growing gas and power shortages.
The project objective is to enhance the supply of natural gas in Pakistan by reducing the physical and commercial losses of gas in the pipeline system.
■■   Component 1: UFG Reduction: This component will finance goods and works that will help reduce UFG in the gas distribution system, including system segmen-
     tation and pressure management, pipe replacement and repair, cathodic protection, and advanced metering systems.
■■   Component 2: Appliance Efficiency Pilot Project: This component will finance modern, energy efficient gas appliances and/or retrofit appliance components for
     residential consumers in a pilot project.
■■   Component 3: Technical Assistance: This component will finance assistance to the implementation agency for improving its organizational capacity and customer
     orientation and for managing the project.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
The projects has been restructured twice – in June 2014 when all of $100 million of IDA funding was cancelled and in June 2015 when $60 million of IBRD funding
was cancelled. Both cancellations occurred because of lack of progress by SSGC. However, now SSGC has started responding. By July 2015, SSGC had gone through
its first set of procurement activity - the Bank gave No Objection Letters for $2.25 million and the first few contracts have been awarded. This is a positive sign and it is
hoped that the project will finally make some headway towards achieving its development objective.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project aims to improve the well being of unserved and underserved low-income communities. Starting with two agencies (Mohmand and Bajaur), it is now
     operational in South Waziristan Agency as well, following military operations to reestablish access, and as the government helps displaced families to return. The
     selection of these agencies in FATA was based on: (i) lack of visible progress and the perceived lack of interest from the authorities to redressing disparities, which
     undermined public trust in the ability of government institutions to meet the needs of the population; (ii) the fact that the region lags other provinces in social and
     economic indicators; (iii) the fact that the region is the most underdeveloped in Pakistan with over 60 percent of its population living below national poverty line; (iv)
     high unemployment due to militancy crises in 2009-2010; (v) the fact that military operations in 2009 did significant damage to physical infrastructure and services,
     while displacing three million people; and (vi) the additional fact that the ongoing military operation against the militants in North Waziristan Agency has once again
     pushed the region in deeper crises leading to economic, social and infrastructure destruction. The project objective is to improve livelihoods and access to basic service
     infrastructure in selected Agencies in FATA. The project components include:
     ■■     Community Development and Social Capital Building: Includes social mobilization of local communities through locally based indigenous organizations.
     ■■     Community Infrastructure and Services: Includes rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, construction of new infrastructure, and operation and maintenance

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
This project aims to reach unserved and underserved low-income communities in Southern KP. Implementation will be focused on three districts (D I Khan, Tank and
Lakki Marwat) in order to concentrate project coverage, effectively monitor the process and its impact, and demonstrate the potential of the approach. The selection of
these districts is based on several factors, including: (i) prevailing low human development indices, even before the onset of the militancy crisis (all three districts are
among the poorest 25 districts in the country); (ii) proximity to the Tribal Agencies of FATA (in particular the South Waziristan Agency, which is under ongoing military
operation); and (iii) all three districts were recipients of the largest number of Internally Displaced People (IDPs) who left the Tribal Agencies during the military
operation in 2009. The ongoing military operation has resulted in influx of more than one million IDPs to Districts D.I Khan (64,966 individuals), Tank (779 individuals),
Lakki Marwat (24,919 individuals) and Bannu (857,776 individuals). District Bannu remains host to the largest influx of these IDPs, resulting in enormous pressure
on the already fragile and weak economy as well as the infrastructure. Restructuring of the project is near completion. It will open up the livelihood menu, leading to
context-based interventions, adding District Bannu to its area of operations.

The project development objective is to strengthen the capacity of the poor to improve their livelihood options through access to social and productive infrastructure,
using participatory approaches in the selected southern districts of KP province.

The project components include:
■■     Community Development Support: Includes community mobilization and formation of economic interest groups (EIGs) at village and district levels; capacity
       building; advisory services and input support; and communications and a knowledge program.
■■     Community Driven Investment Program: Includes: (i) social infrastructure; (ii) on-farm and off-farm productive infrastructure for agriculture and its subsectors;
       and (iii) asset-building support for poorest groups.
■■     Project Implementation Support: Finances capital and incremental operating costs for implementing the project, technical assistance for quality delivery and
       impact assessments, including functional reviews and third-party monitoring, and a functional and well-communicated complaints handling system.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     8.441 community-based organizations formed (339 male, 102 female) with total membership of 14,396 (male 11,172, female 3,226).
■■     310 EIGs formed (male 175, female 135) with total EIG membership of 3,099 (male 1,883, female 1,216).
■■     1 (male) Clustered Economic Interest Group formed, with a total membership of 12.
■■     274 Community Action Plans (male 199, female 75) formed.
■■     225 infrastructure schemes completed.
■■     370 ultra poor provided goat/bucks.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Third Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund Project (PPAF III) is a continuation of the World Bank’s 13 years of engagement with the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund
     that was formed by the government in 1999 with Bank funding and support. PPAF has worked through the creation of strong outreach mechanisms, and is currently
     present in 121 districts out of a total of 135 in Pakistan, spanning all provinces. While the focus was on outreach under PPAF I and II, PPAF III brought recognition of
     the need for integration, saturation, and consolidation within the poorest districts and Union Councils of Pakistan. The project design of PPAF III adopted a holistic
     approach to local development with a strong focus on strenthening the livelihoods of the most vulnerable and poorest households, especially women. PPAF has built
     partnerships with 126 organizations that in turn have organized 475,000 community organizations. They serve as a platform for the rural poor to access markets, the
     private sector, financial services, skills, infrastructure, health, and education, and to participate in the development of their own communities and interacte with the
     government. Project Objective: Targeted poor are empowered with increased incomes, improved productive capacity and access to services to achieve sustainable
     livelihoods. This included:
     ■■     Social Mobilization and Institution Building: To target and empower the poor by supporting the formation of community organizations and their development
            into broader institutions at the village and Union Council level.
     ■■     Livelihood Enhancement and Protection: To develop the capacity, opportunities, assets and productivity of community members to reduce their vulnerability to
            shocks, improve their livelihoods initiatives and strengthen their business operations.
     ■■     Micro-credit Access: To improve access of the poor to micro-finance to enhance their capacities, productivity and returns from livelihood initiatives.
     ■■     Basic Services & Infrastructure: To establish and upgrade basic services and infrastructure to serve the poor, including basic infrastructure, integrated community
            infrastructure projects, and improved health and education facilities.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     Approximately 10 million vulnerable and marginalized people, over half of them women, have benefitted from the program interventions.
     ■■     548,871 micro-loans with a 97 percent return on investment have been given to the poor.
     ■■     125,000 children (45 percent girls) were enrolled in 896 PPAF-supported schools and 6.5 million patients (55 percent women) were treated under various ail-
            ments in 482 PPAF-supported health facilities.
     ■■     A total of 407,700 individuals, of which 61 percent are women, were trained in different employable skills.
     ■■     Productive assets have been transferred to 67,823 ultra and vulnerable poor (50 percent women).
     ■■     More than 4,600 community infrastructure sub-projects have been initiated in program areas, benefiting approximately 2 million people.
     ■■     More than 372,800 people have access to improved sanitation facilities and 1,099,284 water users, including 551,533 women, have new/improved irrigation

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The project will focus on horticulture – particularly chilies (92 percent of national production), onions (33 percent), and dates (about 50 percent) – as well as milk
production because they have a small farmer focus, significant involvement of women in production and processing, and, from a national perspective, Sindh enjoys
the greatest competitive advantage in these pro-poor production value chains. Investing in horticulture is seen to offer the best potential for increased small producer
incomes, new employment opportunities in production and processing, improved resource productivity, and enhanced micronutrient availability in the market. The
project would reach approximately 112,000 farmers covering over 66,000 ha. The project will use a value-chain approach to provide direct investment support to the
farmers and producers groups for: (i) development of more effective and efficient farming systems; (ii) introduction of technology packages for increased productivity
and value addition, and; (iii) improved market access.

The project’s objective is to improve the productivity and market access of small and medium producers in important commodity value chains. This will be achieved by:
(i) investing in knowledge and technology for producers, sub-sectors of crops and livestock; and (ii) strengthening public-sector institutions to enhance the enabling
environment for sustained sectoral growth. The project would contribute to more inclusive growth by prioritizing support for small and medium-sized producers who
are trying to compete in horticulture markets. The projects includes following components:
■■   Capacity Building and Institutional Development. The project will finance capacity building of producers through technology development, technology dis-
     semination, training, and exposure. The project would also provide institutional development for the implementing agencies and support strategic planning for
     Sindh’s agricultural sector.
■■   Investment for Agricultural Growth. This component finances specific investments in the horticulture and dairy value chains and a targeted investment to reduce
     post-harvest loss among small-holder rice growers. The component would also finance a demand driven innovation fund to support farmers and producers with
     technology innovations in the selected value chains.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   The project was declared effective in October 2014. The initial startup activities took longer than expected, including hiring staff in both Agriculture and Livestock
     departments and recruitment of project implementation consultants. Following are the highlights of activities to date:
■■   Project implementation consultants have been hired by the Department of Agriculture and are fully mobilized. The selection of project implementation consul-
     tants by Department of Livestock is at an advanced stage and it is expected that the contract may be awarded by late summer.
■■   Value chain focal groups have been notified by Government of Sindh for rice, onions, dates, and chili crops. Preliminary identification of Milk Producers Groups
     in three districts was completed by Department of Livestock.
■■   Implementation of competitive research component was initiated and the Research Technical Committee was notified by the Government of Sindh.
■■   Hiring of monitoring and evaluation consultants was initiated by project coordination unit and hiring of design and supervision consultants for civil works was
     initiated by the Department of Livestock.
■■   Social assessment is underway and the consultants have submitted inception report for government and Bank review.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project is designed to support the rehabilitation and modernization of the Jinnah Barrage on the Indus River system, while reinforcing ongoing reform to the
     water, irrigation, and drainage sector through support and the monitoring of progress. Jinnah Barrage is one of the most important structures in Pakistan’s irrigation
     system, handling all the Indus River’s water. It provides water to the Thal Canal, which covers an area of 2.1 million acres in a zone of arid desert, where crop production
     is only feasible with irrigation. About five million people in five districts live in the area and their livelihoods, directly or indirectly, depend on irrigation from canal.
     Underground water is saline in some places, and the local population depends exclusively on the canal for drinking water. The overarching project objectives are to
     assist the borrower in: (i) rehabilitating and modernizing Jinnah Barrage and carrying out affiliated works to enable reliable and uninterrupted supply of water for over
     2.1 million acres of farmland, benefitting about 600,000 farm families for irrigation and domestic water users; and (ii) building capacity to improve water resources
     and irrigation system management.
     ■■   Component 1: Rehabilitation and Modernization of Jinnah Barrage. Financing of rehabilitation and modernization of Jinnah Barrage, implementation of social
          and environmental management plans, and construction supervision and support for the project’s preparation and implementation.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Pakistan is one of the world’s most arid countries, with an extensive system of canals and hydraulic structures that are its lifeline and the backbone of its economy.
Pakistan faces many challenges, however, regarding the availability and management of its surface and groundwater resources, including: (i) low water productivity
in the agricultural sector; (ii) low water storage capability; (iii) acute power shortage requiring further development of hydropower resources; and (iv) increased
vulnerability to drought and floods, the economic, social, and ecological impacts of which are expected to be amplified by climate change; and (v) water pollution. The
project aims to improve the management and investment planning of water resources in the Indus River Basin. This includes:
Capacity Building of, and Support to, Federal Institutions in Water Resources Planning and Management: Supports capacity building for federal institutions involved
in water resources planning, management, and development.
Improvement in Water Resources Management and Development: Supports WAPDA to undertake the following activities: upgrading existing tools, databases,
models, and water resources management systems; undertaking sediment management studies for the Indus River system; and preparing a power investment plan
for the upper Indus.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The project has already met most of its expected development outcomes, enhancing the capacity of the relevant institutions to use modern water resources management
tools. Specific outcomes include:

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     A major part of Sindh’s population lives in rural areas, where poverty is pervasive. The rural poor tend to be employed mostly as agriculture wage workers. Irrigation
     and drainage are crucial to Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture, without which the countryside would be desert or salt fields. The Indus Basin Irrigation System is now the
     largest integrated irrigation network in the world. Returns to irrigation are high in Pakistan but investment for the last 30 years has been weak. Despite the large
     need to expand water supplies, improve water management and control, and to upgrade and modernize the century old irrigation system, investment has not been
     forthcoming and the network has deteriorated. The government must maintain a minimum level of spending on the sector to avoid total collapse of its irrigation and
     drainage systems, which would return the countryside to desert that would be hard, if not impossible, to ever reclaim. The Water Sector Improvement Phase-I Project
     would make a start through a mix of institutional strengthening, capacity building and investments in the irrigation sector. This project consolidates the irrigation
     reforms program and makes it sustainable through participatory irrigation management practices.
     The project’s main objective is to improve the productivity of water use in irrigated agriculture. This will be achieved through improved physical delivery efficiency
     and irrigation practices, crop diversification and effective application of inputs, which will translate into greater agricultural output per unit of water used. The project
     contributes to increased agricultural production, employment and incomes, higher living standards and positive environmental outcomes. This is being achieved by:
     ■■   Installation of High Efficiency Irrigation Systems.
     ■■   Improvement of Community Irrigation Systems.
     ■■   Improved Agriculture Technology/Practices and Monitoring and Evaluation.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   As a result of improved availability, reliability and equity of irrigation water deliveries, agricultural productivity has increased on a total of 1.17 million hectares,
          benefiting over 380,000 farm-families.
     ■■    The investment improved the reliability and timely availability of irrigation water at farm level, which also made the farmers confident to shift to higher-value
          crops such as orchard and vegetables. The crop yields increase is about 3 percent.
     ■■   Works on the two large International Competitive Bidding civil works contract are completed. All major hydraulic structures have been commissioned. The overall
          quality of structures and mechanical works seen during the recent supervision mission are commendable, the earthworks on embankments are satisfactory, and
          the quality of construction is high.
     ■■   Farmer organization training in operational areas.
     ■■   Many farmer organizations have held elections and exposure visits, and participated in farmer festivals.
     ■■   Women’s participation in farmer organizations enhanced.
     ■■   Additional financing approved by the Board in December 2014; Credit signed in March 2015 and effective since May 2015.
     ■■   Prequalification of three ICB contracts for Ghotki, Left Bank and Nara canal completed.
     ■■   Bid opening for the Ghotki and Left Bank main canals was planned for August 2015.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The direct beneficiaries are about 580,000 farm families (four million people across Punjab). About 17,500 families would be direct beneficiaries of high efficiency
irrigation systems (HEIS), about 90,000 families would benefit from the laser leveling system, and about 475,000 families from the watercourse improvement
program. A very large population would be indirect beneficiaries of the project, with about 13 million additional person days of employment as farm labor for
agricultural operations. More women farmers are likely to opt for the HEIS, as it does not require night irrigation or other field work generally not considered culturally
appropriate for women (e.g., diversion of water from channels, tilling etc). HEIS can easily be operated by one person and require just a few hours of water during the
day. In contrast, water supply according to the traditional warabandi method of irrigation goes over a 24-hour rotation period, and about half of the shareholders get
water at night.

The project’s main objective is to improve the productivity of water use in irrigated agriculture. This will be achieved through improved physical delivery efficiency
and irrigation practices, crop diversification and effective application of inputs, which will translate into greater agricultural output per unit of water used. The project
contributes to increased agricultural production, employment and incomes, higher living standards and positive environmental outcomes. This is being achieved by:
■■   Installation of High Efficiency Irrigation Systems.
■■   Improvement of Community Irrigation Systems.
■■   Improved Agriculture Technology/Practices and Monitoring and Evaluation.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
Since effectiveness, the project has been off to a very good start due to implementation readiness and preparation by the government. Following are the highlights of
implementation progress to date:
■■   HEIS have been installed over 14,805 acres.
■■   About 2,801 laser land leveling units have been provided to the beneficiaries.
■■   Improvement of community watercourses is progressing well and over 53 percent physical progress is achieved. About 4,791 watercourse schemes have been
     improved, and works are at various stages on another 2,693 watercourses schemes.
■■   M&E consultants have started working and preparing the baseline report.
■■   Pilots for field irrigation system using gated pipes and provision of equipment for improving irrigation scheduling are starting soon.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Barrages are strategic assets of Sindh and millions of people depend on the water that is controlled, diverted, and managed by them. Their continued operation and
     management require specific expertise, experience, decision making, and continuity. Three large barrages were built between 1932 and 1962 on the Indus River in
     Sindh Province. The northern one, Guddu Barrage, has developed major safety issues. This project will finance rehabilitation of the Guddu Barrage. The Guddu Barrage
     constitutes the most strategic component of the large Indus Basin Irrigation System. The effective operations and structural stability are important for agricultural
     production and for averting potential disaster during floods. Climate variability will further add risks by changing the frequency and intensity of extreme events such
     as floods and droughts. There are serious operational difficulties and safety issues. The most severe problems include: (i) up to 60 percent of the steel used for the 65
     gates on the main barrage are badly rusted; and (ii) the lifting mechanisms are badly corroded, with a strong possibility of failure. Since the rate of corrosion cannot be
     slowed, it is considered likely that the gates will fail during normal operation. There is already a risk now that the gates may fail during a flood event that necessitates
     opening and closing. Such a failure will progressively affect water supplies to all the irrigated areas supplied by the barrage. Structural and operational interventions
     are therefore required to manage flows to the off-taking canals.
     The project objective are to improve the reliability and safety of the Guddu Barrage and strengthen the Sindh Irrigation Department’s capacity to operate and manage
     the barrage. The primary beneficiaries include: (i) over 2.6 million people, across 1.2 million ha who will receive reliable supply of water; and (ii) local communities in
     flood-vulnerable areas that will benefit from improvement in flood management and reduction in risks of embankment breaches since the capacity of the barrage to
     pass flood waters will be improved.

     EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   244,480 farmers’ households provided with reliable irrigation water.
     ■■   1 million ha provided with reliable irrigation water.
     ■■   Improved operation and maintenance.
     ■■   65 barrage gates and mechanical lifting equipment replaced.
     ■■   25 main canal head regulator gates replaced.
     ■■   40 km of embankments rehabilitated.
     ■■   Barrage management organization established within Irrigation and Power Department.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The project carries out emergency rebuilding of priority roads damaged during the conflict in the Province of KP. It focuses on early recovery priorities agreed between
the government of KP and the World Bank, as administrator of the MDTF. Given the deep crisis, exacerbated by devastating 2010 floods, the project’s first priority was
the restoration and improvement of pedestrian and vehicle access to some of the province’s poorest areas in the Swat Valley. The project aims to rehabilitate priority
damaged roads and bridges to make them fully operational, guaranteeing access 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to improve access and mobility. The project would
benefit about 300,000 people. The expected outcome is improved traffic flow, resulting in reduced vehicle operating costs and travel time for road users. (The project
supports Pillar1: Restoration of Damaged Infrastructure and Disrupted Services of the MDTF Financing Strategy). The project development objective is to enable the
population along the project corridor to benefit from year-round improved access and mobility through reconstruction of priority damaged roads and bridges in the
conflict-hit areas.
The original project (a grant of $8 million to finance widening and reconstruction of 10.5 km of Provincial Highway S-3B) was approved by the Bank’s regional vice
president for the South Asia region on July 16, 2011. Due to highly satisfactory implementation performance, the MDTF Steering Committee agreed to provide
additional financing to the project. The Bank approved the first additional financing in an amount of $9.1 million on December 13, 2013, to finance widening and
reconstruction of 14.7 km of S-3B. Finally, the Bank approved the second additional financing in an amount of $9 million on April 19, 2014, to finance costs associated
with widening and reconstruction of additional 10.7 km of S-3B. Legal agreements were signed on May 30, 2014. The second batch of additional financing has also
been fully disbursed.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   The original target of 40.8 km of the provincial highway S-3B has been reconstructed. An additional 9.3 km is under construction from project savings.
■■   Due to the reconstruction of the road, several social and commercial activities have been established, including: three schools; three medical and health care
     centers; eight grocery stores; two auto workshops; one restaurant; and three farms.
■■   Improved traffic flow resulting in reduced vehicle operating costs and travel time for road users.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     FATA is the most underdeveloped region in Pakistan with over 60 percent of its population living below national poverty line. Most people depend on subsistence
     agriculture and livestock, and the visible lack of progress means that even small shocks translate into large increases in destitution that deepen poverty. Transport in
     the crisis area of FATA depends solely on roads. The total network is about 6,578 km, of which about 66 percent is paved and primarily comprises single lane roads.
     Accessibility provided by the network is limited – road density is low (0.24 km/square km) and FATA does not compare favorably with rest of Pakistan (0.32 km/square
     km). The project aims to improve connectivity in the Bajaur and Orakzai Agencies of FATA by building all weather-paved rural roads on existing non-motor accessible
     earthen tracks.

     The project focuses on early recovery priorities agreed between the FATA authorities and the World Bank as the administrator of the MDTF. (The project supports Pillar1:
     Restoration of Damaged Infrastructure and Disrupted Services of the MDTF Financing Strategy). The project aims to improve connectivity through construction of about
     50 km of all-weather paved rural roads. The expected outcome is an increase in both the share of population with all-season access and the number of motorized trips
     taken by beneficiaries living along the rural roads. The anticipated results will support governmental efforts to help maintain economic activity and improve social and
     political stability in FATA.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   The project is financing construction of seven rural roads (three in Bajaur and four in Orakzai Agency). The total length of these seven rural roads is about 50 km.
     ■■   Roughly 45 km of priority rural roads have been constructed in the area benefitting a total of 400,000 inhabitants of the area.

berths outside the port (berths one to five) in order to reduce draught and proceed to resume operations at berths located inside the port with lesser draft (berths 22
and 23 with draughts of 7.3 meters). Given that the waterfront berths 15 to 17A are out of service, there is increasing congestion and delays to vessel operations. The
rehabilitation of berths 15 to 17A will make it possible to dredge to a depth of 16 meters, create a larger apron area with new bollards and a wide paved area, as well
as a uniform quay wall. The new facility will also provide an ample backyard area, permitting flexible management of the new port infrastructure.
The project development objective is to replace the lost port capacity and reduce shipping costs to the Pakistan economy through the reconstruction of the failed
berths at Karachi port, and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of port operations, while enhancing environmental sustainability. The project has two components:
■■    Component 1. Financing reconstruction of berths 15 to 17A on the East Wharf at Karachi Port.
■■    Component 2. Institutional strengthening, addressing three main area: (i) preparing a five-year business plan and vision document; (ii) strengthening port
      environmental management to eventually comply with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) international standards; and (iii) Improving financial
      management and planning to meet International Financing Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounting standards and effectively utilize port revenues.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■    Reduction in the ship-waiting-to-service time ratio for the project berths. This will be measured after the project births become operational. The civil work for re-
      construction is progressing well, with the contractor achieving nearly 83 percent progress by the end of July 2015. Three berths (15 to 17) completed and handed
      over to operations division in December 2014.
■■    Improvement in occupancy and rate of cargo handling at the project berths. To be measured after they become operational.
■■    Increase in through-put of the project berths. This will be measured after they become operational.
■■    Consultant firm hired to prepare the Karachi Port Trust’s (KPT) Strategic/Business Development Plan completed the diagnostic report. The strategic options report
      under preparation and was expected to be submitted to KPT by end August 2015.
■■    Development and implementation of an environmental management system. Consultant firm completed gap analysis, and documentation. Training and report
      generation underway. It is expected that ISO certification audit will be conducted by November 2015.
■■    KPT’s financial audits fully compliant with IFRS. KPT has fulfilled the requirement to move towards IFRS-compliant accounts well before the target date. KPT’s fiscal
      2010 and fiscal 2011 financial statements were IFRS compliant. The subsequent statements are also being prepared to comply with IFRS.
■■    Three additional consultancies agreed, and procurement process initiated.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The government of Punjab views the project as a flagship in its efforts to improve the quality of government services provided to the population. The traditional
     land records system had changed little for hundreds of years. Under that system, land records were in the possession of the patwari (village accountant) with little
     to no transparency or quality control. The land records were maintained in sacks and moved from place to place as the patwari carried out his functions. The result
     was long delays to obtain copies of land records by land owners, and lengthy periods to carry out land transactions. Further, the traditional land records system was
     a major source of bribes and corruption, and rated very poorly in customer satisfaction surveys. The weaknesses of the traditional system increasingly hampered the
     development of modern markets for land and real estate. The first half of the project focused on: (i) development, testing, and proving the land records software; (ii)
     introduction of relevant legal and regulatory reforms; and (iii) introduction of institutional changes including creation of a Land Records Cadre. The second half of
     the project has focused on: (i) rolling out the automated land records system throughout the province; (ii) developing automated linkages to the deeds registration
     system; and (iii) testing linkages with GIS.

     The project development objective is to improve the land records service delivery of the province of Punjab, contributing to long-lasting tenure security and more
     efficient operation of land markets. The project upgrades the land records management system for the province by revising current business processes and associated
     laws and regulations, establishing service centers where land records are maintained and available to the public in digital form, and establishes linkages between the
     land records system and the system for registration of deeds. The project has four components:
     ■■   Component 1. Business Process Improvement and Capacity Enhancement.
     ■■   Component 2. Development and Deployment of the New Land Records management information system focusing on development, testing and implementa-
          tion of the land records software, data entry and verification of existing paper-based land records, and construction and equipping of new Land Records Service
          Centers (LRSCs);
     ■■   Component 3. Service Delivery and Information Campaigns focusing on operation of the new LRSCs and stakeholder outreach.
     ■■   Component 4. Project Management

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   Records of rights (fards) provided to customers within a 30-minute target.
     ■■   Time required for land transactions reduced from two to three months to generally less than one week for cases other than inheritance or splitting of a land parcel.
     ■■   High level of customer satisfaction with the new system, in excess of the 95 percent target.
     ■■   A greater sense of tenure security coming from use of the new automated system.
     ■■   The automated land records system has been developed, tested, and proven in practice. As of July 31, 2015, data entry was completed in over 99 percent of
          all mauzas, data verification completed in 90 percent, and 83 percent of all mauzas were online in the new automated land records system. Government has
          requested a six-month extension of closing date to June 30, 2016, to allow for completion of the more challenging peri-urban mauzas and province-wide auto-
          mated linkage with the deeds registration system, and for expanded roll out of the GIS program.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
FATA lags behind other regions of Pakistan across a wide range of social and economic indicators, and have the lowest level of urbanization. Moreover, post-9/11
events have severely impacted FATA and led to acute destabilization of the region. The project development objective is to improve urban services and management
in Khar, Bajaur Agency, and develop a framework for urban management in FATA. The project is envisaged as an urban community-driven development operation,
where investment needs are being identified and prioritized by the citizens of Khar town.
■■   Component 1. Priority Infrastructure Investment Projects: The component supports priority infrastructure investments in Khar town in Bajaur Agency, including
     rehabilitation, reconstruction, expansion, and upgrading of urban municipal infrastructure and services (water supply, streetlights, roads, streets, drains, rescue
     and firefighting, and solid waste collection for the existing population of the urban center).
■■   Component 2. Technical Assistance and Implementation Support: This component supports: (i) design and development of an overall urban management
     framework to be implemented under the TARUCCI program in all 14 towns in FATA; and (ii) detailing the implementation plan for the pilot center (Khar, Bajaur
     Agency). It also supports institutional strengthening of the implementing agencies and building essential urban management competencies at the local govern-
     ment level in Khar.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   Structure Plan developed for Khar, detailing: (i) priority service delivery needs based on feedback received from the local community through focus group discus-
     sions and a household survey; (ii) critical baseline information on service delivery coverage and quality; (iii) GIS maps with spatial representation of population
     distribution, growth trends, and existing services; (iv) urban structure plan and analysis of likely growth and development scenarios; and (v) scope and targets for
     service delivery improvements to be achieved through priority infrastructure investments.
■■   Four additional structure plans being finalized to facilitate ready scaling up of the government’s Tribal Areas’ Rural-to-Urban Centers Conversion Initiative pro-
     gram to four additional towns, based on evidence of existing service delivery gaps and priorities expressed by communities.
■■   Rehabilitation and improvement of 4.3 km of all-season roads, providing access within 500 meters of places of residence to an estimated 40,000 beneficiaries
     in Khar.
■■   450 solar powered street lights installed in Khar, contributing to improved security and economic activity after dark; installation of an additional 72 streetlights
     underway.
■■   Infrastructure investments for providing/restoring 900 piped water supply connections nearing completion with conventional tube wells, augmented by solar
     powered systems in view of frequent power cuts and breakdowns in Khar.
■■   3,500 square meters of streets paved with improved drains, providing full benefits to the population.
■■   Municipal Committee (MC-local government), Khar operationalized, including recruitment of essential staff and renovation and furnishing of office building.
■■   A grievance redress and complaint resolution mechanism established at MC, Khar using a telephone short code along with dedicated staff.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Balochistan is geographically the largest province of Pakistan, comprising roughly 48 percent of its land but with the lowest share of population, at around 5 percent.
     The province has been severely affected for many years by security and political conflict, harming economic growth. The situation is exacerbated by poor communication
     and road infrastructure, as well as weak governance structures. Balochistan has always ranked the lowest in the country in education, with access to schools limited
     to only 60 percent of its settlements. Existing schools lack basic facilities and learning materials. Education indictors for girls are the lowest in the country, with girls’
     net enrollment rate (NER) only 40 percent, and in some parts of the province as low as 7 percent. In response to a request by the Government of Pakistan, a MDTF was
     established to finance critical investments in support of reconstruction and peace building in crisis-affected areas of Pakistan, which included Balochistan province. A
     Balochistan Development Needs Assessment was conducted by the Bank in 2012 and the government requested funds to support access to girls’ education under the
     MDTF. The project development objective is to improve access to education and retention of children in schools, with a special emphasis on girls, in the province of
     Balochistan. The main components of the project are:
     ■■   Component 1 – Construction of building facilities for 130 shelter-less girls’ schools: The aim is to improve provision of school infrastructure and help the govern-
          ment to: (i) confirm functionality of schools through third party assessment; (ii) establish criteria to prioritize schools on a needs basis; and (iii) involve communi-
          ties in school management.
     ■■   Component 2 – Provision of missing facilities for 200 girls’ schools: Provide missing facilities including toilets, boundary walls, additional rooms, blackboards,
          furniture, and drinking water in girls’ primary and middle schools identified for rehabilitation.
     ■■   Component 3 – Establishment of 150 new government primary schools with community participation: This component supports government policy to establish
          new gender free schools on a demand basis, with active community participation in the management of schools to ensure local support and protection for the
          facility, children and teachers.
     ■■   Component 4 – Technical Assistance to the Education Department for implementation and monitoring at the district level: Support the establishment of systems
          and procedures for effective planning and implementation of construction and rehabilitation activities; introduce new or innovative approaches for community-
          government partnerships; establish robust monitoring systems, including by third parties; technical assistance; and the development of a communications
          strategy.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     The project was able to achieve the target of retaining 85 percent of the enrolled children in target schools. Construction was completed on 125 shelter-less school
     sites, missing facilities (boundary wall, toilets, water facility) were provided in 225 schools and 143 new schools were established with community participation. The
     project exceeded the target of students benefitting from the improved facilities by 15,000 children, mainly due to the opening of new schools and active participation
     of communities in enrolling children into the schools. This was mainly achieved towards the end of the project period upon successful completion of construction,
     rehabilitation, and handover of school facilities to the district education authorities. A very good response in enrollments was observed in the communities that had
     no existing school facility.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Pakistan’s performance in school participation has been poor in absolute terms, relative to other countries in the region, and relative to developing countries at its
level of per capita income. Based on existing trends, Pakistan is unlikely to meet the MDGs of universal primary education by 2015. Sindh is one of the four provinces
of Pakistan where the education indicators remain low. In 2010/11, NERs at the primary (ages 6–10, grades 1–5), middle (ages 11–13, grades 6–8), and high school
(ages 14–15, grades 9–10) levels in the province were 62 percent, 36 percent, and 23 percent, respectively. Evidence suggests that children from poor households and
girls in rural areas experience the largest participation shortfalls. There are also significant differences in school participation rates across the province’s 23 districts.
In FY2007/2008, the Sindh government initiated a multifaceted, medium-term sector reform program for primary and secondary education called the Sindh Education
Sector Reform Program (SERP). The Bank provided financial support to SERP through the Sindh Education Sector Development Policy Credit (SEDPC) in FY2007/2008
and the Sindh Education Sector Project (SESP) between FY2008/2009–FY2011/2012.

SERP II is an evolutionary next step by the government, shaped by the lessons learned in the delivery of the previous programs. One of the key lessons was that to
raise government school performance, additional and potentially more powerful actions to strengthen administration systems, governance and accountability, are
required. Under SERP II, the government plans to maximize school reform efforts by simultaneously improving governance and management of service delivery.
The project development objective is to raise school participation by improving sector governance and accountability, strengthening administrative systems and
measuring student achievement. It is a results-based financing project with 10 DLIs priced equally. A specific investment credit supports SERP II over the four-year
period FY2011/2012–FY2015/2016.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The Pakistan Social and Living Measurement Survey 2014 results indicate lagging trend in enrollment targets for girls and boys in the Sindh province. However,
absolute figures in the census data for public sector schools show an increase in numbers from the previous year census. The assessment of program activities in May/
June 2015 indicated that six out of the 10 DLIs have been fully met, three have been partially met, and one was unmet. The government is completing the activities in
the lagging DLIs and is planning to submit evidence of completion for the activities by end September 2015.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Government of Pakistan joined the Global Partnership for Education in 2012 and an allocation of $100 million has been made available for Pakistan. The provinces
     of Sindh ($66 million) and Balochistan ($34 million) were shortlisted to receive the financial grant after detailed discussions between the development partners and
     the Government of Pakistan. The World Bank has agreed to be the supervising entity for the proposed grant; UNICEF is the coordinating agency for the grant.
     The project will benefit four groups. First, children who will enroll in the newly established schools and those already enrolled in government schools (grades K through
     10) will benefit from improved school environments and access to teaching learning materials. Second, girls who did not have the opportunity to enroll in higher
     grades will benefit from an opportunity through up gradation of girls schools. Third, teachers and education managers will benefit from professional development,
     provision of teaching learning material, and capacity-building programs. Finally, the communities who receive project interventions, especially the parents of the
     children enrolled in schools, are expected to benefit from access to better quality education.

     The project development objective is to increase school enrollment and retention in project-supported schools, with a special focus on girls’ participation, and to
     develop mechanisms for information collection and use for improved management of education.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     The project was signed on March 25, 2015, and has made a good start. The project management unit has developed a detailed project implementation plan providing
     activity level details, opened the foreign currency assignment account with necessary government approvals, prepared staffing plans and terms of reference and is
     initiating the staff hiring process. The staff hiring is expected to be completed by August 2015 through transfer of staff from the Promoting Girls Education Project as
     well as fresh hiring. The project environment and social impact assessment has been prepared, adopted and disclosed on the website (www.pgeb.edu.pk). However,
     because of the lapsed loan issue in the Bank’s Pakistan portfolio, the World Bank has not provided advance funds to the project, which may impact the progress of the
     project in the coming months.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The proposed project (S-GPE) is additional to the Second Sindh Education Sector Project (SEP II). The state government reform program has received strong support
from development partners, including the World Bank and the EU. The World Bank continues its support to the state’s reform program through SEP II, a $400 million
IDA Credit, which became effective in March 19, 2014. It aims to raise school participation by improving sector governance and accountability, and strengthening
administrative systems, and to measure student achievement. The S-GPE and SEP II are complementary and mutually enforcing; in particular, S-GPE interventions are
expected to enhance the impact of key reforms supported under SEP II as well as the SESP. S-GPE implementation will be consistent with SEP II in terms of using the
results-based disbursement modality and sharing the same implementing entity.

The project supports the implementation of the SESP. The project development objective is to strengthen the institutional capacity to generate, disseminate, and use
information to support the implementation of key reforms under SESP. Progress towards the achievement of the project development objective will be measured by
the following indicators:
■■   Number of districts for which monitoring data of at least 70 percent of schools is collected by Director General Monitoring and Evaluation.
■■   Number of districts for which monitoring data is analyzed and disseminated to Education and Literacy Department (ELD) management and district administrators.
■■   Number of districts that submitted Human Resource and Management Information System (HRMIS) reports to ELD. The project supports the implementation of
     the SESP.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   The government has had a good start in initiating HRMIS and setting up of the Sindh School Monitoring System (SSMS). The SSMS activity has been initiated on
     a pilot basis in five districts across Sindh and a data dashboard for maintaining monthly visit report data has been created. However, the teams of both these units
     need to be fully staffed to ensure program activities can continue as planned.
■■   A communication team has been created in the Reform
■■   Support Unit and a draft communication strategy has been prepared and presented to ELD. Implementation on the strategy needs to be planned by the depart-
     ment both for internal and external communications. An advocacy and awareness raising campaign has been initiated for certain key reform areas.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     This project recognizes: the Government of Sindh’s strong interest in strengthening technical and vocational education and training (TVET); that the labor force’s lack
     of skills poses significant constraints; and that the TVET sector faces substantial challenges. Project design takes into account the need for both structural reforms to
     strengthen the quality and relevance of TVET (components 2 and 3), and short-term improvements in the provision of training (component 1).
     The project development objective is to support the Government of Sindh in strengthening its training programs to improve the skills and employability of trainees.
     The project includes three components:
     ■■   Component 1. Supporting the provision and relevance of short-term vocational training to 45,000 targeted trainees through private and public training providers
          selected through a competitive process.
     ■■   Component 2. Results-based support for competitively selected programs and training providers to develop market-driven training with a focus on curriculum
          development and equipment provision. (19 percent of funding)
     ■■   Component 3. Technical assistance to strengthen capacity of the Sindh Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (STEVTA) to implement component
          two activities.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   Seventy training programs competitively selected. Institute Management Committees with private-sector representation have been established in each of the
          selected training institutes. One of the four DLIs has been achieved, and disbursements have been made accordingly.
     ■■   A technical assistance firm has supported STEVTA in the development of demand-responsive curricula and equipment lists for the training programs selected un-
          der component two of the project. The procurement for the equipment is underway and relevant schools are being refurbished, all to be completed by November
          2015.
     ■■   Over 45,000 youth have received short-term training and an additional 22,000 are currently enrolled in training programs expected to be completed by Sep-
          tember 2015.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Slow progress on improvements in human development indicators undermines Pakistan’s, and hence the Punjab’s, competitiveness, economic growth, and efforts
to alleviate poverty. While Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, still provides the largest share in terms of GDP, it has experienced a sharp decline in economic
growth since 2004/2005, remaining under 4 percent in each of the last four years. To address constraints to growth in the province, the Government of the Punjab has
prepared an ambitious growth strategy (2015-18) that identifies skills development as one of the key pillars of growth. The main challenges in the skills development
sector of Punjab include: a limited supply of skilled workers; a weak institutional framework; a lack of evidence-based policy making; low quality and relevance of
training; market failures in industry-provision of training; and low access to skills training. The project aims to support the state government’s reform agenda in the
skills sector by improving training provision of existing public-training providers with a focus on employability, as well as encouraging private-sector provision of
training.
The project development objective is to improve the quality and labor market relevance of skills training programs in priority sectors in the Punjab, as well as access
to those programs.
■■   Component 1 on Improving and Expanding Market-Relevant Skills Training, uses results-based financing to support the achievement of the government’s Growth
     Strategy and the Punjab’s Skills Development Strategy and Vision 2018 objectives through five sub-components along three strategic lines: (i) strengthening the
     skills training system; (ii) improving the quality and relevance of skills training; and (iii) increasing access to market-relevant trades. For each sub-component, a
     DLI has been identified with time-bound targets.
■■   Component 2 provides technical assistance and capacity building required to enable the achievement of the DLIs, and to manage project implementation, using
     a traditional disbursement mode based on unaudited interim financial reports.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The project became effective on July 4, 2015, and work on the implementation of all Year 1 DLIs is underway. This includes:
■■   Roll out of the Competency Based Training Assessment plan by Punjab Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (P-TEVTA).
■■   Functional reviews and preparatory work for the formulation of Punjab Skills Authority.
■■   Increased collaboration between training providers and employers to improve quality and relevance of training delivery. P-TEVTA’s Board of Management has
     already approved a partnership framework and related implementation plan to engage with the industry; and at least one partnership agreement will be signed
     by October 2015.
■■   Training of 5,000 additional students in market-relevant trades.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Pakistan’s performance in education has generally been poor relative to other countries in South Asia, and relative to other developing countries at its level of per
     capita income. Shortfalls persist in school participation, attainment, and student achievement in Punjab province. In 2010/2011, NERs at the primary, middle, and
     high school levels were 70 percent, 37 percent, and 25 percent, respectively. The main concern is for children who never go to school: in 2010/2011, 27 percent of
     6-10 year olds, and 19 percent of 11-15 year olds, had never been to school. The Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) has been underway since 2003.
     Building on the institutional, administrative, and program foundations of PESRP, the provincial government developed its next medium-term reform program, the
     Second Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP II) to accelerate the pace of progress towards its education sector goals. The project development objective
     of PERSP II is to support the education sector reform program of the Government of Punjab to increase child school participation at multiple levels, as well as student
     achievement. The project includes:
     ■■   Component 1. Results-Based: Promoting student outcomes, as well as teacher quality and performance, through initiatives that include: (i) introducing test-based
          teacher recruitment; (ii) strengthening the system of field-based advisory support to teachers in the classroom in poor schools with low achievement; (iii) fixing
          and reallocating teaching posts and teachers at the school level; and (iv) offering supplemental cash transfers tied to attendance in rural districts where there has
          been poor secondary school attendance for girls.
     ■■   Component 2. Technical Assistance: Financing essential advisory, technical, and capacity-building support

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   Regular funds are transferred to schools in 18 districts to meet non-salary related spending (e.g., teaching and learning materials and school maintenance) with
          autonomy over spending. School Councils revitalized with responsibility for management of non-salary budgets.
     ■■   Successful leveraging of the private sector through a restructured Punjab Education Foundation (PEF) with more than 1.6 million students enrolled in low-cost
          private schools supported by public financing. Strong accountability regime has been established for PPP through PEF. In addition, 293,000 tuition-replacement
          vouchers given to poor children in urban slum areas to access private schools.
     ■■   Establishment of independent monitoring system that collects monthly data on school performance indicators
     ■■   District and school performance report cards distributed to all schools in the province for better accountability.
     ■■   A test-based teacher recruitment system has been established. (More than 500,000 candidates have been tested to qualify for a teaching post in the province;
          more than 22,246 teachers have been recruited based on merit to date.). In addition, a teacher rationalization policy has been implemented by the Government
          of Punjab to ensure efficient utilization of resources.
     ■■   Helped to establish a student assessment system to test about five million students in grades 5 and 8 annually.
     ■■   More than 393,000 girls are receiving cash stipends for attending middle and high schools in the worst performing districts of the province.
     ■■   Teacher performance bonus program piloted and evaluated for impact on key outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The tertiary education sector in Pakistan has suffered from many years of neglect, resulting in poor performance and results compared to countries with similar
development and income levels. This is one of the factors affecting Pakistan’s competitiveness, economic growth, and poverty reduction objectives. To address
challenges in higher education, the government has developed a higher education development program (outlined in the second Medium Term Development
Framework for Higher Education for 2011-2015 (MDTF-HE II)). The project is a response to the government’s request for continued financial support by the Bank to
implement its tertiary education reform program, building on the experience of the Bank-financed Higher Education Support Project. It supports the implementation
of the first phase of the government’s higher education development program outlined in the MTDF-HE II and uses results-based financing. The project objective is to
improve teaching, learning, and research conditions to enhance access to and the quality and relevance of tertiary education. It supports government reform in tertiary
education under two components:
■■     Component 1 - Program Financing. This consists of four sub-components, aligned with the government’s overall program: (i) improved fiscal sustainability and
       expenditure effectiveness; (ii) enhanced quality and relevance of teaching and research; (iii) improved equitable access; and (iv) strengthened governance and
       management.
■■     Component 2 - Capacity Building, Policy Design, and Monitoring and Evaluation
The project was restructured in January 2014. The objective of the restructuring was to improve implementation performance, which had suffered from the start of the
project due to uncertainty regarding the proposed devolution of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) following the 18th Amendment and changes in the HEC
senior management. The restructuring, which was successful in jump-starting project implementation, included the cancellation of $77.82 million and the revision
of selected DLIs.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Punjab, with 60 percent of the total population, holds the key to Pakistan’s progress towards attaining the MDGs. Punjab’s overall health outcomes are comparable
     to the national average or slightly better than other provinces, but the pace of change remains slow and uneven with significant disparities among regions, rural and
     urban areas, and by economic status. The quality of care in government facilities is sub-optimal, resulting in low use of health services provided by the public sector. The
     Government of Punjab has prepared the Punjab Health Sector Strategy (HSS) 2012-2020, based on the health system framework, outlining a clear strategic direction
     focused on results. The project envisages supporting implementation of the reforms and strengthening the health system to undertake stewardship functions devolved
     under the 18th Amendment to the Constitution.
     The project development objective is to support implementation of the Punjab Health Sector Strategy by focusing on improving coverage and use of quality essential
     health services, particularly in low performing districts of Punjab. The project focuses on building the capacity and systems to strengthen accountability and stewardship
     in the Department of Health (DoH), and uses a results-based approach (DLIs). The project is also supported by $20 million from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund
     and $1.5 million for impact evaluation of the pilots. The project has four components:
     ■■   Component 1. Improving Health Service Delivery: The objective is to enhance coverage and quality of and access to an essential package of health care services,
          including outreach and community-level interventions for primary health care (PHC). The Bank’s technical engagement and monitoring will focus on the follow-
          ing thematic areas: integrated management of maternal, neonatal and child health and lady health worker programs, nutrition services, and HIV/AIDS preventive
          services.
     ■■   Component 2. Enhancing Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Health System: The objective is to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of the health system by
          strengthening ongoing initiatives with a focus on management and accountability and improving quality of care through regulations and standardization of
          services (PHC contracting out, results-based district management contract, governance and accountability mechanisms).
     ■■   Component 3. Strengthening Provincial Department of Health Management Capacity: The objective is to strengthen and reorganize the current DoH manage-
          ment system to improve stewardship, fiduciary, and monitoring functions.
     ■■   Component 4. Improving the Capacities in Technical Areas for Equitable Health Services: This component supports innovative pilots to guide policy development
          in results-based financing and alternate financing approaches.

     EXPECTED RESULTS:
     The success of the project in meeting its objectives are measured by the following indicators: (i) fully immunized children 12-23 months of age; (ii) births attended
     by skilled health personnel; (iii) modern contraceptive prevalence rate; (iv) children 0-24 months of age receiving basic package of nutrition services; (v) issuance of
     a certificate of registration for public and private health facilities; and (vi) community satisfaction. Based on available data, the progress on all project development
     objective indicators is either fully meeting or exceeding the second year provincial level targets. Progress by district will be analyzed when the latest Multiple Indicator
     Cluster Survey becomes available.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Health indicators for KP have been improving but remain poor in comparison to countries in the region. Health facilities in KP lack equipment, medicines and other
essential supplies. The frequent and continuous emergencies and crises faced by the province have had a severe impact on health care provision. Militants have
attacked facilities, carried out vandalism (theft of expensive equipment), and there is coercion, killing, and kidnapping of health personnel. Provision of health services
is also hampered by lack of qualified personnel, vacant posts, and high levels of absenteeism. People in the province are not satisfied with the quality of health services
delivered in the public sector institutions.
The project was implemented in six crisis-affected (security compromised and flood-hit) districts of KP for a period of three years. It is expected that by the end of the
project there will be: (i) increased use and coverage of primary and secondary health care services in the districts; (ii) an adequately equipped and functional health
infrastructure; (iii) improved supervision and timely use of allocated resources through key management decisions based on evidence; and (iv) increased community
satisfaction with publicly provided health services.

The project development objective is to improve the availability, accessibility, and delivery of primary and secondary health care services at the district level. The project
consists of three components:
■■   Component 1. Revitalizing Health Care Services: The primary health care centers will be reorganized into hubs, and support will be provided to enable delivery
     of a comprehensive package of health care services. Management of all facilities in the hubs will be outsourced through a competitive process to a private firm/
     non-governmental organization, which will be responsible for a comprehensive package of care to the communities. The secondary (District Head Quarters - DHQ)
     hospitals in the project districts will also be improved.
■■   Component 2. Rehabilitation of Health Infrastructure in the Districts: Some health facilities damaged during the crisis will be rehabilitated to enable service
     delivery. No new facilities will be constructed, and only existing infrastructure will be rehabilitated.
■■   Component 3. Establish and Operationalize a Robust Monitoring and Evaluation System at District and Provincial levels: This component will support opera-
     tionalizing the monitoring and evaluation systems to guide project implementation at the district level, and dissemination of the results through province-wide
     analysis. It will also support operationalization of the District Health Information System, and periodic evaluations.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The project implementation has not yielded measurable results to date as there have been considerable delays in implementation. The project still has serious internal
issues compounded by factors outside of the control of Department of Health. However, the key performance indicators include: access to a defined basic package
of health, nutrition, and reproductive health services; births attended by skilled health personnel; modern contraceptive prevalence rate; children with severe acute
malnutrition provided adequate nutrition services; and community satisfaction.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Pakistan’s maternal and child health indicators have improved, but significant challenges remain. It has made minimal progress in improving nutritional outcomes
     of children and mothers over the last four decades and has high rates of child malnutrition, with 44 percent of children being stunted and 22 percent severely
     stunted. One in five children is born with low birth weight (less than 2.5 kilograms, kg). In addition, micronutrient deficiencies are widespread – with high rates of
     iron-deficiency anemia, zinc, iodine folic acid and vitamin A deficiencies having a particularly damaging impact on the survival, growth, development, and productivity
     of pre-school children and pregnant women. The project development objective is to increase the coverage of interventions that are known to improve the nutritional
     status of children under 2, and of pregnant and lactating women. IDA credit of $36.24 million will finance Sindh, co-financed by a grant provided through the
     programmatic trust fund for the Pakistan Partnership for Improved Nutrition (PPIN), administered by the Bank, for Balochistan in an amount of $11.71 million. PPIN
     also has a commitment of 39 million Australian dollars from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) of the Australian Government. The PPIN Trust Fund also
     will finance nutrition interventions in the province of KP. The project has four components:
     ■■   Component 1. Addressing General Malnutrition in Women and Children. This component will support key nutrition interventions that address general malnutri-
          tion, mainly in pregnant and lactating women and children less than 2. This component addresses: infant and young child feeding (IYCF); community manage-
          ment of acute malnutrition; and maternal malnutrition.
     ■■   Component 2: Addressing Micronutrient Malnutrition: This component will support vitamin and mineral interventions for women and young children. The focus
          is on delivery of key micronutrient supplementation (vitamin A, iron, iodine, folic acid and zinc) and, in Balochistan, on developing the legislative/enforcement
          mechanisms for food fortification.
     ■■   Component 3: Communication for Development: This component includes three types of cross-cutting communications activities that will support all the other
          project interventions – advocacy, mass media campaigns for behavior change, and inter-personal communications.
     ■■   Component 4: Strengthening Institutional Capacity: This component will strengthen existing institutional capacity for nutrition at the provincial and district lev-
          els. Specifically, this component will address the following areas: staff complement; accountability for results; capacity building; technical assistance for service
          delivery; monitoring and evaluation; social accountability, and multi-sectoral coordination.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     Results will be tracked by the following indicators: (i) overall access to basic nutrition services in project areas for target beneficiaries; (ii) percentage of children 6-23
     months fed in accordance with all three IYCF practices; (iii) percentage of pregnant women and of lactating women receiving iron and folic acid (IFA) supplements;
     (iv) percentage of children 0-59 months treated for severe acute malnutrition; (v) percentage of children 6-59 months receiving vitamin A supplementation; (vi)
     percentage of children 6-59 months with diarrhea treated with zinc and orally rehydration salts; and (vii) knowledge and attitude score of households, relating to
     nutrition. The improvements in the nutritional status of women and children will become measurable after this project is completed, while some of the behaviors that
     the project aims to change are expected to have measurable biological impacts in the short term.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The government of Pakistan established BISP in 2008 to help the poor cope with income shocks by providing them with monthly cash transfers and other
complementary programs to enhance human development and income-generating opportunities. BISP was set up as an autonomous institution, unanimously
approved by parliament in August 2012. Over the last six years, the program has evolved into a modern social safety net system. In 2009, capitalizing on analytical
and operational work in the country, the Bank supported strengthening BISP through a Social Protection Development Policy Credit ($150 million) together with a
Social Safety Net Technical Assistance Project ($60 million). This support enabled the government to establish appropriate institutional, governance, and accountability
arrangements for providing targeted safety nets to the poor. The TA project, among others, supported the national roll out of a targeting system using the Proxy Means
Test-based Poverty Scorecard via a door-to-door census. The project also helped the government create a National Poverty Registry comprising information on more
than 27 million households (approximately 167 million people) – identifying 7.2 million eligible families (bottom 25 percent of population), and providing payments
to more than 4.9 million families, of which 94 percent receive payments through modern technology based mechanisms. To expand coverage of safety net cash
transfers and support setting up conditional cash transfers linked to primary education, the project was restructured with additional financing ($150 million) in March
2012. The project aims to support expansion and strengthening of the country’s safety net, with particular focus on the BISP. The project components are:
■■   Component 1. Establish a National Targeting System and Expand Coverage of the Basic Safety Net System.
■■   Component 2. Strengthen Safety Net Operation: Supports institutional development and implementation of the communication strategy, grievance redressal for
     cash transfers, strengthening payment and reconciliation mechanisms, and the design and roll out of Co-responsibility Cash Transfers linked to primary education
     of beneficiaries’ children.
■■   Component 3. Enhance Safety Net Program Management, Accountability, and Evaluation: Supports setting up program control and accountability mechanisms
     through a management information system, third party monitoring and evaluations, and use of technology for program administration, especially for payments
     and grievance redressal.
■■   Component 4. Develop the Social Protection and Strategy Monitoring: Supports the design of the institutional and legal framework for executing the National
     Social Protection Policy, and design and implementation of monitoring mechanisms for federal and provincial social protection programs.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   65 percent of cash transfers received by beneficiaries in bottom quintiles 1 and 2 (against 46 percent baseline, 70 percent target).
■■   Poverty scorecard applied to 27 million households (target achieved).
■■   87 percent of beneficiaries satisfied with program implementation (target of 70 percent achieved).

     Floods hit parts of Pakistan in early September 2014, including Punjab and the state having jurisdiction over the eight districts of Neelum, Hattian, Bagh, Poonch,
     Haveli, Kotli, Bhimber and Muzaffarabad (hereby referred to as the “State”). The disaster caused 367 deaths, mostly in Punjab province, in addition to damages to
     houses, agriculture, transport, irrigation and communications infrastructure. It is estimated by the NDMA that the floods affected over 2.5 million people in both rural
     and urban areas. The federal and provincial governments were proactive in relief operations in the immediate aftermath of the floods. Following the conclusion of
     the relief phase, the government moved towards medium- and longer-term planning for recovery, reconstruction, and increasing resilience. The Disaster and Climate
     Resilience Improvement Project was prepared in response to the government’s request for assistance in responding to the floods of 2014.

     The project development objective is to support restoration of flood protection infrastructure and strengthen government capacity to manage disasters and climate
     variability. The project comprises four components:
     ■■   Restoring Flood Protection Infrastructure and Upgrading Flood Management Systems ($100 million): This component aims to enhance physical resilience
          through the restoration, rehabilitation, and improvement of critical flood protection infrastructure.
     ■■   Managing Disasters and Climate Variability ($17 million): This component aims to strengthen the government’s capacity to better manage disasters. It would
          finance risk identification, institutional strengthening for improved management of disasters and enhancing fiscal resilience.
     ■■   Project Management ($8 million): The component will be implemented through mandated government departments including Punjab Irrigation Department,
          Punjab Disaster Management Authority, and the State planning and development department. This component will support engagement of additional resources
          at project implementation units within these departments.
     ■■   Contingent Emergency Response Component: In the event of a natural disaster, critical emergency response and recovery costs in the province may be supported
          through this component upon activation.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   The project was signed on July 30, 2015.
     ■■   Project implementation units have been notified at the implementing agencies, while the procurement process for two consultancies has been initiated, based
          on preliminary procurement plans.
     ■■   The project operations manual is being developed.
     ■■   The development of annual work plans by the implementing agencies has been initiated.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The province of Balochistan has experienced several significant natural disasters over the past 10 years. Annual recurring floods between 2010 and 2013, as well as
earthquakes, have had a major impact with damages and losses exceeding $620 million, or 6 percent of provincial GDP. Following the enactment in April 2010 of the
18th Constitutional Amendment and the resulting devolution of a number of federal functions to the provincial governments, the provinces have been given disaster
management responsibilities within the overall national framework. This translates into increased responsibility for Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA)
Balochistan to urgently address the various disaster risk management challenges in the disaster-prone province. Through the Balochistan Disaster Management
Project (BDMP), the Bank is supporting the Government of Balochistan in addressing the various institutional and capacity issues at PDMA. The project development
objective is to strengthen the capacity of PDMA Balochistan to prepare for and respond to natural disasters. The project comprises four components:
■■   Institutional Strengthening of PDMA Balochistan ($2.5 million).
■■   Hazard and Risk Assessment ($1 million).
■■   Development and Piloting of Community Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM) Program ($1.5 million).
■■   Contingent Emergency Response Component.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   A Disaster Management Information System has been established at PDMA Balochistan that is linked to the National Risk Information Platform. The risk informa-
     tion collated in the system would lead to informed planning and decision-making.
■■   An initial draft of the Quetta multi-hazard risk assessment report has been prepared and pending PDMA’s approval.
■■   Almost 100 personnel of PDMA and other departments have been trained in the following subjects: Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction into policy making;
     end-to-end early warning systems; emergency response; remote-sensing and GIS; logistics and warehouse management; office administration; project manage-
     ment; and computer skills.
■■   CBDRM: A cadre of 20 master trainers has been established and CBDRM trainings have been rolled out to communities in five Union Councils of Quetta District.
■■   Day-to-day PDMA functions have been automated through the establishment of an Office Management Information System established through the project.
■■   A solar power system has been installed at PDMA and is providing 90 percent of PDMA’s power needs.
■■   PDMA has operationalized response standards operating procedures prepared through BDMP. An initial drill/simulation exercise was held by PDMA in coordina-
     tion with provincial line departments in December 2014.
■■   Over 20,000 flood and earthquake awareness information packages have been disseminated to local communities and district governments with particular
     emphasis on reaching out to schools.
■■   The disaster risk management provincial plan has been prepared and awaiting approval from the Provincial Disaster Management Commission, headed by the
     chief minister.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Star Hydro Power Limited (SHPL) is a special purpose company for construction, operation and maintenance of a 147 MW run-of-the-river hydro power plant situated
120 km north of Islamabad, near the village of Patrind in the city of Muzaffarabad. SHPL will be the second hydropower IPP in Pakistan. It has an off-take agreement
to sell electricity to the state-owned NTDC under a 30-year power purchase agreement. SHPL is 80 percent owned by Korea Water Resources Corporation (K-Water) and
20 percent by Daewoo Engineering and Construction Company Limited. The total project cost is approximately $436 million, including contingencies. In December
2011, IFC committed a $60 million ‘A’ loan that has a grace period of up to 66 months and final maturity of up to 17 years. In 2012, MIGA issued a guarantee for
$148.5 million to cover an equity investment in SHPL by K-water, acting on behalf of itself and Daewoo, incorporated in Pakistan through KDS Hydro Private Limited
of Singapore.

The project will: (i) help increase much needed generation capacity using a domestic renewable resource, thereby increasing security of energy supply; (ii) ease the
severe energy demand-supply deficit in the country and the resulting drag of power shortages on economic growth; (iii) help diversify the generation mix away from
thermal power and contribute to lowering the average economic cost of power generation in Pakistan; (iv) provide significant climate change and environmental
benefits compared to alternative thermal power options in terms of displacing greenhouse gas emissions; (v) create jobs during the project construction and operating
phase; (vi) reduce reliance on imported fuel oil and help to offset trade and current account deficits. Further, by providing long-term guarantees to a much-needed
infrastructure project, MIGA will play an important role in the overall project financing at a time when international commercial insurers are not open to long term
guarantees in Pakistan.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   Provision of clean power for 310,000 customers by 2017.
■■   Economic rate of return of 17 percent.
■■   Generation of 100 permanent jobs.
■■   Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of about 280,000 tons of CO2 a year.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     K-Electric (KESC, formerly Karachi Electric Supply Company), which has more than 11,000 employees and 2.3 million customers with $2.8 billion in assets, was
     privatized in 2005 when Al-Jomaih and National Industries Group (the original sponsors) acquired a controlling stake. In order to co-finance a $937 million investment
     plan by KESC, which included development of new 800-MW gas-fired power-generation plants and the rehabilitation of existing facilities, IFC committed a $125
     million 10-year loan with the right to convert $25 million into equity. The ADB also participated in the project with a parallel loan of $150 million. In September 2008,
     the original sponsors invited Abraaj Capital to partner through an equity investment of $361 million, taking management control of KESC. IFC and ADB facilitated
     the ownership transition and supported the Abraaj-led turnaround plan by re-profiling the existing loans. Subsequently, IFC also exercised its conversion right in
     December 2012 and subscribed to $25 million common shares of KESC for a 2.5 percent equity stake. Since IFC’s investment, Abraaj-led management has successfully
     implemented the turnaround plan and achieved significant operational and financial improvements, despite challenging circumstances. In February 2015, IFC and
     ADB loans were prepaid by KESC by re-financing it through issuance of listed Sukuk bonds in the local market. The development objectives include: (i) eliminating
     load shedding and meeting incremental demand for electricity in and around Karachi, the nation’s largest city; (ii) enabling new residential and business customers to
     be connected to the grid, thus reducing their cost of obtaining power; (iii) significantly reducing technical and commercial losses of electricity; (iv) improving quality
     of service to consumers; (v) reducing carbon emissions through development of more efficient and cleaner gas-fired generation; and (vi) demonstrating the benefits
     of privatization in the country and region.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     KESC’s turnaround has facilitated economic growth through sustainable and reliable supply of power to the largest city in Pakistan, which is also the nation’s
            industrial and financial hub.
     ■■     Significant reduction in electricity load shedding to about five hours a day with uninterrupted supply to low-loss and industrial customers. Over 50 percent of the
            customers do not experience load shedding while blackouts of 8 to 12 hours a day continue in other parts of the country.
     ■■     Meeting incremental demand for electricity through an addition of around 1,000 MW in generation, increasing access to electricity for residential, commercial
            and industrial customers.
     ■■     Steady reduction in electricity losses to approximately 24 percent as of March 2015 from 38 percent at the time of IFC’s investment.
     ■■     Improved quality and reliability of customer service with significant reduction in complaints and response time.
     ■■     Reduction in carbon emissions through incremental 1,000 MW of cleaner natural gas-fired generation.
     ■■     Demonstrating the benefits of private-sector investment in state-owned utilities in the country and region, a development that is expected to be replicated in the
            planned privatization of electricity distribution companies in Pakistan.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
China Three Gorges Corporation (“CTGC”) is one of the largest renewable power companies in the world and is emerging as the largest player in Pakistan’s renewable
energy sector and a key partner for IFC in Pakistan. CSAIL was established by CTGC through its international investment arm – China Three Gorges International
Corporation (CTGI) to serve as a scalable investment platform to develop, own, and operate renewable power generation projects in Pakistan, primarily large run of
river hydro projects. IFC has joined CTGI, as a founder shareholder, with 15 percent shareholding for $125 million in CSAIL.

CSAIL’s current indicative project pipeline in Pakistan includes seven multi-stage renewable power projects with a cumulative capacity of 2,960 MW. These include
an operational 50-MW wind plant, three wind and solar projects for a cumulative capacity of 500 MW, and 2,410 MW in three large hydropower projects, all at the
development stage. The vision for CSAIL is to become the largest power producer in Pakistan with a target portfolio size of 10,000 MW by 2020. The project will: (i)
help address the country’s severe power shortage situation by development of an incremental generation capacity of 3,000 MW (half of the energy shortfall), which
will provide access to electricity to almost 6 percent of the total population; (ii) utilize cost competitive, indigenous, renewable resource, which will contribute to
significant reduction in the cost of generation and help mitigate Pakistan’s reliance on imported thermal alternatives for power generation; (iii) promote private-sector
participation in the renewable energy sector in Pakistan by targeting a portfolio of around 10,000 MW over time; and (iv) deliver significant climate change benefits
in the form of utilization of indigenous clean energy resources for power generation.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
CSAIL projects, once developed, are expected to achieve the following results:
■■   Bridge half of the existing supply shortfall, estimated at around 6,000 MW.
■■   Increase the available generation capacity in Pakistan by 15 percent and renewable power generation by 34 percent.
■■   Significantly reduce the average cost of generation by substituting the expensive oil-fired generation with low-cost hydros.
■■   Substantial foreign exchange savings on account of the substitution of imported fuel oil, a critical benefit given Pakistan’s balance of payments weaknesses.
■■   Increase private-sector share in overall generation by 18 percent.
■■   Provide access to electricity for 11.2 million individuals – 6 percent of the total population.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     IFC has taken a lead role in supporting private wind energy projects in Pakistan by investing in four wind projects for a total of 206 MW: (i)56 MW Zorlu Energy; (ii)50
     MW Metro Power; (iii) 50 MW Gul Ahmed Wind; and (iv) 50 MW Dawood TGL projects. These projects are being undertaken under the 2006 Policy for Development
     of Renewable Energy on a Build, Own and Operate basis. The power produced shall be purchased by National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) under
     a 20-year Energy Purchase Agreement and fed into the national grid. Government of Pakistan support in the form of a sovereign guarantee for performance and
     payment obligations of the NTDC are provided in the implementation agreement. Zorlu Energy has been operational since 2013, while the other three projects are
     under construction and expected to be commissioned by 2016. IFC played an important role in mobilizing a total of $103 million debt from international financial
     institutions for these four projects.
     The four wind energy projects will: (i) help fill the significant power supply demand gap in Pakistan; (ii) promote the use of renewable energy sources and contribute
     to the diversification of the existing generation mix by reducing the use of expensive imported oil and shifting towards zero emission power; (iii)promote energy
     efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas emissions; (v) help mobilize funding by other foreign investors to broaden the funding sources for this project as well as future
     wind projects; and (iv) support local banks to provide sustainable long-term financing for the development of renewable energy projects in Pakistan.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     The projects, once developed, are expected to achieve the following results:
     ■■    Generate a total of around 560 GWh of energy on an annual basis, thereby providing additional power supply and helping reduce the power deficit.
     ■■    Provide access to electricity for approximately 700,000 people.
     ■■    Reduce greenhouse gas emissions of around 300,000 tons of CO2 equivalent per annum.
     ■■    Create approximately 200 permanent jobs during operations

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Packages is Pakistan’s premier integrated pulp and paper mill and packaging materials manufacturer with a paper and board capacity of 208,000 tons per annum
(tpa), converting capacity of 124,000 tpa, and plastics capacity of 13,000 tpa as of December 2013. It is widely acknowledged as a leader in the local market and
known for its sophisticated and high quality packaging. Packages procures its principal raw materials (wheat straw and waste paper) from the local market. In 2014, it
proceeded to set up a biomass boiler, an industry first, for power-generation purposes for its plant. The plant will go into operation in 2015.

IFC’s equity financing enabled Packages, an IFC client since 1964, to strengthen its balance sheet by reducing reliance on debt taken for the expansion project that
had exposed it to interest rate volatility and significant rollover risk. IFC financing helped provide the necessary stability to endure the global financial crisis of 2008.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   With IFC’s support, Packages was able to undertake programs designed to have a positive impact on climate change (waste paper collection, closed loop system
     for water and waste heat recovery systems at the plants). It helped reduce carbon emissions from burning of wheat and eliminate approximately 450,000 cubic
     meters of landfill annually to avoid typical hazards such as contamination of groundwater, residual soil contamination after landfill close, inefficient use of land
     space and creation of methane, a potent greenhouse gas generated by decaying organic wastes.
■■   The relocation of the new mill has generated significant economic activity in what was previously an agrarian-based and under-developed part of the country. The
     increased procurement of wheat straw has positively impacted the incomes of farmers, who used to burn wheat straw for disposal.
■■   IFC provided advisory services to Packages to increase waste paper collection from the local market, helping the client reduce reliance on imported waste paper.
     This advisory project was successfully completed in FY2013.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Pakistan is facing one of the most severe energy crisis in the world with 144 million people either off-grid or suffering on average over 12 hours load shedding a day.
     Annually these families spend $2.2 billion on battery-powered torches, candles and kerosene lanterns for lighting. This crisis impairs Pakistan’s capacity for economic
     growth and leaves families reliant on an expensive mix of traditional lighting technologies that account for on average 13 percent of their household income. Over
     the last decade. IFC has developed Lighting Africa and Lighting Asia, a series of country-level programs to support the development of new lighting technologies such
     as quality verified solar lanterns and portable solar housing systems that provide families with clean, safe, and affordable lighting solutions. Lighting Pakistan is IFCs
     response to Pakistan growing energy crisis.

     Lighting Pakistan works to promote the development of a sustainable, clean, and modern solar lighting market in Pakistan targeting households, businesses, and
     micro-enterprises that are underserved by the grid. The program aims to increase access to lighting and associated services for 1.5 million people through:
     ■■   Quality Verification: Working with manufacturers who meet the Lighting Global Minimum Quality Standards.
     ■■   Business Development: Providing B2B connections between manufacturers and distributors/financiers.
     ■■   Market Intelligence: In-depth research into the off-grid lighting market to support client investment decisions.
     ■■   Consumer Awareness: A two-year awareness campaign to help consumers differentiate between good quality and poor quality lighting products.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   Number of Lighting Global quality-certified products sold: 36, 555.
     ■■   Number of people with access to improved services: 182,775.
     ■■   Greenhouse gas emissions reduced: 3655.50 tons of CO2 equivalent per annum.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
IFC has been implementing the Business Edge (BE) program in Pakistan since December 2008. IFC selects local training providers, builds their training delivery
capacity and accredits them to deliver Business Edge business management skills training workshops. It also makes available its range of Business Edge training
materials (trainer manuals and workbooks) in the local language with local case studies and examples. The Business Edge program also ensures quality through
trainers’ assessments and their certification. In order to increase the outreach of the Business Edge training products and services to more Pakistani micro, small and
medium enterprises and aspiring entrepreneurs around the country, IFC plans to increase the number of training providers and trainers in Pakistan.
The overall goal of the project is to enhance the business performance and increase the revenues of MSMEs by developing their managerial capacities using BE product
and services.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   BE-accredited training providers have trained a total of 12,213 individuals, of whom 2,419 (20 percent) were women, from 2,545 MSMEs, government and
     development organizations.
■■   The project is working with 18 BE-accredited local training providers.
■■   The project has trained 359 trainers, including 101 women (28 percent) in Pakistan.
■■   The project has localized/translated 53 training manuals/workbooks into Urdu.
Impact Assessment:
An impact assessment of BE workshops in Pakistan was conducted in July 2014 to determine whether the training workshops had any impact on the performance of
MSMEs, particularly with respect to key dimensions of the business such as revenue, productivity, cost, profitability, and staff turnover. The impact assessment shows
that a large majority of owners/managers (94 percent) noted the impact of the trainings on their respective MSMEs to be positive. None of the respondents reported
any negative impact. Respondents noted significant contribution of the training in improving their sales revenue (81 percent) and profitability (75 percent), decreasing
costs (68 percent), and increasing customer satisfaction (66 percent). Only 14 percent of the respondents were able to access finance.

Results under MDTF (WB/IFC) project:
■■   Business Edge has trained 15 Pashto-speaking trainers to conduct training for the MSMEs.
■■   23 training modules are available in Pashto.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Bank Alfalah Limited (BAFL) is the fifth largest private-sector bank in the country. It has 648 branches, including 157 Islamic Banking Branches. BAFL has an asset
     base of $7.7 billion, deposits of $5.9 billion, and an equity base of $471 million as of June 15 with a ~6% market share (based on total assets). It also has presence
     in Bangladesh, Afghanistan and UAE, and is listed on the Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore Stock Exchanges. BAFL has the fourth largest Islamic banking set up in the
     country in terms of branches that are spread across Pakistan. It is majority owned by the Abu Dhabi Group comprising members of the Al Nahyan family, one of the
     ruling families of the United Arab Emirates, and leading businessmen and associates based in UAE.

     IFC’s relationship with BAFL started in 2007 through the Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) with an original limit of $20 million that was later enhanced to $40
     million. On the Advisory Services (AS) side, IFC completed a SME advisory program with the BAFL related to capacity building of its SME banking operations in June
     2014. This engagement paved the way for an equity opportunity in BAFL and IFC made an equity investment of $66.7 million for 15 percent stake in 2014. IFC is now
     engaged with BAFL on other AS discussions including agri financing and digital finance.

     The equity investment provided critical capital support to BAFL. IFC’s investment will support BAFL in growing its conventional and Islamic banking operations,
     increasing penetration into priority areas like SME banking and agri finance, and help improve access to finance.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     While this is a relatively new investment and its results are yet to be seen. Some of the benefits of this investment and previous engagements are as follows:
     ■■   IFC’s equity investment provided critical capital support enabling BAFL to continue with its growth trajectory.
     ■■   IFC has nominated Efstratios Georgios (Takis) Arapoglou to the Board of BAFL. He was elected on May 27, 2015. The nominee brings extensive global knowledge
          of the financial sector and will provide guidance to help NABL achieve its strategic growth objectives.
     ■■   The SME Advisory project ran from June 2012 to June 2014, when a new SME unit was set up. Credit processes were re-engineered to be more efficient and at-
          tuned to the smaller SMEs, and competitive differentiation was ensured through introducing non-financial advisory function. BAFL became the first bank in the
          country to host the IFC’s SME toolkit, which offers a web-based platform for market outreach.
     ■■   The GTFP facility helped BAFL finance trade commitments of more than $365 million since inception, supporting trade of essential commodities such as oil and
          gas, agricultural products, chemicals, and others.
     ■■   BAFL has developed an environmental and social management system and has started implementing it across its portfolio. This is expected to have a demonstra-
          tion effect and will help in making sustainable lending a sector-wide trend.

 ** IFC Participation is with $86 million while $64 million was mobilized by IFC acting in its capacity as implementing entity for the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Program.
 *** Total GTFP facility approved amount is $50 million.


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The loan will support HBL’s domestic and international growth, including financing the growth of SMEs, rural/agri-finance, sustainable energy finance (SEF) and
women-owned businesses while the equity helped the Government of Pakistan successfully complete HBL’s privatization.

In 2014, under the privatization program supported by the IMF, the government was looking to divest its shareholdings in the banking sector, including the balance
41.5 percent shares in HBL, valued at over $1 billion. This was considered to be the largest equity offering of a Pakistani corporate in the domestic and international
capital markets. To facilitate the offering, the government sought IFC’s support to catalyze international investor interest. IFC brought in CDC Group to invest $121
million and IFC’s name helped attract other international investors like Lazard, Templeton and Fidelity, enabling the issue to be over-subscribed by 1.6 times with
foreign investors participating with $750 million (75 percent of the offering). Thus, IFC supported the government in achieving critical targets and the development
of Pakistan’s capital markets.

Given HBL’s reach of more than 1,600 branches, the investments in HBL are expected to have a transformational impact in an IDA country ranked fifth globally among
financially excluded populations. It will help increase financial inclusion, SMEs and rural and agri finance, women-owned businesses and SEF. It will also support HBL’s
expansion in markets that are important for Pakistan for trade and remittances.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
IFC’s investment in HBL is the largest investment by IFC in Pakistan, including mobilization, and was processed in a record time of 36 days. By fast tracking the loan
and equity and processing them simultaneously, IFC was able to respond to the needs of the government and HBL, and help the government meet critical targets
under the IMF program.
■■    IFC’s participation in the equity attracted significant investor interest and helped the largest equity offering by a Pakistani entity to be oversubscribed by 1.6 times.
