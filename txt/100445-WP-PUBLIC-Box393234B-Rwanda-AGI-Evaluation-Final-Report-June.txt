Executive Summary

Introduction

Rwanda has made a remarkable transition from reconstruction to development over the past twenty
years. Despite these developments, Rwanda remains one of the poorest countries in the world. An
estimated 45 percent of the population still lives below the national poverty line, and 24 percent is
considered extremely poor. Women face particular social and economic challenges, including limited
access to the labor market, which requires additional policy and project efforts to enable them to achieve
better outcomes. Innovative and effective training projects specifically targeting the promotion of
successful entry of girls and young women into productive employment are one way to address their
needs.



Overview of the Rwanda Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI)

The Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI) pilot was implemented by the Government of Rwanda as part of an
eight-country initiative led by the World Bank aimed at promoting the economic empowerment of
adolescent girls.1 The development objective of the Rwanda AGI was to improve employment, incomes
and empowerment of disadvantaged adolescent girls and young women (aged 16-24), and to test two
integrated models for promoting these goals.

The Rwanda AGI had three components:

       Component I: Skills Development and Entrepreneurship Support
       Component II: Scholarships to Resume Formal Education
       Component III: Project Implementation Support

This evaluation focuses exclusively on Component I, which was carried out by the Workforce Development
Authority (WDA), under the supervision of the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF). It
was delivered sequentially to roughly 2,000 vulnerable girls and young women in three equal-sized
cohorts between 2012 and 2014. The project was targeted geographically in four districts (Gasabo,
Kicukiro, Gicumbi, and Rulindo), where nine vocational training centers (VTCs) provided the training.

The year-long training project was divided into three phases:

 The Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI) was implemented between 2008-15 by the World Bank in eight countries in
partnership with the Nike Foundation and the governments of Afghanistan, Australia, Denmark, Jordan, Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, Liberia, Nepal, Norway, Rwanda, South Sudan, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

Evaluation Methodology

A tracer methodology was used for this evaluation, which follows individuals before, during, and after the
intervention. This methodology traces the individual journey of project trainees over time using a mix of
quantitative and qualitative research instruments to understand if and why certain changes in their
situation, perceptions or aspirations may have occurred.

The three objectives of the evaluation were:

           To examine how well the AGI project delivered the planned activities
           To assess the usefulness of the training provided
           To measure the change in beneficiary outcomes before and after the AGI project

The evaluation was conducted on the second cohort of beneficiaries, from which 160 girls were randomly
selected to participate in baseline and endline surveys.2 A smaller sub-sample of trainees were also
recruited for midline and endline focus group discussions (FGDs), and project managers and service
providers were invited to take part in semi-structured interviews (SSIs).

For the quantitative analysis, baseline and endline survey data were used to compare the outcomes of
cohort 2 beneficiaries before and after the project. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the
average values of each indicator using a statistical t-test. For the qualitative analysis, responses from FGDs
and SSIs were compiled, compared and analyzed to identify key themes and to select relevant quotes.



Profile of AGI Participants

The study population reflects the intended eligibility criteria to a high degree, with all respondents aged
between 15 and 25 and not in school at the start of the project. The project attracted a young population,
as 61 percent of baseline respondents were aged 20 or under. Almost all (94%) respondents had
completed primary school, with 44 percent also having completed some secondary education. A small
minority (9%) of surveyed participants had been married, and – as per AGI requirements – none of them
were pregnant at the baseline.



2   182 girls were selected at baseline, 160 of which were successfully followed-up with at endline.

                                                                                                                       2
Baseline levels of economic activity were high, but not abnormal for the country context. Half (50%) of
interviewed girls were engaged in at least one non-farm income-generating activity (IGA), such as wage
employment, non-farm businesses, or internships. Including household agriculture, 81 percent of
respondents were economically active when they started the training program. Many of the activities
carried out by the girls were unpaid however, with only 69 percent of those working reporting having
earned money or in-kind payments the previous month.

When asked directly about the challenges and vulnerabilities facing girls in their communities, focus group
participants mentioned unplanned pregnancies and poverty most frequently. Girls identified various
repercussions of unplanned pregnancy, including dropping out of school, struggling to support the child,
and risk of marginalization, and of poverty, including inability to pay school fees, lack of “food, clothes and
body lotion,” and psychological stress.

Quantitative Results

The vocational training project led to a substantial increase in non-farm employment among beneficiaries,
with the share of girls reporting businesses, wage employment or internships rising from 50 percent to 75
percent. Surveyed girls were 1.5 times more likely – a 25 percentage point increase – to work outside their
families’ farm at endline than at baseline. This increase was driven primarily by higher self-employment
rates, mostly involving small-scale trading in rural areas. Nevertheless, household agriculture continued
to be a common activity for girls in our sample, with a constant percentage of respondents (58% at
baseline vs. 59% at endline) reporting involvement the previous month.

Despite a high rate of IGA involvement, the likelihood that girls were applying the trade they studied
varied significantly across training groups. Between 38 percent and 53 percent of culinary, food
processing, and agri-business trainees were doing work connected to their training at endline. However,
although 61 percent of arts and crafts trainees had at least one non-farm IGA, only 12 percent among
them said they were using their trade. Focus group participants recognized this issue and suggested that
a broader range of trades should be taught in the VTCs to address the “market” problem.

There was only a modest increase in the share of respondents who reported being paid for at least one of
their IGAs (from 55% to 58%), but amounts earned increased significantly. Looking at the entire sample,
average cash incomes almost doubled, from RwF 5,415 to RwF 10,254, and reached RwF 12,657 if in-kind
payments are included. Among the sub-sample of respondents who reported non-zero earnings, cash
incomes amounted to RwF 19,288 and total earnings to RwF 21,976 at endline.

By the end of the program, respondents were more likely to be members of savings groups (from 27% to
81%), to have saved recently (from 18% to 37%), and to have saved larger amounts (from RwF 7,050 to
RwF 20,086). The project helped trainees open individual Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCO)
accounts and encouraged the use of deposits as start-up capital for their cooperatives. Many trainees also
used part of their stipends to purchase goats, sheep or rabbits, with livestock ownership tripling (from
15% to 44%), over the course of the project.

The impact of the AGI project on beneficiaries’ lives went beyond the economic realm. Respondents
reported wider social networks and moderate improvements in their relationships with friends, family
and community members following their participation in the project. Notably, more girls declared having



                                                                                                             3
someone to borrow money from in case of an emergency (from 61% to 72%) and having a place to meet
female friends (from 67% to 79%), both aspects directly related to goals of the AGI project.

AGI participants also reported higher satisfaction with their lives, especially with regards to their incomes
and jobs, as well as greater optimism for the future. Although improvements in self-esteem, which was
already relatively high at baseline, were limited, their entrepreneurial self-confidence increased
significantly. Girls became significantly more assured of their abilities to identify business opportunities,
to run their own businesses, and to interview for a professional job – skills directly related to the training
curriculum.

Reports of gender-based violence increased considerably, with a larger share of respondents indicating
that they experienced sexual harassment at least once in their lifetimes (25% to 43%). Available data does
not enable us to determine when the harassment occurred or whether it was connected to participation
in the project. Moreover, it is not possible to exclude the possibilities that reporting was higher at endline
because respondents were more comfortable during the interview process or that respondents were
better able to recognize their past experiences of harassment as a result of the AGI life skills training.
Either of these conditions would indicate that baseline reports were in fact underestimates, and so the
change from baseline to endline would be overestimated in the data. The results on sexual harassment,
which were accompanied by similar rates at endline of verbal abuse (51%) and a smaller but still significant
rate of physical violence (18%), do point to the high level of vulnerability faced by AGI participants.



Implementation Lessons and Stakeholder Feedback

An important component of the evaluation was obtaining feedback from participating girls as well as
administrators and trainers on the implementation of the project.

Project management: All of the interviewed project staff had positive things to say about the level and
ease of communication and collaboration with project managers. Nevertheless, trainers reported
struggling with large class sizes and with having to teach both in the morning and the afternoon due to
the overlapping of the training for cohorts 2 and 3.

Trainee selection and participation: There was significant variation across urban and rural settings in
trainees’ ease of attending the project on a regular basis, mostly as a result of differences in the cost of
transport and the opportunity cost of lost income. While the majority of trainees reported being able to
choose their field of study, some reported that the selection criteria prevented them from doing so.

Stipends: Delays in the delivery of stipends were a key hurdle for both trainees and project staff. On
average, trainees faced a month delay and project staff faced delays ranging from one day to several
weeks. For trainees who relied on the stipend for daily transport to the VTCs, this was a significant burden.

Girl-friendly environment: Most trainees indicated that VTCs were girl-friendly and reported feeling
comfortable in those settings. On the other hand, childcare facilities were not available or were not used
by the trainees at most of the interviewed VTCs.

Life skills training: The life skills training, particularly the lessons on sexual and reproductive health,
appeared to be the most popular project component among the trainees. Several of the trainers


                                                                                                            4
mentioned, however, that the curriculums were not appropriate for the learning level of the participants
and that more time was needed for follow-up.

Entrepreneurship training: All of the interviewed trainees were satisfied with the entrepreneurship
training, stating that they learned for how to save, track expenses, serve customers, and apply for loans.
Both girls and staff requested additional entrepreneurship training, with an emphasis on marketing skills
and working in cooperatives.

Technical training: Overall, trainees were satisfied with their trades but there was some criticism about
the viability and profitability of certain trades, notably arts and crafts in rural areas. There was a consensus
at all levels of project implementation on the need for VTCs to include other non-traditional trades.

Support to join SACCOs: Feedback regarding SACCOs was largely positive. For some trainees however, the
savings process was not clear and they reported receiving limited information on their SACCO accounts.
Project staff faced several challenges in facilitating trainees’ SACCO membership, including a lack of IDs
and the inability of girls to provide collateral for their loan applications.

Post-training phase: Most girls appeared confident about the post-training transition and felt prepared to
begin their cooperative activities or seek employment with their newly-acquired skills. Four district-level
mentors supported beneficiaries in forming cooperatives, but the registration procedure was more time-
consuming than expected. Some VTCs also provided job search assistance, though this support was not
clearly structured and less heavily emphasized than the support for cooperative formation.



Main recommendations

The following recommendations are based on the quantitative and qualitative findings of this evaluation,
and are broadly applicable both to future rounds of the AGI as well as to youth skills development
programs more broadly.

    1. Ensure that core staff (e.g. Project Coordinator, M&E Officer, and Finance Officer) are on board
        throughout the duration of the project
    2. Ensure trades are demand-driven and re-evaluate the suitability of the arts and crafts training.
    3. Remove unexpected costs of attending the training for participants, notably of uniforms.
    4. Translate curriculum into local languages and adapt for low-literacy.
    5. Integrate marketing skills into the technical training and extend the duration of the life skills
        training.
    6. Fully integrate GBV prevention and response into project design and implementation.
    7. Ensure timely payment of stipends.
    8. Promote internships and private sector engagement, particularly in urban VTCs.
    9. Hire more mentors and train them to deliver consistent services.
    10. Provide more training on how to start cooperatives and begin the process earlier on.

1.       Introduction
Rwanda has made a remarkable transition from reconstruction to development over the past twenty
years. According to the World Bank’s 2014 Poverty Assessment, the size of the economy has increased
four-fold since 1995. Infant mortality dropped from 120 to 49 per 1,000 live births, among the lowest in
low-income countries, and enrolment in primary school became almost universal. Food insecurity and
hunger, once rampant in the country, have eased substantially. A large fraction of the population, even
those in extreme poverty, are covered by public health insurance, which has significantly expanded access
to health care. Rwanda has become a model of business and investment climate reforms, climbing to the
32nd place on the 2013 World Bank’s Doing Business Ranking. It also has the highest proportion of female
legislators in the world (64 percent).3

Despite these developments, Rwanda remains one of the poorest countries in the world. An estimated 45
percent of the population still lives below the national poverty line, and 24 percent is considered
extremely poor. Youth play a critical role in efforts to tackle poverty over the long run. Forty percent of
Rwanda’s population is aged between 14 and 35, and this demographic group faces particular social and
economic challenges. Although the labor force participation of youth aged 15 to 24 is high at 75 percent,
they are more likely than adults to be in informal employment and are disproportionately represented
amongst unpaid farm workers.4

Women are particularly disadvantaged in their access to the labor market. Only 19 percent of women are
engaged in non-farm employment, and 29 percent of young women who work are not paid (DHS 2010).
Adolescent girls and young women, especially those in disadvantaged conditions, need to “catch up”
quickly in terms of skill training suitable for productive employment in the short term, and broad-based
economic growth in the medium and long term. Given the key roles they play in their households and
society and in consideration of their disadvantaged circumstances compared to their male peers,
disadvantaged adolescent girls and young women need additional policy and project efforts to achieve
better outcomes. Innovative and effective training projects specifically targeting the promotion of
successful entry of girls and young women into productive employment are one way to address their
needs.

For these reasons, adolescent girls and young women, especially those in disadvantaged circumstances,
need particular support in their efforts to enter the labor market, through skills training suitable for
productive employment. The Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI) in Rwanda creates important livelihood
opportunities for adolescent girls and young women by preparing them for income-generating activities,
thus contributing to broad-based economic growth.

The AGI project is aligned with the priorities of the Government of Rwanda (GoR). Rwanda’s Vision 2020
prioritizes key areas of reform, with gender considered as a cross-cutting element in all sectors of the
economy. The National Employment Policy of 2005 recognizes constraints faced by women in accessing
employment, such as limited employment opportunities, high unemployment and underemployment
(especially among youth), low literacy among women, and the under-representation of women in wage-
earning jobs. Specifically, the National Employment Policy promotes employment among youth and
women through: (i) the development of formal vocational training or on the job training adapted to the

2.       Overview of the Rwanda Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI)
The “Promoting the Economic Empowerment of Adolescent Girls and Young Women” Project (known as
the Rwanda AGI) was officially launched in Kigali on April 2, 2012. The pilot was part of the World Bank’s
Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI). The AGI was implemented between 2008 and 2015 by the World Bank in
eight countries in partnership with donor and recipient governments and the private sector. The objective
of the initiative was to better understand what works in helping adolescent girls transition to productive
employment. The AGI piloted and evaluated innovative delivery of interventions including business
development skills training, technical and vocational training targeting skills in high demand, as well as
life-skills training, that could be scaled up or replicated if proven successful.

The development objective of the Rwanda AGI is to improve employment, incomes and empowerment of
disadvantaged adolescent girls and young women (age 15-24), and to test two integrated models for
promoting education, empowerment and employment. Rwanda AGI had three components: Component
I: Skills Development and Entrepreneurship Support; Component II: Scholarships to Resume Formal
Education5; and Component III: Project Implementation Support. This evaluation report focuses on
Component I, hereafter referred to as “the project”.

5Component II was implemented by a local Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) called Imbuto Foundation. This component
supported 120 eligible adolescent girls and young women (aged 15-24) who dropped out of school to return to secondary

                                                                                                                     7
The project was implemented by the Workforce Development Authority (WDA), under the supervision of
the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF). It is unique among the eight AGI pilots in that
it was the only pilot in which the government was responsible for the overall coordination of the project
as well as for the delivery of training. Training was delivered in nine government-run Vocational Training
Centers (VTCs) that were renovated under the AGI project. 6


The project was targeted to 2,000 vulnerable girls or young women. To be considered for the training, the
applicant had to:
    1. Be between 16-24 years of age
    2. Be out of school for at least one year
    3. Have some primary education (preferably completed primary education)
    4. Live in the vicinity of the training sector
    5. Be classified as highly vulnerable or at risk of becoming highly vulnerable

Applicants were pre-screened for their eligibility, and then selected through a public lottery conducted by
WDA and MIGEPROF in each of the 11 sectors of recruitment. The project was targeted geographically in
four districts, two of which are urban (Gasabo, and Kicukiro) and two of which are rural (Gicumbi and
Rulindo). Within these four districts, nine Vocational Training Centers were selected to provide training.7

school. The component began in 2011 and ended on December 31, 2013, at which time 98 of the girls were still enrolled in
school. The Government of Rwanda supported Imbuto Foundation to finance the 98 girls through the completion of their
secondary school education.

At the beginning of the project the trainees partook in a two-week induction period during which they
received 40 hours of life skills training and 20 hours of entrepreneurship skills training. The life skills and
the entrepreneurship skills training was delivered by an NGO called Frontiers Great Lakes. The induction
also oriented the girls to the expectations and goals of the project, and helped them to make informed
decisions about which field of training to pursue. The girls chose their own trades, subject to minimum
education qualifications required for some trades, namely food processing.

After the induction period participants received six months of technical skills training in one of the
following fields: culinary arts, food processing, agri-business (nursery beds and bee keeping), or arts and
crafts. The trainings in culinary arts, food processing and agriculture were delivered by WDA. Gahaya Links,
an export-oriented private sector company, was contracted to provide the technical training in arts and
crafts within the government-run VTCs. Classes were held daily for 5 hours over the period of six months.
The training included continuous assessment tests, and the WDA issued certificates to girls who
completed the training.

Following the technical training, participants were supported for 5.5 months with follow-up support for
job placement and cooperative formation, as well as mentoring for micro-enterprise establishment.8
Beginning in June 2014, the project hired four business women as mentors to assist participants with
business advisory services and support for cooperative formation. This included helping the cooperatives
to liaise with local authorities, establish articles of incorporation and become officially registered, to
identify of market opportunities, develop a business plan and access financial services.

The Rwanda AGI included several girl-friendly design features to promote vulnerable young women’s
participation and success in the project.
     Individual Savings and Credit Co-operative (SACCO) accounts were opened by the VTCs for all
        beneficiaries at the beginning of the training. During the induction and the training girls received
        a stipend of RwF 700 per day,9 of which RwF 200 was automatically saved in the individual SACCO
        accounts. The remaining RwF 500 was given to the girls for transportation. Trainees could then
        access these savings upon completion of the training phase, and it was expected that the money


8 Cohorts 2 and 3 were compressed and the girls did not receive the full 12 month project (see Figure 3.1). Cohort two started
on January 19th 2014 and completed classroom training on July 18th 2014. The post-training phase continued up to December
19th, 2014.
9 Girls recieved 300 RwF/day during the post-training phase.

                  complete the project, the stipend was returned to the project.
                 A designated “Girls’ Room” was established in each VTC and stocked with female hygiene
                  products and staffed with female attendants.
                 Beginning in July 2014, WDA contracted the Centre Psychotherapeutique Icyizere (CPI) to provide
                  pyscho-social counselling through a training of trainers (ToT) model and monthly monitoring visits
                  to the nine VTCs.10 CPI trained two staff members from each VTC to handle small cases of trauma
                  and drug abuse and identify cases for referrals to CPI.

The project was launched on April 2, 2012 in Kigali and the training was delivered sequentially among
three cohorts. Training of Cohort 1 began in May 2013 and the follow-up ended in May 2014. 621 girls
entered Cohort 1 and 597 completed. Due to implementation delays, the second and third cohorts were
compressed in order to finish before the project closing date in December 2014. The second cohort of
trainees began the technical training in February 2014 and concluded the project in December 2014. 692
girls entered in Cohort 2 and 657 completed. Cohort 3 was trained concurrently with Cohort 2 in staggered
morning and afternoon classes. Cohort 3 began training in March 2014 and concluded the follow-up
period in December 2014. 696 girls entered Cohort 3 and 659 completed the project. The overall
completion rate for the training project was 95%. A summary of the project’s achievements by component
is included in Annex 3.

3.          Evaluation Methodology
This report describes the mixed-methods evaluation of Component I (Skills Development and
Entrepreneurship Support) of the Rwanda AGI. A tracer methodology was used for this evaluation which
follows individuals before, during, and after the intervention, focusing on understanding if and why their
situation, perceptions, outlook and/or aspirations have changed during the course of the observation
period. This methodology traces the individual journey of project trainees over time using a mix of
research instruments – including semi-structured interviews, focus groups and quantitative
surveys/metrics – to understand why certain changes may have occurred.

The three objectives of the evaluation are:
    1) To examine how well the project delivered the planned activities of Component I;
    2) To assess the usefulness of the training provided; and
    3) To measure the change in beneficiary outcomes before and after the project.

The first and second objectives were examined qualitatively, by engaging beneficiaries, implementers,
and other stakeholders in a participatory process to elicit their perceptions of project quality and efficacy.
In support of the third objective, the evaluation conducted quantitative surveys before and after the
project to capture information on a core set of indicators relating to the project’s objective of promoting
productive work.11 Because the evaluation does not include a comparison group, the emphasis is on
developing a descriptive understanding of how well the project worked rather than demonstrating a
causal impact of the project on specific outcomes.

As described in Section 2, Component I was delivered sequentially to 2,000 young women in three equal-
sized cohorts. The evaluation was conducted on the second cohort of beneficiaries of the project. In
focusing on the second of three cohorts, the evaluation examines what might be considered a “typical”
cohort that received the intervention after the project had time to find its footing and incorporate the
early lessons from the first cohort. The content of the project and the eligibility criteria were the same
across all three cohorts, so the results from the second cohort should reasonably represent those of the
project as a whole, aside from any improvements through learning-by-doing.

3.1.     Data Collection
This evaluation draws upon a number of data sources, including the progress reports prepared by the
project implementation team, as well as the following activities conducted by Laterite Limited, an
independently contracted research firm:
    1. Baseline survey prior to Cohort 2 induction phase (Month 0): A quantitative survey was
        administered to 182 randomly sampled girls chosen for the second cohort of the AGI project. A
        team of 12 female enumerators and 4 female field coordinators interviewed the respondents in
        the eight vocational training centers (VTCs) just prior to the two-week induction phase to collect
        demographic information and key outcomes indicators (listed below). Each interview lasted
        approximately 30 minutes and were compensated with RwF 1,000 each as a transport stipend.
    2. Midline qualitative study (Month 6): Five focus group discussions (FGDs) and twelve semi-
        structured interviews (SSIs) were conducted. The purpose of the FGDs was to learn about trainees’
        opinions of the process, quality and relevance of the training they received during the first six
        months of their experience with the project. The FGD guides were structured into 9 modules: (1)
        Attendance; (2) Impacts; (3) Trade-Specific Training; (4) Life Skills Training; (5) Entrepreneurship
        Training; (6) Quality of Teachers; (7) Transition to Employment; (8) Project Management; and (9)
        Other Comments. The FGDs were conducted in five VTCs with randomly sampled participants.
        The twelve SSIs were conducted among three project participants (to follow up on issues that
        arose in FGDs), three project dropouts, three trainers, and three VTC managers.
    3. Endline qualitative study (Month 12): Eight focus group discussions (FGDs) with project
        participants and ten semi-structured interviews (SSIs) with project implementers were conducted.
        Participants of the FGDs were compensated with RwF 1,000 for their time and as a transport
        stipend. The purpose of the FGDs was to gain insight into the perceptions of participants on the
        challenges and successes they faced in transitioning to work as well as the quality of the follow-
        up support they received from the project. One FGD was conducted in each VTC among a random
        sample of eight participants who did not participate in either the baseline survey or the midline
        FGDs. No dropouts were interviewed at endline. The FGDs explored the following themes: girls’
        challenges with regard to everyday life and employment, AGI’s support in addressing these
        challenges, perceived impacts of the project, including narratives of change, and feedback on
        follow-up support received. These main themes were also included in ten SSIs with project
        managers, VTC managers, trainers and mentors (a full list of SSI is found in Annex 2), along with
        questions regarding trade selection, private sector partnerships with Gahaya Links and Centre
        Psychotherapeutique Icyizere (CPI), and cooperative formation.
    4. Endline quantitative survey (Month 12): A follow-up survey was administered to 160 of the 182
        randomly sampled beneficiaries that responded to the baseline survey. Though special effort was
        made to follow up with the 43 individuals from the baseline survey who did not complete the
        project, the team was only able to interview 21 of them. Only a few additions and minor changes
        to clarify questions were made to the survey instrument used at baseline.12



12The precise changes made to the survey instrument are summarized in a separate endline report prepared by Laterite and
available upon request.

3.2.      Indicators
A full list of indicators measured in the quantitative surveys (baseline and follow-up) is included in Annex
5. The indicators, based on a subset of outcomes used in other AGI impact evaluations, covered the
following areas:
 Employment: Engagement in income-generating activities (IGAs); Characteristics of IGAs: self or wage
     employment, agriculture or not; Nature of the enterprise, location of the work; Number of IGAs; Time
     devoted to IGAs
 Earnings: Earnings (cash and in-kind); Control over earnings; Non-earned income (transfers)
 Economic assets: Savings; Debt; Access to credit; Physical assets (e.g., mobile phone, radio);
     Productive assets (e.g., livestock, sewing machine)
 Social assets: Friends; Mentors; Colleagues; Support from partner; Support from family
 Empowerment: Self-confidence; Control over resources; Access to money in an emergency
 Child well-being (if respondent has children): Children’s educational enrolment; Spending on
     children’s education and health; Difficulty in meeting basic needs for children


3.3.      Sampling
3.3.1. Quantitative Surveys
The sample size for the quantitative baseline and endline surveys was 180 girls. A minimum sample size
of 150 respondents was needed to detect the employment rate of the full cohort of 650 with 95%
confidence. Using data from the Rwanda 2010 DHS survey, in which the employment rate of young women
aged 15-19 was 52%, the sample size was calculated using the following assumptions: 95% confidence,
5% maximum error rate, 650 finite population size. An additional 30 girls were included to account for
possible attrition between baseline and endline. A total of 182 girls responded to the baseline survey and
of those, 160 responded to the endline survey.

The sample was stratified by the sector of participants’ residence. In each sector, all applicants who passed
the eligibility screening by a sector-level committee were entered into a lottery to determine admission

                                                                                                          13
into the project.13 The lottery was held publically and girls were invited to attend. Directly after the lottery,
the research team from Laterite Limited conducted uniform random sampling (in Excel) to select a subset
of admitted applicants for the baseline survey. The baseline survey was conducted immediately after the
sampling.14


3.3.2. Focus Group Discussions
At midline, the FGDs were conducted in five VTCs, four of which were chosen randomly by the research
team (Gacuriro and Nyarugunga in urban districts, and Bushoki and Rushaki in rural districts) and one of
which (Shyrongi VTC) was selected by the AGI project implementation team because it was considered an
exemplary VTC. In most cases, the research team randomly sampled six participants per VTC from among
those who responded to the baseline survey.15 If the selected participants were not present at the time
of the interview (either because they were absent that day or because they had actually dropped out of
the project), then other girls from the list were randomly selected in their place. The Laterite team read
the list of randomly selected names (or provided a list of pre-selected girls to the school manager) upon
arrival at each VTC.

At endline, the team from Laterite followed a similar strategy to select FGD participants. The sample was
drawn from participants in the second cohort of trainees who did not take part in either the baseline or
endline quantitative surveys, were not interviewed during the midline qualitative study, and were not
dropouts. The research team filtered the entire list of Cohort 2 trainees using the above criteria and
subsequently randomly selected 8 participants in each of the 8 Vocational Training Centers. Laterite
selected more participants than the required 6 in anticipation of attrition and considering that trainees
did not attend their schools on a regular basis during the third component of the project.


3.4.     Analysis
3.4.1. Quantitative
The quantitative analysis was conducted by the World Bank. Baseline and endline survey data were used
to compare the outcomes of Cohort 2 beneficiaries before and after the project. After cleaning the data
to resolve inconsistencies and drop outliers, basic descriptive statistics were computed to give an overall
picture of the beneficiaries’ status. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the average values of
each indicator using Student’s t-test. A more detailed description of the indicators and the analysis can be
found in Annexes 4 and 5.


13 For Cohort 2, there were 1,364 applicants who passed the screening committee and 712 were randomly selected for project
admission. Unsuccessful but eligible applicants were allowed to enter the lottery for the third cohort, which started just one
month after the second cohort. Hence, there was no feasible way to use the rejected applicants as a control group for an
impact evaluation.
14 Note that the baseline survey was administered only to those who were physically present at the lottery. In 6 of the 11

sectors of recruitment, girls who did not appear for the lottery were excluded from the project, so the evaluation sample
reflects the project sample. In the other 5 sectors, absent applicants who were randomly selected for project admission were
still allowed to join, but they were still excluded from the baseline survey.
15 In Nyaragunga, the research team conducted the FGD at the headquarters of Gahaya Links, a private company that provided

the arts and crafts training. On the day of the site visit, most of the randomly sampled participants were not present at Gahaya
Links (they were either at their VTC receiving other training or absent). The team replaced the randomly sampled girls with
participants who were present at Gahaya Links that day.

                                                                                                                              14
3.4.2. Qualitative
The qualitative analysis was undertaken by Laterite Limited. After transcribing and translating both FGDs
and SSIs (based on written notes and audio-recordings), the researchers compiled responses to all key
questions into a spreadsheet to facilitate comparisons and analysis. Using this matrix, averages were
calculated for binary responses (e.g., Yes and No) to determine the frequency of responses. Key themes
were identified from the matrix and quotes were selected that represented the majority opinion as well
as important outliers. The analysis for SSIs was combined with the FGD analysis matrix. Over-arching
themes/ideas that were identified during the data collection process were confirmed using this matrix.
The researchers reviewed all transcripts to note any areas of disagreement and to compare the findings
from project staff interviews with those from participant/dropout interviews. A similar process was used
for the endline with a FGD analysis matrix supplementing the SSI analysis.

4.          Profile of AGI Participants
In line with the project’s objective of reaching vulnerable girls who would not otherwise access formal
education or vocational training, the following criteria were used to determine eligibility:
     1. Be between 16-24 years of age
     2. Be out of school for at least one year
     3. Have some primary education (preferably completed primary education)
     4. Live in the vicinity of the training center
     5. Be classified as highly vulnerable or at risk of becoming highly vulnerable

The baseline survey data provide a comprehensive portrait of the status of AGI participants before starting
the project.16 The survey instruments modules covered (i) demographic characteristics; (ii) economic
activity; (iii) economic assets; and (iv) social support and empowerment. To supplement these measures
of well-being, girls’ own perceptions of vulnerabilities were explored qualitatively in focus group
discussions.

4.1.        Demographics
The study population reflects the intended eligibility criteria to a high degree, with all respondents aged
between 15 and 25 and not enrolled in school at the time of the baseline survey. The project attracted
a young population, as 61 percent of baseline respondents were aged 20 or under. Almost all (94 percent)
respondents had completed primary school, with 44 percent also having completed some secondary
education. The required education levels for AGI respondents are one key way in which AGI participants
are not representative of the general population. The Demographic and Health Survey (2010) reports that
57 percent of Rwandan girls age 15 to 24 have some primary education, 20 percent have some secondary
education and 4 percent have completed secondary or above. Almost all (91 percent) of AGI respondents
had never been married at baseline, and one-quarter of them were mothers, with respondents reporting
having one child on average. As per AGI requirements, no respondent was pregnant at baseline. Half of
respondents reported having at least one deceased parent, perhaps reflecting the legacy of Rwanda’s
genocide twenty years before.

                                                                                                                    15
4.2.     Economic Activity
At baseline, AGI respondents were asked about their involvement in any of the four following income
generating activity (IGA) categories:

        Household agricultural activities, whether for sale or for household food
        Employment for wages or in-kind payment, including casual labor or work on someone else’s farm
        Employment in any kind of non-farm business, whether paid or unpaid
        Internship or apprenticeship, whether paid or unpaid

Baseline levels of economic activity were high, but not abnormal for the country context. Looking
exclusively at non-farm IGAs (wage employment, non-farm businesses, and internships), half (50 percent)
of AGI respondents were active at baseline. If we consider any type of IGA as described in the four
categories above (including household agriculture), then more than three quarters (81 percent) were
engaged in at least one IGA. While this is a high rate of involvement, it is not unusually high for Rwanda,
where the national employment rate among women aged 15 to 24 is 61 percent.17 One reason why AGI
beneficiaries may have had a higher employment rate at baseline than the general population is that they
had completed primary school, but were not currently in school, thus having both time available and basic
skills. Another potential reason is that AGI beneficiaries may be more motivated than the average girl, as
demonstrated by their signing up for the AGI training.

Despite the high employment rates, many of the activities carried out by the interviewed girls were
unpaid. Fifty-four percent of all AGI respondents, or 69 percent of those involved in an IGA (including
household agriculture), reported having earned money or in-kind payment for at least one of their


17 DHS (2010) asks respondents if they have worked in the last 12 months.58.5% report currently working, 12.3% of
respondents report working in the past 12 months and 2.9% report having a job but being on leave for the past 7 days. This
figure comprises of those respondents who are currently working and those on leave, and includes household agriculture as
employment.
18 Five respondents did not provide information on income generating activities. As this information is missing, they are not

included in and IGA and earnings measures.
19 Involvement in non-agricultural IGAs comprises of respondents who report involvement in wage employment or non-farm

employment and no involvement in household agriculture.
20 Involvement in any IGA comprises of reported involvement in household agriculture, wage employment or non-farm

employment. Involvement in internships is not included in the calculation, as no respondents report taking part only in an
internship. These are implicitly included as a result of respondents’ simultaneous involvement in household agriculture, non-
farm employment or wage employment.

                                                                                                                                16
activities during the previous month. These figures are similar to those reported in the DHS (2010): 51
percent of the survey population, or 70 percent of those employed at the time of the survey, reported
receiving cash, in-kind payments or both.

The statistics varied substantially for urban versus rural areas, with a large portion of rural IGAs being
household agriculture (see Figure 4.1). A higher share of rural respondents reported involvement in any
IGA (90% vs. 63%), because they were more likely to work on the family farm. Conversely, more
respondents in urban areas reported being engaged in non-farm IGAs (57% vs. 43%) due to better access
to wage employment opportunities. The more surprising finding that rural respondents were more likely
to be paid than urban respondents is explained in part by the significantly higher overall employment rate,
and in part by the fact that many of the girls living in urban areas were employed as housemaids21 and
hadn’t received any income in the previous month.

In both rural and urban settings, self-employment was more common than wage employment at
baseline. Among rural respondents, 64 percent were working either for themselves or a family member,
as opposed to just 11 percent being employed by someone else. In urban areas, 37 percent were self-
employed and 22 percent were engaged in wage employment. The prevalence of self-employment is
partly explained by engagement in household agriculture. Among those engaged in non-farm activities,
wage employment was almost as common as self-employment at baseline.22

Throughout this report, monthly earnings of respondents are summarized in two ways:
     Unconditional earnings, equal to the average earnings among the entire survey population
     Conditional earnings, equal to the average earnings among respondents who report involvement
       in an income generating activity with earnings greater than zero

We also distinguish between monthly earnings in cash income versus in-kind payments.


21A third (5 out of 14) of the urban respondents engaged in at least one IGA but reporting being unpaid worked as housemaids.
22Among the sub-sample of respondents engaged in at least one non-farm IGA: In rural areas, 26 percent of girls reported
working for themselves or a family member and 20 percent reported being employed by someone else. Ratios were even more
similar in urban areas, where 30 percent of respondents were self-employed and 29 percent were engaged in wage
employment.

                                                                                                                          17
Over half (54 percent) of respondents earned money in the month prior to the baseline survey: 52 percent
received cash income only, 6 percent received in-kind payments in addition to cash income, and 9 percent
only received in-kind payments. As expected, average conditional earnings (the average among those who
report non-zero earnings) were considerably higher at RwF 17,390, than average unconditional earnings
at RwF 9,034, which include the entire survey population. The median earnings among girls who had non-
zero earnings were RwF 10,000. Importantly, 80 percent of respondents reported that they were involved
in deciding how to spend their earnings, indicating a high degree of girls’ control over their own earnings
at baseline.


4.3.     Economic Assets
The ownership and control of assets has been described as a “critical component of well-being for both
adolescent girls and their families.”23 Assets are multidimensional – they can be converted to cash, store
wealth, act as collateral to credit and financial services and provide security in periods of uncertainty. The
AGI baseline survey inquired into girls’ ownership and control of assets. Although not saleable, health
insurance was the most commonly owned asset with 71.90 percent of respondents owning it. Among
marketable assets, a phone/mobile phone was the most commonly owned among respondents, with
62.50 percent of respondents reporting owning one. Respondents also indicated that they alone could
decide if and when to sell their phone.

While the incidence of saving (17.5%) and loan-taking (12.5%) were low for the overall survey population,
rates were somewhat higher among the 35 percent of respondents who reported being a member of a
savings group at baseline. A significant portion of baseline respondents had received cash or in-kind
transfers from either their boyfriends/husbands (22%) or their relatives (39%) in the past month,
indicating an important source of non-earned income.



4.4.     Social Support and Empowerment
At baseline, respondents reported receiving substantial social support from their parents and
boyfriends/husbands for their engagement in economic activities – such as vocational training, wage
employment and self-employment (all over 90%). Mentorship was also commonly available to AGI
respondents. Approximately 74 percent indicated having a mentor that could provide advice on business
or work-related matters.

The baseline survey explored the issue of empowerment by employing various subjective measures of
psychological and economic empowerment. The purpose of such scales was to establish a baseline for
comparison more than to derive meaning from the specific scores obtained for individual respondents.
Questions about the quality of one’s own life revealed a high degree of satisfaction with respondent’s
friends and families, and substantially less satisfaction with their incomes, employment, and education
levels. The girls also appeared quite optimistic as measured by the commonly used “ladder of life” which
asks respondents to rank the quality of their life today and in the future on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being
the worst possible life one can have and 10 being the best. While younger respondents appeared to be
slightly more satisfied with life in the present, all respondents seemed equally optimistic about the future.
Entrepreneurial self-confidence was also high, as measured by respondents’ perceived ability to do 11
entrepreneurship-related tasks. Interestingly, “unemployed” respondents (those with no current IGA)
reported higher entrepreneurial self-confidence scores at baseline than “employed” respondents (those
with IGAs) in every task, possibly due to their lack of professional exposure and/or experience. The survey
measured girl’s self-esteem using the well-known Rosenberg self-esteem scale, which has been validated
and used in many countries and cultural contexts.24 The average self-esteem score for AGI respondents
was 20.10, which is on the higher end of the 0-30 point scale. There was little variation across age groups,
employment status and rural/urban districts.


4.5.     Vulnerability and Challenges faced by Girls
Because quantitative survey data does not always adequately capture the vulnerabilities of young women,
respondents were asked directly about the challenges and vulnerabilities that girls face during the endline
focus group discussions. These discussions inquired about challenges in general, rather than asking girls
to list their own particular challenges. Individuals within the focus groups were asked to share their
challenges, and then the groups voted on the hardest and most important challenges.

The results, presented in Table 4.2, indicate that unplanned pregnancies and poverty are far and away the
main challenges of girls according to AGI respondents. Girls identified various repercussions of unplanned
pregnancy, including dropping out of school, struggling to support the child, and risk of marginalization of
the girl and the baby by one’s family. Girls also recognized that coming to training centers could help –
albeit indirectly – prevent unplanned pregnancies as it kept them busy and less prone to risk. As one FGD
participant in Kibali said: “You come to school, you don’t have time to go where they can trick you”.

In close second place was poverty, as agreed by 28 out of the 51 FGD participants. Girls identified the
repercussions of poverty in several areas of their lives: education (and the risk of dropout due to inability
to pay school fees), basic needs, psychological, behavioral and personal appearance/hygiene. In the
discussions held in Rushaki one girl explained that girls lack “food, clothes and body lotion” because of
poverty. Respondents in 4 of 8 FGDs also spontaneously mentioned that poverty could lead girls into
promiscuous behavior or “cause you to sell yourself”. With regard to both unplanned pregnancies and
poverty, girls repeatedly discussed the psychological effects. Because of poverty, “you always have
unpleasant thoughts, this makes your life difficult”; “it makes you feel lost, isolated and hurt” (FGD 1) and
due to unplanned pregnancy, “one loses hope for the future” (FGD 5) and “you always feel sad and
depressed” (FGD 7).

Although not discussed by the girls, project managers and other implementing partners discussed girls’
vulnerabilities in the context of exposure to sexual abuse. One project manager said: “We had some
issues. We had some girls who were violated at home... Some talked about it openly, some did not…they
needed someone to talk to and say ‘this is what has happened to me. I have not told mom, I have not told
dad, I’m not able to talk about it, but this has happened to me’” (SSI 2).

The AGI project in Rwanda led to a significant increase in economic activity among participants. By the
end of the year-long project, 75 percent of surveyed girls were involved in at least one non-farm income-
generating activity (IGA) and 42 percent were operating non-farm businesses, often trading food
products, ornaments or jewelry they made themselves. Increased membership in cooperatives and
savings groups facilitated by the AGI project also contributed to an expansion in the scale of businesses,
which were more likely to be jointly-owned and to have larger inventories. Average earnings and business
profits doubled over the course of the project, while savings and livestock ownership also increased
considerably. Only a third of respondents were involved in an IGA related to the trade they studied,
however, with arts and crafts trainees being the least likely to apply their new skills.

Surveyed participants reported improvements beyond the economic realm as well: they were more
satisfied with their lives, worried less about getting a job in the future or their families not having money
for basic needs, and showed higher self-confidence, especially in terms of identifying business
opportunities and running their own businesses. Nevertheless, the data also shows a concerning increase
in reported sexual harassment among interviewed young women. While this may be partly due to the
success of the project in encouraging girls to talk more openly about their problems, it may also indicate
a higher degree of vulnerability associated with their new IGAs.

The achievements of the AGI program are impressive, particularly when considering the profile of
participants and the length of time that the evaluation allows for outcomes to manifest. Participants were
young and vulnerable girls from poor communities, who were out of school and faced limited
opportunities to improve their living conditions on their own. It is also important to keep in mind that the
findings presented here refer to the situation of girls shortly after their completion of the program. The
endline survey was administered at the end of the mentoring phase. It is possible that girls’ economic
activity would be even higher once their businesses and cooperatives became more established. The
evaluation provides us with a snapshot of participants’ lives approximately six months after the technical
training, but it does not allow us to comment on the medium-term effects or the sustainability of observed
changes in the long run.

 Box 5.1 AGI b rought about significant change in the lives of vulnerable participants

 Kibali Trainee: “Previously, I had a hard life; I had no body lotion, no clothes and no shoes. […] When I mastered my
 trade, I started working on my own, I sold fabrics at the market place and I got money to buy what I needed. Now, I
 lead a good life, I don’t beg for money anymore, I look for money myself.”

 Rutare Trainee: "Before I started the project, I was a farmer and I was working very hard. I had left school because
 of a lack of means. I had challenges such as having no clothes, no body lotion for my skin. […] I studied arts and
 crafts. I learned a lot, how to make pearls and fabrics to the extent of which if I had enough capital I would start my
 own business. The money they gave us helped me buy clothes as well as body lotion. Knowledge is very important
 because I will not go back to the life I was living because I am no longer ignorant. […] I socialized with others. I
 learned to save money and I managed to buy livestock."

 Gicumbi Trainer: “I have realized that most of the girls’ situation was very bad… there was a remarkable change
 because now girls are clean, they look smart due to stipends and various trainings especially the ones regarding life
 skills.”

5.1. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
5.1.1. Involvement in income-generating activities
Non-farm employment increased from 50 to 75 percent over the course of the AGI project. Surveyed
participants were asked about their involvement in each of the four following income generating activity
(IGA) categories: household agriculture, wage employment, non-farm business, and internship. At
endline, the share of respondents engaged in at least one IGA other than household agriculture grew from
50 percent to 75 percent. By equipping participants with technical and entrepreneurial skills, the AGI
project therefore enabled them to pursue a wider range of income-generating activities (IGAs). The
proportion of respondents with household agriculture as their only IGA dropped from 31 percent to 17
percent, as did that of respondents without any IGAs (from 19% to 8%).

Consequently, overall employment increased substantially too. Despite the substantial increase in non-
farm employment, helping with the family farm remained a common activity for girls in our sample.
Irrespective of involvement in other types of IGA, a constant percentage of respondents (58% at baseline
and 59% at endline) reported involvement in household agriculture the previous month. Although working
on the family farm may not provide girls with a direct income, it is important to take this type of work into
account because it is a contribution to their households’ livelihoods.

Not only were beneficiaries more likely to be working, but the number of activities they were involved
in also increased. First, as illustrated above, the share of respondents with no IGA decreased from 18.71
percent at baseline to 8.39 percent at endline. Second, the average number of reported IGAs increased
considerably, from 1.16 to 1.62, over the course of the AGI project. As the share of respondents with only
one IGA went from 52.30 percent down to 39.40 percent, the share of those with two or three IGAs
increased from 23.20 percent to 34.80 percent, and from 5.81 percent to 16.80 percent, respectively. A
22-year old woman from the Nyarugunga vocational training center (VTC) reported involvement in four
IGAs at endline, including an internship. Overall, while young women’s participation in multiple IGAs

                                                                                                            22
reflects the small-scale character of the economic opportunities available to them, running multiple
activities simultaneously is a strategy for managing low and unstable sources of income.

The increase in economic activity was driven primarily by non-agricultural IGAs. Surveyed AGI
participants were 1.5 times more likely – a 25.20 percentage point increase – to work outside their family’s
farm at endline than at baseline. Notably, involvement in non-farm businesses increased from 16.80
percent to 41.90 percent. The increase in total business ownership, which also includes sale of own
household’s agricultural production, was directly proportional with the increase in non-farm business (by
25 percent), suggesting that involvement in farming-related business remained constant. Regarded as
stepping stones towards formal employment, internships also became much more common among
respondents (2.58 percent to 20 percent). Internships were especially common among food processing
trainees, 25 percent of whom were placed as interns at Inyange Industries, Blessed Dairies etc. Qualitative
data suggests that providing reference letters for girls to obtain internships was common practice across
VTC managers. According to a project manager, 80 percent of the culinary arts trainees who worked as
interns were offered permanent jobs afterwards.26

While there was only a minor overall change in engagement in household agriculture or wage
employment, disaggregating by place of residence reveals important differences in livelihood strategies.
In rural areas, IGA participation rates increased across the board, including for household farming and
paid jobs (from 85.90 percent to 89.40 percent, and from 29.30 percent to 38.30 percent, respectively),
which suggests that businesses were developed alongside continued participation in agriculture. Urban
areas, on the other hand, saw a decline in agricultural activities (from 20.60 percent to 16.40 percent) as
well as wage employment (from 49.20 percent to 41 percent). A potential explanation is that earning
money through self-employment enabled young women to reduce reliance on family farming or to move
away from less desirable jobs.




26We cannot verify this in the quantitative data, because the switch from internship to full-time job would have occurred
between the baseline and endline surveys.

Small-scale trading activities emerged as the most common non-agricultural IGAs. Specifically, the two
occupations that expanded the most between baseline and endline were “vendor”28 (from 2.58 percent
to 12.30 percent) and “small trade/business” (from 3.23 percent to 10.30 percent). Almost a quarter
(22.60 percent) of working respondents were engaged in buying and selling activities by the end of the
project. Moreover, “livestock husbandry” was also reported as an IGA by significantly more respondents
at endline than at baseline (14.20 percent vs. 7.74 percent). A more detailed discussion will follow later in
the report (section 2.3.), but qualitative data suggests that AGI participants used part of their
transportation stipends to buy livestock for rearing and sale. Although a higher share of respondents were
engaging in non-farming activities at endline, agriculture remained at least one of multiple IGAs for almost
half (47.1 percent) of them.




27  Respondents were asked about their involvement in each of four IGA categories: (i) household agricultural activities, whether
for sale or consumption, (ii) employment for wages or in-kind payment, including casual labor or work on someone else’s farm,
(iii) employment in any kind of non-farm business, whether paid or unpaid, and (iv) internship or apprenticeship.
28 The term “vendor” refers to “Umucuruzi wo ku muhanda (harimo no gucuririza ku isoko) ” in Kinyarwanda, and includes petty

traders selling goods on the street or in markets.

Self-employment, defined as working either for herself or a family enterprise, in rural areas accounts
for almost the entire increase in non-farm employment. While the share of respondents engaged only in
wage employment, defined as working for a non-relative, remained constant at 23 percent, the share of
self-employed respondents increased by 17 percentage points (from 27% to 45%). Similarly, the share of
respondents reporting both self-employment and wage employment went from 5 percent to 8 percent.
Disaggregating by type of place of residence, it becomes clear that the most significant increase in non-
farm employment occurred in rural areas. Here, the share of respondents without any IGAs outside
household agriculture dropped significantly (from 48% to 17%) over the course of the AGI project. The
increase was solely driven by self-employment (from 26% to 53%), as the prevalence of wage employment
remained unchanged.

Urban areas also saw improvements in non-farm employment, though not as large as in rural areas
because of higher baseline employment. While non-farm employment increased from 43 percent to 75
percent among rural respondents, the share of urban respondents reporting non-farm IGAs only increased
from 56 percent to 77 percent. Although no significant increases were observed in urban or rural aras,
wage employment remained more common in urban than in rural areas due to greater access to
employment opportunities outside of the household. A focus group participant in Rushaki explained that
“[the management] have helped us getting jobs by giving us advice, finding us a place to work and a
market for our products.” There were variations across VTCs, however, with trainees in three locations
(Bushoki, Gacuriro and Kibali) stating that project staff did not help them access direct employment and
encouraged them to form cooperatives instead, whereas in the other three locations (Nyarugunga, Rutare
and Rushaki), trainees reported receiving help to find formal jobs.

The emphasis on self-employment is also apparent in respondents’ job searches. As the share of young
women searching for any type of employment increased from 48.75 percent to 74.38 percent, the
increase was concentrated in self-employment opportunities (from 43.75 percent to 73.75 percent) rather
than in wage employment (from 45 percent to 51.88 percent). Reasons cited for not having searched for
work include being already involved in other activities and being pregnant or nearly due to give birth.

Self-employment is often associated with membership in a cooperative. The post-training phase
prioritized cooperative formation as a way of enabling young women to pool their resources and to
support each other. Despite delays in the registration process, 81.76 percent of respondents reported
being members of cooperatives at the time of the endline survey, as opposed to only 9.43 percent the
year before. Out of 51 respondents in the endline focus group discussions (FGDs), 12 girls referred to
cooperative-related work whether this
involved farming, selling arts and crafts
products in the market place or having a
restaurant,     whereas      only      four
respondents reported employment other
than being involved in cooperatives. A
number of focus group discussants
conveyed significant understanding of
their position and rights within their
respective cooperatives, as two groups
stated that they have equal advantages
within the cooperative as “profits are
shared equally” (FGD 6) and “there is no
favoritism” (FGD 7). There were also issues
that emerged within these small

associations, including mistrust, disagreement, and lack of equipment, capital and unavailability of
markets for produces. Overall, however, it seems that by enabling girls to form cooperatives, the AGI
project led to an expansion of businesses, with more of them being jointly-owned and having larger
inventories.

Business ownership more than doubled over the course of the project, driven by a substantial increase
in joint-ownership. While only 13.80 percent of respondents declared having a business at baseline, their
share increased to 35 percent at endline. Because many of the new business were started by cooperative
members, joint-ownership became significantly more common: 54 percent of businesses were jointly-
owned at endline, as opposed to 27 percent at baseline. Among the 22 businesses reported at baseline
and the 56 businesses reported at endline, half in each case were concerned with the buying and selling
of goods. While the relative share of retail businesses remained constant, their frequency increased
significantly, from 11 at baseline to 28 at endline. Retail sale via stalls and markets was most common (36
percent) among buying and selling businesses, followed by retail sale not in stores, stalls or markets (26
percent) and retail sale in stores (21 percent). Finally, manufacturing or processing of goods, usually of
food products or beverages, saw a significant increase, with its share among businesses rising from 6.88
percent to 17.50 percent over the course of the project.

The increase in business ownership was accompanied by significant improvements in respondents’
reported business practices. While no business was registered with the government at baseline, the
business registration rate went up to 40 percent by endline. Surveyed participants were also much more
likely to keep written records of business expenses and sales (from 9 percent to 70 percent), and to store
money from their businesses separately from money for personal use (from 4 percent to 77 percent).
These improvements were recognized by the girls themselves, who mentioned learning “to seek
opportunities to make money and to gain customers, ” and “about starting capital […] how to identify and
know the products you need to offer, how to gain a reputation through friendships with customers” during
the focus groups. The entrepreneurship training administered by Frontiers Great Lakes appears to have
been successful at building the business management capabilities of participants.

Despite high IGA involvement overall, the likelihood that girls were applying the trade they studied
varied significantly across training groups. Disaggregated by type of trade, the proportion of respondents
working at the end of the project ranged from 84 percent among culinary trainees to 100 percent among
agri-business trainees. The shares doing something related to their vocational training, however, present
a different picture. When asked if they were working in the trade they studied,29 41 percent of culinary
trainees, 38 percent of food processing trainees, and 53 percent of agri-business trainees said they were.
Indeed, the VTC manager from Rutare praised the commercial success of a group of food-processing
trainees: “They are producing juice and they say that all of the products – the juice – has been sold. You
find that if their products are popular on the market, it gives the management the trust that what they
are doing has quality.”

On the other hand, although 98 percent of arts and crafts trainees were engaged in at least one IGA, only
12.5 percent among them said they were using their trade. Focus group discussants in Nyarugunga
mentioned that girls were involved in making jewelry as part of an order addressed to their VTC manager,
but it seems that this was only a temporary IGA that ended by the time of the endline survey and was not
captured by the data. Not being able to apply the skills acquired learned during the arts and crafts training
was explicitly brought up by focus group discussants, who suggested that a broader range of trades should
be taught in the VTCs to address the “market” problem.

29This question allowed for some flexibility in matching training course with the type of IGA developed during the post-training phase, with
both cooking and making juice, for example, seen as related to both food processing and culinary trades.

                                                                                                                                               28
Linking girls to markets was one of the strategies
employed during the post-training phase to help
participants find employment, but with only limited
success. As explained in more detail in section 6,
none of the approaches introduced by the mentors
(participating in exhibitions, setting up selling points
at the border, using businesses as intermediaries, or
weekly trips to Kigali) proved sustainable. While
many focus group participants acknowledged the
positive change brought by participation in the AGI
project (“when someone teaches you something,
they bring you out of poverty,” “we won’t be poor
because after this training we will get jobs; we get
money from our cooperatives and we can sustain
ourselves,” “it’s easy to find a job in my trade
because I have knowledge in this trade”), there was
a consensus among participants as well as project staff that marketing their products was a considerable
challenge.

5.1.2. Earnings and business profits
A higher share of AGI participants reported earning an income due to an increase in profitable
businesses. Despite a 92 percent economic participation rate, only 58.10 percent of respondents were
being paid for any of their IGAs by the end of the project. This is only a modest increase from the 54.80
percent being paid at baseline, although the percentage receiving only in-kind payments declined from
8.73 percent of those paid at baseline to 4.86 percent at endline. 53 out of the 146 respondents involved
in at least one IGA at endline didn’t report any earnings, neither cash nor in-kind, during the month prior
to the survey. The majority (29) of unpaid workers were involved in agriculture, while smaller shares were
employed as maids (7), interns (2), clerks or restaurant workers (2). Making money through businesses,
on the other hand, became significantly more common over the course of the project (from 12.30 percent
to 29.40 percent among those with IGAs). As illustrated in the figure below, the 20 percent reduction in
the share of working respondents with no income is driven exclusively by an increase in profit-making
businesses, with 12.50 percent instead of 3.17 percent reporting only business income. Overall, the
percentage of respondents having money of their own that they alone can decide how to use increased
significantly over the course of the project, from 42 percent at baseline to 64 percent at endline.

Amounts of earnings increased significantly across the board. Looking at cash incomes only, average
earnings of the entire sample almost doubled, from RwF 5,415 to RwF 10,254. Average conditional
earnings (the average of those who report no-zero earnings) also increased significantly, from RwF 11,883
to RwF 19,288. Including in-kind transfers, or payments in goods, commodities, or services instead of
money, the increases in earnings from baseline to endline are still large (from RwF 9,034 to RwF 12,657
for the entire sample, and from RwF 17,390 to RwF 21,976 for those with paid IGAs), but no longer
statistically significant. Median earnings for those with paid IGAs increased by RwF 4,585, from RwF
17,390 at baseline to RwF 21,975 at endline. Among the most common IGAs, household agriculture
generated RwF 8,732 per month on average (RwF 4,188 of which as in-kind payments), working on
somebody else’s farm for an average of 11 days generated RwF 9,813, while small traders and vendors
earned RwF 13,126 and RwF 14,833, respectively, and those in food processing made RwF 33,545. The
new IGAs girls were involved in were therefore substantially more lucrative than the agricultural ones
they were moving away from.

There was a substantial increase in business profits, which doubled over the course of the project from
RwF 7,464 to RwF 15,290. The most sizeable change, however, occurred in terms of the average reported
expenditures on business inputs and inventories, from an average of RwF 11,419 at baseline to RwF 47,669
at endline. This increase was mostly driven by investments of over RwF 100,000 made by mostly (10 out
of 12) jointly-owned businesses and is indicative of a larger trend: from baseline to endline, the share of
jointly-owned businesses doubled from 27 percent to 54 percent. It can be concluded that the AGI
project’s emphasis on cooperative formation successfully facilitated the pooling of funds for the
development of larger businesses, in the hope of generating higher profits in the future.

5.1.3. Unearned income (transfers)
There was a large and significant increase in respondents’ transfers, both received and given, during the
previous month. While respondents were less likely to have transferred money at endline than at
baseline, the average total amounts were more than double (RwF 9,263 instead of RwF 4,492). Children
received the largest transfers (RwF 2,041), closely followed by relatives other than husband or boyfriend
(RwF 1,924). The increase in gifts to children is notable and reflects participants’ concern with education,
in the context where less than 2 percent of them were able to complete secondary school. Focus group
participants explained that it was common for girls in their community to drop out of school primarily
because that they lacked the money to pay for school fees and necessary school materials, but also
because they were burdened with household chores or their parents prioritized their brothers’ education
instead. Furthermore, a lower percentage of mothers reported having experienced any difficulty in
meeting the basic needs of her children, such as food, clothes, education or health expenses, during the
previous six month (67 percent at endline vs. 78 percent at baseline).

Total gifts received by respondents increased significantly, from RwF 3,613 at baseline to RwF 7,597 at
endline, mostly from husbands and boyfriends (RwF 1,603 at baseline and RwF 4,198 at endline). Transfers
from non-relatives, usually from religious and community organizations, also became significantly more
prominent, increasing from RwF 404 at baseline to RwF 1,859 at endline. Note that transfers reported
here refer to the previous month only, so do not include the transportation stipends received by the girls
during the AGI training. Overall, respondents transferred RwF 1,666 more than they received at endline,
an amount larger by RwF 786 than at baseline, but not statistically significant.

5.2. ECONOMIC ASSETS
5.2.1. Savings and loans
Respondents were significantly more likely to be members of savings groups, to have saved recently,
and to have saved larger amounts after participating in the AGI project. As part of the post-training
phase, the project helped AGI trainees open individual Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCO) accounts
to save part of their stipends. Of the RwF 700 received daily, RwF 200 would be deposited directly into
the account and the remaining RwF 500 given directly to the girls to cover transportation fees. Access to
these savings was restricted until completion of the training phase in order to be used as start-up capital
for cooperatives. As a result, savings group membership increased from 27 percent at baseline to 81
percent at endline. With the majority of respondents being members of savings groups, the overall share
of the population having saved in the previous two weeks also increased significantly, from 18 percent to

  Box 5.2 SACCO members used part of their stipends as start -up capital for new businesses.

  Rutare Trainee: “AGI gave us money, RwF 700 per day, out of which I would get RwF 500 per day
  every week. In class we were 20, we would take RwF 2,000 and invest it in a VSLA and take RwF 500
  home to buy body lotion and soap. In the VSLA we would do a lottery and one would get RwF 40,000.
  I got RwF 40,000 and I started selling tomatoes and vegetables at the market place. Now I have my
  own small shop. I never thought I could get to this point. AGI came and drew me out of poverty.”


                                                                                                               32
37 percent. According to information collected through qualitative research, the project seems to have
instilled a savings culture (FGD 3, FGD 4, FGD 5, FGD6) or else financial management skills among the
trainees, as many focus group discussants declared that they kept track of their money and tried to spend
within their means (FGD 5, FGD 7, FGD 8).

Six months after completing the training and no longer receiving stipends, respondents reported savings
significantly higher than at baseline. Average total savings amounted to RwF 31,171 among the 59
respondents who indicated saving in the past two weeks and RwF 20,086 among the entire survey
population. Compared to baseline values, respondents not only improved their savings behavior, but
those who saved also managed to put aside 78 percent more. One interviewed project manager estimated
that cooperatives had, on average, RwF 300,000, amounting to a total of RwF 7,800,000 available to the
261 cooperatives formed by cohort 2 trainees during the post-training phase of the project.

Incidence of loans, on the other hand, remained low, with only 11 respondents (7 percent) declaring to
               SAVINGS money
had ever borrowed          AMOUNTS  from a microfinance institution, VSLA or NGO, and only 5 respondents (3
percent) having outstanding loans at the time of the endline survey. Many more girls (89 respondents, or
                                       31171
56 percent) had ever borrowed money from friends or family, however, and 30 respondents (19 percent)
had outstanding informal loans at endline. Average loan amounts of formal loans increased from RwF
16,800 to RwF   20086
                   20,100 over     the course of the project. In addition, average amounts borrowed informally
                                17479
averaged RwF 8,350 at endline.30 Facilitating access to loans did not appear to be a priority for the VTCs,
as AGI participants
         7050             were expected to use their own savings as start-up capital for their cooperatives
Nevertheless, qualitative data suggests that even the cumulative savings of cooperative members were

5.2.2. Ownership of assets
Ownership of assets, especially of livestock and mobile phones, improved significantly among AGI
participants. From a list of eight assets, such as land, radio or sewing machine,31 respondents owned an
average of 1.66 assets at baseline and 2.2 assets at endline. The statistically significant increase is an
underestimate of how many durable goods they have access to, because the indicator presented here
only refers to assets owned alone by the respondents and not to assets owned jointly with at least one
other person. Taking both types of ownership into account, surveyed participants owned 2.60 assets at
baseline and 3.08 assets at endline. Health insurance and mobile phones were the two most commonly
reported assets from the beginning, with the percentages of girls having health insurance and owning
phones reaching 87 percent and 79 percent, respectively, at endline. More surprisingly, the AGI project
led to a threefold increase in livestock ownership, from 15 percent at baseline to 44 percent at endline.
This appears to be the result of AGI participants investing part of their transportation stipends to purchase
of goats, sheep or rabbits, often seen as a way to store wealth. One focus group participant said that,
“they have given us transportation stipends that we used to buy livestock, everyone at home gets to have
what they want easily.” Finally, in addition to significant increases in ownership of livestock and phones,
notable improvements were also seen in terms of young women’s control over these assets. Among those
who owned livestock alone, 86 percent reported that they would be able to sell the asset without anyone’s
permission at endline, compared to only 67 percent at baseline. Similarly, 92 percent of respondents who
owned phones alone were able to sell them at endline, up from 82 percent at baseline.

     Box 5.3 Trainees used their transportation stipends to purchase livestock.

     Although it was not explicitly promoted by the AGI project, livestock purchase appears to have been a
     very common strategy for income generation for AGI graduates. Amongst the 51 trainees interviewed,
     nine mentioned using money from their savings to buy small animals for rearing.

     Kicukiro Trainee: "I dropped out of school after failing the senior three National Exams and when I
     heard of this project I believed that if I get selected my life would change. I am so grateful to AGI, I have
     completed the trainings, I have gained new skills and I have managed to buy a goat of RwF 20,000 out
     of the savings I made from the money for transport that they gave us. I can sustain myself and I don’t
     ask my parents for money anymore."

     Kinihira Trainee: “Before I joined this project I owned nothing at home, but we made small groups and
     put money together and out of that I have managed to buy a sheep that even provides us with manure.”

     Kinihira Trainee: "Before I joined this project I was so dependent to my husband but then I used some of
     the money they gave us to buy a rabbit, it has reproduced and I sold some of its young ones. I now can
     take good care of my children and my husband gives me more value than before.”



5.3. TIME USE AT HOME
Increased engagement in IGAs did not translate into a reduction in the hours spent on household
chores. At baseline, respondents allotted 6.23 hours a day to domestic responsibilities, such as collecting
fuel materials, fetching water, cooking and cleaning, and childcare.32 Comparing respondents according
to their “employment” status revealed that those without any economic activities spent almost two hours
more every day on domestic chores (7.52 vs. 5.93). This relationship disappeared, however, at endline,
when average time spent by both economically active and inactive respondents equaled the overall
average of 6.23 hours per day, which remained unchanged. Focus group discussants provide some
supporting evidence by citing cases of women being unable to attend meetings because their husbands
insisted they carried out household duties. In fact, married respondents tend to spend an hour more than
unmarried respondents on domestic chores (7.19 vs. 6.01), while the difference between mothers and
women without children is even larger (7.22 vs. 5.73). In a context where social norms assign household
responsibilities almost exclusively to women, time spent on income-generating activities is more likely to
be accompanied by a reduction in leisure rather than in domestic chores.

5.4. SOCIAL ASSETS
The AGI project provided participants with opportunities to expand their social networks and led to
moderate improvements in their communication with friends, family and the community. Respondents
gained one new same-age friend by the end of the project, with the average increasing from four to five
friends. Positive changes were also seen in terms of connecting with others, as one focus group discussant
explaining that “teachers helped [them] overcome [their] isolation, which was a result of poverty.”
Although the majority (over three quarters) already reported discussing each issue listed in the
questionnaire with their friends, differences between baseline and endline are indicative of changes in
respondents’ lives over the course of the project. Problems in the households no longer featured as the
issue discussed by most respondents (from 84 percent to 76 percent), suggesting that respondents were
less concerned with it33. Conversely, hopes or plans for the future became a more common topic of
conversation among respondents (from 77 percent to 80 percent), as did being bothered by men or boys
(from 74 percent to 80 percent), which also seems to be a consequence of an actual increase in

her new social context: “AGI helped me regain love because I felt that I had no love left in me. I was able
to socialize with others and regained hope.”

Moderate improvements were also seen in terms of parental and community support. While over nine
out of ten respondents felt their parents or guardians were supportive of professional activities – such as
vocational training, wage employment and self-employment (all over 93 percent at baseline and over 94
percent at endline) – and socializing with friends (88 percent at baseline and 91 percent at endline), only
about half of respondents (57 percent at endline, up from 47 percent at baseline) felt their parents were
supportive of dating. High levels of community support also persisted, with notable improvements in
terms of respondents having someone to borrow money from in case of emergency (from 61 percent to
72 percent) and having a place to meet female friends (from 67 percent to 79 percent), both aspects
directly related to goals of the AGI project.

 Bushoki Trainee: “Before [I] came here I had spent one year at home because I had dropped out of
 school from senior two. My mom discouraged me a lot that the trainings will make no change in
 my life since then I have been saving a little portion of the money they gave us for transport to
 show my mom that the whole thing is really helpful. I now can buy all I need and support my mom. I
 have also managed to buy sheep for rearing and a mobile phone of 5000RFW."

 Gasabo Trainee: "Before I joined the AGI project, I was at home and was not doing anything. My
 husband would often insult me; tell me that I was pointless, that all I was doing was sitting at
 home. My life started changing when I went back to school, my husband would not find me home
 when coming back and he knew that I had gone to study. Now that I am educated, I can now work
 and I can also become an entrepreneur. This change is important to me because I can now move
 forward in life, it’s easy to find a job in my trade because I have knowledge in this trade. I have
 become self-confident as I have knowledge of a trade".

 Bushoki Trainee: "I got pregnant when I was in senior one and I was affected because of how my
 family treated me so when I came to this school they discouraged me that I want to bring them
 another unwanted child but that did not bring me down. I continued attending the trainings and
 now I have bought pigs for rearing and I do take a good care of my child. I came to AGI three years
 after dropping out of school."


Finally, despite the mentorship component of the AGI project, the increase in the share of respondents
who reported having a mentor who can provide advice on business or work-related matters was modest:
from 74 percent at baseline to 80 percent at endline. 74.4 percent of respondents with a mentor reported
meeting them at least once a week, while 18.1 percent reported meeting only once or twice a month.
Based on information from the qualitative research, however, it appears that mentors did play an active
role during the post-training phase: they facilitated the formation of cooperatives by helping participants
comply with the conditions necessary for registration and providing them with advice on business
ventures, business plans, and management. Some of the mentors also helped trainees become members

of savings groups and others facilitated links with markets through exhibitions or business connections.
The availability of only one mentor per VTC is likely to have limited the scope of their ability to provide
more direct assistance to participants.



5.5. EMPOWERMENT
5.5.1. Life satisfaction and outlook
AGI participants reported higher satisfaction
with their lives following completion of the
project. Measured by aggregating self-assessed
satisfaction in eight areas of life,35 with individual
scores ranging from 1 (completely unhappy) to 7
(completely happy), total satisfaction score
increased significantly from 31.7 at baseline to
36.7 at endline. As illustrated in Figure 5.17
below, the two areas where satisfaction
increased the most were income (2.96 to 4.33)
and job (3.43 to 4.65). It therefore emerges that
not only did the AGI project lead to increased
employment and incomes, but also to greater
perceived wellbeing among participants.

In the same vein, respondents worried significantly less about getting a job in the future (from 2-3 times
a week at baseline to once a week at endline) as well as about their families not having money for basic
needs (from almost every day to 2-3 times a week). Worrying about their family being victim of

violence/theft or experiencing nightmares did not significantly change from baseline to endline, which is
consistent with the project’s emphasis on alleviating economic constraints. These are very important
improvements, as qualitative data also points to poverty as a main concern among interviewed girls.
Household poverty is, unsurprisingly, seen as having multiple repercussions, including school dropout,
lack of “food, clothes and body lotion,” and vulnerability to abuse.

Currently improved life satisfaction translated into greater optimism for the future. AGI respondents
were also asked to rank their position on the “ladder of life,” with 1 being the worst possible life one can
have and 10 being the best possible life one can have. Respondents reported being at a higher position in
life (5.88) than they were a year before (4.11) and appeared to be highly optimistic about their position
in the future (8.01). Endline scores were also higher than baseline scores. Younger respondents (under
20) appear to be slightly more satisfied with life in the past (4.49 vs. 3.87), present (6.41 vs. 5.55) and
future (8.3 vs. 7.83), although respondents of all ages were generally very optimistic.

     Shyorongi Trainee: "I dropped out of school not because my parents couldn’t afford paying school fees
     for me but I just felt like I wanted to leave, I was fed up. After leaving school I went to Kigali to live
     with my elder sister but that didn’t make me feel any better. I was so depressed and I always wished
     to get back to school. So when my mom heard of this project they called my sister and she sent me
     back home (village) I was among the lucky ones who got selected and now I feel so complete. I am
     grateful to AGI."

     Kibali Trainee: "Before AGI I was shy, I could not stand in front of people and talk or do something
     that can be useful to others. The challenges I faced were that I lacked self-confidence, I was very poor,
     I had dropped out of school, I was always sad and I was pregnant and wondering how I will raise that
     child. Through AGI I was able to learn a trade, after school I started flour-related business. I was
     delivering to the construction sites. I was able to overcome poverty and to raise my child, I was no
     longer sad. Now I am moving forward without any problem and I share with others what I learned. I
     teach them what I learned. This change is important because self-confidence makes other people trust
     and respect you mostly when you have confidence in what you do, it benefits you and the whole
     country and it yields satisfyingly."

     Gasabo Trainee: "I am married and I have two kids. Before I joined the AGI project, I was isolated and I
     was often disrespected. AGI taught me to accept myself; before I wouldn’t speak much but my life
     changed a lot, I now have friends and am actively looking for a job. I also gained friends who can
     advise me. I used to be big headed, I would not listen to anyone, but this has eased out. Although I do
     not have a job now, I have learned how I can become an entrepreneur or work in cooperatives and
     move forward in life. I used to ask for things and I wouldn’t get them, now I can sustain myself. I also
     learned how to save money. I have learned a trade that will make me progress in life. I will help my
     husband to sustain our family. If I manage to start working, I will tell my friends to join me and leave
     their isolation.”



5.5.2. Self-esteem and entrepreneurial self-confidence
Quantitative measures of self-esteem found only modest increases. Self-esteem was measured using
the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), in which respondents were asked to rate statements based on
whether they strongly agreed, agreed, disagreed or strongly disagreed. Responses were awarded points
(3=strongly agree, 2=agree, 1=disagree, 0=strongly disagree for positive statements and reversed for
negative statements) and then summed to generate a total self-esteem score, with higher scores
indicating higher self-esteem. On a 30 point scale, the total self-esteem score for AGI respondents
increased modestly from 20.10 at baseline to 21.30 at endline. The 1.2 point increase in self-esteem score
represents an increase of 0.41 standard deviations.36 Scores ranged from 12-27 points, and there was no
systematic variation in self-esteem scores across age groups, employment status and rural/urban districts.

The focus group discussions, on the other hand, suggest that girls became much more confident and
secure as a result of the AGI project. A Gasabo trainee explained that: “Before I joined the AGI project, I

36   Standard deviation of average self-esteem scores was 2.90 at baseline.

                                                                                                             41
was isolated and I was often disrespected. AGI taught me to accept myself; before I wouldn’t speak much
but my life changed a lot, I now have friends and am actively looking for a job.” Asked more generally
about how the project helped them address other challenges they faced, girls indicated that the training
helped them improve their self-esteem by providing them with support and teaching them self-
acceptance (FGD 1), by restoring a “sense of dignity” and providing advice on how to handle abuse (FGD
6), and by making “all feel valuable” (FGD 1). Moreover, given that poverty is often associated with
negative psychological effects (“you can’t be comfortable,” “you always have unpleasant thoughts, this
makes your life difficult,” “it makes you feel lost, isolated and hurt,” and “people disrespect you because
you have no work”), it is likely that participation in the AGI project also helped improve self-esteem
indirectly, through increased engagement in IGAs.

Entrepreneurial self-confidence increased substantially by the end of the project. Rating their ability to
carry out specific tasks related to business management on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the
most confidence, respondents seemed most unsure about obtaining credit and most convinced about
their abilities to manage financial accounts and to protect their business assets. The three categories that
saw the most improvement appear to be directly connected with the curriculum of the AGI training:
identifying business opportunities and running their own business (for self-employment), and
interviewing for a professional job in an office (for wage employment).

5.5.3. Decision-making power
Increased involvement in IGAs was accompanied by an improved ability to make decisions related to
work by herself. Asked who in the household decides whether she works for pay or not, 42 percent of
respondents reported to be in charge of this decision, up from 38 percent at baseline. The share of
respondents deciding for themselves whether or not to go to the training or do household work also
increased over the course of the project, by 50 percent and 28 percent, respectively. Fewer respondents
reported being solely in charge of the decision of whether or not to have children at endline than at
baseline, however, despite the fact that 81 percent of them reported being able to decide whether to get
married or not.37 Even if not directly in charge, almost all respondents (from 95 percent to 100 percent)
participate in all decisions that concern them. The apparent decline in the ability to make decisions
regarding childbearing reflects a shift towards more joint decision-making between the respondents and
their husbands or partners.

5.6. GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE

Surveyed AGI participants were asked to indicate how frequently they had experienced the following: 38

        Verbal abuse: Boys/men verbally abuse me (e.g. called me names, shouted at, spoken to in a
         degrading manner)
        Physical violence: Boys/men hit or physically hurt me.
        Sexual harassment: Boys/men try to sleep with me although I do not want to.39

The same questions were asked at both baseline and endline, and answer choices were restricted to:
“once a week or more,” “once or twice a month,” “every two or three months,” “once a year or less” or
“never”. A respondent was identified as having ever experienced a particular type of harassment if the
answer she provided was different than “never”.

Between baseline and endline, the reported prevalence of all three indicators increased. Since the
estimates were based on whether or not the respondent had “ever” experienced certain types of
harassment, part of the increase can be simply explained by a longer observation period. However,
variation across indicators suggests that there were other factors at play too. Reports of physical violence
and verbal abuse increased, but only modestly (from 13% to 18%, and from 43% to 51%, respectively),
however a substantially higher proportion of respondents reported having ever experienced sexual
harassment (from 25% to 43%). The share of young women reporting to have been harassed either “once
a week or more,” or “one or twice a month,” increased proportionally with the decrease in “never,”
suggesting that the increase was not driven by one-off occurrences.

agasuzuguro),” “Abahungu/abagabo barankubita/barambabaza ku buryo bw'umubiri,” “Abahungu/abagabo bagerageza

Box 5.6 There are three main caveats in interpreting GBV estimates

1. It is not possible to determine when the incident(s) happened. The estimates are based on whether or
not the respondents had “ever” experienced abuse, with no indication of it occurring before, during or
after participation in the AGI training.

2. In the absence of a comparison group, we cannot attribute causality to the AGI project. The increase
in the level of gender-based violence experienced by the girls may have been caused by external factors,
such as a rise in community-level violence or girls becoming more prone to violence because they were
slightly older at endline.

3. It is not clear whether relatively higher endline values reflect an actual increase or inaccurately low
baseline values. Gender-based violence is a particularly sensitive issue that may be difficult to discuss
openly during a survey and is often underreported. Although the same (sensitive) questions were asked
at endline, it is likely that respondents provided more honest answers because they had become more at
ease with the enumerators and the interview process. It is also possible that respondents were better
able to recognize their past experiences of harassment as a result of the AGI life skills training. Either of
these conditions would indicate that baseline reports were in fact underestimates, and so the change
from baseline to endline would be overestimated in the data.



As mentioned in Box 5.6, a potential explanation for the increase in reports of sexual harassment
experienced personally is that girls felt more comfortable talking about sensitive issues during the second
round of interviews.40 More openness could have also been a direct result of participation in the AGI
project, which aimed to provide girls with peer support as well as psycho-social counseling. One of the
interviewed project managers mentioned that, following the training administered by Frontiers Great
Lakes, participants were better able to express themselves and to share their problems: “We had some
girls who were violated at home, during the training. Some talked about it openly, some did not…they
needed someone to talk to and say this is what has happened to me.” Abuse, including physical abuse by
caretakers, is also identified by 11 out of the 51 focus group participants as a main challenge faced by girls
in their community. Despite repeated mentions of abuse, however, none of the focus group discussants
suggested that their situation had worsened over the course of the AGI project. On the contrary, a number
of them indicated that attending the vocational training reduced their vulnerability both directly (“you
come to school, you don’t have time to go where they can trick you”) and indirectly, by empowering them
economically ("AGI paid for our tuition, we studied, and it taught us to become entrepreneurs so that the
abuses we experienced at home stopped”).

Higher reporting rates can also be attributed to an actual increase in the level of gender-based violence
participants and their social circle were exposed to. While our survey didn’t ask about incidence of sexual
violence – the questions referred more broadly to attempted sexual harassment, these estimates are not
inconsistent with what the DHS 2010 reports. According to the nationally-representative data, 16 percent
of Rwandan girls aged 15-24 had experienced sexual violence. Prevalence of sexual violence was even

Countries” American Journal of Epidemiology; Mar2014, Vol. 179 Issue 5, p602.


                                                                                                                           45
higher among women employed for cash (26%) and among women in the lowest wealth quintile (49%).
Participants in the AGI project therefore seem to face a double vulnerability: they tend to come from low-
income families and are increasingly involved in income-generating activities. In fact, survey data suggests
that the types of IGAs that drove most of the increase in employment were associated with higher than
average risk of sexual violence. While 54 percent of girls reported being victims of sexual harassment, the
share went up to 65 percent among vendors and to 75 percent among small traders. This also reflects the
significant increase in the number of businesses being operated from outside the home, from 19 at
baseline to 44 at endline. Not surprisingly, the share of respondents reporting being sexually harassed is
much higher among those operating their business on a fixed location on the street (75 percent), as a
mobile business (60 percent) or from a storefront/market (55 percent) than among those operating their
business from home (40 percent).



6.      Implementation Lessons and Stakeholder Feedback
6.1.    Project Management

All of the interviewed project staff had positive things to say about the level and ease of communication
and collaboration with project managers. The trainer from Frontiers Great Lakes (FGL) pointed out that
communication was sometimes slow, but “Anytime we had to collaborate, it [was] smooth.” (SSI 1). The
trainer from Gahaya Links mentioned that she would contact the WDA focal point: “Their communication
is swift is fast so I have never encountered anything. They call me when there is something. I think the
best thing that happens between us is the center managers. When I want to take my report, no problem.”
Some logistical challenges, such as the limited availability of space in schools and delays by WDA in
clearing invoices, were reported by center managers.

Implementation challenges arose from overlapping the training for Cohorts 2 and 3. The trainer from
FGL pointed out that this sometimes made things difficult for Cohort 3 because the trainees were tired in
the afternoon and it was already hot outside when they began their training (SSI 1). Similarly, the school
manager from Gacuriro said that it was a challenge, at first, for the girls to study in the afternoon (SSI 4).

Trainers reported improvements in the implementation of Cohort 2 due to managed expectations of
the trainees and the supervisory role played by Cohort 1 trainees to their fellow counterparts. The
school manager from Gacuriro provided an example: “There is a difference because, before, you could
find that the project was just starting – it was the first time. The students were expecting to have a lot of
facilities because it was the first time. They were expecting the project to rent houses for them but
because Cohort 1 has completed their studies, they are like ambassadors – they talked to other cohorts,
showed them what is there, and explained it to them” (SSI 4).

Trainers struggled with large class sizes, which may have impacted girls’ learning outcomes. A trainer
stated that there was a “challenge of numbers,” meaning that there were not enough teachers for all of
the students. She dealt with this challenge by dividing the girls into sub-groups for some exercises, but
still felt that some girls were missing out. This was reiterated by two other trainers who said the class sizes
were too large. The school manager from Gacuriro VTC explained that the “AGI teachers were not
enough, so [this training center] used other teachers from the VTC staff”.


                                                                                                            46
6.2.    Trainee Selection and Participation

Overall, the project staff was satisfied with the selection process, insisting that the focus on vulnerable
girls and single mothers was appropriate. However, some trainers indicated that the low level of
education of some of the trainees made it difficult to facilitate the training.

There was significant variation across urban and rural settings in trainees’ ease of attending the project
on a regular basis. These differences were tied to the cost of transport and the opportunity cost of lost
income. In the urban VTCs (Gahaya and Gacuriro), trainees described the large burden of transport fees,
which were typically higher than RwF 500 per day and therefore were not fully covered by the stipend
(FGD 1 and FGD 2). Furthermore, urban participants were more likely to engage in income-generating
activities. Many of them moved to Kigali as migrants and needed to remit money. They worked either as
housekeepers or in petty trade, and their participation in the training left little time for these activities.

The average travel time to the VTCs reported among participants in the midline focus group discussions
was 1.5 hours. See the table below for the average travel time to the center reported by the midline FGD
participants.

Table 6.1 Average Travel Time to VTCs

                                                              Average Travel Time to Center
                    Center              Urban/Rural                (Hours, One-Way)
                   Gahaya                  Urban                            2.50
                   Gacuriro                Urban                            0.75
                  Shyorongi                Rural                            1.63
                   Bushoki                 Rural                            1.44
                    Rushaki                   Rural                             1.29
               (Note that this is based on responses during Focus Group Discussions with enrolled
               trainees only. It included travel on foot or using public transport)



The qualitative assessment was unable to draw strong conclusions on the number of dropouts or the
causes of attrition. The three dropouts interviewed at midline all dropped out within a few weeks of the
start of the project and cited the delay in receipt of transport stipends and family pressures as the cause.
All three indicated that they would prefer attending the training if their circumstances changed.
Conversely, project staff claimed that attrition was mainly related to marriage, pregnancy or
misidentification of girls as out-of-school during the recruitment process.

The majority of trainees reported that they were able to choose their field of study, however some
reported that the selection criteria prevented them from doing so. The allocation of girls to trades was
determined by the preferences of the girls, as well as their level of education and the location of VTCs.
Agri-business was not offered in urban areas and food processing was not offered in VTCs where there
was limited access to electricity. A former trainee in Nyarugunga said that she had wanted to study
culinary arts, but had been placed in the arts and crafts course because she did not have a background in
chemistry and biology (SSI 5). At Gahaya Links, two respondents said that they wanted to study food
processing, but were also places in the arts and crafts class. Another FGD participant chose to study arts
and crafts instead of food processing, because she could not afford to travel to the VTC offering food

                                                                                                           47
processing classes. Finally, another girl was placed in the arts and crafts class because she did not meet
the criteria of speaking other languages (FGD 1). One consequence of the differing eligibility for the trades
is that girls enrolled in the arts and crafts course presented with a higher overall level of vulnerability: for
example, they were less likely than other trainees to have started or completed secondary school (29.16%
vs. 52.83%).

6.3.    Stipends

Delays in the delivery of stipends was a key hurdle for both trainees and project staff. On average,
trainees faced a month delay and project staff faced delays ranging from one day to several weeks. For
trainees who relied on the stipend for daily transport to the VTCs, this was a significant burden. One of
the dropout trainees suggested that she knew several trainees who had to take loans to pay for transport:
“My suggestion is that there are times you take a loan or debt to pay transport fees and they delay to pay
the stipend, yet those who lend to you want their money” (SSI 5).

There were differences across urban and rural settings in terms of the importance of the stipend for
project participation. Respondents in rural areas reported that they would have been able to attend
without the stipend (FGD 2, FGD 3, and FGD 4). In rural areas, most participants traveled by foot and used
the stipend for basic needs and other products such as livestock, clothing and health insurance. On the
other hand, in urban areas, most trainees had higher transportation costs as well as higher opportunity
costs of participation in terms of lost income. This was less of an issue in rural areas where trainees
explained that they spent less time cultivating than they used to, but that the income from their daily
stipend made this trade-off worthwhile (FGD 3, FGD 4, and FGD 5).

The girls felt that their daily stipends played a role in addressing their day-to-day needs. Many –
especially those in rural areas –saved the money to meet various needs, such as “body lotion, clothes”
(FGD 6). Some used money from their savings to start or nurture their businesses: “I have made some
savings out of the money they used to give us for transport and I have managed to grow my business and
I am grateful to AGI." (FGD 2); “They have given us transportation stipends that we used to buy livestock,
everyone at home gets to have what they want easily” (FGD 7).




6.4.    Girl-Friendly Environment




                                                                                                             48
Most trainees indicated that VTCs were girl-friendly and
reported feeling comfortable in those settings. When
prompted to provide suggestions to make the VTCs more girl-
friendly, they responded, “I think that what they have done is
enough because, as my fellow student said, when you are sick
there is a place you can go and then come back after when
you feel good” (FGD 4). The participants at Bushoki VTC also
indicated that they had all used the girl-room at the VTC and
had amenities such as pads, soap, lotion, and a bathroom to
wash. However, one trainee from Gahaya pointed out that
“…they lied that when someone has periods they would
provide hygienic pads; they didn’t [provide them]” (FGD 1).
She mentioned that while there are toilets, but that were was
no girls’ room.41

Childcare facilities were not available or were not used by
the trainees at most of the interviewed VTCs. Trainees from
Gahaya indicated that they were not allowed to bring their
babies to the training center. However, the trainer from
Gahaya Links pointed out that the need for childcare services was more of an issue with Cohort 1, which
was older, and also more of an issue in urban than in rural areas (SSI 2). Similarly, the trainer from FGL
reiterated that childcare was not an issue because most of the girls left their children at home (SSI 1). In
Gacuriro VTC, the school manager felt that the childcare services were not used as there were no young
mothers with babies under the age of 1. While he felt that there should be some support for girls with
children, he conceded that it would create additional challenges for the center, as it would be difficult to
find someone to take care of the babies (SSI 4).

The trainers interviewed during the qualitative assessment were not directly involved in the psycho-
social training and none of the interviewed girls reported using the services. The project manager
reported, however, that at least 22 girls benefitted from these services (SSI 2, SSI 5). Alcoholism and the
trauma of sexual abuse were reported as common problems among the trainees (SSI 2). Despite their
limited involvement in the psycho-social counselling project, the interviewed teachers acknowledged its
effectiveness: “I can say that the initiative itself has worked because now girls can speak openly which
was not the case at the start…which is a result of an effort of the psycho-social team” (SSI 9). The Project
Manager criticized the late provision of the counseling service that, as a result, had a limited impact on
Cohort 2 trainees (SSI 2).



6.5.    Life Skills Training

The life skills training, particularly the lessons on sexual and reproductive health, appeared to be the
most popular project component among the trainees. One trainee from Rushaki said she had learned a
lot about pregnancy and birth control through the training and also how to operate and live within the
community (SSI 11). A trainee from Gahaya was also effusive in praise about the sex, gender and violence
modules: “the reason is that it will be useful to have education on sex and how you can behave with boys

41
  VTCs were obligated to provide pads and have a girls’ room while Gahaya Links (a private firm, not a VTC) was
not required to do so.

                                                                                                                  49
and girls. It is useful to know about sex.” She said that she learned how to apologize if she has done
something wrong to others, and that she has already applied what she learned about personal hygiene
(SSI 3). Most other trainees in the FGDs also indicated that they learned a lot about pregnancy, family
skills, and managing stress. The trainer from Frontiers Great Lakes said, “In reproductive health, they will
ask you – you may even stay there all day – questions you never thought about. Because there are so
many myths and then the culture, their lack of knowledge sometimes, the rumors and things they hear
here and they. They will ask you – up to the last question, they don’t fear [speaking with the teachers]”
(SSI 1). Focus group participants from the Rutare VTC also mentioned that “the VTC manager sent us a
pharmacist, who told us that there are pills that people who cannot wait can take to avoid getting
pregnant.”

Many respondents mentioned that the life skills training was complementary to their technical training.
For example, in the focus group at the Gacuriro VTC, one participant said that she thought the life skills
training was useful because “When studying [life skills], we studied about health. You cannot achieve
something great if you are not healthy. Another reason is that, in culinary, health is very important
because at work they will ask you for a certificate showing that you are healthy” (R1, FGD 2).

Several of the trainers mentioned that the curriculums were not appropriate for the learning level of
the participants and that more time was needed for follow-up. Trainers dealt with this challenge by
focusing more on the practical exercises rather than teaching theory. The trainer from FGL said that she
would have liked to have had more time with the beneficiaries for follow-up and to help them handle
personal issues, such as when they are “mistreated, beaten, or kicked out of their homes” (SSI 1).

6.6.    Entrepreneurship Training

All of the interviewed trainees (Shyorongi, Bushoki, Gacuriro VTCs) were complimentary about the
entrepreneurship training, stating that they learned how to save, track expenses, serve customers and
apply for loans. A participant in the Gacuriro FGD said: “I learned to seek opportunities to make money
and to gain customers. I learned that you have to convince customers to pay and also have good customer
care skills”. Another trainee also noted: “It was very useful. I learned about starting capital, about how to
get information about a business before starting it, about how to identify customers around the location
and how to know their characteristics/criteria, how to identify and know the products you need to offer,
how to start a business and gain a reputation through friendships with customers, how to have good
customer care skills, and how to expand the business” (FGD 2).

Girls and staff requested additional entrepreneurship training; suggestions included additional
emphasis on marketing skills and on working in cooperatives. The trainer from Gahaya suggested
including training on marketing and making market connections as part of the entrepreneurship training.
When asked to elaborate on the girls’ skill level when they graduate, she said, “They have no capacity.
Nobody should lie to you. They are still shy. They can’t approach anybody, so they need to create a
marketing component of AGI” (SSI 1). One trainee from Bushaki suggested that the training could be
improved by incorporating a focus on working in cooperatives. She said, “I would choose for them to
provide information again about working in cooperatives. Some people didn’t understand it very well so
it might be useful to provide those trainings. Nothing was very complicated but the level of students to
understand it is different” (SSI 8).




                                                                                                          50
According to the AGI Project Manager and the girls, Frontiers Great Lakes (FGL) was successful and the
instructors formed strong relationships with the girls. The Project Manager recommended that in the
future FGL should be involved from the beginning to the end of the project. This viewpoint mirrored the
girls’ request for increased mentorship by FGL, particularly during the post-training phase. Some of them
expressed a desire for refreshers on “doing business” and others expressed a need for training sessions
on customer care (FGD 1). A trainee in Shyorongi explained, “Yes, I would like our businesses to be
provided with more mentoring because these people have different duties, our trainers give us knowledge
of the trades we choose, others from Frontiers teach us how we can create our own jobs so they are all
important to us."

6.7.    Technical Training

Participants hoped that the training would increase their incomes, however some participants
expressed worries in this regard. For example one participant said, "We won't be poor because after
these trainings we will get jobs. We get money from our cooperatives and we can sustain ourselves” (FGD
4). Despite mentioning some of the positive aspects of the AGI project, the trainees felt that their relative
poverty was still a reality and they were concerned about their futures.

Overall, trainees were satisfied with their trades but there was some criticism about the viability and
lucrativeness of certain trades. Based on comments from trainee who participated in focus group
discussions, culinary and agribusiness seem to have better prospects (easier to find jobs or to generate
income by selling produce) than arts & crafts (especially for girls residing in rural areas) and food
processing (higher start-up costs, more difficult to find markets). A student of food processing suggested
that the training could be improved by focusing on processing foods that are more easily available. Asked
if the trade-specific training met their expectations, one respondent said it didn’t “because we study very
few things and because the foods we studied in theory – like strawberries and apples – are not available
in practice.” (FGD 3) At Bushoki VTC, expectations were met and only one of the food processing trainees
suggested that they expand the training to bread-making as well to increase their income-generating
opportunities. Another criticism of the food processing training was that trainees were financially
burdened by the requirement to purchase uniforms. The issue of uniform costs was raised by participants
in both the midline and the endline qualitative focus group discussions.

Similar to the life skills and entrepreneurship training, the technical skills curriculums were not
adequately adapted for low-literacy learners. In semi-structured interviews, trainers repeatedly brought
up the challenge of accommodating those with low education who had trouble keeping up with the
material, as well as trainees that had completed some secondary school. The interviewed trainers
adjusted their curricula by incorporating more practical exercises and focused on experiential activities to
accommodate the low level of education of trainees. They also adjusted the levels of some of the lessons
to meet the students’ level of understanding (SSI 1). These strategies were successful to some extent. By
endline, a trainer from a rural VTC referred to the girls’ increased learning aptitudes such that most are
operating at a similar level: “We don’t find it easy - at the beginning - to teach people with different levels,
but at the end they are all at the same level” (SSI 6).

The partnership with Gahaya Links to offer Arts and Crafts training seemed to be more successful in
urban areas that in rural settings. Gahaya Links’ instructors taught the technical training, provided the
girls with a start-up kit containing all the equipment for bead work and made a formal commitment to the
project provide jobs to some of the trainees. According to one of the project managers, half of the girls in


                                                                                                             51
Cohort 1 were employed by Gahaya Links. However, in rural areas trainers and girls reported that the arts
and crafts training was not market-driven. Some of the Arts and Crafts trainees complained about not
being able to apply the skills learned due to a lack of market for their products and recommended that a
diverse range of trades should be taught in the VTCs to address the “market” problem.

There was a consensus at all levels of project implementation—including the beneficiaries—on the need
for VTCs to include other non-traditional trades. Suggested trades included mechanics, engineering,
carpentry, construction, welding, tailoring, etc. (SSI 2, SSI 9, SSI 10, SSI 3, SSI 6, FGD 4 and FGD 6). These
trades were reported to be more responsive to local market demands and be more aligned with girls’
desire to learn skills that could lead to job or product sales opportunities.

6.8.    Support to Join SACCOs

Many trainees seemed to have a good perception of the SACCOs. Most groups were able to provide
information on the benefits of having a SACCO account. They referred to the accessibility of loans, the
ability to manage and save funds, as well as the safekeeping of funds. One respondent pointed out that
the SACCO was advantageous because they did not charge any monthly fee.

For some trainees however, the savings process was not clear and they reported receiving limited
information on the SACCO accounts from the project. For example in Gacuriro, a girl reported “we were
told that we have to give RwF 200 each to open accounts in SACCO and that there was no other bank in
which they could open accounts for us.” One of the Kinihira respondents said: “They just told us that it’s
where our saving will be kept, nothing else” (FGD 5). This was reiterated in Nyarugunga, Shyorongi and
Gacuriro. One focus group among six trainees from Gasabo could not name any of the SACCO advantages;
they only reported knowing that it was a financial institution. None of them were able to access their
savings and reported using Urwego Opportunity Bank, another local micro-credit institution.

Respondents in Kibali raised challenges with accessing their funds in the SACCOs. The trainees criticized
the services, saying: “Most of the time, they tell us that there is no money available, that it has been lent
to businessmen. The service is bad. They tell us that they are aware of it but there is nothing they can do
about it” (FGD 7).

Project staff faced several challenges in facilitating trainees’ SACCO membership. The main issue was
that many girls did not have Identification Cards, which are required to open an account (SSI 8, SSI 9, SSI
7). Another challenge was the inability of girls to provide collateral to back their loan applications.
Furthermore, the cooperatives could only access loans once they had obtained registration certificates,
and the cooperative registration process was commonly delayed (see the section on post-training).

6.9.    The Post-Training Phase

During the training most girls appeared confident about the post-training transition and felt prepared
to begin their cooperative activities or seek employment with their newly-acquired skills. Participants
from the Bushoki FGD expressed not having worries because they had contributed each week to their
SACCO, so “the saved money will help us start” (FGD 4). Similarly, one of the trainees from Gacuriro
indicated: “For us as a whole class, we will use the stipend. We have taken a certain amount and gathered
it together in a bank account. After completing studies we will set together and look for something we
can do collectively and then start it” (FGD 2). There was no obligation to be in a cooperative with other

                                                                                                           52
students: “If you want to work individually, you can do it. It was not an obligation. They explained to us
the benefits and we all decided to join.” It would also be possible to leave the cooperative, but “maybe
you have to sit with cooperative members and decide how to divide [the funds]” (FGD 4).

Those trainees who were not optimistic about their post-training opportunities raised the issue of
potential funding gaps for their cooperatives. For example, a trainee from Shyorongi discussed her
financial concerns: “I am trying my best to make more efforts so as to be a part of a cooperative. It is not
difficult to be a part of a cooperative, but I need the financial means. I think the money in the savings will
be enough and even if I don’t have enough, I will sell livestock to have enough” (FGD 3).

At midline, some teachers had already started supporting students with advice and planning for after
the training. Some examples include: “Our teacher is helping us; we go to her and ask advice” (FGD 2);
“The teachers provide advice and guidance on how we should operate. They have already begun providing
advice and they will continue to do so, including helping us address obstacles should there be any” (FGD
4); “We will come to see them [teachers] if we have any problems” (FGD 3); “We have planned that we
will look for a time to come here to school for advice, if possible once a week” (FGD 4).

Some VTCs did provide job search assistance, though this support was not clearly structured and less
heavily emphasized than the support for cooperative formation. In three locations, Bushoki, Gacuriro
and Kibali, trainees stated that the project staff did not help them access direct employment but
encouraged them to form cooperatives instead. On the other hand, trainees in Nyarugunga, Rutare and
Rushaki, reported receiving help from project staff to find jobs. For example girls in Rushaki mentioned:
“they have helped us getting jobs by giving us advice, finding us a place to work and a market for our
products. All the management helps us” (FGD 8). The Nyarugunga trainees who recounted receiving an
order for jewelries that was initially placed with their VTC manager. In Shyorongi, the girls stated that
despite the staff’s commitment to provide help in finding jobs, they were yet to access any job
opportunities. VTC managers did however provide letters of recommendations to the girls who needed
references for internship.

The main responsibility of the four district-level mentors was to support the beneficiaries to form
cooperatives. AGI mentors were recruited because of their experience with cooperatives and they
enjoyed full flexibility in steering the cooperative formation and registration processes. As experts in the
cooperative sector, they did not receive any specific guidelines from the project, but only informed of the
project expectations. The project however established deadlines by which they strived to abide. Two of
the four mentors also mentioned that they collaborated well with the school management (SSI 7, SSI 8),
who provided them with guidance and, at least in one case, a copy of the law governing cooperatives (SSI
8).

The precise activities undertaken varied somewhat from mentor to mentor, but all mentors did the
following:
      Trained participants on cooperative formation and registration, including cooperative law,
        rights, management board and the general assembly;
      Researched the requirements pertaining to cooperatives and ensured that they were met
        before starting the registration process;
      Led the registration efforts which involved registering at the level of the Sector, the District as
        well as Rwanda Cooperative Agency, the main regulatory body overseeing cooperatives;
      Provided advice on the trainees’ business ventures, business plans, as well as operations within
        cooperatives or businesses;

                                                                                                           53
       Mentored trainees on a regular basis whether in their VTCs or in their cooperatives.



Some mentors and/or VTCs provided additional support on an ad-hoc basis, including:
    Some VTCs lent equipment and space to cooperatives to enable them to become active;
    Two mentors, one in Gicumbi and the other in Rulindo, attempted to link their trainees to
      markets (SSI 10, SSI 9);
    In Rushaki, trainees recounted the support of mentors in providing guidance with regards to the
      profitability of potential ventures or the implementation of their projects;
    Some mentors and/or VTCs provided assistance by linking students to financial institutions such
      as SACCOs;
    One VTC manager secured a RwF 8 million grant from an NGO for the benefit of one of the
      cooperatives;
    Two mentors reported holding training sessions on financial literacy and inviting SACCO staff to
      provide information to girls.

Helping cooperatives to access loans did not seem to be a priority at the VTCs, as girls mentioned only
two VTCs that provided training on this topic. Some mentioned that this information was provided during
the cooperative registration process (FGD 3, FGD 4), whereas the rest of the girls said they did not receive
any support in accessing loans. In Rutare, the girls did not seem to view loans as crucial since they used
their own funds within their cooperatives (FGD 6).

The girls who had interacted with a mentor were appreciative of the support, specifically for the training
provided. The qualitative endline assessment found that some groups reported having mentors but some
did not. Those who had a mentor mentioned that the training taught them how to generate profits and
to manage their cooperatives. Their understanding of cooperatives’ rules and regulations, specifically with
regards to the management structure, board elections, decision-making procedures, and the importance
of recording adopted resolutions was based on the training received. Participants felt that the support of
mentors was really important as they would like “more ideas support and encouragement from mentors”
(FGD 2).

The schools appeared to have done a good job of contacting their trainees during the post-training
phase. In all but one VTC – Kinihira – trainees reported being contacted by their schools. All eight VTCs
provided space for the cooperatives to hold meetings, though the regularity of these meetings varied
quite a bit across VTCs. During the post-training phase, trainees from all other VTCs reported returning to
their respective centers to meet with their fellow cooperative members. In some VTCs (e.g., Bushoki,
Kinihira), these meetings were held weekly, while in others girls met twice a week (Rutare), only once a
month (Nyarunga) or on an ad-hoc basis (Shyorongi). In Bushoki VTC, the meetings were also the platform
used by mentors to assess the progress of their cooperatives as well as to dispense training on the
workings of cooperatives (FGD 3). In another VTC, meetings were the place where cooperative members
elected their committee and advisors and where they received a variety of trainings encompassing
cooperative set up and management, funds management, and loan allocation procedures. These
meetings also determined profits generated by the cooperative by measuring incomes against
expenditures incurred (FGD 7).




                                                                                                         54
Overall, the process of cooperative formation appears to have been successful, but the registration
procedure was more time-consuming than was expected. By December 2014, 28 cooperatives had been
established by Cohort 2 trainees.42 One specific hurdle arose because some girls did not have personal
Identification Cards, either because they had not reached the required age – 16 – or because they had not
applied for them. Another important issue involved delays at the sector and district levels to handle
registration applications, which was reported as a tedious and time-consuming process (SSI9, SSI10). One
mentor recounted being unable to get a hold of the person in charge of cooperatives while another
mentor in Gicumbi stated that one application took 5 months to be processed by the district. Finally, there
was no budget for typing, printing and binding cooperative documents as these expenses were not
allocated during the planning phase; mentors resorted to paying for these services out of their own wages
(SSI 9, SSI 10). As a result of these challenges, by the time of the endline focus groups in December 2014,
only cooperatives from the Shyorongi VTC had obtained legal status. In focus groups in other VTCs,
respondents were still in the process of obtaining legal status for their cooperatives.

Delays associated with cooperative registration were the most significant challenge voiced by project
staff and mentors, but many other problems were encountered, including:
    • Girls’ limited level of education and the limited time allocated to business development: despite
        a classroom session spanning over almost 6 months, the girls were still not able to run their
        cooperatives’ operations independently from the mentors’ support (SSI 2).
    • The limited number of mentors assigned to the project (i.e. one mentor per district): the fact that
        other VTC staff were unfamiliar with the process and could not provide adequate support in this
        field was a severe challenge (SSI 1).
    • The lack of work premises or sufficient start-up capital: cited by both trainees and one of the VTC
        managers.
    • The challenge of obtaining certificates from the Rwanda Bureau of Standards for the food
        processing cooperatives: this concern was expressed by a mentor and food processing trainers.
    • High start-up costs, especially for the food processing trade which required costly equipment to
        begin operations (SSI 3).
    • The lack of a market for potential cooperative products: trainees reported that that the
        cooperatives were mainly established in the four trades, except in Nyarugunga when one
        respondent mentioned that some girls formed cooperatives based on the needs of their
        community.

Mentors reported that marketing efforts have been led (with mixed success) by mentors and VTC staff
and cited a need for developing better marketing skills among the project participants (SSI 1, SSI 10).
For example in Gicumbi the mentor took the initiative of encouraging girls to take part in exhibitions and
find selling points, however only one out of six cooperatives managed to participate in the exhibitions. An
attempt to open a selling point near the border with Uganda also failed (the girls hoped to exhibit their
products on in the open to attract travelers but regulations at the border require that products are sold
within shops). In Rulindo, the mentor attempted to market the girls’ products by contacting several
businesses to sell the trainees’ products but was not successful. An attempt to get the girls to come to
Kigali once a week to market their products also failed, as the girls could not cover the related
transportation costs.

7.       Summary and Recommendations
The following recommendations are based on the findings of this evaluation. These lessons learned are
relevant for any future rounds of the AGI project as well as other vocational training projects geared
toward youth and young women in particular in Rwanda and other countries.

Project Management

        Ensure that logistical and operational expenses are adequately reflected in the project budget.
         Revise the budget for the post-training phase to account for a realistic forecast of the costs.
        Improve project planning to prevent delays in procurement and in the implementation of project
         activities.
        Ensure that the AGI project is sufficiently staffed with core personnel, including a Project
         Manager, an Accountant, an M&E Officer, a team of field monitors, etc.

Training Content and Delivery

        Adapt all training curriculum to be accessible to low-literacy learners:
              o Institutionalize participatory approaches and practical exercises within all training
                  curriculum—including the technical trainings, life skills and entrepreneurship skills.
              o Ensure that all teaching resources are translated into local languages.
              o Experiment with organizing girls in groups or pairs during the classroom training to
                  improve learning outcomes.
        Consider developing incubation centers during the classroom training phase. In this way, trainees
         could practice their newly acquired technical skills in a “learning-by-doing” fashion, and perhaps
         earn additional income during the training phase. There could be one incubation center per trade
         in each VTC (and per cohort) and trainees could work in shifts.
        Carry out periodic local labor market assessments in advance of future rounds of training to
         ensure the market demand for the trades to be offered.
              o Re-assess the demand for arts and crafts training in rural areas. Several participants who
                  were not able to study the trade of their choice were assigned to arts and crafts,
                  suggesting limited interest in this course. Also, based on the quantitative data, arts and
                  crafts stood out as the trade with the lowest share of trainees doing something related to
                  their course of study at endline (12.5 percent versus almost 40 percent in the case of
                  culinary/ food processing).
              o Consider other non-traditional trades such as mechanics, engineering, carpentry,
                  construction, welding, tailoring, etc. that may be more responsive to local market
                  demands.
        Remove costs to training that may not clear to participants from the beginning, including
         uniform costs.
        If there is continued market demand for food processing, ensure that this training focuses on
         products that are readily available in the training locations.
        Remove or alleviate trade-specific start-up barriers for cooperatives. In particular, the project
         needs to address the high cost of food processing equipment if training in this field is to continue.

                                                                                                           56
       One suggestion is that the AGI could facilitate the leasing of such equipment to the cooperatives.
       Similarly, the project should ensure that agri-business cooperatives have access to land.
      Increase the amount of time allocated to entrepreneurship training, particularly on the subjects
       of business plan development and marketing skills.
      Encourage participants to exercise their marketing skills during the training by entering
       exhibitions, practicing marketing to potential buyers, etc.
      Consider spanning the life skills training over a longer duration. Demand for additional training on
       sexual and reproductive health and conflict management was particularly noted.

Stipends and SACCOs

      Establish mechanisms to ensure the timely payments of stipends and monitor the process.
      Consider varying the stipend amount between urban and rural VTCs to reflect the greater
       transport and opportunity costs of participation among urban trainees.
      Equip teachers with standardized information to convey to trainees at the beginning of the
       project, covering the following:
           o Risks and benefits of saving in a SACCO;
           o Process of how the project will automatically save a portion of their stipend in a SACCO
                account;
           o Expectations for use of this savings upon completion of the project;
           o How to access this account;
           o What to do if they have problems or questions, etc.

Girl-Friendly Environment and Ancillary Services

      Ensure the timely delivery of additional services such as childcare, psycho-social counseling and
       family planning advice.
           o On the issue of childcare, the project could undertake an independent assessment to
                determine the demand among the trainees for this service and make recommendations.
           o Formal announcements and regular reminders on the availability and the process to
                access ancillary services should be communicated to the participants on a regular basis.
      Ensure that the project is designed to prevent and respond to cases of violence.
           o Schedule all classes during daylight hours when it is safer for girls to travel.
           o Encourage girls to travel to and from the training in pairs.
           o Require that students sign up for the Mutuelle de Sante and task teachers to follow-up
                and provide assistance as needed.
           o Explore ways to mitigate the risk of harassment faced by girls who develop IGAs involving
                selling products in public spaces. This could involve facilitating access to market stalls and
                encouraging girls to co-locate their activities near one another, to limit instances of girls
                selling items by the side of the road.
      Improve the monitoring of girl-friendly project elements, including the safe spaces and ancillary
       services. Consider improving usage of safe spaces and ancillary services even during the post-
       training phase.

                                                                                                           57
Post-Training Phase

      Clarify the roles and responsibilities of each actor (WDA school managers, WDA trainers, and
       mentors) in the post-training phase so that activities are consistently delivered and trainee
       expectations are managed. Guidelines on the access and availability of human and other
       resources should be clearly communicated to the trainees early on.
      Experiment with incorporating a stronger internship component in urban VTCs.
      Increase outreach with the private sector and explore private sector partnerships for the
       placement of urban trainees in employment or internships. Standardize the approach and level of
       support to be offered for private sector employment across the VTCs.
      Create a more formal system to link participants to financial institutions.
           o Equip VTC managers, trainers and mentors with referral information to financial services.
           o Ensure that trainees can access their SACCO savings as a capital base for their cooperative
                or business activities.

Cooperative Formation

      The approach to cooperative formation should be more systematic and introduced earlier on in
       the project.
           o Formally integrate education on the risks and benefits of cooperative membership into
               the training content and practicums.
           o Encourage girls to develop team work skills and group problem solving by working in
               groups or pairs during the classroom training.
      Address the issue of cooperative registration delays.
           o Secure IDs for girls as soon as they are enrolled on the project so they can open SACCO
               accounts.
           o Establish good working relationships with the district and sector authorities. Alert them
               to the incoming registration packets and clarify the appropriate processes and procedures
               in advance of the registration process.
           o Increase girls’ knowledge of these procedures and their ownership of the registration
               process.
      Develop a more systematic approach to delivering mentorship to the cooperatives.
           o Clarify the roles and responsibilities of VTC managers and trainers in cooperative
               mentorship and support.
           o Increase the number of mentors such that all cooperatives can be reached by a mentor
               at a regular frequency.
           o Develop clear guidelines and a schedule of activities for the mentors.
           o Equip the mentors to provide refresher business training to the cooperatives as needed.
           o Monitor the implementation of the mentoring activities.

4. Methodology
4.1. Data Cleaning
After the collection of survey data, Laterite Limited prepared the data for analysis by correcting duplicate
identification numbers, renaming endline variable names in order to match baseline variable names,
dropping confidential personal identification variables (e.g. name, mobile phone number) or unnecessary
variables (e.g. GPS coordinates, device number), codifying variables stored as names of income-generating
activities (IGAs), and merging baseline and endline datasets. Based on feedback from the World Bank
research team, Laterite Limited also provided additional translations of answers entered in Kinyarwanda
and created variables to indicate interview duration and whether or not the interview was conducted over
the phone.

A number of additional changes to the data were made during the quantitative analysis:

       Values of specific variables (e.g. business type, first or second income-generating activity)
        recorded as “other” that fit existing answer options were re-codified;
       To address inconsistencies between different sections of the survey, values entered for the IGA
        screening sections (whether respondents was engaged in any household agricultural activities,
        wage employment, non-farm business or internship) were corrected based on information
        provided in subsequent, more detailed, questions on the two main income-generating activities
        and/or business. No changes were made in the absence of supporting information. Where both
        wage employment and non-farm businesses were indicated for the same IGA, answers to
        screening questions were reconciled based on whether the respondent reported working for
        herself (business) or for a non-relative (paid job).
       Because 86 out of 160 values for age at baseline were missing in the merged dataset provided by
        Laterite Limited, data on age was extracted from the baseline dataset;
       Outliers – 3 income values (extra 0 at the end, or amount entered as in-kind daily payment instead
        of monthly income) and 4 in-kind amount values (divided by 10 to fit in ranges of reported in-kind
        amounts for same occupation) were considered typos; for the remaining outliers, values above
        the 99th quintile were dropped from the estimations.

4.2. Statistical Tests
Data analysis was completed in Stata, Release 13. It was based on a tracer methodology, used principally
for measuring change before and after the AGI project. The definitive characteristic of this study design is
that two measurements were made on the same experimental unit: the pretest measurement made prior
to the administration of the treatment, i.e. participation in the project, and the post-test measurement
made after the treatment was completed.

To determine whether changes from baseline to endline were statistically significant, T-tests of the
differences were implemented using a dummy indicating the time of the survey. The T-test answers the
question, "Is there a difference in the mean weight change between baseline and endline?" Frequencies
and means were calculated for the sample as a whole and for sub-groups as detailed in the Results Section.

Instructions


The purpose of these focus group discussions is to learn about trainees’ opinions of the process, quality and
relevance of the training they received during the first six months of their experience with the AGI project
in Rwanda. Following a brief section on background information, the discussion is structured into 8


                                                                                                                  65
modules: (1) Attendance, (2) Impacts, (3) Trade-Specific Training, (4) Life Skills Training, (5) Teachers,
(6) Transition to Part II, (7) Program Management, and (8) Other Comments. The discussions will last
between 1 hour 30 minutes and 2 hours.


Discussions will be managed by two female enumerators: one discussion leader/translator and one note
taker. The discussion leader will use a “nominal group technique” to facilitate conversation. At the
beginning of each module, the discussion leader will introduce the topic and pose the main question to the
group. Each participant will be asked to reflect on her response for 2-3 minutes (and to take notes if she
wants to) before sharing her thoughts with the group. After each participant has had an opportunity to share
her thoughts with the group, the discussion leader will pose the follow-up questions and encourage all
participants to share as much information as possible. As indicated in the “instructions” column of the
questions guideline, the discussion leader will use the flip chart to facilitate conversation. At the end of
each module, the note taker will verbally report a summary of what was heard. This confirms for the group
members that they communicated what they intended to, and allows them to make any suggestions for
adjustments in the event that what they said was not accurately represented.43


Informed Consent


Read Aloud: Hello, my name is __________, and I am from Laterite Limited. Laterite is a Rwandan
research firm that has been hired to conduct research on young women participating in the Adolescent Girls
Initiative, or AGI project. We interviewed all of you for our baseline survey before the program began, and
now we are conducting a midline evaluation. The purpose of this midline evaluation is to learn your opinion
of the quality and relevance of the training that has been provided to you. If you agree to participate in this
midline evaluation, we will ask you questions about your experience in and opinion of the program so far.
We will hold this discussion together as a group. The information you share is entirely voluntary and will
not be circulated beyond the management team. If you do not want to provide information, you can still
continue participating in the AGI training – there is no obligation to participate in this focus group
discussion. You will neither gain nor lose anything from participating in this evaluation. If you agree, we
will contact you again in the next 6 months for follow-up questions, so it will be important for me to find
out the best ways to contact you in the future.


The interview will take about two hours. You can choose to stop at any time. If you do not want to answer
any question, you can refrain from answering or leave the group at any time. Please let me know if you
have any questions before we proceed, and feel free to interrupt at any time if you have questions or
concerns about sharing information with us.

Questions for Enrolled Trainees


Instructions: Provide each participant with a pen and small notebook to jot down her thoughts throughout
the interview. Begin each module by posing the “main question.” Ask participants to think about the
question for 2-3 minutes and to jot down her thoughts if she would like. Once the time has passed, ask all
participants to share their thoughts with the group, one-by-one. Afterwards, pose the follow-up questions
and allow any respondent who would like to answer them the chance to share with the group. Use follow-
up questions to engage participants in conversation together and encourage them to share as much as
possible. If the follow-up question is in bold, make sure to ask ALL respondents so that the notes can include
the total count of respondents who gave particular answers.

6.2. Endline Focus Group Discussion Guidelines

Program Participants Focus Group Discussion Guidelines

The general goals of the focus group discussions are to understand how adolescent girls are disadvantaged
(or not), and the effects of the program. The discussions should last approximately two hours. They will
be conducted with a random selection of program participants from each of the eight VTCs.

These discussions are to be held in a private setting, so that participants are able to feel comfortable
expressing their views and not worried that non-participants will overhear the conversation. Successful
focus groups will resemble discussions where participants react to each other’s statements, adding their
own experiences to provide additional detail or contrasting evidence. The moderator’s role is to
encourage the participants to keep talking and to steer the conversation toward topics of interest. The
discussion should NOT be a series of questions from the moderator followed by short responses from
the girls. The information gathered from these focus group discussions – a specific form of qualitative
inquiry – is valuable because we can learn from the discussion among the girls about key topics in which
they compare and contrast their experiences. Moderators should repeatedly use open-ended probes,
such as:

       Will you please tell me more about that?
       Can you give an example that will illustrate what you mean?
       Has anyone else had a similar experience that they are willing to share?
       Has anyone else had a different experience? How was it different?
       How was that different from what you expected?

The specific objectives of these focus group discussions are:
     To capture a profile of vulnerability. In what ways are these girls disadvantaged?
     Learn more about the content of the program follow-up period
             o What activities did the school managers and school trainers do during this period?
             o How did the girls interact with the school personnel during this period?
             o How were cooperatives formed? How were cooperatives supported?
             o How was VSLA participation facilitated?
     Investigate effects of the program
             o If/how did the program help girls transition to (better) employment? Capture stories!
             o How did the program affect other, non-economic, outcomes?


                                                                                                       73
            o   How are the program-initiated cooperatives functioning?
            o   How was participation in VSLAs facilitated and are the girls benefiting from that activity?
            o   How could the program be improved?




GIVE A PROPER INTRODUCTION

MAKE EACH PARTICIPANT SIGN A CONSENT FORM

1. a. We would like to start by doing an activity to learn about what challenges girls in your community
   face. You are the experts on this topic. There are no wrong answers. We would like you to list all
   of the challenges you can think of. We will record what you say on this flipchart so that we can
   remember what you have reported.

    Please make a list of the challenges that girls in your community face. Make the list as long as you
    can. Remember, there are no wrong answers. These can be challenges that girls have with in the
    types of activities / business/ job that she does to earn money; in her livelihood, wellbeing, quality
    of life; in how she feels about herself; in her relationships with others. Anything! We want to hear
    about ALL of the challenges that girls face.

**Moderator: Encourage girls to list challenges and record them directly on the flipchart. Give everyone a
chance to report at least one challenge. Give them a chance to add more challenges if any, and ask them
not to repeat challenges already mentioned.
Then, refer to the list generated by the group and ask these follow-up questions:

1. b. Which of these challenges do you think are the hardest and more important challenges that girls
face?

** Moderator: ask the girls to vote whether it is an important/very hard one or not, they can vote several
times

Probes: Why are these the biggest challenges? What about the challenges earning money--What makes
it hard for girls to earn money? Do girls get bad jobs? Like what?

2. a. Now I want you to think about the AGI program. Which of the challenges that you talked about
   before has the program helped you overcome? How did the program help you overcome these
   challenges?

Probes: How did the AGI help you overcome challenges with your job or earning money? What were you
doing before the program to earn money and what are you doing now?

2. b. Is there any challenge that the program did not overcome but you wish it had? How could have the
program been more helpful?


                                                                                                        74
   **Moderator: Ask the following question to the whole group:

3. a. What has been the most important change that has happened in your life because of your
participation in the AGI program?

   Ask each participant in turn to briefly state in one sentence the most important change that has
   happened in their life because of their participation in the AGI program.

   Explain that changes might be:

          In the types of activities / business/ job that she does to earn money
          In her livelihood, wellbeing, quality of life
          In how she feels about herself
          In her relationship with others

   Ask each participate in turn to briefly state in one sentence the nature of the change. On the
   flipchart, the note-taker writes a few words against each name to describe the change. (For
   example: my family respects me now; I know how to use my time wisely).

   3. b. Now we would like to collect some stories from you in your own words to describe what has
   changed in your life because of the AGI program. We would like you to select two stories from this
   group that we can record. We can then share them with other Rwandan women and the
   Government of Rwanda.

   Ask each participant to come up to the front and select the two stories (by putting check mark
   against) which she thinks:

                  Shows the biggest change individually as a result of the program
                  Together illustrate the different types of change that have happened for the young
                   women

   Count the number of times each story was selected; the two stories with the highest “votes” are
   the ones that will be recorded.

   3. c. Assemble participants into two equal-sized groups with one of the two selected story-tellers
   in each. Find a place for each group to sit so they can talk without interruption.

   Ask each group to spend 15 minutes helping the woman to formulate / narrate her story by asking
   questions such as:

              What was your situation before the AGI program? What problems did you face?
              Since you participated in the AGI program, in what ways has your life changed? Can you
               describe the events?
              Why do you think this change is very important?

                                                                                                      75
    REMEMBER: THE STORY IS BASED ON WHAT WAS VOTED FOR!!

    While the participants are discussing in groups, the facilitator and note-taker circulate around,
    supporting if needed, but letting the participants run the discussions. At the end of the 15
    minutes, the story should be ready for recording.

    The facilitator and note-taker select a group each, and ask the story-teller to tell her story in her
    own words, prompting only if and when necessary.

               Ask the participant to introduce herself by her first name only (or an invented name if
                she prefers) and to explain who she is (e.g. market trader, worker in a store), her age
                and where she lives.
               Prompt her if needed to help her with her story; encourage her to be relaxed and take
                her time to explain her story – she knows it best.
               Ensure other group members are silent, and do not interrupt the storyteller.
               Record her story on the voice recorder.
               Check that the recorder is switched on and recording the information.

    Thank all participants for their contribution to the story documentation exercise. Now we are
    going to re-convene as a group and have a few more discussions.




4. Now we want to discuss specifically what you have been doing since the AGI classroom training ended
in July. We would like to learn more about what you have been doing and in what ways you have been
supported by the AGI project since the classroom training ended?

Probes: Did you come back to the VTC? If yes, what for? Did the school or the teachers contact you? What
for? Did anyone provide coaching or mentoring? Who—trainers? Mentors? Both? How? Do they help you
find jobs? How? Do they visit you at your jobs? How often? Do they help you access loans for your
businesses? Are you satisfied that you get enough support from mentors?

What about your teachers from Frontiers? Have they visited you at all since the classroom training ended?
Would you like them to be providing your businesses with more mentoring? Why or why not? What about
psycho-social counseling—has anyone come back to the VTC for counseling? What was this like and did it
help you? Please tell me more.

Is there anyone who has not interacted with the school or trainers at all since the classroom training
ended? Why not? Do you meet with friends that you made during the classroom training? What do you
do with these friends?
5. Next we would like to talk about cooperatives. Did the program help students to join or start a
cooperative?



                                                                                                        76
**Moderator: For each of these topics of discussion, when someone volunteers an experience, ask the
group how their experiences were similar or different.

5.a. Probes about group formation: How did the program help? How were the groups formed? Were the
teachers or mentors involved or did the students choose their own groups? How many girls are in a
cooperative?

5.b. Probes about group management / functioning: How was cooperative management decided? Did
teachers or mentors give guidance on cooperative management? Did they give general guidance to all
students? Did they give specific guidance to each cooperative? Specifically, what guidance did the
teachers or mentors provide on how to make important decisions as a group? How does your cooperative
make decisions about how to spend or borrow money? Who within the cooperative makes decisions—
everyone or only some people? Do cooperatives share their profits equally? Do some girls benefit more
from the cooperatives than others? What are some of the problems within the cooperatives? Do any girls
have problems participating in their cooperative because their husbands or families are not supportive?
Please explain.

5.c. Probes about cooperative success: For students who are in cooperatives, is the cooperative active
now? How often does it meet? Where does it meet? What kinds of businesses are cooperatives running?
Is the cooperative profitable? How do you know? Is the cooperative registered? How do you know? Are
some cooperatives not successful in their businesses? Why not? What are some of the business problems
faced by cooperatives?

5.d. Probes about program support to the cooperatives after the classroom training: Has the program
helped your cooperative since the classroom training ended? How? Do trainers or mentors from the
program visit your cooperative? How often? What do they do?

5.e. Probes about joining in the future: For girls who are in cooperatives, would you recommend to a
friend that she join a cooperative? Why or why not? For students who are not working in a cooperative,
would you ever consider joining a cooperative? Why or why not? What is best—working in a cooperative
or working in your own business? Please explain.




                                                                                                    77
6. a. Now we want to talk specifically about your membership in the SACCO (Savings and Credit Co-
Operative). What did the teachers explain about your membership in the SACCO?

Probes: Did teachers explain what it means to be a member of a SACCO? Was any of this new information?
What are some good things about being a member of the SACO? What are the benefits/purposes of
SACCO and did the teachers explain about your membership in the SACCO? Were you taught about how
to use your account? When did girls learn about the SACCO—during the classroom training or afterwards?

**Moderator: For each description of how the teachers explained the SACCO, ask the group how their
experiences were similar or different.

6. b. Have girls been participating in SACCOs since the classroom training ended?

Probes: If yes, why? As cooperatives or as individuals? If not, why not? How often do girls borrow money
from the SACCO? What do girls borrow money from the SACCO for? How often do girls save money in the
SACCO? What do girls save money in the SACCO for? How often do girls meet with their SACCO?

**Moderator: For each description of how the program helped students join SACCOs, ask the group how
their experiences were similar or different.

6. c. For the girls who joined a SACCO, how did that help you? Which challenge did you overcome? Any
benefits? Did the SACCO had none or negative effect?

*** Moderator: Make the girls vote: helped, didn't change anything, made it worst, don't know and ask a
girl why for each of the different options selected




                                                                                                     78
7. Next we would like to hear your feedback about the program so that we can make it more useful
for students in the future.


7. a. If you could change something about this part of the program—THE PART AFTER THE CLASSROOM
TRAINING—what would you change?

Probes: What were the main challenges to participating in the follow-up part of the program? How could
the program have been more helpful to girls after the training ended?

7. b. We understand that some girls were unable to make money during the classroom part of the
training because they came to the training and could not work. That is one example of a bad
consequence of the program. Even when programs are helpful, they can also have bad consequences.
What are some of the bad consequences that you experienced because of participating in this program
(during the classroom training or the follow-up period)?

Probes: Did the program cause some students to lose income? Did the program cost money for some
students because of transportation or needing to buy uniforms or something else? Are some students
doing income generating activities now that are not as good as the ones they were doing before? Did
participation in the program have negative effects on some students’ relationships with others? Did
participation in the program cause some students to feel bad about themselves?

7. d. Given everything that we have talked about, what else do we need to know to help make this
program more useful for girls in the future?
Probe: Do you have any final thoughts that you would like to share before we end our session?

**Moderator: Be sure to thank each of the girls for their time and for their participation. Encourage them
to work hard and let them know that the program is very proud of them.

Read Aloud: Hello, my name is __________, and I am from Laterite Limited. Laterite is a Rwandan research firm that has
been hired to conduct research on young women participating in the Adolescent Girls Initiative, or AGI project. Right now
we are conducting an end-line survey. The purpose of this end-line survey is to find out the situation of the young women
who have been chosen to participate in the program. If you agree to participate in this end-line survey, we will ask you
questions about yourself, your background, your family, and your community. The information you give me is entirely
voluntary. If you do not want to provide information, you can still continue participating in the AGI training. You will neither
gain nor lose anything from participating in this end-line survey.

The interview will take about 40 minutes. You can choose to stop at any time. If you do not want to answer any question,
you can tell me and we will move on to the next question. All of your answers will be kept private. Your name will never be
connected to any of the answers you provide.


             Do you agree to provide information?
             1=Yes
