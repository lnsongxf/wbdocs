Overview

World Bank Group Support to Electricity
Access, FY2000–FY2014
Highlights
The World Bank Group has committed to achieving universal access to electricity by 2030 under the Sustainable
Energy for All (SE4All) initiative. This is a daunting challenge: more than 1 billion people do not have access, and
another 1 billion have chronically inadequate or unreliable service. Most of those without access are poor, and the
largest share is in Sub-Saharan Africa. Achieving universal access within 15 years for the low-access countries
(those with under 50 percent coverage) requires a quantum leap from their present pace of 1.6 million connections
per year to 14.6 million per year until 2030. The investment needed would be about $37 billion per year, including
erasing generation deficits and meeting demand from economic growth. By comparison, in recent years, low-access
countries received an average of $3.6 billion per year for their electricity sectors from public and private sources,
including $1.5 billion per year from the World Bank Group.
Development outcomes of the Bank Group’s assistance were generally favorable compared with other infrastructure
sectors. However, performance in improving financial viability of country electricity sectors was below expectations.
There were significant gaps in the Bank Group’s coverage of low-access countries, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Median implementation time of World Bank investment projects was nine years, with time overruns attributable to
inadequate project design and borrower capacity. Support for off-grid electrification was low and sporadic, with a
few notable exceptions. The Bank Group’s growing non-conventional renewable energy portfolio is dealing with
technology and regulatory challenges. Tracking welfare and gender impacts in World Bank projects has improved,
and International Finance Corporation (IFC) has made a beginning in addressing these issues. The Bank made
some significant pilot contributions to addressing the affordability of electricity connections. Collaboration grew
among World Bank, IFC, and MIGA through joint projects, which helps break ground for the private sector in some
high-risk and fragile countries, and supports a few large and complex projects.
There are several good practice national access scale-up experiences worldwide, some with significant Bank Group
involvement—Vietnam, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Indonesia, and Bangladesh—and more recently,
Rwanda and Kenya’s national electrification programs combining grid and off-grid means. These experiences
illustrate common underlying principles adapted by each country to its own institutional framework, broadly stated:
adherence to a nationwide least-cost national access rollout plan using coordinated grid and off-grid delivery as
appropriate to achieve universal access nationwide; maintaining the financial sustainability of the sector and the
commercial viability of its agent(s) to draw investment financing requirements on a sustained basis; addressing
equity by targeting the poor nationwide to ensure affordability; and not the least, guided by a unifying government
vision and committed leadership that stays the course over the duration of the implementation program.
The scale of the SE4All challenge requires the Bank Group to reposition itself as a global solutions provider in the
sector, going well beyond the confines of its own direct support for access. This evaluation points to the urgency for
the Bank Group‘s energy practice to adopt a new and transformative strategy to help country clients orchestrate a
national, sustained sector-level engagement for universal access. A major challenge in this effort is to deploy the
Bank Group units’ individual and collective strengths beyond Bank Group–led projects and transactions to stimulate
private sector investments for closing the financing gap—especially in generation—for low-access countries.

Management Response
World Bank Group management thanks the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)
for undertaking an evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Electricity Access. The
Report highlights the challenges for the World Bank Group in the electricity sector in
pursuit of the goal of achieving universal access to electricity by 2030 under the
Sustainable Energy for All initiative (SE4ALL). World Bank Group management
acknowledges and is broadly in agreement with IEG’s recommendations. The report
accurately identifies success in different countries and areas for improvement. The
report also provides a positive assessment of the Bank Group’s past efforts to
contribute to the expansion of energy access, including acknowledging the Bank
Group’s support for an addition of one-sixth of the total generation capacity during
the review period and 7 percent of new electricity connections.

General Comments

Management appreciates the report’s definition of electricity access which includes
elements that emphasize adequacy, affordability, quality, and reliability. This is
largely in line with the Multi-Tier Framework for measuring energy access for
SE4ALL, which will be introduced globally. The Multi-Tier Framework recognizes
that electricity access is more than just the connection. It offers a framework for
grading the quality and other attributes of available power. Accordingly, the Bank is
working on improving measurement under the SE4ALL Global Tracking
Framework.

Acknowledging the definition of electricity access introduced in the report, it
nevertheless tracks progress on energy access in a traditional “binary” way; for
instance counting the number of connections, regardless of the type and quality of
service achieved. This is understandable, given the available data, but these
limitations may have also skewed the conclusions. Management sees this as a
missed opportunity. To measure impact, it is critical to evaluate energy access with
all its attributes, including availability, quality, reliability, safety and affordability.
Recognizing that virtually all Bank Group power sector engagements aim to
improve some element of service to the customer, such a multi-dimensional
definition of “access” could substantially change the assessment on the real access
achieved during the period covered in this report.

As the report notes, strong government ownership and commitment has been one
of the most important factors in successful electrification programs. Increased Bank
Group engagement is not enough to guarantee results. While the World Bank Group
strives to expand support to low-access countries (51 countries, of which 22 are
fragile and conflict-affected states or FCS), it has finite resources and must align


                                                                                          xxi
                                                                   MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


those resources to support client priorities. Many low-access countries require
support in almost all of the Bank Group’s key sectors. Therefore, even though
energy access may be a priority, it must also compete with other priorities for
limited Bank Group program resources.

The World Bank Group also plays an important role in countries not considered
as low-access countries. The Bank Group helps these clients to strengthen reliable
and affordable electricity provision—part of the multi-dimensional definition of
access—to support economic growth. In many of these countries, institutional and
financial indicators for utilities are not improving, indicating a continued need for
the Bank Group to focus support in these areas.

The report provides a good assessment of the nature of World Bank Group
collaboration in the electricity sector, mainly through joint projects featuring at
least two of the three institutions. The Bank brings value-added through its
upstream support and advice to country clients on policy and institutional
frameworks, and partial risk and partial credit guarantees to backstop government
payment obligations to private investors. The International Finance Corporation
(IFC) offers various types of term financing, plus mobilization of other investors,
which is rarely available in countries with underdeveloped financial markets and
high investor risk. The report also highlights the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency’s (MIGA) value added in terms of: (i) providing long-term political risk
insurance for high-risk countries not available from international commercial
insurers; (ii) enhancing credit worthiness of projects; and (iii) mobilizing additional
capital. While the report states that collaboration among the Bank, IFC, and MIGA
through joint projects has grown in an ad hoc manner, management would like to
note that there are some good examples of strategic Bank Group collaboration. For
example, in four years of operations, the IFC-MIGA partnership has mobilized a
total of US$2.1 billion with a focus on investments in International Development
Association (IDA) countries and FCS. The Bank Group has also been engaged in
more intensive collaboration, including through Joint Implementation Plans (JIPs).
The report provides useful evidence regarding the positive correlation between the
value of Bank Group collaboration and the difficulties of the operating environment,
i.e., the greater the challenges, the higher the value of Bank Group collaboration.

The report provides good examples of Bank Group-supported projects that
stimulated private sector investments in the electricity sector and highlights the
“ground breaking” nature of these projects. It correctly points out the challenge in
stimulating private sector investments for electricity over and above Bank Group led
operations, especially in low-income, low-access countries. The sector-wide
operations offer good illustrations of their critical “de-risking” role in testing
approaches and resolving uncertainty about legal and regulatory frameworks
essential for leveraging private sector investments. The report also notes, in the


xxii
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


success stories of Rwanda and Kenya where access levels have dramatically
increased, the commitment of the private sector on a level that may not have been
possible in the absence of the sector-wide programs. Management agrees with this
assessment and notes that such operations are often characterized by demonstration
and replication effects fundamental to the private sector development process.


Comments on Specific IEG Recommendations

Engaging Countries with Low Electricity Access
With respect to the recommendation on engaging in countries with low electricity
access, management concurs with the need for expanded support to low-access
countries as well as broader and deeper Group-wide engagements identified in
Country Partnership Frameworks (CPFs). Management acknowledges that the Bank
Group’s role is very important to help client countries achieve universal access to
electricity that is adequate, affordable, and of the required quality and reliability. At
the same time, management wishes to emphasize the crucial role of country
governments, power utilities, and other development partners in achieving
significant gains on electricity access. As noted above, decisions on where to engage
and allocate resources are made based on multiple factors, taking into account
competing priorities for limited development resources, opportunities for impact,
and selectivity. Energy access is one of the priority areas acknowledged by the World
Bank Group. To operationalize the global practice’s (GP) commitment to energy access,
an Energy Access Global Solutions Group and an Energy Access Global Lead are now in
place in the Energy and Extractive Global Practice (E&E GP). This group will, in
particular, provide expertise, advice, and additional technical inputs to low-access
countries that have identified energy access as a priority.

IFC management has already placed a priority on electricity access as a central part of IFC’s
overall business strategy. This strategy involves efforts in FCS countries as well as many
countries that are part of the “low access country” list introduced in the evaluation. If
population is factored into the calculation, IFC has portfolio or new business engagements
that will potentially serve more than 50 percent of the people in the low access country list
within Sub-Saharan Africa. Lastly, while IFC management thanks IEG for the low access
country list and will continue to ensure that focus is placed on countries that have low
access as part of its efforts, it is important to note that a focusing of our priorities on such a
list could lead to sub-optimal outcomes, such as a lack of prioritization on key countries like
Nepal and Bangladesh that are classified as high and medium access, respectively, based on
the methodology used to prepare the list.

Sector-wide Framework and Engagement

Management also agrees with the recommendation on the greater use of a sector-
wide organizing framework and process for rapidly increasing access, where


                                                                                              xxiii
                                                                     MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


appropriate, to achieve universal access by 2030 in low-access countries. The
principle of sector-wide planning is anchored in the 2013 World Bank Group Energy
Sector Directions Paper. The paper notes, “The World Bank Group will support a long-
term approach with sector-wide planning—nationally and, where appropriate,
regionally—to achieve optimal and cost-effective results. This involves looking beyond
individual projects to consider the full range of energy supply options in any particular
country. While the World Bank Group will support consideration of all options at the
planning stage, given limited availability of its resources, the eventual World Bank
Group financing will be applied selectively to areas where it has comparative
advantage.” The same principle will be applied specifically to energy access. However,
the scope and timing of the sector-wide frameworks and engagement plans should
be set by governments, taking into account readiness factors and the local context.
Management will remain flexible in applying different approaches (e.g., a sector-
wide framework and engagement, a specific targeted project, a Bank Group joint
project, etc.) to suit the given context.

Designing an Engagement Strategy
On the recommendation to design an engagement strategy, again it would be
important to consider country conditions appropriate for the formulation of a sector-
wide approach and a government-led investment financing platform. Management
appreciates the report’s acknowledgement that engagement approaches must reflect
the country’s conditions. Whenever applicable, management is committed to
drawing upon respective institutional strengths and expertise and tailoring
mobilization mechanisms. Depending on the country priorities, starting conditions,
and capacities, the focus may be on the overall sector or on specific sub-sectors.

Results and Impacts of Electricity Access

Management is committed to advance the evidence on results and impacts of
electricity access, including its contributions to the Bank Group goals of ending
extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. However, some of the specific
recommendations are too broad and go beyond the energy sector, and some are
difficult to translate into measurable actions and indicators. As part of an effort to
advance the evidence on results and impact, more impact evaluations are being
done as part of ongoing energy access projects. The Bank will roll-out the SE4ALL
Multi-Tier Framework to measure progress towards universal access, and track
project contributions, starting with a pilot group of energy operations to be
implemented in FY16, and expanded afterwards. IFC will continue to implement
across sectors its eight-point action plan that resulted from IEG’s evaluation on IFC’s
Poverty Focus, over a three-year timeframe. Management is also pleased that IFC is
among the 25 international finance institutions that have agreed upon a list of 27
harmonized reporting indicators across 13 different sectors and industries.
However, as energy access is often one of many influences over broader



xxiv
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


development impacts, a cautious approach is needed about including explicit links
in the project’s results framework. The causality and attribution of an access
program to broader welfare gains are difficult to rigorously confirm. In addition,
there is frequently a time lag between the project period and the emergence of
welfare impacts that further clouds any direct links. The specific recommendation to
assess “value-added” of Bank Group joint projects to private sector clients and the
country would not be feasible in the absence of counterfactuals and the absence of a
Bank Group-wide methodology for such an assessment.


Other Specific Comments

Interpretation of the sample. While the report presents useful findings, the
limitations of the sample should be recognized in interpreting the findings. For
instance, the report uses the whole of the Bank’s electricity lending as a proxy for
support to electricity access, and compares that input with the results achieved in
terms of increased connections. In fact, the Bank estimates that the projects directly
supporting electricity connections (distribution or off-grid) account for only about 4
percent of the Bank’s electricity lending. As reported in the evaluation, Bank Group
engagement in off-grid electricity is 1.5 percent of the total portfolio, which seems
“marginal.” Yet, it is important to recognize that the off-grid share among the
projects directly supporting new connections (about 4 percent of the Bank’s energy
lending) is slightly over one-third. For MIGA projects, the evaluation findings are
based on 15 Project Evaluation Reports (PERs), from a population of 72 MIGA
guarantee projects, which do not provide a robust sample for firm conclusions.

Lighting Africa. Management stresses the unique role and groundbreaking
performance of the Lighting Africa program. As documented in its final evaluation,
this initiative’s achievements range from development of global product quality
standards to number of beneficiaries reached, and from greenhouse gas emissions
reduced to creating a model for a joint World Bank-IFC partnership and from
investment and donor funds mobilized to financial sustainability. Above all, the
program has been influential in creating the conditions for the sector and the market
to attract new entrants and rapid expansion to achieve scale. In terms of findings on
Lighting Africa, management regrets missed opportunities to identify critical
lessons, such as Bank-IFC collaboration leveraging on inherent strength,
innovations, and impact to the beneficiary as a result of using a single evaluative
lens across the four programs. Lighting Africa is a market-based approach and
fundamentally different in nature from the other three umbrella multi-donor trust
fund facilities. The report, in particular, mischaracterizes the program’s donor
reporting function, which was discontinued and replaced with overarching and
periodic half-year program reporting. Impact results are publicly reported semi-

                                                                   MANAGEMENT RESPONSE

Lighting Asia websites.

IFC’s support in FCS. Recognizing its critical importance for development, support
for electricity access has long been at the center of IFC’s strategy, with an increasing
focus on low-income countries and FCS. As announced recently, management is
strengthening IFC’s commitment to FCS where supporting infrastructure, including
electricity, is key. As FCS have among the lowest rates of electricity access
worldwide, management believes that this strengthened commitment, backed by,
inter alia, an enhanced risk envelope, new pools of risk capital and blended finance
instruments, and boosted resources and talents in these markets, would help
accelerate their improved electricity access. To improve electricity access, including
reliability and quality, the Bank Group is engaged in more intensive collaboration on
project-related as well as broader sector and institutional challenges, including
through JIPs. These efforts are showing initial signs of pay-offs in the form of
growing pipelines in some of the most difficult business environments from the
private sector perspective.

MIGA’s role in World Bank Group support for electricity access. The report notes
that MIGA accounted for only 8 percent of the $63.5 billion provided by the Bank
Group to the electricity sector over the period FY2000-2014 (World Bank-71 percent,
IFC-21 percent). However, across the Bank Group, the sector’s share in total MIGA
commitments as well as the share of low-access countries within the electricity
access portfolio was the highest in MIGA (18 percent and 35 percent, respectively),
which denotes its relative importance. It would have been useful for the report to
draw lessons from the experience, and provide a coherent explanation and guidance
as to MIGA’s roles and contributions in low-access, low-income countries.

Impacts of MIGA guarantee projects. The report finds it challenging to get
evaluative evidence of the impacts of MIGA guarantee projects on end-users,
especially the poor, and on its fiscal sustainability. The report also states that MIGA
and IFC do not have any significant provision for tracking the welfare and gender
outcomes related to their operations. The challenges faced with regard to MIGA’s
Development Data Gathering has been well recognized by IEG’s 2013 assessment of
self-evaluation systems in MIGA and IFC. Essentially, this challenge is inherent to
MIGA’s business model as a political risk insurance provider, including the arms-
length nature of its relationship with the project company.

Report to the Board from the Committee on
Development Effectiveness Sub-Committee
The Sub-Committee (SC) of the Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE)
considered the Independent Evaluation Group’s (IEG) report, World Bank Group Support to
Electricity Access, FY2000-FY2014—An Independent Evaluation, Draft Management
Response, and World Bank Group Support toElectricity Access, FY2000-FY2014: An
Independent Evaluation—Annex.

The Committee welcomed IEG’s evaluation and assessment of the technical and financial
constraints to reaching universal electricity access. They recognized that the World Bank
Group has made progress in expanding access to electricity, but noted that to achieve
universal access by 2030, a major shift had to be made. Members endorsed the
recommendations and called for the World Bank Group to increase its support to countries
with low-access to electricity, asking the World Bank and the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) to engage decisively and step up their engagements. They were pleased to
learn that by having targets on fragile and conflict-affected states, IFC was not ex-ante
foreclosing its engagements across low-access countries; they were hopeful that the new
Energy Access Global Solutions Group and the Energy Access Global Lead would provide a
clearer vision on how the World Bank Group could maximize its efforts. Members noted the
importance of securing government ownership and commitment to achieve universal
electricity access. Management reiterated its strong concurrence with the report’s
recommendations and noted its commitment to developing a comprehensive action plan.

Members queried whether the World Bank Group possessed the skills in-house to reach the
targets and the ambitious goals. Noting that the World Bank Group will not be able to deploy
the needed $33 billion to meet the 2030 goal, the Committee encouraged the World Bank
Group to use its convening power to mobilize resources from other donors and the private
sector. Members highlighted that there was space to scale up renewable energy and put an
emphasis on non-conventional renewable energy in poor rural areas. Members agreed that
the World Bank Group should move from a predominantly project-by-project approach to a
sector-wide approach to include generation, transmission, and distribution investment and
asked that the institution work closely with governments to set appropriate timing and
sequencing. Management cautioned about the need to maintain a flexible approach at the
country and sectoral context level. The Committee was pleased to learn that the tracking
framework that integrates documentation from both governments and development partners
is fully rolled out and will be updated approximately every two years. Management explained
that the multi-tier framework had recently been presented to the Sustainable Energy for All
(SE4ALL) initiative and that it was now being socialized with governments and donors who
will ultimately be responsible for implementing the agreed monitoring and evaluation
framework. The Committee welcomed the Bank's commitment to apply and promote the
SE4ALL multi-tier framework and encouraged IFC to also apply it.

Members commented on the scope of the evaluation, noting that it would have benefited
from addressing underlying problems (e.g. price distortions from fuel subsidies; poorly
functioning power sectors, level of
government commitment); assessing how World Bank Group interventions have impacted
electricity tariffs; including investment advisory services and public finance management;
and discussing private, public, and joint ownership of assets. Members expressed their
interest for management to continue its full Board engagements on sustainable energy

        1. Evaluation Context, Scope, and
        Approach
Access to electricity can enable economic growth, reduce poverty levels, and
enhance human welfare. The World Bank Group has long acknowledged this and
highlighted it with its decision to support the global Sustainable Energy for All
(SE4All) initiative, launched in 2011. 1 Supporting this initiative is integral to
achieving the Bank Group’s twin goals of increasing shared prosperity and ending
extreme poverty by 2030. The goal of SE4All is to achieve universal access to energy,
including electricity, within the next 15 years. It also aims to improve energy
efficiency and increase the use of renewable energy by 2030. The initiative is co-
chaired by the UN secretary-general and the president of the World Bank.

This evaluation examines the Bank Group’s support to its country clients for scaling
up access to electricity during the 15-year period from fiscal year (FY)2000 through
FY2014, aiming to inform its strategy to support access-deficit countries in a move
toward universal access in the next 15 years. This assessment covers IBRD and IDA
lending and nonlending assistance, IFC investments and advisory services, and
MIGA guarantees.


Dimensions of the Access Challenge
About 1.1 billion people—one-sixth of the world’s population and mostly poor—do
not have access to electricity. Among those who have access, a comparable number
receive electricity services that are below the standards of quantity and reliability
expected of an efficiently performing sector. These shortcomings in electricity sector
performance can seriously undermine a country’s economic growth and prevent the
realization of improvements in human welfare (figure 1.1; appendix B).

Inadequate electricity access can severely limit human development and quality of
life. Directly or through its economic multiplier effects, electricity access can enable
transformative progress in all dimensions of human development (education, health
care, access to water, essential communications and information), and in access to
financial services and opportunities for income generation. For example, education
may improve since lighting improves school environments and enables studying at
home. Positive health effects may result from better food storage and less indoor air
pollution. Outside the home, electricity can facilitate sterilization, water purification
and supply, sanitation, and refrigeration of essential medicines. Access to electricity

may also increase the willingness of the educated workforce (teachers and doctors,
for example) to live in rural areas. Better access to information and less time spent
on nonpaid work can bring positive gender impacts. More access to entertainment
and information via television, radio, and mobile phones can also improve
opportunities and quality of life (box 1.1).

Inadequate electricity access can also have adverse effects on the productivity of
manufacturing and commerce (IEG 2014e). Business costs increase because of the
need to take preventive measures against power outages, such as self-provision of
electricity. Costs are also incurred from outage-related damage, spoilage, and
cleanup, startup after an outage, and lost or deferred sales and transactions (Foster
and Steinbuks 2009).

The three charts in figure 1.1 show correlations rather than causal relations among
income, human development, and electricity access (positive correlations) and
between poverty and electricity access (negative correlations). But substantial
research has examined the causal links between electricity access and economic
growth. Literature reviews (Bayar and Özel 2014; Ozturk 2010) reported that a
majority of the studies found unidirectional causality between electricity
consumption and economic growth, but some studies found bidirectional causality
(Calderon and Servén 2014). Where causality was unidirectional, studies in some
countries found it unidirectional from electricity consumption to economic growth,
but the reverse in others (Gurgul and Lach 2011; Bildirici and Kayikçi 2012; Hu and
Lin 2013; Ogundipe and Apata 2013; Nazlioglu, Kayhan, and Adiguzel 2014). The

EVALUATION CONTEXT, SCOPE, AND APPROACH
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) has conducted a systematic review of the
evidence on the welfare impacts of electricity access on beneficiaries. The findings,
summarized in box 1.1 and detailed in appendix J, provide some evidence on
welfare impacts.


 Box 1.1. Systematic Review of Welfare Impacts from Electricity Access—Findings
 Systematic reviews are used to answer a specific research question by identifying and
 screening relevant impact evaluations and synthesizing the quantitative and qualitative
 evidence from them to inform policy and practice.
 IEG, in collaboration with the EPPI-Center, is conducting a systematic review on the
 welfare impacts of electricity access on beneficiaries. Using a screening process, the
 review has narrowed the analysis to 32 impact evaluations, including five associated with
 World Bank projects in Bangladesh, Nepal, India, and Vietnam. Most of the studies (63
 percent) were in middle-income countries (12 in lower-middle income and 7 in upper-
 middle income). The regions with the largest gaps in electricity access—Sub-Saharan
 Africa and South Asia—are represented well with 14 and 9 studies, respectively. 24
 studies covered grid-based electricity connections and the remaining 8 covered off-grid
 provision of electricity comprising six cases of solar home systems (SHSs) and two with
 mini-hydro schemes. Majority (85 percent) of impact evaluations covered rural
 electrification.
 The findings of the systematic review show that electricity access improves children’s
 study time at home, school enrollment and has a positive impact on years of schooling.
 The review finds mixed evidence on fertility and women empowerment. Two studies
 show significant effect of electricity access on fertility reduction, while one study found
 no effect. Very few studies measured the impact of electricity access on health. However,
 one study found evidence that electricity access significantly reduces indoor pollution.
 Another study found the incidence of cough, respiratory problems, eye irritation, and
 headache lower in electrified households than in un-electrified households. The evidence
 base for the impact of electricity access on microenterprise profits is also thin. Regarding
 household income, electricity access is found to have a positive impact on total income as
 well as non-farm income. No overall impact on the number of hours worked was
 observed.
 While these emerging findings add to the knowledge of links between electricity access
 and welfare outcomes, they also underline the need to increase the evidence base to better
 understand the extent and magnitude of these links.



Although electricity access to households tends to be highlighted in developmental
efforts, it should be noted that the household sector accounts for a relatively small
portion (about 20 percent) of global and national electric power demand. Industry,
business and commerce, government, health and education services, agriculture,
and other economic activities account for the remaining 80 percent. 2 The technical

performance, financial viability, and reliability of the entire electricity delivery
system (generation, transmission, and distribution) is anchored by the industrial
sector, which continuously uses electricity and is capable of paying for it.

Electricity access is more than just a connection to a distribution network; it requires
that electricity is provided adequately as demanded and in a reliable, affordable
manner. The SE4All framework includes the attributes of adequacy, reliability, and
affordability in its definition of electricity access (World Bank and IEA 2013). The
provision of adequate and reliable electricity service on demand requires a balanced,
planned expansion of generation capacity and transmission and distribution (T&D)
for delivering electricity securely and efficiently, based on the location of generation
plants and load centers, and coordinating with off-grid options where feasible.
Policies and regulation are needed to achieve this, both to facilitate the large capital
investments needed to bridge the access gap and to ensure that electricity services
are financially viable and affordable for all, especially the poor. Therefore, this study
assesses the range of support the World Bank Group (including IBRD, IDA, IFC, and
MIGA) provides for the electricity sector that relates to electricity access, including
physical infrastructure for generation and T&D, the enabling sector policy
framework and policy dialogue, and technical assistance and advisory services.

Note: Electricity access data are for 2010 (the latest year for which the most consistent data are available).


If the pace of new connections made during 2000–2010 continues for the next 15
years and population growth is taken into account, the number of people without
access in low-access countries would rise by 40 percent by 2030 (box 1.2). There
would still be 1.2 billion people without electricity by 2030, and another 1 billion are
likely to be constrained by unreliable electricity supplies.

The access challenge set by SE4All is almost exclusively concentrated in Sub-Saharan
Africa. East Asia is on track to nearly close its access gap by 2030. South Asia can
largely eliminate its access deficit by then if it maintains the pace of new connections
it implemented in recent years. By contrast, the challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa is
daunting: Of the 40 low-access countries in the Region, seven have access less than
10 percent, and another 15 countries have access less than 25 percent. Unless there is
a big break from recent trends, the population without electricity access in Sub-
Saharan Africa is projected to increase by 58 percent (from 591 million to 935
million) during 2015–2030. Furthermore, five countries would still have access levels
below 10 percent by 2030; and another 15 countries would have access levels under
25 percent. Overall, in Sub-Saharan Africa, 39 countries would still be in the low-
access category. A serious implication of continuing the current pace of access is that
yet another generation of children will be denied the benefits of modern service
delivery facilitated by provision of electricity, including education, health, and
connectivity. And more than 40 percent of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population is under
14 years old. 5

EVALUATION CONTEXT, SCOPE, AND APPROACH

The World Bank Group’s Evolving Strategy for Electricity Access
The Bank Group gradually sharpened its focus on electricity access, as seen in its
approach to the electricity sector during the past few decades. In the 1970s and 1980s
the Bank Group concentrated on investments in generation, transmission, and
distribution in vertically integrated national electricity companies. Some of the key
policy and guidance documents governing this period were the Operational Manual
Statement OMS3.72 (World Bank 1978), power sector support strategy (World Bank
1983), and the corresponding operations directive (1987). In the 1990s the Bank
Group financed a wave of rural electrification projects that carried into the 2000s,
informed by lessons learned from the initial cohort of operations. The policy paper
on power sector governed Bank Group support during the 1990s (World Bank 1993).
Starting in the 2000s, the strategy focused on unbundling and privatization. In the
latter part of the decade, those strategies emphasized electrification and increased
support to national utilities for renewable energy and off-grid options as
technologies improved and became less expensive. The Bank Group aimed to
improve focus on the environmental concerns and impacts of the power sector
covered in the report Fuel for Thought: An Environmental Strategy for the Energy Sector
(World Bank 2000), which led to the policy guidelines in Development and Climate
Change: A Strategic Framework for the World Bank Group (World Bank 2008). More
recently, the Bank Group shifted again toward scaling up access nationwide by
supporting the full range of electricity infrastructure. It began with sectorwide
approaches using a comprehensive planning approach backed by geospatial
planning and pooled resources for balanced access growth. In 2012 the Bank Group
partnered with the SE4All global initiative. And in July 2013 the Bank Group
outlined its future sector directions for energy access, energy efficiency, and
renewable energy in the Board Report Toward a Sustainable Energy Future for All:
Directions for the World Bank Group’s Energy Sector, which contains actions and
initiatives to improve electricity access (World Bank 2013f).


Evaluation Questions and Methodology
This evaluation considered the question: To what extent has the World Bank Group
been effective in the past and, going forward, how well is it equipped to put its
country clients on track to achieve universal access to electricity that is adequate,
affordable, and of the required quality and reliability? The focus is on drawing upon
the Bank Group’s experience in the last 15 years to inform strategy as it prepares to
face the access challenge.

The evaluation was guided by a results framework consisting of the logically linked
inputs, outputs, intermediate outcomes, and development outcomes for electricity
access, shown in figure 1.3. The results framework reflects the development
objectives, components, and key performance indicators of lending, technical
assistance, and advisory services implemented by the World Bank Group for the
electricity sector, and the core development indicators adopted by the energy
practice in the Bank Group. 6

The results framework implicitly assumes that with the requisite government
leadership and private sector participation, the Bank Group’s support and
interventions would lead to increased electricity generation, transmission, and
distribution, and to improved sector frameworks (policies, regulations, and
institutions), sector management capacity, and financial arrangements. These
outputs are assumed to lead to intermediate outcomes through improved financial
viability and institutional capacity in the sector, and increased connectivity and
access for the population and businesses. Finally, the increased access that is
financially and technically sustainable is expected to lead to development outcomes
through improved economic growth, human development aspects, and welfare. To
investigate the linkages in the theory of change implied by the results framework,
this evaluation drew upon project data and knowledge products from the Bank

The evaluation assessed both quantitative and qualitative results for individual
projects during FY2000–2014. The portfolio review covered all projects for the
World Bank, IFC, and MIGA that were approved or closed/matured during
FY2000–2014 as shown in table 1.2. Field-based Project Performance Assessment
Reports (PPARs) were prepared for 10 projects in four countries. Detailed Country
Electricity Sector Profiles were prepared for a sample of 35 countries covering nearly
60 percent of the Bank Group’s lending for the electricity sector, and more than 75
percent of the world’s population without electricity access. Key performance
indicators for projects completed and reported in the 35 sample countries from
FY2000–2014 were rated. More than 25 interviews were conducted with staff, task
team leaders, and management of the Bank Group’s Global Practice for Energy and
Extractives. The list of sample countries with selected data, list of PPARs, a detailed
note on methodology, and the task team leaders templates are in appendixes C, D, E,
and F, respectively.

The evaluation complements and builds on the findings from parallel, recent, and
older IEG evaluations. It complements the earlier IEG reports Power for Development:
A Review of the World Bank Group’s Experience with Private Participation in the Electricity
Sector (IEG 2003) and New Renewable Energy: A Review of the World Bank’s Assistance
(IEG 2006), and it adds to the relevant findings of The Welfare Impact of Rural
Electrification: A Reassessment of the Costs and Benefits, An IEG Impact Evaluation (IEG
2008b) through an analysis of economic and welfare outcomes from World Bank
projects. The evaluation also complements the findings of Safeguards and
Sustainability Policies in a Changing World: An Independent Evaluation of World Bank
Group Experience (IEG 2010), which covered electricity sector projects, and two
evaluations on climate change (IEG 2008a; Chomitz 2010), which covered energy
policies and energy efficiency issues. Relevant findings of The Big Business of Small
Enterprises: Evaluation of the World Bank Group Experience with Targeted Support to
SMEs, 2006–12, which identified electricity access as a major constraint in this sector,
were taken into account (IEG 2014e). The findings of World Bank Group Support to

2014c) and the World Bank Group Assistance to Low-Income Fragile and Conflict-Affected
States (IEG 2014g), where relevant to the electricity sector, were also considered by
this study.

IEG conducted a cluster review of four partnership programs: the Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), Asia Sustainable and Alternative
Energy Program (ASTAE), Global Partnership on Output-based Aid (GPOBA), and
Lighting Africa (IEG 2005). These four programs were selected because they are the
largest partnership programs contributing to the Bank Group’s work in energy
access. The findings from this cluster review are reflected in the analysis of portfolio
focus and performance (ESMAP, ASTAE, and Lighting Africa) and of affordability
of access to the poor (GPOBA).

IEG’s 2008 study of Bank Group activities related to climate change covered the
World Bank’s win-win energy policy reforms: energy price reform and policies for
energy efficiency—both of which offer potentially large gains at the country level,
together with significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. One of the report’s
conclusions is that “there is no significant trade-off between climate change
mitigation and energy access for the poorest. Basic electricity services for the world’s
unconnected households, under the most unfavorable assumptions, would add only
one-third of a percent to global greenhouse gas emissions, and much less if
renewable energy and efficient light bulbs could be deployed. The welfare benefits
of electricity access are of the order of $0.50 to $1 per kilowatt-hour, while a
stringent valuation of the corresponding carbon damages, in a worst case scenario, is
a few cents per kilowatt-hour.” Others note that universal energy access can be
achieved with essentially no increase in the global emissions of CO2 only if the
billions of people without access to energy services (or with poor quality service)
demand only a minimal amount of energy services (Bazilian and Pielke 2013).

The report is organized as follows:

Chapter 2 analyzes the Bank Group’s interventions and support for electricity access
(lending, policy advice, and knowledge development) in country clients through the
lens of electricity access categories and assesses the portfolio’s electricity access
relevance, outcomes and impacts, and efficiency.

Chapter 3 evaluates the Bank Group’s role and effectiveness in improving
institutional frameworks for electricity access, focusing on the financial viability of
electricity sectors, and addressing the affordability of electricity access for the poor.

Chapter 4 evaluates Bank Group support for national access expansion programs
through grid and off-grid means. It also examines recent efforts for systematic

Highlights
 The World Bank Group’s support to the electricity sector is a significant share of its overall
   engagement with country clients.
 Within the electricity sector, countries with low- and medium- electricity access received a
  smaller share of assistance relative to high- and universal-access countries.
 There were significant gaps in coverage of low-access countries, with low engagement and
  continuity mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Region with the largest population without access.
 Support for off-grid electrification was low and sporadic, with a few significant exceptions.
 The World Bank consistently raised issues and strategies to country clients for adequacy,
  reliability of electricity services, and financial viability, but less so for affordability and welfare.
 The Bank Group—on its own and through global partnerships—contributed substantially to
  knowledge development in electricity access for country clients.
 Development outcomes were favorable overall compared with other infrastructure sectors, but
  outcomes for low-access countries were somewhat lower relative to other categories.
 Infrastructure projects performed better than policy loans. The growing renewable energy
  portfolio is scaling the learning curve for dealing with technology and regulatory challenges.
 Median implementation time of World Bank electricity sector investment projects was nine years,
  with time overruns attributed partly to quality of project design and borrower capacity.
 Monitoring and evaluation performance of World Bank projects was poorer in low- and medium-
  access countries compared with high- and universal-access countries.
 Tracking welfare and gender impacts in World Bank projects improved; a beginning has been
    made in this respect by IFC.



Lending and Focus on Electricity Access
The World Bank Group provided $63.5 billion to the electricity sector during FY2000–
2014, about 9 percent of its support for all sectors during the period. WB support is
regarded as commitments and includes grants, credits or loans and guarantees; IFC
investment support is regarded as financing and include loans and equity; MIGA
support is regarded as insurance and includes guarantees. This portfolio
concentration tracked the directional flow of global private investments, mostly
involving high and universal access countries, and included sixty-one (61) of 88
countries that received repeated IFC and MIGA support during the past 15 years and

Guarantees (PRG), IFC financing and advisory work and/or MIGA political risk
insurance (PRI) were rated high risk by Institutional Investor and the Economic
Intelligence Unit. (figure 2.4).

The World Bank (IBRD and IDA) accounted for $45 billion (71 percent); IFC), $13.6
billion (21 percent); and MIGA, $4.9 billion (8 percent). The electricity sector was 10
percent of World Bank commitments, and all other infrastructure sectors (transport,
water, and telecommunications) accounted for 27 percent of overall lending. IFC’s
commitments for the electricity sector accounted for 8 percent of all IFC
commitments, compared with 17 percent for all other infrastructure sectors. MIGA
devoted 18 percent of its overall gross exposure to the electricity sector, compared
with 21 percent for all other infrastructure sectors. Overall, this is a significant
emphasis on the electricity sector (figure 2.1).

When viewed by access levels, however, the share of Bank Group electricity sector
commitments for low-access countries during the period was not commensurate with
the scale of the challenge for this group of countries. Only 22 percent of Bank Group
commitments went to low-access countries, compared with 42 percent for universal-
access countries; 6 percent of IFC commitments went to low-access countries,

compared with 58 percent to universal-access countries. MIGA has a more balanced
portfolio compared with the Bank and IFC: the share of low-access countries was
higher at 35 percent while the share of universal access countries at 39 percent is the
lowest among the Bank Group (figure 2.2). The World Bank’s relatively low share for
low-access countries can be partly attributed to limited IDA resources, which have
multiple claims from a variety of sectors. Also, the large incidence of fragile and
conflict-affected states (FCS) among low-access countries (22 of 51) limits Bank
operations to small grants under the multi-donor trust fund. However, IDA support
to the electricity sector increased in line with the expanding overall IDA commitments
during FY2000–2014 (figure 2.3). The evaluation recognizes that the approximately 78
percent of the WBG portfolio invested outside of low access countries—that have
reached medium to near-universal access— focused to a greater extent on other
dimensions of electricity access including quality and reliability, and energy efficiency
and renewable energy, which are key goals of the SE4ALL Initiative.

Bank Group funding for private sector investments was also heavily skewed toward
high and universal access countries. This portfolio concentration tracked the
directional flow of global private investments, mostly involving high and universal
access countries, and included sixty-one (61) of 88 countries that received repeated
IFC and MIGA support during the past 15 years and were also noted to be in
different stages of the reform trajectory. The latter group of countries are mostly
IDA-eligible countries, primarily with low electrification rate. Using country risk as
a filter, fifteen universal and high access countries with projects that received WB
Partial Risk Guarantees (PRG), IFC financing and advisory work and/or MIGA
political risk insurance (PRI) were rated high risk by Institutional Investor and the
Economic Intelligence Unit 1 (figure 2.4).

The depth and continuity of the Bank Group’s engagement in low- and medium-
access countries is poor compared with their access needs and the urgency of the
Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) goals. Of 51 low-access country clients, the Bank
Group supported two projects at most in 31 countries during the past 15 years and
did not engage at all in 14 countries. Similarly, of 18 medium-access countries, 11
had two projects or fewer, and five countries had no engagement at all. IFC’s
engagement was sparser, with no engagement at all in 29 of the 51 low-access
countries, and nine of the 18 medium-access countries (table 2.1).

World Bank lending for the electricity sector was concentrated in infrastructure,
with generation and transmission and distribution (T&D) each accounting for about
one-third of the FY2000–2014 portfolio; this is in line with demand and the capital-
intensive nature of the sector. Two themes—improving energy efficiency and
enabling policy framework—had shares of 12 percent each, and dedicated technical
assistance projects had less than 0.5 percent. IFC’s investments were predominantly
in generation, which made up 85 percent of its portfolio, with much of the remaining
amount going to T&D. Advisory services and other categories accounted for less
than 0.5 percent each. MIGA guarantees was also largely in generation, which
absorbed three-fourths of its overall gross exposure, and the rest going to T&D
(figure 2.5).

ASSISTANCE, FOCUS, AND PERFORMANCE, FY2000-2014
Regarding access categories, the Bank Group’s lending and guarantees in low-,
medium-, and high-access countries was mostly concentrated in electricity
infrastructure. Bank lending for sector policy was significantly higher in high- and
universal-access countries ($5.4 billion of $5.6 billion) and was delivered through
dedicated projects reflecting the demand from these countries and availability of
financing under IBRD terms. This pattern also reflects various elements of the Bank
Group’s energy sector strategy as it evolved during the past few decades (as detailed
in the section on Strategy for Electricity Access in chapter 1), and as it applied to
countries at different levels of access and sector development. In low- and medium-
access countries, policy-related support, technical assistance, and advisory assistance
were typically channeled through relatively small components of infrastructure
investment projects, which totaled $674 million in low-access countries and $135
million in medium-access countries. The outcomes from these approaches to policy
and technical assistance support are discussed in various sections of this chapter and
in chapter 3 (figure 2.6).

Non-conventional renewable energy accounted for nearly 25 percent of the Bank
Group’s support for generation during FY2000–2014 (figure 2.5). Individually, the
World Bank, IFC, and MIGA devoted significant shares of their resources to build
generation capacity using non-conventional renewable sources, which absorbed 25
percent, 19 percent, and 27 percent of their portfolio amounts, respectively. The
patterns observed in the growth of the Bank Group’s renewable energy portfolio are
described in box 2.1.

 Box 2.1. Bank Group Support for non-conventional Renewable Energy
     Support for non-conventional renewable energy (solar, wind, biomass, mini-hydro,
     geothermal) trended upward during the past 15 years. IFC’s commitments, in
     particular, accelerated since 2008 after several years of slow growth, and exceeded
     World Bank commitments for this purpose in 2013 and 2014 (figure B2.1.1). Bank Group
     staff indicate that IFC’s investments in non-conventional renewable energy have built
     on previous and ongoing Bank support for policy and regulatory frameworks in
     countries where IFC operates. The proportion of lending for non-conventional
     renewable energy generation in low- and medium-access countries is still on the low
     side for IFC (17 percent) relative to the World Bank (33 percent). Overall, more non-
     conventional renewable energy projects by the World Bank had favorable development
     outcomes ratings (69 percent) compared with 50 percent of the small cohort of
     evaluated IFC investment projects in this sub-sector (discussed in the section on Bank
     Group performance). IFC investment projects in conventional generation (including
     large hydro) had better development outcomes compared with its projects in non-
     conventional renewable energy. Technology risks and regulatory uncertainty affected
     outcomes of non-conventional renewable energy projects. In particular, withdrawal of
     government subsidies and tax incentives plus policy reversals in some countries placed
     financial viability of non-conventional renewable energy projects’ at risk. Work quality
     shortcomings at appraisal also contributed to lower development and investment
     outcomes, particularly for IFC equity investments. Another IEG review of IFC’s
     renewable energy projects, which included large hydro projects, identified constraints
     in land acquisition issues and regulatory uncertainty as factors affecting outcomes. The
     review also highlighted recent and evolving experience by the private sector and
     governments in this sub-sector.

The World Bank promoted off-grid solutions—individual units, mainly solar home
systems (SHS) and isolated mini- and micro-grids—as a fast way to provide energy
services to rural and remote areas (World Bank 2014a). However, its assistance for


18
CHAPTER 2
ASSISTANCE, FOCUS, AND PERFORMANCE, FY2000-2014
off-grid electrification in the past 15 years is only a small part of its electricity sector
portfolio. During FY2000–2014 the Bank Group committed $1.1 billion 2 to off-grid
electrification projects, which is 1.5 percent of its total commitments to the electricity
sector during the period. There is no discernible trend in the World Bank’s support
for off-grid electrification in the past 15 years, during which small spurts of lending
were punctuated by large commitments to a few projects (figure 2.7; table 2.2).

Off-grid projects were heavily concentrated in a few countries that received 70
percent of the total support for this purpose (Argentina, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Mali,
Mongolia, and Sri Lanka). Two operations in Bangladesh (Rural Electrification and
Renewable Energy Development Projects I and II) accounted for 41 percent of the
Bank Group’s total off-grid support during FY2000–2014. 3 Only two fully dedicated
off-grid operations were financed during this period, in Mongolia and
Nicaragua. 4Other off-grid interventions were components of larger projects
(appendix G).

Only 30 percent of the World Bank’s off-grid support in the past 15 years was
directed toward low-access countries. This contrasts with the potential of off-grid
electrification to rapidly bring basic electricity services on a large scale to people
who are not likely to be reached by the grid in the near future, or to remote or
sparsely populated areas that are not likely to ever be cost-effective for grid
expansion. The size and significance of off-grid electrification grew in many
countries and thus could be important in scaling up electricity access, both on its
own and as a pre-electrification complement to grid expansion. The Bank Group’s
support for various business models for off-grid electricity and to create markets for
basic lighting and charging products are discussed in chapter 4.


Coverage of Electricity Access Issues and Strategies in CAS/CPS
During FY2000–2014, the World Bank Group was generally diligent in diagnosing
country needs, raising relevant issues, and proposing strategies for most
components of the results framework for improving electricity access. This is
evident from an analysis of Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) and Country
Partnership Strategies (CPSs) for the 35 case study countries. The strategies
consistently and comprehensively covered issues relating to the adequacy and
reliability of electricity services. Similarly, the financial viability of sector utilities
and other service providers was covered in depth in almost all the sampled
countries. Off-grid electrification issues were taken up in the vast majority of both
low/medium- and high/universal-access countries, but there was little continuity
from one CAS/CPS to the next, and there was less attention to specific strategies.
The CAS/CPS fell short on coverage of electricity affordability for the poor and on
links between electricity access and welfare impacts. Just 10 of the 19 sampled low-


20
CHAPTER 2
ASSISTANCE, FOCUS, AND PERFORMANCE, FY2000-2014
and medium-access countries received an analysis of issues and strategic directions
with respect to electricity affordability for the poor. Similarly, welfare outcomes
were covered in only 14 of the 19 low- and medium-access countries (table 2.3;
appendix H).

Knowledge Development for Electricity Access
The Bank Group made strong contributions to knowledge about electricity access
development. This body of knowledge was generated by the Global Practice for
Energy and Extractives (formerly the Energy Sector of the Sustainable Development
Department), the Development Economics Group, various Bank Regions, and the
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and Asia Sustainable and
Alternative Energy (ASTAE), two global programs administered by the Bank Group
that have devoted significant resources to energy access. This section also draws
upon the findings of a parallel IEG learning product on global programs for
electricity access covering ESMAP and ASTAE, and the activities of the Global
Partnership on Output-based Aid (GPOBA) and the Lighting Africa program. A
summary of the learning product is in appendix I.

This evaluation identified 321 knowledge products for FY 2000–2014, including 147
sectorwide economic, policy, and technical studies, 162 policy research working
papers, and 12 policy notes covering one or more aspects of electricity access. Of the
321 studies, 187 (59 percent) related to various aspects of sector management
(including generation and T&D), 66 (21 percent) focused on renewable energy, and
50 (16 percent) covered access-welfare linkages. For geographic coverage, about one-
third dealt with multiple Regions, and 38 products (22 percent) looked primarily at
Sub-Saharan African countries, followed by South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific
with 46 products each (14 percent each). Thus the knowledge products had an even
coverage in subject matter and set priorities for Regions with the most prominent
access issues.



                                                                                                            21
                                                                              CHAPTER 2
                                        ASSISTANCE, FOCUS, AND PERFORMANCE, FY2000-2014
The global programs ESMAP and ASTAE contributed prominently to the mix of
knowledge products. ESMAP is a global program for knowledge assistance that
covers advice on legal, regulatory, and policy frameworks; training to strengthen the
capacity of energy institutions; dissemination of best practices; and support to pave
the way for World Bank investments. Energy access accounted for 38 (21 percent) of
ESMAP’s completed activities and $12.3 million (26 percent) of total budget
allocations during FY2009–2012 (World Bank 2013d).

The ESMAP has an important role in supporting knowledge products that are
directly linked to access-related project preparation and implementation. ESMAP
piloted the preparation of geospatial access rollout plans based on geographic
information system techniques in Senegal and Kenya, where there was no
systematic planning of this kind before. This process was also used in Rwanda and
Kenya, which prepared credible and bankable prospectuses detailing the sector
parameters, government policy commitments, and sectorwide programs to scale up
electricity access in a staged manner (discussed in more detail in chapter 4). This
process is yielding tangible results in both countries. Similar efforts are at an
advanced stage in Indonesia (in three Eastern Indonesian provinces), Myanmar,
Nigeria, and Papua New Guinea. An external evaluation of ESMAP for 2007–2011
found that it was successful in influencing World Bank lending operations and, in
some situations, was successful in catalyzing private sector investment and
moderately successful in influencing the donor community (Lafontaine and others
2012).

The ASTAE, a regional program for East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia,
supported upstream project preparation, some implementation support work, and a
few freestanding technical assistance projects, mostly consisting of knowledge
products. IEG identified 34 completed and ongoing ASTAE-funded activities,
totaling $6.5 million, in FY2007–2013 that supported rural grid and off-grid
electrification and renewable energy. This evaluation finds that ASTAE’s inputs for
project preparation were valuable—it provided quickly accessible funding for small-
scale activities such as the preparation of an operations manual and implementation
plan in Vietnam, capacity building in Bangladesh, geospatial mapping in Indonesia,
and a beneficiary survey in Mongolia.

A sample of 16 analytical products covering electricity access issues was assessed as
part of the learning product on global programs for electricity access, which covered
ESMAP, ASTAE, GPOBA, and the Lighting Africa program. The learning product
found that more than half of the sampled analytical products analyzed issues with
objectivity and rigor, and generated new knowledge on energy access. The best
publications contributed substantively to the global body of knowledge; their


22
CHAPTER 2
ASSISTANCE, FOCUS, AND PERFORMANCE, FY2000-2014
conclusions, lessons, and recommendations were useful for the intended purpose;
and they were written for the target audience. However, less than half of the papers
were suited to their intended purpose based on the overall relevance of the original
objective, and on the facts and analysis underpinning their conclusions, lessons, or
recommendations. Only four of the sample reports satisfied all the criteria of
objectivity, rigor, fitness to purpose, and ease of understanding for the intended
audience. A list of sample products and specific examples underpinning the above
conclusions are part of a summary of the report on global programs in appendix I.


Development Outcomes: Adequacy, Reliability and Quality, Affordability, and
Welfare
This evaluation analyzed the development outcomes for electricity sector projects
that closed (IBRD and IDA) or have reached early operating maturity (IFC and
MIGA) with evaluations completed during FY2000–2014. 5 For the World Bank, 69
percent of the projects had outcomes rated moderately satisfactory or better, and 79
percent of IFC investment projects had outcomes rated successful or better. Of
MIGA’s 15 evaluated guarantee projects, seven projects (53 percent) had
development outcomes that were rated satisfactory and better. These performance
measures are based on the respective evaluation methodologies of the World Bank,
IFC, and MIGA, which are described in Appendix E (Table E.2). The World Bank
portfolio performance reflects the portfolio’s diversity of investments in generation,
T&D, and development policy operations with a greater spread of performance.
Based on the XPSRs completed in FY2000-2014, IFC supported relatively more
generation projects and those in middle-income and higher access countries.
Aggregate outcome ratings of IFC investment projects were influenced by the higher
proportion of conventional generation (85 percent) and T&D (85 percent) projects
with successful development outcomes. Development outcome ratings of IFC
power sector projects were buoyed by the projects’ “satisfactory and better”
economic contribution 6 and environmental and social (E&S) effects. Lower
development outcome ratings of MIGA conventional generation projects (38
percent), although located in higher access countries, has affected the aggregate
outcome ratings of its projects in the sector. MIGA’s renewable energy generation
and T&D projects had slightly better outcomes. 7

The World Bank’s performance in the electricity sector is somewhat lower than its
performance in other infrastructure sectors combined (transport, water, and
information and communication technologies), though in a similar comparison,
IFC’s performance was better (figure 2.8). The complexity and diversity of energy
sector activities and operations compared with those of other infrastructure sectors

                                                                                                                              ASSISTANCE, FOCUS, AND PERFORMANCE, FY2000-2014
may partly explain this difference. The relatively better outcomes of IFC’s electricity
projects, especially in conventional generation, benefit from the layers of contractual
obligations defined under power purchase agreements covering technical,
safeguards, and operational requirements. Multilayered contractual obligations are
not found in other sectors, except for the extractive industries. IFC’s performance
also benefits from the sound technical capacity of its clients, and from its greater
presence in countries with more favorable country and investment risk profiles. The
aggregate outcome ratings of MIGA power sector projects relative to other sectors
were affected by the older cohort of evaluated projects which lagged in
environmental and social (E&S) sustainability effects. The lack of post-contract of
guarantee follow-up and monitoring in this older set of evaluated projects was also a
factor. A few projects experienced financial problems, which were further linked to
weaknesses in project appraisal.

When classified by country access categories, development outcomes for World
Bank projects in all low-, medium-, and high-access countries were significantly
lower than for universal-access countries (figure 2.9). This result is broadly
correlated with the less favorable World Bank performance (combining project
design, quality at entry 8, and project supervision) in low-access countries. Only 55
percent had results rated moderately satisfactory or better compared with 76 percent
for the whole cohort. IFC ratings for development outcome reflects its portfolio
concentration in higher access countries. IFC work quality was in the acceptable
range for only one out of two evaluated projects in the low-access countries,

compared with 85 percent of all evaluated projects in the sector. Despite the small
number of MIGA evaluations, three of the four evaluated projects in low access
countries had satisfactory and better outcomes. Reasons for better performance vary
by project and has. World Bank performance and IFC work quality are also affected
by the weaker institutional and sector management capacities in low-access
countries. The factors driving the lower World Bank performance in low-access
countries are discussed with illustrative examples in the section on implementation
efficiency later in this chapter.

When development outcomes for the electricity sector are analyzed based on the
major project purpose, World Bank projects focused on policy lending—mainly
financial viability issues—fare distinctly worse than projects focused on electricity
infrastructure (table 2.3). The poorer performance of policy-oriented projects is of
particular importance for the sustainability of electricity access. This issue, along
with links to affordability of access to the poor, is covered in more detail in chapter
3.

For IFC, conventional generation and T&D projects had the most successful or better
ratings. This was due to IFC’s corporate expertise, experience, and comparative

advantage in conventional generation and to the contractual features of power
sector operations as discussed above. The lower ratings for IFC’s new renewable
generation projects is partially due to IFC’s more recent engagement in this area,
and hence the learning curve it faced in dealing with the technology and regulatory
risks in this field (box 2.1). MIGA’s performance was relatively better for T&D and
renewable energy projects compared with conventional generation projects, but
because of the small number of evaluated projects, further analysis is challenging.

IFC advisory services. IEG also reviewed 20 evaluated IFC advisory services
activities relating to the electricity sector, which is about 16 percent of those
evaluated for all sectors during FY2000–2014. The evaluated activities included
assistance to clients to structure public-private partnership transactions, and
structuring tenders and bids document that sought to improve the enabling
environment for electricity sector investments. All 20 evaluated activities were rated
satisfactory and above for IFC’s role and contribution in helping improve the
enabling environment for power sector investments, and generally displayed higher
development effectiveness than the rest of the advisory services portfolio. In several
projects, the advisory activities followed World Bank sector work but in few cases,
IFC advisory work preceded the Bank’s sector work. The actual impact of the
advisory projects is difficult to assess because the evaluated projects’ impacts were
too early to judge, but there appears to be value in continuing the upstream-
downstream linkage. Unbundling IFC’s advisory operations would have to ensure
that the focus on low-income countries’ needs continue.

Key Performance Indicators for access attributes, financial viability, and welfare
This evaluation also assessed the performance of World Bank projects that closed
during FY2000–2014 and which focused on the attributes of electricity access—
adequacy, reliability and quality, and affordability. The assessment used detailed
analysis of key performance indicators for a sample of 35 countries. Key performance
indicators for financial viability and welfare outcomes were assessed using the same
approach, and were consolidated at the country level for the entire period FY2000–
2014. The sample of countries studied (listed in appendix C) accounts for nearly 60
percent of the Bank Group’s lending for the electricity sector and more than 80 percent
of the population without access in Bank Group country clients.

Adequacy and reliability outcomes correspond broadly to generation and T&D
infrastructure outputs, respectively, and were each addressed in 27 of the 35 sample
countries. Between 55 and 60 percent of these countries had moderately satisfactory or
better indicators and did not differ much between low/medium- and high/universal-
access countries. Financial viability was addressed in the next largest set of 24
countries. Here the outcomes were distinctly better for high- and universal-access
countries compared with low- and medium-access countries.9 Welfare indicators
were present in projects for 20 countries, with positive results in 60 percent of them.
Affordability received the least attention; projects in only 10 of the 35 countries took
up this issue. Of these, outcomes were moderately satisfactory or better in six cases.
The World Bank’s experience with supporting its country clients in improving
electricity affordability for the poor is covered in detail in chapter 4 (table 2.5).

The evaluation also considered the differences in outcomes in the above attributes
between low-access countries subdivided into two groups: 0–25 percent access and
25–50 percent access. The differences in ratings are not statistically significant except
for sector finances, in which the 25–50 percent access group is performing worse.
Overall, this data does not lend itself to much interpretation given the limited
number of interventions in both country groups in this regard, and the generally
poor performance of utilities in both these groups, as discussed in chapter 3.

The evaluation assessed the extent to which Bank Group projects, in their results
frameworks, have linked electricity access with improved outcomes for productive
activities, income, and welfare benefits (health, education, communication, and
safety) together with gender-related tracking. IEG found that only a few of the
World Bank’s dedicated rural electrification projects (a subset of all projects related
to electricity access) incorporated welfare-related issues into project design, even
though most of the projects considered improvements in welfare to be part of their
objectives (IEG 2008b). The report recommended that tailor-made surveys be built
into a greater number of Bank projects and designed to allow rigorous testing of the
impacts of electrification. IFC projects covered by this evaluation do not yet include
indicators on poverty and distributional effects. An IEG on evaluation of IFC’s
poverty focus recommended that IFC should define, monitor, and report poverty
outcomes for projects with poverty reduction objectives (IEG 2011). 10 While IFC has
made progress in addressing the recommendations, poverty measurement has not
been fully integrated in its project approval documents and in its monitoring
system. 11 Recently (last two years), IFC project approval documents had included
an estimate of the number of women beneficiaries. 12 However, data collection and
verifiability remains a challenge.

During FY2000–2014 16 World Bank electricity sector projects—a fraction of the 278
projects approved during this period—included indicators in their results
frameworks for tracking productive uses and increased income from activities
associated with electricity access. These projects were mostly in a mix of low-,
medium-, and high-access countries—Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Mexico,
Peru, Philippines, Senegal, Sri Lanka, and Uganda. The indicators related to
adoption of electricity-using equipment for small and micro business or stores and
farming activities.

Relative to productive uses of electricity, World Bank projects paid more attention to
human welfare and gender-related outcomes (box 2.2). During FY2000–2014, 48
World Bank projects included performance indicators for welfare or gender-related
aspects, and 36 of these were in low- and medium-access countries. Twenty-eight of
the 48 projects were approved in FY2009 or later, pointing to continued and


28
CHAPTER 2
ASSISTANCE, FOCUS, AND PERFORMANCE, FY2000-2014
potentially increased attention to these issues in recent years. Seventy-five percent of
projects approved (36 out of 48) were in low- and medium-access countries,
suggesting a greater focus on the poor. Most of these indicators from closed projects
showed satisfactory or better results. However, the quality of indicators for welfare
outcomes was uneven, with most indicators focused only on the number of
beneficiaries that obtained welfare benefits without quantifying the improvements,
and most tracked outputs instead of outcomes. Significant exceptions were found in
Bangladesh, Peru, and Sri Lanka, as explained in the following paragraphs.


 Box 2.2. WBG Progress in Integrating Gender Issues
 Since the adoption of its first gender strategy, Integrating Gender into the World Bank’s
 Work: Strategy for Action in 2001, gender issues have become more integrated in the World
 Bank’s energy operations. ESMAP supported a gender and energy program through the
 Africa Renewable Energy and Access program (AFREA, 2010) and published a guidance
 note on Integrating Gender Considerations into Energy Operations (2013). It is supporting
 World Bank teams on integrating gender considerations into projects by providing direct
 financial and technical support, such as in the case of the Bolivia’s Rural Electrification
 Program; a regional gender assessment of India, Nepal and Pakistan; the second phase of
 the AFREA gender and energy program; a gender and energy subsidies research program
 in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region; a technical assistance program on social
 accountability in the energy sector in Egypt; and the development of a new East Asia and
 Pacific Gender and Energy Program. IFC has also undertaken several steps to address
 gender in its investments and advisory services and promoted business opportunities for
 women in the private sector. In 2002, IFC set up a Gender Entrepreneurship Markets
 program, and has since advocated increasing the number of women board members in
 the companies in which it invests; in 2012 it addressed gender in its Sustainability
 Framework. These initiatives were also guided by the 2009 IEG evaluation of the Bank’s
 Strategy between 2001 and 2005, which concluded that gender integration at the strategic
 level did not always translate into project-level design features, attributing this to the
 absence of results frameworks and weak monitoring and accountability mechanisms.
 The portfolio review carried out under this evaluation revealed that the following need
 improvement in key performance indicators for gender: (i) a clear definition of
 beneficiaries vs. users, since they may be different groups; (ii) tracking of outputs and
 outcomes, not only headcount figures; (iii) measures of outcomes. Most projects limited
 themselves to tracking the “number of female beneficiaries (%)”. In some instances,
 indicators were better designed, and tracked, for example: “Number of hours school aged
 girls in the household study at night; percentage of women getting access to news and
 information; and number of women knowledgeable about reproductive health,
 HIV/AIDS and other women issues” 13; “Contribute to the increase of income of
 participating communities, with percentage distribution between women, men and youth
 ($/year)” 14; “Percentage of active loans to women-owned businesses (%)” 15. However,
 these good practice examples did not track gender outcomes.

 There is need for better monitoring of gender outcomes and impacts in WBG operations
 in order to support the corporate goals of promoting shared prosperity and ending
 extreme poverty and by 2030.

In Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, a set of impact evaluation studies (Khandker, Barnes,
and Samad 2009) and a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) study (RDC 2008) covered
the productive uses, economic, welfare, and gender-related impacts of electricity
access. The Bangladesh studies found positive impacts of grid electrification on
household incomes, use of technology in the home, women’s empowerment, and
study time for boys and girls. The impact evaluation of the SHS program found a
positive and significant impact of electricity access on study time; and a correlation
between those households with a television, and health outcomes and impact on
women’s mobility, among others. Sri Lanka’s M&E study found that even in small
quantities, electricity consumption brings significant lifestyle changes in families,
mainly by making home life more convenient and housework easier. Small and
micro business activities, such as grocery shops, bakeries, battery-charging stations,
communication centers, computer training centers, grinding/rice milling and
cinnamon processing, benefitted from mini-hydro schemes. Villagers reported
increased safety from lighting after dark, and an increase in sociocultural activities
because of the presence of electricity at religious places in the villages.

In the remote areas and poorer regions of Peru, a high-access country, the link
between electricity access and productive activities was established by the World
Bank’s Peru Rural Electrification Project. 16 The project’s productive uses component
helped more than 21,000 rural producers—one-third of which were women—to
adopt electricity-using equipment for processing cereals, coffee, cocoa, baked goods,
meat products, milk, wood and metal products, and handicrafts; and to pump water
for expanded agricultural production and processing. More examples are discussed
in the context of off-grid electrification in chapter 4.


Reliability and Quality
The World Bank recognized the reliability and quality of service issues and
provided country clients with support to address them. In 29 of the 35 case study
countries, CASs/CPSs covering the period 2000-2014 analyzed quality and
reliability issues, and proposed strategies to address them. Typical strategies and
measures adopted in the projects were “improving availability, reliability and



30
CHAPTER 2
ASSISTANCE, FOCUS, AND PERFORMANCE, FY2000-2014
affordability of electricity supply for households and businesses” (World Bank
2010b); “improving reliability and financial sustainability of electricity distribution
companies” (World Bank 2009a); “reliability in rural distribution” (World Bank
2012a); “urgent upgrading of antiquated electricity distribution infrastructure”
(World Bank 2012a); and “increase the reliability of electricity supply to improve the
financial viability of the state-owned energy utility” (World Bank 2014b).

The project-level outputs and outcomes for reliability and quality as measured
through key performance indicators satisfactory or better results in 35 of 37
evaluable projects. IEG reviews of project implementation completion and results
reports show that strong government commitment and a realistic project design
were the main contributing factors to satisfactory performance. These conditions
were in place, for instance, in Uganda, where the Bank project reduced service
interruptions by 48 percent (the original target was 30 percent). 17 In Nigeria, the
cluster-level losses were reduced from 37 percent to less than 12 percent (with a
target of 12 percent); tail-end voltage improved from an average of 29 kilovolts to 33
kilovolts in the 32 clusters; and end-user voltage was increased from 200 volts to 220
volts (achieving the targets). Furthermore, the number of clusters developed with
demonstrable improvements in service levels was increased from zero to six
(overachieving the initial target of five clusters). 18 In Kenya, the number of
combined monthly distribution line interruptions per 100 kilometers for 66 kilovolt
and 33 kilovolt lines was reduced from 4.7 to 2.0, and annual T&D losses were
reduced from 18.7 percent to 16.2 percent. 19

By contrast, reliability and quality outcomes were less than satisfactory in the
reviewed Bank projects in Senegal and Pakistan. These results are attributed to the
project design being too complex (both in areas addressed and number of
implementing agencies involved), or not taking sufficient account of the local
institutional capacity and context; and weak borrower commitment. In the Senegal
project, the technical and nontechnical T&D losses (as a share of net generation)
increased to 21.4 percent by project close instead of decreasing from 17.5 percent to
15.5 percent, as planned. Moreover, a targeted reduction in power interruptions
from 14 gigawatt hours to 8 gigawatt hours was not achieved. 20 In Pakistan, there
were shortcomings in achieving planned outcomes all around. The substation
automation and protective relaying was achieved for only 20 of the 67 targeted
stations; the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company annual T&D loss reduction was
short of target; but Lahore Electric Supply Company annual T&D losses and system
load at two grid stations increased. 21

The analysis of IFC and MIGA projects’ key performance indicators in country
reviews mirrors the World Bank’s focus and performance. Although projects with


                                                                                     31
                                                                               CHAPTER 2
                                         ASSISTANCE, FOCUS, AND PERFORMANCE, FY2000-2014
quality and reliability objectives and indicators covered a diverse range of
interventions for the World Bank, in the case of IFC and MIGA most projects with
quality and reliability objectives (60 percent) were linked with increasing (greenfield
projects) or enhancing (modernization and/or privatization projects) the countries’
generation capacity (adequacy) and thereby contributed to better quality of service
and reliability. IFC and MIGA projects’ that had reliability and service quality
objectives had mostly satisfactory results, with only two out of seven evaluated
projects underperforming on the relevant indicators.

Institutional Framework and Capacity Building
The World Bank has long provided clients with support for developing and
reforming their policy and institutional frameworks to respond to the emerging and
long-term developmental needs of the sector. The assistance typically supported
government and sector ministries to improve policy development and
implementation. Among other things, the Bank supported sector planning and
management; enactment and reform of sector laws; regulatory institution set up and
capacity building; enabling private sector investment; sector restructuring,
unbundling, and corporatization; and improving the financial viability of the sector
and access to services by the poor. In a limited way, the Bank also supported utilities
to improve operations. Following the World Bank’s lead, many bilateral and
multilateral donors and multilateral development banks began to support
institutional development and capacity building in a significant way (ADB 2014).

The CASs/CPSs of 34 of the 35 countries reviewed discussed sector policy,
institutional and capacity issues, and proposed measures to address them. Of the
186 projects reviewed, 177 included key performance indicators focused on
institutional framework and capacity, 174 focused on sector planning and
management, 56 focused on sector regulation and agency, and 10 focused on utility
operations. Overall, 164 projects (88 percent) reported performance on key
performance indicators as moderately satisfactory or better, and there was no
significant difference in rating covering one or more of the issues between country
access levels. Among the other 22 projects with poor performance, 13 were in low-
and medium-access countries, and the remaining were in high- and universal-access
countries. IEG’s review of Implementation Completion and Results Reports showed
that government commitment was a strong factor behind the performance.

Several successes are particularly notable. In Brazil, three projects achieved the
intended sector and market reforms. 22 Tariffs regulations were issued and enforced,
a new wholesale market structure was established, transmission and distribution
(T&D) were unbundled, and energy efficiency laboratories were established around


32
CHAPTER 2
ASSISTANCE, FOCUS, AND PERFORMANCE, FY2000-2014
the country. In India, six projects helped four states and the national power grid to
establish new legal, regulatory, tariff, and institutional frameworks, including
unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution. 23 The Bank built on the
Renewable Resources Development Project for mobilizing $113 million in private
capital for renewables. 24 In Ethiopia, several projects helped establish a regulatory
agency, transform the main utility into a for-profit corporation, put rules in place
facilitating private participation, and trained staff. 25 Also, a regulatory and
institutional structure for rural electrification was established, including training for
designing and constructing rural networks. In Cambodia, two projects helped phase
out wholesalers, establish the main utility as a separate entity, and establish a Rural
Electrification Fund. 26 Furthermore, the World Bank provided advisory services for
establishing a regulatory agency and developing a sector master plan. In
Bangladesh, although sector studies and private sector investments in two
generation projects were achieved, corporatization of a distribution company and
capacity building for the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) were not fully
achieved (IEG 2014a).

At the utility level, the World Bank supported operational improvement through a
supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) in Nigeria, 27 and
technical studies in Tanzania. 28 It also supported establishing environmental units in
Cambodia, 29 Nigeria, and Indonesia, 30 and unbundling and corporatization in
Bangladesh, 31 Indonesia, and Tajikistan. 32

By contrast, in Pakistan, the operation did not succeed in sector restructuring,
including private sector development, market unbundling (including the
underpinning legislation), and improving sector finances by phasing out
government subsidies. 33 In Senegal, there were no satisfactory results for ensuring
cost-recovery tariffs for the main utility (Senelec), market reform and restructuring
through privatization and unbundling, establishing a regulatory authority for the
hydrocarbon subsector, and strengthening Senelec’s internal audit department. 34 In
Vietnam, the integration of small power producers into the market was not fully
achieved. 35 In Cameroon, the World Bank’s efforts to support enactment of the
Electricity Act 36 was not successful. In Ethiopia, training of Ethiopian Electric Power
Corporation staff was not completed because of implementation delays due to an
over-optimistic project design. 37 In Senegal, the projects did not succeed in
reinforcing the Senelec internal Audit Departments, or the unbundling of Senelec
and the achievement of adequate private participation during the lifetime of the
project. 38 In Vietnam, the planned installations for operational management systems
was not completed. 39

IFC’s InfraVentures facility aims to support early-stage infrastructure project
development, thus facilitating private sector investments for infrastructures projects,
including in the electricity sector. InfraVentures was created in 2007 to address
private sponsors’ funding and capacity constraints as well as risk averseness during
the early phases of project development. It has $150 million funding, and
commitments since 2007 reached $70.7 million for 30 projects, including $62 million
for 25 power sector projects (of which 19 active and six closed) as of the end of
FY2014. Ten power projects are located in the Sub-Saharan Africa Region,
representing fifty percent of the power sector commitment amounts. Except for three
projects in Indonesia and Serbia, the projects are located in IDA countries. So far,
two InfraVentures-supported projects reached the financing stage with IFC
investment support (a 181 megawatt hydro project in Georgia and the 96 megawatt
thermal project in Senegal, Tobene IPP). IEG’s review of InfraVentures supervision
reports found challenges to scaling up InfraVentures activities from heightened
political and macroeconomic risks in several countries; technical feasibility
problems, especially in wind farm projects; project bankability issues; and delays in
signing power purchase agreements.


Implementation Efficiency of World Bank Electricity Sector Investment Projects
SE4All set a short period for reaching universal electricity access globally. Therefore,
one dimension of efficiency—implementation efficiency of World Bank electricity
sector projects—including the time required to implement them, is particularly
important. This section examines the record of planned implementation times and
time overruns for investment projects executed by the public sectors of country
clients, and identifies and analyzes the principal factors that drive their efficiency.

Implementation times were evaluated for all 215 World Bank electricity sector
investment projects that closed during FY2000–2014. Of these projects, 81 were in
low- or medium-access countries, and 134 were in high- or universal-access
countries. About 78 percent of all projects were delayed relative to the original
planned implementation period. Delays ranged from five months to eight years,
with an average delay of 2.5 years and a median delay of two years. The share of
delayed projects in low- and medium-access countries (84 percent) was somewhat
higher than that for high- and universal-access countries (72 percent). Among the
sample of closed investment projects reviewed for the efficiency analysis, 20% of
projects had additional financing (AF) to scale up project activities and extend the
project closing date. An analysis of the median delay for the projects with and
without AF showed an insignificant difference of about one month and a half.

Analysis of preparation times (the time elapsed between the review of the project
concept note and project approval by the Board) yields a median preparation time of
two years. The median length of a World Bank investment project, including time
overruns, is nine years (figure 2.10).

The major reasons for implementation delays in these projects are the responsibility
of both the Bank and the borrower. Borrower institutional capacity and the Bank’s
quality at entry are the most important factors, followed by the government’s
commitment to the project, and areas of shared responsibility, principally
procurement matters. Low- and medium-access countries were more affected by
shortcomings in institutional capacity than high- and universal-access countries (42
percent versus 10 percent). Similarly, as seen in figure 2.11, quality at entry
contributed more often to implementation delays in low- and medium-access
countries than in high- and universal-access countries (35 percent versus 19 percent).
By contrast, for projects that closed on time, no significant shortcomings were
observed in institutional capacity, and the Bank’s quality at entry was inadequate in
only one of thirty projects.

The two key factors—inadequate institutional capacity and poor quality at entry—
appeared to reinforce each other in many projects that experienced time overruns.
Inadequate institutional capacity was a factor in Uganda’s Energy for Rural
Transformation project, 40 Zambia’s Power Rehabilitation Project, 41 and Cabo Verde’s
Energy and Water Project. 42

In Uganda, an overrun of 50 percent on a planned implementation period of 4.7
years was due to an overestimation of government and sector institution capacity to
implement an ambitious program of rural transformation. Although training and
technical assistance were included in the project, they took time to favorably affect
the severe absorptive capacity constraints. Capacity limitations were aggravated by
weak implementation arrangements. In Zambia, a 75 percent time overrun on a
planned four-year implementation period resulted. The project design was complex
and tried to combine investment requirements with a range of policy issues
accumulated during more than 20 years of Bank absence from the sector. In the Cabo
Verde project, a 95 percent overrun on a five-year implementation period followed
when little account was taken of the difficulties of implementing a complex and
sensitive program involving the power and other infrastructure sectors in a
geographically dispersed country with limited institutional, technical, and
managerial capacity. Two key privatization-related risks—faltering political
commitment and an unsatisfactory concession agreement—were initially rated as
negligible to modest, but they materialized in a big way. The major part of the
renewable energy and development component, consisting of the extension of 7.8
megawatts of wind farms, was rolled back because of mismanagement of the
procurement process, mainly on the Bank’s part.

Capacity constraints also affected projects in countries with more mature electricity
sectors and high or universal levels of access. Albania’s Power Sector Generation
and Restructuring Project had a nearly 100 percent time overrun on a planned four-
year implementation period, and ended with an unsatisfactory development
outcome. The project’s progress was mainly affected by shortcomings in quality at
entry, capacity, and procurement. The Bank’s analysis of the capacity of the
Albanian Power Corporation did not adequately consider its limited experience
with thermal power plants and their construction problems. Vietnam’s System
Efficiency Improvement, Equitization, and Renewables Project took 10.5 years to
complete compared with the planned 5.5 years. 43 This project illustrates how an
otherwise successful national electrification program had to contend with gaps in
technical and management capacity of some of the implementing agencies, which
caused delays or cancellation of several subprojects, especially during the early



36
CHAPTER 2
ASSISTANCE, FOCUS, AND PERFORMANCE, FY2000-2014
years of implementation. The T&D improvement subprojects were affected by
inexperience in substation control systems, poor coordination between equipment
suppliers and civil contractors, delays in compensation of affected persons, and
prolonged contracting processes.

Rwanda’s project was a fast-track operation to alleviate the country’s power supply
shortfall 44. The project gave primacy to power system reinforcement while
beginning to build capacity that would support present and future activities in the
sector. However, the project was affected by high staff turnover due to increased
competition for key project staff in donor and government-funded projects.

The importance of implementation time efficiency also came up during interviews
with the staff and management of the Bank Group’s Global Practice on Energy and
Extractive Industries. Task team leaders with experience in low-access countries,
particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, pointed to weaknesses in the institutional
capacity of both the government and the implementing agency as constraints on
speedy and effective implementation of projects. At the government or ministry
level, the weaknesses generally relate to sector planning and financial and
regulatory issues; designing and managing public-private partnerships; and
strengthening institutions for these functions. Gaps in technical and planning
capacity exist at the implementing agency level. Staff turnover due to lack of career
incentives or substantially better prospects in other work situations is a continual
problem, though this may be a positive feature if that talent is being mainstreamed
in the country’s electricity sector. Although these observations relate to low-access
countries, even countries with higher access levels and a longer history of
electrification are subject to capacity constraints, but in narrower areas.


Safeguards Performance
The World Bank started to more systematically track environmental and social
safeguard issues in its project Implementation Completion and Results Reports after
2007; and this review covers the 83 electricity sector projects that closed from that
year onwards. Most of the projects are assigned category B under the World Bank’s
environmental and social safeguards policies 45, when potential environmental
impacts are expected to be moderate (76 percent of the sample of 83 projects). Only
about 10 percent are assigned category A. The most frequent safeguard policies
triggered are Environmental Assessment OP 4.01 and Involuntary Resettlement OP
4.12, followed by Safety of Dams OP 4.37 and Natural Habitats OP 4.04 (figure 2.12).

All the project Implementation Completion and Results Reports reported that their
projects were generally in compliance with the World Bank’s environmental and
social safeguards policies. There were some outstanding issues at closure in 6
percent of the projects—mainly generation and T&D projects. For the Afghanistan
Emergency Power Rehabilitation Project (P083908), assigned category B, deficiencies
in dam safety arrangements were identified. These were not addressed during
implementation, and the Bank had to prepare a separate project to address these
deficiencies at the Naghlu plant. Nine projects were reviewed by the Inspection
Panel, three of which were subsequently investigated (Albania Power Sector
Generation and Restructuring Project, India Vishnugad Project, and Nepal Power
Development Project). 46

In four World Bank projects, safeguards issues were reported to have caused
implementation delays, in most cases related to land acquisition. In Indonesia
(P004021, 1996–2003), right-of-way negotiations and land acquisition problems were
time-consuming. In Argentina (P006036, 1993–2000), the agency was slow in
performing land acquisitions and housing construction, adding to pressures that
slowed down project implementation. In Pakistan (P039281, 1996–2003), there was a
significant increase in the cost of compensation for land, which caused long delays
in land acquisition ($36.95 million appraisal estimate versus $116.5 million actual);
this situation warranted an investigation by the National Accountability Bureau of


38

Pakistan and led to the arrest and prosecution of a number of officials and other
people. In Sri Lanka (P076702, 2002–2011), delays were related land acquisition and
to obtaining required approvals from the Central Environmental Authority and
other agencies.

IEG reviewed 51 IFC investment projects evaluated during FY2000–FY2014 for their
E&S effects on two environmental dimensions. 47 The first dimension relates to the
environmental and social performance of the client, such as the preparation and
implementation of environmental and social action plans; compliance with
contractual environmental and social requirements; performance against national
and IFC performance standards, and IFC’s Environment, Health, and Safety
Guidelines. The second dimension assessed and rated the extent of environmental
change or impact brought about by the project as positive or negative.

Of 51 projects, 84 percent achieved satisfactory rating for addressing projects’
environmental and social effects (E&S); these outperformed evaluated projects in
other sectors (52 percent). When weighted by type of power projects, the E&S effects
ratings remains about the same at 88 percent for renewable energy projects, 85
percent for T&D projects, and 81 percent for conventional generation projects.(figure
2.13, panel a).

Among the fourteen evaluated MIGA projects rated for their E&S effects, nine
projects (64 percent) had positive ratings. (figure 2.13, panel b) This share was
relatively higher than the evaluated projects in other sectors with satisfactory and
better ratings (59 percent) for this same indicator. By sub-sectors, all three evaluated
T&D projects were rated positively and two of three renewable energy generation
projects (67 percent) were also rated satisfactory and better for their E&S outcomes. 48

The main drivers of positive E&S effects were the commitment of the sponsor and
the competence of the project management. Projects rated excellent had also gone
beyond typical corporate social responsibility. Several satisfactory-rated projects
established systems to receive the ISO 14001 certification on environmental
compliance.

Only in a few evaluated IFC and MIGA projects has compliance to its respective
E&S standards caused project completion delays. Such delays were experienced in
large generation Category A projects in India, Chile, and the Bujagali project in
Uganda. Of the 495 IFC and MIGA power sector projects that were covered in this
evaluation, four received complaints from local communities and were investigated
by the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman relating to 49: the Albania Advisory
project (IFC Advisory Services); Allain Duhangan, India (IFC Investment Services);
Himal Power, Nepal (IFC Investment Services and MIGA); and Magat Power,
Philippines. All cases are closed.


Monitoring and Evaluation
The World Bank began rating M&E design, implementation, and utilization in
project ICRs in 2007, and IEG validated these ratings through its ICR reviews.
Analysis of these ratings for 79 closed projects for which M&E ratings are available
found that about half have M&E ratings that are substantial or better (on a four-
point scale of high, substantial, modest, and negligible). M&E performance in low-
and medium-access countries is poorer than in high- and universal-access countries
(table 2.6).

The main reason for inadequate M&E performance in low- and medium-access
countries was lack of appropriate or measureable key performance indicators,
including for economic and welfare outcomes—the last link in the results
framework. The M&E rating for one-third of the projects in low- and medium-access
countries was affected by absence of baseline data or targets and weak
implementation capacity.

Among projects with inadequate M&E systems, Mali’s Household Energy project
provided limited evidence that the project’s inputs and outputs led to increased
productivity of small and medium enterprises, enhanced quality and efficiency of
health and education centers, and improved living standards. 50 In the Ethiopia/Nile
Basin Initiative: Ethiopia-Sudan Interconnector project, the outcome indicators were
narrowly defined as export volumes and revenues, and the development objective
broadly aimed to create the conditions and capacity for Ethiopia to generate export
revenues. 51 Although the indicators for infrastructure allowed easy tracking of the
project results, indicators on institutional issues were broader and could have been
better articulated to include both qualitative and quantitative indicators. In another
example, the performance indicators for India’s Rajasthan Power I project were
poorly designed and confusing. Goals such as “loss reduction” or “improved
revenue generation” were included in the design without quantitative or
measurable indicators. The design had few measurable, time-bound targets. In
Rwanda’s Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation project, the data identified in the M&E
plan were being collected regularly, but use of those data was limited. 52 The Bank’s
recommendation to revise the intermediate outcome indicators for technical
performance―reliability and quality of electricity supply―to reflect international
standards could not be followed through because of The Rwanda Electricity
Corporation’s inadequate capacity to implement them.

Among projects with favorable M&E ratings, performance indicators for Uganda’s
Power Specific Investment Loan 4 covered institutional measures relating to sector
reform and management, and projected outputs and outcomes such as load
shedding, loss reductions, and the number of new connections. 53 The indicators
were mainstreamed and continued to be tracked beyond the end of the project. In
Bangladesh’s Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development Project, an
ongoing monitoring system was established by the implementing agency, the
Infrastructure Development Company (IDCOL), and partnership organizations’
representatives. 54 The data collected through project M&E had a strong impact on



                                                                                                41
                                                                                CHAPTER 2
                                          ASSISTANCE, FOCUS, AND PERFORMANCE, FY2000-2014
improving project implementation. In particular, feedback from the field helped the
project team and IDCOL incorporate new technical specifications and technologies
(such as LEDs) in SHSs to better serve lower-income households.

It is challenging to get evaluative evidence of the impacts of IFC investment and
advisory and MIGA guarantee projects on financial sustainability and on end-users,
especially the poor. Project effects on affordability and fiscal sustainability are often
not considered in the project documents—an issue that was identified in earlier IEG
evaluations. In most project documents, there continues to be little discussion, if any,
on affordability relative to inclusion and the impact of the take-or-pay contracts on
government finances. In nearly all of the evaluated projects, assessment of fiscal
effects did not go beyond taxes paid to the government. With MIGA, regular
tracking of project performance and project data collection has been challenging
because of its business model, in which the contractual obligation to provide project-
level information rests on the guarantee holder (typically a foreign investor) and not
on the project company.

As the preceding examples show, indicators for economic and welfare outcomes,
including gender-related outcomes, were more likely to be missing or poorly
defined and inadequately followed up during project implementation. This is of
particular significance because of the Bank Group’s goals for reducing extreme
poverty and promoting shared prosperity. In recent years, there was some progress
in including welfare-related indicators in electricity sector projects.


Conclusions
Insufficient focus on low-access countries. When set against priorities for electricity
access, Bank Group lending volumes for the electricity sector were skewed toward
high- and universal-access countries, which absorbed 46 percent of the resources,
and low-access countries accounted for 22 percent. IFC, in particular, channeled only
6 percent of its lending to low-access countries. Overall, electricity sector lending to
the private sector (IFC, MIGA, and World Bank guarantees) heavily favored high-
and universal-access countries and was not sensitive to investor’s perception of
country risks.

The depth and continuity of Bank Group engagement in investment projects in
low-access countries was low. During the past 15 years, there were two or fewer
World Bank investment projects approved in 31 out of 51 low-access country clients.
IFC’s engagement was sparser in low-access countries, with no engagement at all in
29 out of the 51 countries. For the World Bank, the median length of an investment



42
CHAPTER 2
ASSISTANCE, FOCUS, AND PERFORMANCE, FY2000-2014
project is nine years. When taken together with its thinly spread engagement, the
weak momentum generated by the World Bank in many low-access countries
contrasts sharply with the scale and urgency of the SE4All universal access goal.

The focus on access for the poor is weak. The Bank Group sharpened its approach
to electricity access during the past 15 years. However, its strategic coverage of
affordability issues for electricity access for the poor, especially in low- and medium-
access countries is inadequate.

Bank Group performance in supporting electricity infrastructure is strong overall.
Development outcomes for electricity sector projects that closed or matured during
FY2000–2014 show a favorable record for the World Bank and IFC, and somewhat
lower performance for MIGA. When analyzed further, the Bank Group’s
performance is strong in providing electricity infrastructure (generation and T&D).
In particular, IFC, whose investments is predominantly in generation, shows strong
outcomes in this area, reflecting its depth of involvement and expertise.

The Bank Group’s involvement in non-conventional renewable energy projects
has been growing in recent years. But the performance of such projects trails that
of conventional generation, mainly due to still-evolving regulatory regimes. Bank
Group support for renewable off-grid electrification in the past 15 years was an
uneven and minor portion of electricity sector lending, though there are a few
outstanding projects in this area.

Knowledge products increased the information and analytical base for
policymaking, and some provided valuable linkages to project preparation. The
Bank Group made a major contribution to expanding knowledge about all aspects of
electricity access through its economic and sector work and with balanced coverage
of all Regions. It emphasized learning lessons, informing policymakers, and
applying knowledge to innovate and improve lending operations. Chapter 4
provides more detailed analysis of how specific knowledge products supported
project preparation and lending under sectorwide frameworks and processes.

World Bank performance in supporting sector institutional frameworks and
capacity building is notable, but policy reforms aimed at financial viability is
weak. The analysis of key performance indicators of policy reforms involving sector
planning and restructuring, regulations, and utility operations show notable
successes across the low- to universal-access countries. However, outcomes show
lower performance for financial viability compared with electricity infrastructure.
Low- and medium-access countries show distinctly poorer performance for financial
viability compared with high- and universal-access countries. Given the crucial role



                                                                                     43
                                                                                CHAPTER 2
                                          ASSISTANCE, FOCUS, AND PERFORMANCE, FY2000-2014
of financial viability in scaling up electricity access, the Bank’s performance in these
areas is discussed in more detail in chapter 3.

Monitoring and evaluation show weaknesses in all elements of design and
implementation. This weakness is more marked in low- and medium-access
countries, largely because of a lack of indicators, weak baseline data, and inadequate
capacity for monitoring. The shortcomings are highest regarding the tracking of
economic and welfare outcomes, including gender considerations, but there has
been greater recognition of this matter in the World Bank and recent improvements
in M&E frameworks in this regard. IFC has made a beginning in addressing these
issues.

6 One example is an IFC investment in the privatization of an electricity distribution in
MENA region. The project helped the company transition towards commercially-oriented
principles and eased the government’s budget constraints. Pre-privatization operational
risks relating to high technical losses, low capital expenditures and growing budget support
have been stemmed after privatization. The project also exceeded targets in terms of
delivery of electricity output, downstream access, employment, gender, technical loss

country’s power generation mix, making the country less vulnerable to droughts. The
project helped ease power shortages and rationing during a period of severe drought.
MIGA value-added was high particularly when it came to resolving disputes between the
government and the sponsor. With MIGA coverage and dispute resolution, the project
demonstrated that a geothermal independent power producer (IPP) can successfully operate
in a high risk political environment.

3. Supporting Sector Financial Viability and
   Affordable Access for the Poor
 Highlights
  The financial performance of the electricity sector in many country clients is weak, adversely
   affecting their ability to provide adequate and reliable electricity services, and to organize
   investments to expand access.
  The Bank Group, through its strategy documents and analytical work, has consistently and
   comprehensively raised issues and proposed strategies to improve the financial viability of
   countries’ electricity sectors.
  Overall, efforts to improve financial viability through development policy operations and
   components of investment projects have not yielded positive results. This points to the need for
   new approaches to address this issue, which is a major constraint for expanding electricity
   access.
  The Bank Group produced sound analytical work on affordability of electricity access for the
   poor, but this is not adequately reflected in its country strategy documents and project
   monitoring and evaluation frameworks.
  The Bank Group made some significant pilot contributions to addressing the affordability of
     electricity connections through project components and output-based assistance.


As discussed in chapter 2, the World Bank provided a range of support to country
clients in developing and reforming their electricity sector policy and institutional
frameworks, and improving capacity for sector planning and management. This
chapter examines the overall impact of the World Bank’s upstream work related to
policy and institutional frameworks and capacity and on the financial viability of
electricity sectors, which have impacts on the adequacy, reliability, and affordability
of electricity services.


Commercial Viability of Institutions and Financial Viability of the Electricity Sector
Maintaining the commercial viability of electricity utilities is essential for the
provision of adequate and reliable electricity services, regardless of whether the
service delivery agents are under public or private ownership. Commercial viability
entails the ability to generate sufficient income to meet operating payments and debt
commitments, and to allow for growth while also maintaining service standards.
Several Bank Group government clients regulate electricity services and set retail
tariffs below full cost recovery (operating costs and capital costs), citing concern


                                                                                                      49
                                                                                         CHAPTER 3
                          SUPPORTING SECTOR FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS FOR THE POOR
about the affordability of service for the poor. Inadequate revenues limit the ability
to make needed investments on a timely basis for access expansion (generation,
transmission, and distribution) and to support required operations maintenance. In
time, these factors lead to the progressive deterioration of service reliability and
performance efficiency, including technical and nontechnical losses, extended
service restoration times after outages, chronic power supply inadequacy from
insufficient generation capacity, and downgraded performance of existing
generation plants (box 3.1).


 Box 3.1. Financial Performance and Adequate and Reliable Services
 Poor financial performance of the electricity sector sets up a vicious cycle by causing
 deterioration in the reliability and quality of electricity services, which in turn negatively
 affects the sector’s finances. Undercapitalization and structural operating deficits caused
 by insufficient tariffs, lagging budget transfers, network losses, power theft, and poor bill
 collection perpetuate inefficiencies by preventing the sector from investing in required
 maintenance of aging assets and new capacity. The resulting impacts on the adequacy
 (persistent and widespread power shortages) and the quality and reliability of electricity
 supply (frequent and long-duration service interruptions) prevent consumers of all
 categories from realizing the potential welfare and economic gains from electricity use.
 Considerable country-based evidence points to the adverse impact of poor financial
 performance on broader access outcomes. For instance, the link between lack of financial
 viability and available electricity supply from existing infrastructure is evident in
 Senegal’s recent experience. Financial losses for Senelec, the country’s national utility,
 increased by a factor of 14 between 2004 and 2010 because of delays in needed generation
 investments, poor operational efficiency, and fuel supply difficulties, and undelivered
 energy jumped by a factor of 12.5 during the same period.

In many countries where the Bank Group operates, the financial condition of the
electricity sector remained weak for years. In a sample of 40 countries covering all

CHAPTER 3
SUPPORTING SECTOR FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS FOR THE POOR
regions and levels of income and electricity access, three-fourths of the national or
leading power utilities reported net financial losses (net income after taxes) in 2013.
For low- and medium-access countries (16 of the 22 in the sample were in Sub-
Saharan Africa), 82 percent of utilities reported net losses; in high- and universal-
access countries, 67 percent of utilities had losses. Thus, financial distress is spread
across all categories of countries (table 3.1; appendix L). Sector finances in some
countries (Bangladesh, India, Senegal, and Vietnam) deteriorated in recent years—in
some cases rather sharply. The Bank Group provided substantial policy and
institutional support to these countries through investment projects and
development policy lending.

Support for Improving Sector Financial Viability
The World Bank’s support for improving the overall financial viability of client
electricity sectors comes through two channels: development policy operations
(DPOs) and financial management components in investment loans, sometimes
accompanied by financial covenants. The Bank deployed DPOs mainly in medium-,
high-, and universal-access countries, and to a far less extent in low-access countries.

The use of financial covenants in investment lending is generally restricted to utility
performance, such as payment collection, reduction of commercial losses (metering,
for example), and cost rationalization. Covenants such as tariff-setting for
addressing policy issues, though once prevalent, are less frequently used now.




                                                                                                              51
                                                                                  CHAPTER 3
                   SUPPORTING SECTOR FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS FOR THE POOR
Development policy operations provide quick-disbursing budget support to
governments for achieving specific policy and institutional reforms—typically
drawn from the government’s reform program—that are considered critical to
achieving sustainable improvements in the sector’s financial performance. All DPOs
require prior actions, which are reform measures to be fulfilled by the government
before the operation is cleared and the funds disbursed. Prior actions in support of
electricity access tend to focus on the adoption of cost-recovery tariffs, payment
collection, and reduction of commercial losses (such as metering), cost
rationalization, and government subsidy transfers. DPOs are either freestanding
operations, a series of freestanding but independent operations, or programmatic
series. In contrast to a freestanding series, DPOs in a programmatic series are linked
by flexible indicative actions or triggers to respond to the country’s circumstances.
In most DPOs, financial viability or sustainability of the electricity sector (or national
utility) was explicitly included as a development objective, but almost all DPOs
contained key performance indicators related to sector financial performance. 1


World Bank Effectiveness in Improving the Commercial Performance of Service
Providers and Overall Financial Viability of Electricity Sectors
The World Bank’s efforts at improving the commercial performance of service
providers and the overall financial viability of the client electricity sectors during the
past 15 years did not measured up to expectations. Among the sample of case study
countries, the experience of financial components and covenants in investment
operations was positive in Kazakhstan, but was not encouraging in Senegal and
Vietnam.

The Kazakhstan Electricity Transmission Project and a series of follow-on projects
helped the national utility reverse a pattern of losses in the late 1990s and display
financial viability from 2002 to 2012. 2 Policy and technical assistance components in
these projects promoted cost recovery for its services, including setting a cost-
reflective transmission tariff, eliminating administratively imposed tariff discounts,
improving payment collections, reducing accounts receivable, and divesting non-
core businesses. Meanwhile, Senegal’s Electricity Sector Efficiency Enhancement
Project, with provisions for a new electricity tariff mechanism and a series of
financial covenants (including debt service coverage, return on assets, and accounts
receivable) could not prevent a serious deterioration of Senelec’s finances (IEG,
2013). In retrospect, the covenants were not sufficiently elaborated during project
preparation, and the government lacked an overall strategy to address the sector’s
deep-seated structural problems related to tariffs and budget transfers and long-
term investment decisions, particularly for generation. Similarly, a long series of


52
CHAPTER 3
SUPPORTING SECTOR FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS FOR THE POOR
Bank-supported investment projects in Vietnam that included time-bound measures
related to tariffs and financial performance did not make headway in these matters
because of excessive political implementation risks (IEG, 2014c).

Interviews and discussions with the Energy and Extractives Global Practice staff
suggest that financial covenants and policy activities operate on different time lines
and with different stakeholders, making it difficult to seamlessly combine the
actions required under investment projects and DPOs. With investment loans, the
point of maximum leverage on reform-related issues occurs before Board
presentation and quickly dissipates as attention is focused on the physical
investment portion of the project.

The Bank Group funded 25 DPOs in 13 countries during FY2000–2014 that
addressed the electricity sector alone or in combination with other sectors. 3 These
DPOs represented total commitments of $6.6 billion, of which $5 billion was for
actions related to the electricity sector. A list of DPOs and their ratings is in
appendix M. Most of the DPOs were in high- and universal-access countries. Only
three DPOs were in low-access countries, accounting for $87 million in commitments
for the electricity sector. Seventeen of the DPOs belonged to programmatic series of
two or more operations, and the rest were one-off interventions. Reforms related to
transparency, governance, and accountability also became more common than in the
past. For example, the Bangladesh Power Sector Development Credit supported
enhanced governance and accountability in addition to more typical measures such
as tariff adjustment, payment collection, and budgetary transfers to the national
utility (table 3.2).

Seventeen of the 25 DPOs were rated. Of the 17 DPOs in 10 countries, nine had
overall outcome ratings of moderately satisfactory or better, and the remaining
seven were rated moderately unsatisfactory or worse. No DPOs were in a low-access
country. Only four of the 17 projects had a low or moderate rating for risk to
development outcome. Overall, medium-access countries had a better proportion of
favorable outcome and risk ratings (table 3.3).

The focus of DPOs on improving the financial performance of electricity sectors was
appropriate and in line with the Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) and Country
Partnership Strategies (CPSs), but despite these efforts, few country clients showed
improvements in sector finances. The relatively poor performance of electricity
sector DPOs (only 50 percent were rated moderately satisfactory or above) contrasts
with the generally good performance of all DPOs (81 percent were rated moderately
satisfactory or above, with large variations across the regions) based on Operations
Policy and Country Services findings (World Bank 2004) and IEG’s review of DPOs
as part of this study. The World Bank’s own findings and guidance note on DPOs
note the critical importance and fragility of country ownership of reforms; they also
note the role of the Bank in building and sustaining such ownership through
continuous policy dialogue, policy notes, and analytic and advisory activities
(among others), and through ensuring that program design is simple, can be
monitored, and directly complements governments’ own reforms (World Bank
2004). DPOs pose higher risks of achieving development results in the electricity
sector than in other sectors—only four of 17 DPOs had low or moderate risk to
development outcome, and hence warrant particular care in design and
implementation.

Most of the DPOs reviewed by this evaluation experienced delays or only partially
fulfilled reform commitments. The DPOs that yielded the most notable results in the
past 15 years were in Turkey and Brazil, both middle-income countries with
universal access. On average, the performance of DPOs in low- and medium-access

CHAPTER 3
SUPPORTING SECTOR FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS FOR THE POOR
and low-income and lower-middle-income countries is unimpressive, especially
regarding key performance indicators that directly relate to electricity sector
financial issues.

Shifting political commitment to reforms involving financial stabilization and
recovery objectives was evident in Bangladesh, the Dominican Republic, and
Senegal. This commitment is often fragile and can be eroded by new elections,
changes in government, macroeconomic crises and external shocks, or an abating
sense of urgency after a severe crisis was weathered, and after having acquired
sizable financial support from the Bank. The value of political commitment was
clearly shown in Turkey and Brazil, but note that the strength and diversity of their
economies helped to maintain that commitment.

As illustrated by the experiences of Bangladesh and Senegal, the longstanding
nature of electricity sector financial viability issues in many countries and their lack
of financial and technical resources point to the need for continuous Bank Group
engagement to help countries put their sector finances in order and put them on the
road to adequate, reliable, and affordable electricity access. In the best of cases,
where government commitment and follow-through is demonstrated, it takes five to
10 years for sector reforms to take hold.

Experience suggests that reform covered by one-off DPOs should be designed to be
complementary with other Bank operations, whether through investment lending or
technical assistance. For instance, in the Dominican Republic, the freestanding sector
DPO should have been accompanied or preceded by parallel investment operations
by the Bank (or other development agencies) to address the high risks stemming
from the poor technical condition of the power infrastructure and overdependence
on high-priced imported oil for electricity generation.

Programmatic DPOs, by contrast, displayed flexibility. A programmatic approach is
especially useful when the government’s medium- and long-term reform direction is
clear, but the timing and details of implementation need to be flexible.
Programmatic DPOs generally fared better than multi-tranche operations (all the
programmatic DPOs received moderately satisfactory IEG-validated outcome
ratings as in Bangladesh, Ghana, Tonga, and Turkey). Multi-tranche operations are
prone to noncompliance with agreed actions and loan cancellations, as in Senegal.
They are considered more rigid since the tranche release conditions are
predetermined and require waivers from the Bank if the conditions are not fully
met.

                   SUPPORTING SECTOR FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS FOR THE POOR
The Bank’s large lending volumes in Turkey and Brazil (in support of complex
reforms involving large retail tariff adjustments) provided a strong incentive for the
government to comply with all major policy conditions. However, in the Dominican
Republic, the sector DPO provided support that was too inadequate to motivate the
government or defray the costs of reform. In Senegal, the heavy front-loading of
fund disbursement while back-loading the restructuring conditions greatly reduced
the government’s incentives to meet the tough second-tranche release conditions.


Affordable Access for Inclusive Development and Shared Prosperity
The need to recover operating costs and financing costs for capital expenditures to
ensure financial viability of the electricity sector competes with the need to keep
electricity access and consumption affordable for the poor. High costs for connection
and service can discourage low-income households from gaining access to electricity
even if they are within reach of the distribution network. Common practices for
subsidizing connection costs include partial or complete subsidy, delayed monthly
payment for a long period, treating connection costs as capital costs, or a
combination of these approaches (World Bank 2010a). The World Bank usually
supported such subsidy schemes where governments administer them with their
own funds; direct use of Bank funds has been limited and generally involves
arrangements where governments use IDA funds for grants to utilities to cover
capital costs associated with distribution, metering, and connection to poor
households. Recently, output-based aid (OBA) approaches aim to combine these
schemes with pre-agreed targets for performance-based subsidy (World Bank
2010a), and the Bank embraced such pilot projects in several poor countries.
Regarding monthly payments for consumption, these are found to be less of an
obstacle because the costs of alternatives, such as kerosene or batteries, are
comparable to most grid-supplied electricity tariffs for small consumers
(Golumbeanu and Barnes 2013).

Among the 35 case study countries examined by this evaluation (appendix C), the
World Bank discussed affordability of electricity in 19 CASs/CPSs during FY2000–
2014, which include 10 of the 18 low- and medium-access countries and nine of the
16 medium- and universal-access countries in the sample. Of the countries that
raised affordability matters, seven low- and medium-access and all of the high- and
universal-access countries also proposed specific strategies or actions for addressing
them. However, the discussions of affordability focused more on consumption
aspects instead of connection cost issues, with only five strategies referring to them
(including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, and Lao PDR). Also, the
World Bank actively partnered with the Global Partnership on Output-based Aid


56
CHAPTER 3
SUPPORTING SECTOR FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS FOR THE POOR
(GPOBA) to support and undertake pilot projects in eight countries (seven of which
are low- and medium-access countries).

Although the Bank Group devoted considerable effort to identifying, analyzing, and
following up on issues of affordability and inclusion in the countries where it
operates, more effort is needed to cover all countries, since many still require
support for paying the connection costs, even in some universal-access countries.
Illustrative experiences and findings from the World Bank’s interventions to address
connection cost affordability are discussed in the next sections.

In Vietnam, the costs of providing electricity to communities (extending power
networks at medium and low voltages) was shared by local, regional, and national
governments. An effective partnership between the national state utility (Electricity
of Vietnam) and local operators and communities, as along with multiple funding
sources (customers’ contributions; community funding; district, province, and
central government budgets; international donors; and others) helped increase rural
households’ access to electricity from about 60 percent in 1995 to 94.5 percent in 2008
(IEG 2014f). This is a different institutional arrangement than is found in most Sub-
Saharan African countries, where funding for electricity expansion is mainly
provided through government-sponsored projects to national power companies. The
Bank Group contributed to this effort with its continuous engagement in Vietnam’s
electricity sector during the period.


 Box 3.2. Connection Costs and Electricity Access: An Issue of Shared Prosperity
 High connection costs and electricity tariffs can discourage low-income households from
 gaining access to electricity. In practice, monthly payments for consumption are less of an
 obstacle because the costs of alternatives, such as kerosene oil, candles, and batteries, are
 comparable to most grid-supplied electricity tariffs for small consumers. However,
 connection charges—depending on the extent and period in which they are recovered—
 can deter poor households from obtaining available service, and can have a dramatic
 dampening effect on electrification rates. This is a key issue for the Bank Group’s goal of
 shared prosperity, given the linkages between electricity access and poverty and welfare.
 For a grid connection, the costs include the house wiring and utility charges. The grid
 connection charges for small residential consumers vary considerably across countries—
 from modest (often subsidized) sums of $10–20 to $200 or more in some countries, as
 shown in the figure B3.2.1. To obtain service in many cases, the consumer is expected to
 reimburse the utility for the entire 20- or 30-year capital cost of an electricity service that
 often was designed not for subsistence consumers, but for users of larger amounts of
 electricity.

In Lao PDR, the Bank Group supported the Power to the People program, which
successfully targeted poor rural households (box 3.3) through a combination of
appropriate connection subsidy and extended repayment.


 Box 3.3. Lao PDR’s Power to the People Program for Poor Rural Households
 The Power to the Poor (P2P) program, implemented by the Lao PDR national utility
 Electricité du Laos together with the Ministry of Energy and Mines, subsidizes
 connections and finances indoor wiring for poor rural households. The program,
 supported by the World Bank’s Rural Electrification Adjustable Program Loan (P075531),
 uses participatory methods and targets poor, female-headed households. Eligible
 households receive a basic low-voltage connection that is sufficient for two light bulbs
 and a small electrical appliance, such as a radio. Households make an average upfront
 payment of about $24 and can obtain an interest-free credit of up to $87 to cover the costs
 of installation and indoor wiring. The credit is paid back over three years in installments
 of about $2.50 as part of the household’s monthly electricity bill. Both the repayment of
 the interest-free credit and electricity consumption are at the same level as their
 expenditures for vastly inferior traditional energy substitutes (such as batteries, diesel
 lamps, and candles). In the villages where P2P was implemented, it helped more than 90
 percent of the vulnerable and disadvantaged families connect to the grid, which is 20 to
 40 percent of the total number of families in the villages. Strong government commitment
 to the welfare of its people and the high motivation of the national utility’s staff for
 implementation were crucial to the success of the program and the fast expansion of
 access to grid-supplied electricity in the country.

SUPPORTING SECTOR FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS FOR THE POOR
In Rwanda, capital subsidy policy combined with low-cost electrification
technologies and improved procurement practices contributed to significant access
results. Lower costs combined with a capital subsidy allowed the number of
connected households to double in the targeted urban and peri-urban areas during
the period 2010–2011 (World Bank 2013e).

In Zambia, the power utility benefits from a World Bank project to reduce
connection charges. 4 Under the project, a government subsidy of about $120 covers
75 percent of the cost of a basic household connection. The utility receives the
subsidy in the form of materials and equipment to be used to connect a certain
number of low-income households. In the initiative’s pilot areas, the number of
households requesting a connection doubled from the previous volume of requests.

Output-based Aid Approach with GPOBA
This evaluation reviewed the experience of GPOBA, whose objective is to promote
access to basic services, including energy, for the poor through the application of a
specific OBA model for provision of targeted subsidies. IEG identified nine
electricity projects piloted by GPOBA, which mostly built on existing IDA
operations. These were mostly in low- and high-access countries—Bangladesh,
Bolivia, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Liberia, and Uganda—and targeted the poor
with connection subsidies that supported initial access instead of consumption. They
also provided financial incentives for utility companies to extend their services to
the poor. As pilots, the projects were relatively small, with four pilots under $5
million, three between $5 million and $10 million, and the remaining two between
$10 million and $15 million.

Projects in Bolivia and Bangladesh showed successful results, though there were
some issues with targeting the poor. In Bolivia, a project to increase electricity access
in remote rural areas through the partial subsidization of off-grid SHSs and solar
lanterns was well integrated with the government’s priorities and, despite a slow
start, exceeded its planned targets. A follow-up IDA project is expected to expand
the program and ensure continued support for the servicing and maintenance of
these systems (World Bank 2013c). A similar project in Bangladesh was also
successful. By taking advantage of the falling cost of solar panels and strong
consumer demand, the subsidy could be reduced over time and the program far
exceeded its original targets; it is now being sustained and expanded with a follow-
on IDA project (World Bank 2013b). Targeting was an issue, however; a GPOBA-
funded report found that about one-third of the households that purchased the
system tended to be the higher-income households in the villages where the solar

                                                                                  CHAPTER 3
                   SUPPORTING SECTOR FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS FOR THE POOR
systems were offered, which tended to be the more prosperous of the off-grid
villages in the country (Asaduzzaman and others 2013).

The project in Ghana aimed to enable the supply of solar panels to remote rural
areas by providing microcredit to households. The GPOBA pilot project design
provided insufficient incentives to motivate utilities and suppliers to prioritize poor
households; thus, the lack of access to working capital stalled the project. Since
GPOBA’s approach requires that suppliers be paid after work is completed and
certified, contractors lacking access to working capital found it hard to finance up-
front connection costs. The project began to progress only after a special effort by the
project team to engage local banks to provide credit to interested private companies.
Although the project eventually succeeded, the business model was sustainable
given the continuing lack of access to working capital and trade finance. In Ethiopia,
only about one-fifth of the targeted number of households were connected. Major
impediments included a two-year moratorium on new connections (in response to
electricity supply constraints) and a new government policy to limit its procurement
to local suppliers, which restricted the supply of electricity meters. Also, serious
local capacity limitations delayed compliance with GPOBA’s technical, safety, and
administrative requirements. Although the Bank Group provided assistance to help
the utility address these issues, no significant improvements could be observed
before the closing of the project (World Bank 2014c). The India-Mumbai Slum
Electrification project also had an unsatisfactory outcome. The project, which aimed
to replace illegal and unsafe connections with legal and safe ones, failed because
consumers were unwilling to pay for anything beyond basic electricity access,
including safety. In this case, the expectations of beneficiaries and project sponsors
were not aligned.

The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program and GPOBA also funded a
comprehensive overview and analysis of the financial and technical issues
associated with electricity connection charges, solidly grounded on data collected
from every utility in Africa. The analysis concluded with practical, actionable
strategies for lowering these costs and enhancing their affordability for the poor
(Golumbeanu and Barnes 2013).


Conclusions

The Bank’s efforts to address financial viability issues in country clients are
notable, but their effectiveness is poor. Countries did not sustain the initial reform
actions, and some even partly or fully reversed (as in Bangladesh and Senegal).
Financial viability issues are deeply rooted and structural, but the Bank’s efforts and



60
CHAPTER 3
SUPPORTING SECTOR FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS FOR THE POOR
instruments were inadequate in addressing the political economy aspects
surrounding the issues. At best, multi-tranche DPOs only helped delay the reversal
of the initial reforms.

Country ownership and commitment are key. This commitment is often fragile and
can be eroded by changes in government, macroeconomic crises and external
shocks, or an abating sense of urgency after a severe crisis was weathered, and after
the government availed itself of sizable financial support from the Bank. The value
of political commitment was clearly shown in Turkey and Brazil, but note that the
strength and diversity of their economies were clearly helpful to stay the course.

Continued Bank engagement tends to improve stakeholder awareness of financial
viability for expanding electricity access. The longstanding nature of financial
viability issues of the electricity sector in many countries and their lack of financial
and technical resources point to the importance of continuous Bank engagement to
help countries put their sector finances in order and put them on the road to
adequate, reliable, and affordable electricity access. In the best of cases, where
government commitment and follow-through is demonstrated, it takes five to 10
years for sector reforms to take hold.

The Bank produced sound analytical work and pilot interventions on
affordability as a barrier to new electricity connections. Affordability issues in the
electricity sector are covered in about two-thirds of the sample CAS/CPS documents
but, with a few exceptions, there is little focus specifically on connection costs. The
Bank Group supported the implementation of some well-designed pilot
interventions for ensuring affordability of connections in a targeted manner (Lao
PDR, Vietnam, and Zambia). However, there is no ready means of tracking the
performance of these schemes beyond the end of the projects. The pilot projects
implemented by GPOBA showed some positive results, but these instruments are
yet to be mainstreamed into Bank Group projects.

          4. Enhancing Country Approaches and
          Scaling Up Access
 Highlights
  In low-access countries, a quantum leap in the pace of new connections and in levels of
    investments will be necessary to reach the goal of universal access within the next 15 years.
  Successful country experiences in rapidly scaling up access suggest important driving factors:
   comprehensive planning of the national electricity access rollout; ensuring financial viability of
   the electricity sector; and addressing affordability, equity, and inclusion through targeting the
   poor.
  The Bank Group’s first sectorwide programs in the electricity sector, in Rwanda and Kenya, led
   to significant financing commitments from development partners, including the private sector,
   and show promising results.
  The Bank Group collaboration, including joint projects, in low- and medium-access countries is
   notable. But there is no evidence to verify the value added and cost and benefits to private
   sector clients.


This chapter begins by reviewing the rate at which country clients increased
electricity access in recent years. It then presents indicative estimates of the pace of
connections and resources needed by the countries for transmission and distribution
(T&D) and associated generation to achieve universal electricity access by 2030. This
is followed by an assessment of the Bank Group’s support for nationwide efforts to
expand access through coordinated grid and off-grid rollouts. It also assesses the
Bank Group’s knowledge and operational support for sector-level institutional
frameworks and processes for organizing, planning, financing, and implementing a
programmatic effort for achieving universal access targets. Finally, the chapter
reviews the internal synergy between the units of the Bank Group as a crucial
element in any future strategy in support of universal access. Taken together with
the findings of chapters 2 and 3, the evidence and analysis points to the need for a
paradigm shift in the Bank Group’s approach to scaling up connections in low-
access countries to make credible progress toward achieving the Sustainable Energy
for All (SE4All) goal, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.


The Challenge of Achieving Universal Access
The implementation rate of new electricity connections in country clients during
2000–2010 falls well short of what will be required to achieve universal access by
2030 (table 4.1). In particular, low-access countries added 2 million connections per

year during the period, and will need to raise this rate at least sevenfold and
maintain it for the next 15 years to achieve the SE4All goal by 2030.

Medium- and high- access countries are likely to come close to universal access by
2030. For medium-access countries, the annual rate of new connections will need to
rise from 6.2 million to 6.7 million, and high-access countries will need 3.1 million to
3.2 million; these rates would need to be maintained for the next 15 years. The Bank
Group will continue to have a significant supporting role in this effort, particularly
in addressing growing adequacy and reliability issues in medium-, high-, and
universal-access countries.

Table 4.2 underscores the daunting investment financing gap for achieving
adequate, reliable, and affordable universal electricity access in low-access countries
by 2030. The incremental investment required in low-access countries for access
scale-up—T&D extensions and generation capacity required to serve the demand
from the new connections—is estimated to be about $17.1 billion per year, which
includes $11.9 billion for T&D and $5.2 billion for generation (table 4.2). 1 By
comparison, during 2000–2014, the average annual investment financing was about
$3.6 billion from principal sources (multilateral banks and donors, together with
government counterpart funding and private sector investments), including $1.5
billion per year from the Bank Group (table 4.2). Note that these estimated
requirements are in addition to the investments required for refurbishing existing
electricity infrastructure, which is generally in poor condition in low-access
countries. Adding generation capacity to meet current suppressed demand and
keeping up with demand from projected economic growth will cost an estimated
$20 billion per year for several years in low-income (and largely low-access)
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa alone (Foster and Briceño-Garmendia 2011).

countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to achieve universal access by 2030 is about $17
billion, and to satisfactorily address power supply inadequacy and shortfalls
experienced in many countries and to meet projected demand from economic
growth would be about $37 billion per year, of which $12 billion is for T&D and $25
billion is for generation.

The preceding analysis of resource needs for universal access for low-access
countries uses indicative estimates that are not intended to be precise, but instead
indicate the order of magnitude of the additional resources that will be needed for
this effort. A main implication from this analysis is that the immense gaps in
investment financing under the SE4All targets cannot be met without large-scale
private sector involvement, especially in investments for generation capacity to meet
new and suppressed demand, ensuring power supply adequacy and reliability to
acceptable standards of practice and powering electricity demands from economic
growth. Simply continuing the Bank Group’s practice of mobilizing resources on a
project-by-project or transaction-by-transaction basis cannot be expected to be
transformative by itself. On average, for every $1.00 of the Bank Group’s own


64
CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
commitments to the electricity sector in the past 15 years, Bank Group projects
mobilized an estimated $1.30 from government counterpart funds, co-financers, and
co-investors (table 4.3). This ratio is even lower for low-access countries, at $0.80 for
every $1.00 of Bank Group commitments. Given competing demands from other
sectors, it is unlikely that the Bank can increase its contribution or counterpart
funding to the electricity sector by an order of magnitude that can make a significant
dent in the resource gap facing low-access countries that want to achieve universal
access.

The preceding analysis points to the need for mainstreaming radically new and
different approaches to complement existing practice that would help syndicate
investments on a larger scale than is possible through the current project-by-project
approach. The syndication efforts would need to be differentiated for T&D, which
remains largely in the domain of the public sector, and for generation, where the
private sector has and must have a far larger role. Recent and ongoing World Bank
experience with sectorwide frameworks and processes that aim to do this are
assessed later in this chapter.


Bank Group–Supported Good Practices for Scaling up Access
Against the background of the preceding discussion, this section highlights the
Bank’s experience in advancing good practice in selected national country programs
toward universal access—grid and off-grid—and their implications for low-access
countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Figure 4.1 shows the steep gradients of access implementation for four countries
over time. Indonesia (Gencer and others 2011), Lao PDR (World Bank 2012b), and


                                                                                                              65

                                                                ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
Vietnam (Gencer and others 2011) scaled up from low access levels to connecting the
vast majority of their populations to electricity within two decades. Today,
electricity access levels are at 80 percent in Indonesia, 83 percent in Lao PDR, and 96
percent in Vietnam, compared to 53 percent in 2000, 6 percent in 1995, and 5.5
percent in 1980, respectively. All these countries achieved this access level despite
starting with low gross domestic product per capita, comparable to or even lower
than that of several low- and medium-access countries in Sub-Saharan Africa today
(figure 4.1). With the Bank Group’s ongoing support, Bangladesh achieved a
remarkable expansion of off-grid SHS, which quickly brought basic electricity
services to nearly 10 million people over the last decade, and is filling the void left
by the stalled grid expansion and generation shortages in the country.

In all cases, the governments owned the access effort and incorporated it in their
growth strategies. Indonesia’s national utility, PLN (Perusahaan Listrik Negara),
historically achieved about 2 million grid connections per year; in recent years it
ramped up connections with government support and financing to well over 3 million
per year, most of which are in rural areas scattered across the country’s 3,000-mile-
long archipelago of several thousand islands. Lao PDR integrated its national
electrification in a broader strategy of national development. The government set
specific targets for electricity access—70 percent by 2010 (which was exceeded) and 90
percent by 2020—to be achieved through aggressive grid extension complemented by
off-grid electrification where cost-effective. In Vietnam in the 1990s, about half of the
rural communes and less than 15 percent of rural households had access to electricity.
In response, the government made rural electrification a component of its



66
CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
development strategy to provide households with lighting and improved health care,
education, and economic opportunities.

Vietnam and Lao PDR both had to overcome weak institutional arrangements. In
Vietnam, almost 90 percent of rural electricity distribution was carried out by
commune-level electricity groups—supported by the national utility, Electricity of
Vietnam (EVN) —that had no legal status, minimal technical competence, and little
financing. Regulation of the power sector was grossly inadequate, lacking an
effective legal and regulatory framework and technical standards for rural
electrification. The government formulated a phased long-term electrification plan
that during the initial years focused on physically connecting rural communes
rapidly, and it attracted broad local participation. Starting in the mid-2000s, a second
and ongoing phase of the plan focused on improving efficiency and reliability of
electricity supply through more efficient technical operation. In Lao PDR, the
national electricity utility EDL (Electricité du Laos) was held accountable for annual
targets for grid-based access expansion. The government, meanwhile, followed up
with the policy and financial commitments necessary to manage the balance
between ensuring affordability of electricity connections to the vast majority of the
population while remaining sensitive to the need to strengthen EDL’s financial
health and sustainability to deliver the grid extension program on time.

For Lao PDR, hydropower export revenues helped finance the startup and the early
stage growth of the national electrification program. Visionary and opportunistic
developments of hydro projects were pursued during the late 1970s and early 1980s.
These projects were driven by export sales to nearby Thailand markets, coupled with
negotiated arrangements for power buyback or exchange arrangements, where
feasible, for electrification of border areas. The revenues from these projects enabled
financing of the early hydro projects, and financing the national power expansion and
connections program. Starting in the late 1980s, government reforms encouraged the
participation of independent private power providers (export hydro IPPs) and led to
the significant private investment underlying installed power capacity today, with
several more projects in the pipeline.

Vietnam and Lao PDR created a common sector-level platform by planning and
phasing access expansion while providing stable sector policies and regulation. The
platform was led by their governments and anchored by a national electrification
rollout plan aligned to national priorities and targets. It was designed to orchestrate
systematic expansion of access through a sustained program supported by donors
who financed large-scale access improvement instead of using a door-to-door, project-
by-project mode of sector investments. The Bank Group’s support for Vietnam’s
electrification spanned nearly two decades from 1995, providing about $3.3 billion in


                                                                                     67

investment lending to support $4.1 billion in projects that built and rehabilitated T&D
networks together with other lenders, including the Asian Development Bank and the
Japan International Cooperation Agency. The Bank has also provided $700 million
through a series of three development policy operations (DPOs). In Lao PDR, the
government’s approach led to strong, longstanding donor engagement and support—
finance for the national electrification program investment and knowledge to help the
government implement sector reforms, strengthen institutions, and improve sector
performance and efficiency. The major grid extension projects sponsored by
multilateral institutions during 1987–2009 provided an estimated $450 million, of
which about $400 million was for grid investment, $5 million for off-grid investment,
and about $25 million for institution building. Given the limited IDA allocations, the
World Bank’s role was important for mobilizing resources from the Global
Environment Facility, Norway, and Australia for rural electrification, and from
various trust funds for project preparation.


Bank Group Experience with Off-Grid Expansion
The Bank Group portfolio during the past 15 years displays a range of off-grid
electrification experience—in technical delivery modalities and standards, and
context-specific institutional frameworks. Notable among these are instances where
off-grid provision, particularly deploying solar home systems (SHSs), proved to be
commercially viable on a freestanding basis and rapidly scalable in a sustainable
manner. These experiences span pre-electrification in grid-proximate areas, regions
that are permanently off-grid because of remoteness or difficult accessibility, and in
portable cash-and-carry retail solar products for lighting and charging cell phones
(box 4.1). The following assessment of various Bank experiences in off-grid
electrification shows scope for replication as appropriate in different country or sub-
regional contexts. The experience with geospatial planning models that enable the
coordinated growth (with the grid expansion) of off-grid electrification is covered in
the discussion on sectorwide frameworks and approaches to electrification.


 Box 4.1. Off-Grid Electrification in a Nationwide Least-Cost Electrification Strategy
 Off-grid electrification that is well coordinated with grid-based electrification is an
 essential part of a nationwide least-cost electrification strategy (World Bank 2011a).
 Experience backed by technical and economic analysis shows that in most country
 contexts, conventional grid extension is generally the most cost-effective means of
 electrification for most populations in light of the geospatial settlement patterns and
 density.




68
CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
 However, the unit marginal costs of grid extensions inevitably increase as the grid
 spreads further out and extends its reach into less populous and more distant areas with
 lower settlement density and typically lower demand. These costs eventually surpass the
 unit costs of decentralized delivery modalities such as a mini- or micro-grid (an isolated
 small generation unit feeding a local network in a compact footprint) and individual units
 such as solar home systems (SHSs). Increasingly, with the continuing and significant
 declines in unit costs of some new technologies (especially solar panels) coupled with
 increasing penetration of mobile banking services, off-grid options such as SHSs offer a
 fast and cost-effective alternative for meeting high-valued electricity needs.
 Outside of grid extensions and coordinated off-grid access scale-up efforts, the fast-
 growing markets are in filling the gaps in demand for modern energy services, which
 includes retail, off-the-shelf portable solar charging and lighting products that replace
 candles, kerosene, or flashlights. These are a major improvement in both the quality of
 services and costs until the user can get access to an SHS, a mini- or micro-grid, or the
 main grid. Off-grid solutions provide a critical and transformative first step with basic
 energy services such as lighting, mobile phone charging, fans, and television. Instead of
 waiting for all energy needs and the full range of electricity services to be met at once
 through grid extension, off-grid interventions help get populations on the energy ladder
 on a time scale that accelerates impact: days and months, not the years and decades they
 often must wait for centralized power plants and grid extension.


IEG identified and reviewed 47 World Bank projects (20 of which are active)
approved since FY2000 that focused on or included off-grid components. These were
implemented in 33 countries (15 low access, 5 medium, 9 high, and 4 universal). The
list of these projects and financing amounts is in appendix G. Across this set of
projects, the World Bank supported several business models and institutional
frameworks for off-grid electrification, principally the vendor model and the
concession model for SHS. The vendor model, initially tried in Sri Lanka with SHSs,
was adopted on a far larger scale in Bangladesh and was tailored to the sector
context there. The concession model was used with good results in the electrification
of remote and hilly regions of Argentina and Peru. Although the focus in this section
is on learning from successful off-grid experiences supported by the Bank Group, as
discussed in chapter 2, the Bank Group’s less successful experiences in other
countries are also reviewed.

WORLD BANK EXPERIENCE WITH SUPPORT FOR PRE-ELECTRIFICATION
Sri Lanka’s Bank Group–supported Renewable Energy for Rural Economic
Development program was a proving ground for the vendor model of private sector–
led off-grid renewable energy development (IEG 2014d). The program was initially
hosted in the public sector Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon with a
number of credit institutions and private solar vendors participating in the market,
selling about 13,000 SHSs per year at the peak of the program. However, with the


                                                                                             69
                                                                                  CHAPTER 4
                                         ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
faster-than-expected expansion of the electricity grid in Sri Lanka, demand for SHSs
declined, though there is still scope and interest in SHS expansion in some regions of
the country.

The vendor model got much more traction in Bangladesh in the past decade through
the Bank’s Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development Project
(RERED), even though the impetus for this was largely from the stalled main grid
extensions and connections rollout program exacerbated by a severe shortfall in
electricity generation in the country in the past decade. The Bangladesh off-grid
experience is exemplary in many respects, including the attention paid to
institutional arrangements, private participation, quality control, maintenance
arrangements, and financial provisions to make the SHSs affordable to the
beneficiaries. Bangladesh’s rapidly scalable off-grid access expansion can be viewed
as pre-electrification, a second-best solution for areas that otherwise could be
covered cost-effectively by centralized grids. The Bangladesh experience, described
in box 4.2, holds promise for low-access countries, especially those in Sub-Saharan
Africa where the main grid sector institutional frameworks and other conditions
have not advanced sufficiently to undertake a systematic grid extension rollout with
matching generation capabilities.

Bangladesh’s vendor-based program built upon a first generation effort by the
Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board using a fee-for-service approach to deploy
SHSs. The scheme did not fare well since it was not cost-effective for the board (and
the associated rural electric cooperatives) to undertake bill collection or perform
maintenance in dispersed locations. A lack of user ownership of the SHS asset
resulted in neglect and even abuse of the installed systems. Additionally, out of seven
mini-grids originally planned in the project (accounting for less than 1 percent of the
RERED project cost), only three were attempted, of which only one remains in
operation. In this case, the lack of a clear regulatory framework for remunerative
tariffs and compensation for stranded assets appears to have deterred investors (IEG
2014d). These experiences, when contrasted with the vendor model employed by
Infrastructure Development Company Limited, highlight the importance of
appropriate institutional and financial arrangements, program design, and incentives
for all stakeholders to make off-grid electrification a viable proposition.


 Box 4.2. Bangladesh’s Experience in Off-Grid Pre-Electrification
 Bangladesh’s 2002–2013 Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development
 (RERED) Project, supported by the World Bank, notably contributed to social and
 economic outcomes in rural areas by extending access to electricity through off-grid SHSs,
 supplementing the extension of the electricity grid. The project and its ongoing successor,
 RERED II, helped install SHSs on a scale that far exceeded original targets, topping about

CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
 2 million by end of 2014, when grid expansion was slowing. The country installed about
 100,000 SHSs a month in 2014.
 This off-grid experience demonstrated the potential scale and speed at which off-grid
 facilities can bring connectivity to households. In a relatively short time, an SHS can bring
 electricity to a household in a rural or remote area that would otherwise have to wait
 years for the grid to reach it with the promise of more comprehensive services.
 The program was managed by Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL), a
 semi-governmental infrastructure finance organization, which worked through
 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and demonstrated the feasibility of having
 beneficiaries pay for a substantial portion of the SHS asset in affordable installments. The
 program started with five NGO partners with an initial target of installing 50,000 SHSs.
 By the end of 2014, 49 partner organizations were installing SHSs under a competitive
 business model. IDCOL also helped mentor and develop the partner organizations.
 IDCOL’s solar program effectively managed its after-sales network through its partner
 organizations. To ensure quality standards, the commercial participating organizations—
 NGOs, microfinance institutions, and private sector institutions—purchase solar panels,
 batteries, and other components approved by a technical standards committee. Vendors
 submit required documents, warranties, and product-testing certificates to the committee
 for examination and approval. Once the products are approved, the participating
 organizations can buy them directly from the vendor and set up their own terms of
 purchase and payment. The participating organizations arrange for user training in
 operations and maintenance, regular after-sale services, and timely handling of customer
 complaints. IDCOL routinely inspects the installed systems and shares its findings with
 the participating organizations.

SUPPORT FOR REMOTE-AREA ELECTRIFICATION
Bank Group projects also provided some countries with support to bring off-grid
electricity to sparsely populated, remote, or mountainous areas that are unlikely to
be covered by the conventional grid. Of particular interest is the concession model
employed in the outlying areas of Peru and Argentina—countries with high
electricity access. 2

Argentina’s Renewable Energy in Rural Markets Project (1999–2012) supported an
early fee-for-service concession model to supply electricity to remote areas. 3 The
model worked well given Argentina’s long experience with concessions in
traditional electricity markets. The project developed eight concessionaires that
installed off-grid facilities in nearly 30,000 households—mainly with SHS but also
with wind turbines and mini-grids—in addition to installing more than 2,000 SHSs
in schools, medical centers, and other public buildings (World Bank 2013a). The
relatively large unit size of the institutional installation and mandated installation


                                                                                             71
                                                                                   CHAPTER 4
                                          ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
(as opposed to individual households that may not opt to sign up) greatly increased
the attractiveness of the package to private sector bidders. Similarly, under Peru’s
Rural Electrification Project (2006–2013), electricity distribution companies installed
more than 100,000 SHSs in remote and isolated areas. 4 Though considerably lower
than the project’s goal of 160,000 connections, the target of increasing electricity
consumption for productive uses by 18,000 megawatt hours in the first five years
was exceeded by 1,107 megawatt hours. The Bank Group’s role was important in
supplementing the financing plan, particularly in supporting capital investments
and helping ensure transparency in awarding concessions.

In another example of providing off-grid solutions to thinly spread out (and in this
case distributed) herder populations, Mongolia’s Renewable Energy for Rural
Access Project enabled distribution and sales of nearly 70,000 SHSs, covering more
than 60 percent of the country’s herder population. 5

In Nicaragua, insufficient attention to commercial arrangements for selling surplus
power to the wholesale market during preparation and design of the Off-Grid Rural
Electrification project resulted in underperformance of small hydro facilities. 6 After
Lao PDR’s Southern Provinces Rural Electrification project, a survey revealed that
more than 80 percent of the 6,000 SHS were not working properly because of low
levels of maintenance. 7 In Mali’s Household Energy and Universal Access project,
there was weak community demand for stand-alone SHS because the products sold
were of low quality and capacity, and maintenance services were substandard. 8 This
contributed to the underachievement of project targets for SHS installations by a
substantial margin. There was little activity with isolated mini-grids in World Bank
projects. As previously noted, the planned mini-grids in the Bangladesh RERED
project did not get off the ground. In Vietnam’s System Efficiency Improvement,
Equitization, and Renewables Project, serious quality problems surfaced during
construction and rehabilitation of the mini-hydropower plants planned under a
small component, and their relevance was eventually overtaken by a faster-than-
expected advance of the grid.9 The search is still on for commercially viable and
scalable mini-grid network models, but there have been no significant results so far.

PRODUCTIVE USES OF OFF-GRID ELECTRICITY
The use of off-grid electrification is mostly dedicated to lighting, comfort,
entertainment, and communication. Combining off-grid projects with interventions
to promote local productive uses of electricity, as in the Peru case cited previously, is
expected to catalyze economic activity and improve incomes. The Mexico
Renewable Energy for Agriculture project demonstrated the considerable
developmental benefits of promoting productive uses of off-grid electricity by
addressing the lack of awareness and risk aversion of potential beneficiaries, and the



72
CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
lack of trained technicians and standardized specifications. 10 Survey results showed
that more than 2,300 farmers who did not have electricity connections previously
were provided with a reliable supply (through photovoltaic pumping systems) and
thus had refrigeration for milk and fish, which contributed to substantial increases
in the beneficiaries’ incomes. Under the Lao PDR Southern Provinces Electrification
Project, 81 households in Nonsal village reported a 50 percent increase in income
from the additional time spent on making handcrafts since SHS were installed. 11

SOLAR OFF-GRID LIGHTING PRODUCTS
The Lighting Africa program, a joint initiative of IFC and the World Bank, was
launched in September 2007 with the goal of catalyzing retail markets in Sub-Saharan
Africa for clean, modern, off-grid lighting and charging products (mainly portable
solar lamps, some with attachments for charging cellphones and radios). In IEG’s
assessment, the program is a relevant and innovative approach to meeting the needs
of targeted countries, and it made important contributions to the growth of the
Region’s market for private sector-supplied portable off-grid lighting products. The
main drivers of the program’s performance were its provision of quality certification
and testing infrastructure, and market intelligence. Its focus on unsubsidized market-
based approaches has considerable replication potential (box 4.3).

Lessons from the good practice country examples highlighted in the preceding
sections (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Lao PDR, and Vietnam), along with those from
other earlier, successful country programs and from cases when the World Bank
Group was not a major player (notably Brazil, Mexico, Thailand, and Tunisia) point
to certain primary drivers of success. These drivers are common across the
countries’ national electrification program records of achievement toward universal
electricity access, but not across the specific institutional models for their
achievements.


 Box 4.3. The Lighting Africa Program
 The Lighting Africa program supports the rapid scale-up and delivery of affordable,
 quality lighting products, mostly basic solar lanterns (Pico PV or a small PV-system with
 a power output of 1 to 10W) predominantly for household lighting. Against the backdrop
 of generally serious product quality difficulties in the region, Lighting Africa addresses
 quality assurance, market intelligence, business support, access to finance, consumer
 education, policy, and regulation to help participating governments create an enabling
 environment for off-grid lighting and integrating it into their national electrification
 plans.
 Lighting Africa implemented four IFC projects and five World Bank projects, with three
 IFC projects in the pipeline. Lighting Africa reports that it helped lighting products reach
 nearly 7 million people—an achievement far surpassing the program’s initial goal of 2.5
 million beneficiaries by 2012. To date, 49 products met or surpassed the program’s quality



                                                                                            73
                                                                                    CHAPTER 4
                                           ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
 and performance standards, with more than 1.3 million sold in 20 African countries. The
 Sub-Saharan African countries where quality-certified solar lanterns are sold increased
 from 5 to 10 in 2010, and to 20 in 2012, and the number of certified manufacturers grew
 from 6 to 25 in the same period. To put these achievements in perspective, the program
 has reached about 2.5 percent of its potential market in Africa.
 Although the full extent of the program’s contribution to the spread of solar lighting
 products cannot be established, a stakeholder survey attributed 30–60 percent of all
 quality solar lighting products to the program (in Kenya and Ghana, where the program
 was piloted). This suggests that the program’s impact is substantial.
 The experience of the Lighting Africa program led to programs in Bangladesh, India, and
 Papua New Guinea, with more programs being developed in Pakistan and Indonesia. The
 program is now part of the expanded Lighting Global program, which supports Lighting
 Africa, Lighting Asia, and Lighting Pacific, and which works along the supply chain of
 off-grid lighting products and systems to reduce market entry barriers and first-mover
 risks.

Countries’ electrification succeeded through a homegrown institutional structure
and framework of implementation and accountability considered appropriate for
their country contexts and circumstances, as revealed by country-specific reviews
undertaken by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and
other reports (World Bank 2011a). Most high-access achievers in Asia used their
national utilities and other public institutions as the main agents for scaling up
electricity access; by contrast, several Latin American nations relied on their
privatized utilities as primary agents (for example, Argentina, Brazil, and Peru). In
some instances, publicly owned distribution cooperatives had a major role in scaling
up access, notably in Bangladesh, Costa Rica, the Philippines, and Vietnam
(commune electrification councils). Furthermore, the lessons indicate that neither the
publicly owned entities nor private sector alone can marshal the capacity, financing,
quality, and policy needed to scale up access efficiently, effectively, and sustainably.
Another common feature across the good practice country programs is their use of
some form of targeted public subsidies—especially for the T&D investments—for
ensuring affordability of retail electricity tariffs and customer connection charges to
the poor.

The core organizing principles and strategic drivers of successful performance
common across the large and diverse spectrum of country contexts and experiences
described above—including differences in sector structures, regulatory frameworks,
and enabling policies—can be broadly stated as follows:

     •   Develop a least-cost, comprehensive national electrification rollout plan that
         is consistent with the national development vision and has government


74
CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
        ownership; uses an appropriate combination of grid and off-grid solutions
        that will enable economic growth and modernization; and that sets access
        targets that include household connections and connections for service
        delivery institutions (health and education), business and commerce, and
        other enterprises.
    •   Establish clearly delineated roles and accountability for sector performance
        and results to ensure efficient and effective management and operation of the
        sector.
    •   Ensure the ongoing commercial viability of the delivery agents during the
        program implementation period, while also ensuring customer affordability,
        especially for the poor.
    •   Promote equity, inclusion, and shared prosperity through a well-targeted
        rollout to ensure affordability of the service for the poor and disadvantaged
        across geography and time.
    •   Establish a consultative framework and process that is government-led and
        facilitates sustained engagement in the sector—recognizing the long-term
        programmatic nature of the implementation and financing challenge.
    •   Use a sectorwide organizing architecture guided by the principle of “many
        partners, one team, one plan,” and aim to rally the participation of designated
        sector agents and key stakeholders. This approach can also help to increase
        the degree of harmonization in donor participation.


Sectorwide Engagement for Nationwide Access Rollout
This section highlights notable experiences from Rwanda and Kenya, both low-
income countries that are implementing sectorwide programs to scale up national
access. A key driver of the positive and encouraging experience and results from
these programs was the government’s ownership, early commitment, and persistent
follow-through on the enabling actions established in Investment Financing
Prospectuses. Each program is anchored by a least-cost geospatial national
electrification rollout plan for grid and coordinated off-grid development for
universal access by 2030. Hence, the programs exemplify many of the principles
described in the preceding section. In both instances, the Bank is continuing to assist
the government.

The Bank supported the governments’ efforts to mainstream a framework for
sectorwide investment financing to syndicate sufficient financing to support
ongoing implementation of the program. An important point in this framework is
recognition that the overwhelming share of the investment financing—for sub-
transmission and distribution and for off-grid rollout—must come from other sector
agents and participants, not from the Bank’s sectorwide approach instrument of


                                                                                     75

                                                  ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
budget support. The Bank deployed a sector investment loan and a supplemental
operation to intermediate its own commitments, and most other donors use their
own instruments to provide their share of financing support of the access rollout
program.

The Bank’s engagements began in 2007 for Kenya and 2008 for Rwanda. The first
major step for each was preparation of a national geospatial access rollout plan that
combined geographic, demographic, and technical parameters to scale up access in a
least-cost and time-bound manner. The plan addressed equity and shared prosperity
considerations through policies for keeping connections charges affordable for the
poor; a substantial off-grid program gave priority to connecting public facilities
(schools, clinics, primary health centers, and administrative centers) so that
developmental impacts could be spread out even ahead of the progress on
household connections (box 4.4). The plans were funded by ESMAP as knowledge
products that would be translated into operations.


 Box 4.4. Rwanda Geospatial National Electrification Rollout Plan and Investment Financing
 Rwanda is among the first countries to prepare and implement a nationwide
 electrification program combining grid and off-grid means, based on a systematic and
 least-cost plan aided by geographic information system (GIS) mapping techniques that
 combine technical, economic, demographic, and demand and supply data. The rollout
 plan can be updated with new information and offers several advantages over traditional
 Electrification Master Plans, as follows:
     Figure B4.4.1. GIS Mapping for Electrification Rollout in Rwanda

     Note: GIS = geographic information system.
            Geospatial planning is easier to visualize for all stakeholders and can rally
             financial participation. As experienced in Rwanda and Kenya, the geospatial plan
             effectively anchored a “prospectus” for large and diverse groups of national and
             international stakeholders to coordinate and commit to an adequate and
             sustainable financing package.
            It speeds up wider developmental impact. The geospatial plan captures a national
             development perspective across all sectors (health, education, administrative

         centers) and all households (urban, peri-urban, rural, and deep rural) and is not
         restricted to a “rural electrification project here and there” planning framework.
         Geospatial planning helps identify the off-grid interventions that are best in each
         area.
        Modest cost and ability to make frequent updates make it a dynamic planning
         platform. The geospatial plans for Rwanda and Kenya each cost about $1 million
         and took one year to prepare. They better capture the ever-changing situation
         (growing grid extensions, changing demand and affordability, equipment costs) to
         inform the implementation process. By contrast, classic Electrification Master Plan
         studies take two to three years and more than $2 million to prepare, and are based
         on a static framework.

As part of the process, each country prepared a prospectus detailing the national
electrification rollout plan. The prospectus stated the governments’ commitments to
sector policies and regulations for ensuring the financial viability of the sector and
service providers. It also specified the financing requirements for each element of
the program—generation, T&D, off-grid facilities, and others—in a phased manner
for the next 15 years. These prospectuses were presented to donor groups in 2009 for
Rwanda and 2010 for Kenya. 12

The Rwanda and Kenya programs are similar in spirit to a compact and code-of-
engagement understanding entered into by donors at the outset. They do not
incorporate traditional tariffs or other such covenants, nor do they use explicit
trigger and tranche mechanisms like a DPO instrument. Instead, the Investment
Financing Prospectuses the government presented to donors to syndicate the
projected financing gap were prepared with the upfront understanding that the
bankability of the Prospectus would hinge, among other expectations, on retail
tariffs that would, at minimum, cover all open and all capital expenditures upstream
of sub-transmission required for grid supply.

Government commitment and ongoing involvement at the highest levels and from
the earliest stages was crucial for the preparation of a sectorwide framework and
process. The Rwanda and Kenya governments were involved throughout the design
and preparation of the national program and geospatial plan. The governments
drew up clear results frameworks and established monitoring and evaluation
accountability under the overall institutional setup. To maintain the financial
viability of the sector and ensure the commercial viability of the national utility,
public subsidy funds were targeted to financing the gap between revenues
recovered from retail tariffs set by the regulator, and revenues from affordable
connection charges to new customers; the sub-transmission and distribution
investment costs of grid rollout and all recurrent costs of the distribution operations
were also offset; in other words, all capital and operating expenses upstream of


                                                                                           77
                                                                             CHAPTER 4
                                    ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
primary distribution are recovered in the cost of bulk power supply coming into the
distribution network and all operational expenditures within the distribution system
up to the customer meter. The shortfall in the utility’s revenues from regulated
tariffs under this scheme were reimbursed to the utility as a grant or as a soft loan.

Based on its prospectus, Rwanda syndicated financing of $340 million for the first
five years with contributions from the Bank Group ($78 million), other multilaterals
and donors ($185 million), and the government and national electricity utility ($77
million). A review of Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility data (a
database that records private sector investments) shows that $158 million was
committed by the private sector for electricity projects in Rwanda during 2010–2011;
the amount for the previous 10-year period was a mere $1.6 million (tables 4.4 and
4.5). 13 Kenya’s prospectus helped raise $1.5 billion for 2009–2013 through a donor
financing roundtable. Also, private sector flows of $1.38 billion came into Kenya’s
electricity sector since 2009 (table 4.4). Project staff, task team leaders, and
stakeholders IEG interviewed in Kenya suggested that the private sector flows can
be at least partly attributed to the donor response to the country prospectuses.

From tables 4.4 and 4.5, it is clear that the total amount syndicated for electricity
access though the sectorwide programs is several times what might have been
possible using a project-by-project approach. Specifically, in Rwanda, $78 million in
Bank financing leveraged 4.5 times that amount from other public sector donors and
stimulated twice the Bank’s contribution from the private sector. The Bank Group’s
contribution directly or indirectly brought in $350 million from public sector or
public sector funding sources, and an additional $158 million from the private
sector, for an overall leverage of $6 for every dollar contributed by the Bank Group.
The rations are similar for Kenya. This contrasts sharply with the leverage
performance of the Bank Group (table 4.3) on a project-by-project basis.

The evidence available from the ongoing sectorwide programs shows impressive
growth in access during 2009–2014 from 6 percent to 15 percent in Rwanda, and
from 23 percent to 30 percent in Kenya (tables 4.6 and 4.7). Rwanda exceeded its
original electricity access targets for 2014 and revised its target from 12 percent to 25
percent for 2016. By 2016 Rwanda also aims for 80 percent coverage of schools and
universal coverage of administration centers, health centers, and hospitals (table
4.6). In 2003 the national utility, Kenya Power and Lighting Company, made 40,000
new grid connections per year, corresponding to less than 0.5 percent of the
population. Performance indicator data from the ongoing Kenya Electricity
Expansion Project and country sector statistics show that the rate of new connections
added annually increased from 135,000 in FY2007–2008 to 443,000 in FY2013–2014
(table 4.7).

Collaboration among World Bank, IFC, and MIGA in the Electricity Sector
Collaboration across the Bank Group in the electricity sector is mainly through joint
projects in which at least two of the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA are involved. The
World Bank brings to this collaboration the value of its upstream work for country
clients on policy and institutional frameworks, and the Partial Risk and Partial
Credit Guarantee instruments to support government payment obligations to
private investors. IFC brings long-term financing that is rarely available in countries
with underdeveloped financial markets and high investor risk. MIGA’s main value
added in the joint transactions is from long-term political risk insurance for high-risk
countries, which is not available from international commercial insurers. 14

ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
Bank Group–wide collaboration in the electricity sector has occurred for several
years. IEG identified 25 projects with the involvement of at least two of the three
institutions (listed in appendix M). Of these, nine are in low-access countries
(Cameroon, Kenya, and Uganda); seven are in medium-access countries
(Bangladesh, Côte D’Ivoire, India, Lao PDR, and Senegal); five are in high-access
countries (Guatemala, Jamaica, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka); and two are in
universal-access countries (Tajikistan and Moldova). Bank Group engagement was
higher in low- and medium-access countries ($3.4 billion) compared with high- and
universal-access countries ($600 million). Also, IFC and MIGA financed projects in
high- and universal-access countries without the need for World Bank involvement
(table 4.8).

Fifteen of the 25 projects addressed conventional generation (of which four covered
large hydro projects); two addressed small new renewable energy projects, and two
others involved privatization of distribution companies (Moldova and Uganda). Ten
of the operations had less than $100 million each of Bank Group commitment; 14
had $100–500 million, and the remaining projects (Maharashtra State Electricity
Transmission Company Limited and Nam Theun 2) had commitments of $1,050
million. Of the 25 projects, only 10 had been evaluated, of which nine projects have
outcome ratings. Seven of these projects had development outcomes rated
moderately satisfactory/successful or better. Two projects had less successful results
because of the complexity of project design relative to the country’s institutional
capacity and experience in a joint IDA-IFC rural electrification project. The other
joint IDA-IFC project fell short of meeting its objectives because of a change in
government and limited IDA support compared with the ambitious
objectives. (Bibiyana IPP; Bangladesh Power Sector Development Policy Credit).

The joint projects added value for country clients by breaking ground for the private
sector in high-risk countries, and by pulling together financiers in large and complex
projects, as is seen in the following examples.



                                                                                                                    81

                                         ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
Breaking ground for the private sector. At least six of the joint Bank Group projects
were considered pioneering transactions in their respective countries including the
first independent power provider in the country (Bangladesh, Cameroon, Jamaica),
the first private or privatization of a power company or utility (Moldova and
Uganda), or the first such transaction in the country (Guatemala). In the gas-to-
power project in Cameroon, IDA designed a hybrid Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG)
with a feature like an IBRD) Partial Credit Guarantee because the utility opted for a
different procurement model. Without IDA financing and guarantee support, it
would have been difficult to mobilize local banks to provide local currency
financing and for the other international financiers to provide long-term debt. In the
Umeme Limited project in Uganda, the relatively small IDA PRG covering a letter of
credit supported by MIGA’s political risk insurance helped large capital
mobilization, including from IFC (box 4.5).


 Box 4.5. Bank Group Collaboration in Transforming Uganda’s Electricity Distribution:
 Lessons from IEG’s Evaluation of Umeme Limited
 Bank Group support for Umeme Limited, Uganda’s privatized utility, is an example of
 how a “one Bank Group” approach can mobilize private investment, introduce
 efficiencies, and improve viability of a once underperforming utility in a post-conflict
 country. Through the provision of an IDA contingent credit and MIGA political risk
 insurance to support government guarantees, the Bank Group attracted first-rate private
 investors in the first fully privatized utility in Sub-Saharan Africa. IFC loans and equity
 investment provided additional lower-cost and long-term financing and helped catalyze
 financing for Umeme Limited’s past and current $439 million 2013–2018 capital
 investment programs. Previous IDA credits also helped with other aspects of Uganda’s
 power sector reform that had spillover effects on the project. Despite numerous
 challenges since its concession started in 2005, the Umeme experience showed that
 privatization of electricity distribution can introduce efficiencies, improve sector viability,
 strengthen the regulatory framework and capacity, and expand access.
 Umeme exceeded the capital expenditures and collection rate improvements required
 under its 20-year concession agreement with the Uganda Electricity Transmission
 Company Limited. Electricity consumption in billed sales among the different customer
 types also increased. Household connections increased in its concession areas. Household
 electricity consumption increased from 334 gigawatt hours in 2004 to 455 gigawatt hours
 in 2012. Umeme had its initial public offering in 2012 and is cross-listed in the Kampala
 and Nairobi Stock Exchanges.

Large and complex projects. Uganda’s Bujagali hydropower project is one of the
largest private sector operations in the Sub-Saharan Africa power sector, with a total
cost of $800 million. In this project, IFC’s substantial loan of $130 million and MIGA
participation ($115 million) proved critical to financing $152 million of private equity,


82
CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
and IDA’s $115 million PRG supported the entire commercial financing package. For
the Cameroon Kribi Gas-to-Power project, the Bank Group covered almost half of the
$350 million project cost. The PRG enabled local banks to extend the maturity of their
loans from the normal loan length of 7 years to the borrower’s need for 14 years,
improving the risk profile of the project to financiers. In Thailand, Nam Theun 2
Power Company is a cross-border project and was the World Bank’s first major
investment in hydropower after the World Commission on Dams report and the
Bank’s new water strategy of 2003. MIGA provided $200 million in coverage for the
foreign equity holders. IDA’s financial support was limited to a $20 million grant for
social and environmental activities and a $50 million PRG to cover a small portion of
the commercial borrowing. Although the IDA funding for this project was small
compared with the total project cost, the Bank’s appraisal was critical for bringing in
other international financial institutions. Private participants, including Thai
commercial banks, considered IDA and MIGA involvement essential because they
provided critical risk mitigation comfort through their guarantees. Perhaps more
important, their participation would ensure that the potential adverse social and
environmental impacts of this category A (signifying substantial risks under the
Bank’s environmental and safeguards policies) would be fully addressed.

Intra-Bank Group parallel financing was hindered in the past by several issues,
including the pledge of shares issue between IFC and MIGA, and the lack of
familiarity among other Bank Group staff with MIGA’s product and value added.
Attempts to formalize intra-Bank Group collaboration, especially between IFC and
MIGA, started in 2009 with the creation of a joint MIGA-IFC unit within IFC 15 to
formalize cross-marketing and business referrals arrangements and a decision to re-
establish MIGA field presence within select IFC/WB regional offices. This was
followed by the resolution of conflict of interest issues and the joint business
development agreement between IFC and MIGA 16. The signing of a Claims
Cooperation Agreement between MIGA and IFC in the event of claims for joint
projects where IFC is a senior lender eased the longstanding hindrance to parallel
financing. The appointment of MIGA champions in IFC industry units and the
financial incentives provided by MIGA to IFC investment teams at financial closure
also gave impetus for increased cooperation. Discussions between MIGA, WB’s
Financial Solutions Unit, and the WB’s Sub-Saharan Africa region began in 2010. The
revival of World Bank guarantee products also set the stage for the rise in the
number of joint Bank Group projects in the last three years.

At the staff and management levels, regular consultations between Bank and IFC
country teams are helping better collaboration (Bangladesh, China, Kenya,
Indonesia, India), and close communication among World Bank and IFC directors
and regional vice presidents helped joint Country Assistance Strategies (India) and
spurred joint projects (Kenya). More recently, formalized collaborative
arrangements and senior management involvement helped foster greater internal



                                                                                      83

                                      ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS
Bank Group synergy, as with the Bank Group’s Joint Energy Business Plan for
Nigeria. In April 2014 Bank Group management launched Joint Implementation
Plans (JIPs) 17 as a mechanism within the Systematic Country Diagnostic/Country
Partnership Framework for fostering better collaboration among Bank Group
institutions and placing greater emphasis on leveraging the private sector to provide
solutions to development problems (World Bank 2014a).

Feedback from private sector clients points to the need for simplifying requirements
and lowering costs (both transactional and business costs) associated with complex
structuring. In some cases, the recipients indicated that the process involved in IBRD
partial risk guarantees was complex or not easy to understand. Staff from IFC and
MIGA conveyed that whenever WB was involved, managing timelines for different
processing, especially involving governments and public sector entities, as well as
differing E&S guidelines posed challenges. From the perspective of Bank Group
staff, however, implementation delays could be partly minimized with a reduction
in the multiplicity of policy mandates that must be taken into account in project
design and implementation. These policy mandates, usually from shareholders,
should be prioritized according to their strong relevance to the project’s ultimate
purpose. Clear guidance by Bank Group management, including a formalized
mechanism delineating interagency responsibilities for appraisal, supervision,
monitoring, and managing potential internal conflict of interest issues are required
to improve the efficiency of staff-level collaboration. Finally, more focused feedback
from private sector clients is necessary to verify the efficiency and value added by
joint projects.

In summary, Bank Group–wide collaboration through joint projects added value by
jump-starting private sector investments in some countries and providing comfort for
investors in large projects, chiefly in generation. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where the
access challenge is largest, three low-access countries benefitted (Cameron, Kenya,
and Uganda). Total Bank Group commitments during FY2000–2014 for joint projects
in low-access countries totaled a little more than $1.7 billion, which is about 13 percent
of lending from the Bank Group and 3 percent of the lending from all sources. As
previously noted, the projected investment requirements in Sub-Saharan African
countries in generation alone is about $25 billion per year, of which $5 billion per year
is required through 2030 to meet incremental demand from universal access, and the
remaining $20 billion for several years to deal with suppressed demand and increased
demand from economic growth.

The relatively small scale of investments made possible by Bank-wide collaboration
calls for fresh thinking about how to deploy the Bank Group units’ individual and
collective strengths to stimulate private sector investments beyond Bank Group–led
projects and transactions to facilitate the syndication of the financing gap, especially
in generation for low-access countries.

CHAPTER 4
ENHANCING COUNTRY APPROACHES AND SCALING UP ACCESS

Conclusions
A quantum leap is needed in the access scale-up effort. In low-access countries, a
quantum leap in the pace of new connections and levels of investments will be
necessary to reach the goal of universal access in the next 15 years.

Best practices point to opportunities. Best practice country experiences, some with
Bank Group support, showed that the transition from low access to high or
universal access can be made within two decades. Indonesia, Lao PDR, and Vietnam
moved to high or universal electricity access through strong and sustained grid-
based expansion within two decades. With the Bank Group’s ongoing support,
Bangladesh achieved a remarkable expansion of off-grid SHS, which quickly
brought basic electricity services to nearly 10 million people and is filling the void
left by the stalled grid expansion and generation shortages in the country.

A synchronized and comprehensive approach is essential. The country experiences
point to the importance of comprehensive and synchronized planning of the
national electricity access rollout; integrating grid and off-grid means; ensuring
financial viability of the electricity sector and its agents; and addressing
affordability, equity, and inclusion through targeting the poor and those in remote
and inaccessible areas. All these aspects need to be tied together with a clear
government vision and comment to the access goals.

The experience of sectorwide approaches. The first sectorwide approaches in the
electricity sector in Rwanda and Kenya are showing better results than a transaction-
by-transaction approach and, along with demonstrated government commitment,
have so far led to significant financing commitments from various development
partners. In particular, the private sector made commitments it may not have made
without the sectorwide approach adopted by the two countries. After a long period
of stagnation, the access levels increased from 6 percent to 15 percent in Rwanda,
and from 23 percent to 30 percent in Kenya during the past four years.

World Bank Group collaboration. Collaboration among World Bank, IFC, and
MIGA through joint projects grew with time, though initially in an ad hoc manner.
Still, the scale of these joint efforts is a relatively small proportion of Bank Group
commitments to the sector. Feedback from both internal and external stakeholders
point to a number of areas for improvement. To take effective action in this area,
more solid evidence is needed on the value added and on costs and benefits to
private sector clients from such joint projects. The challenge is to deploy the Bank
Group units’ individual and collective strengths to stimulate private sector
investments beyond Bank Group–led projects and transactions to facilitate the
syndication of the financing gap, especially in generation for low-access countries.

14World Bank Group collaboration in the energy sector has been on-going prior to the
endorsement in 2013 of the One-World Bank Group approach to achieve the twin goals.
Intra-World Bank Group coordination in the form of sequential upstream-downstream
project linkages, staff consultations at appraisal and in country assistance and sector
strategies, providing inputs to appraisal/board documents, assistance with project
structuring and government negotiations and follow-up were routinely practiced by
operational staff at the three institutions. Crucially, the three institutions have provided
parallel financing to numerous projects. IEG was able to identify 25 joint World Bank
Group projects, discussed in this section and identified in Appendix S. However, the intra-
World Bank Group collaboration prior to the 2013 World Bank Group Strategy was on a
need or ad-hoc basis and mostly at the project or transaction level.

        5. Findings, Conclusions, and
        Recommendations
This evaluation assessed the Bank Group’s support for increasing electricity access
during 2010–2014, with a view to informing its strategy for supporting access-deficit
countries to achieve the goals set by Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All). It sought to
answer the question: To what extent has the World Bank Group been effective in the
past and, going forward, how well is it equipped to put its country clients on track
to achieve universal access to electricity that is adequate, affordable, and of the
required quality and reliability?

The evaluation found that Bank Group engagement in, and assistance to, the
electricity sector in low-access countries was relatively low compared with high- and
universal-access countries. If the Bank Group is to accelerate progress towards
universal electricity access in 15 years in low-access countries—especially in Sub-
Saharan Africa—there is a clear and urgent need for two measures: to raise the
scale, depth and speed of implementation of the Bank Group’s own engagement in
the electricity sector in low-access countries; and to help low-access countries
mobilize other resources tailored to the universal access challenge, and that are
several orders of magnitude greater than what has been mobilized in recent years.

The Bank Group’s electricity sector portfolio during the past 15 years showed strong
performance in the provision of physical infrastructure, and there have been
significant achievements in generation, transmission and distribution (T&D), and
connections during the period. For perspective, the grid-based connections
supported by the Bank Group are estimated to be about 4.4 percent of all
connections added during FY2000–2014 by all country clients, and 4.8 percent of all
connections added by low-access country clients.

The Bank Group also pioneered off-grid electrification in low- and medium-access
countries. The impact has been low with the exception of the good practice Solar
Home Systems Program in Bangladesh, which installed and successfully serviced 2
million systems in the past decade and is reportedly adding 80,000 systems per
month on a commercially viable and sustainable basis. Notably as well, this
program is largely driven by private sector, albeit, enabled by the “light touch” of
Government role, especially at the outset, within the framework of a public-private
partnership. The good practice Bangladesh program experience is potentially
relevant for several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that are characterized by a
fragile environment and dispersed populations, or where the main sector conditions
are not yet minimally in place for systematic and fast scale-up by grid expansion. In
such instances, and where a country expresses demonstrated commitment and


                                                                                     87
                                                                               CHAPTER 5
                                               FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
willingness to engage, the Bank Group’s new strategy would need to initially focus
on context-specific upstream support consistent with sector readiness; in parallel, it
can support a pre-electrification program in commercially viable areas that are
proximate to areas where the grid would otherwise represent the least cost solution
for electrification, as well as potentially target priority interventions for
electrification of health and educational facilities nationwide.

The Bank Group made little progress in improving the financial viability of
electricity sectors as a whole for its country clients, despite strong analytical work
and lending. The vast majority of development policy operations targeting the
financial viability of electricity sectors were directed to high- and universal-access
countries, of which about half performed satisfactorily. The relatively fewer
investment operations that relied on covenants to stimulate financial discipline in
country clients also did not achieve the intended results.

Attention to welfare and gender-related outcomes of electricity access interventions
is increasing in World Bank projects and with satisfactory impacts, though much
needs to be done for mainstreaming these issues in the project design and
monitoring and evaluation (M&E). IFC has made a beginning in addressing these
issues.

Best practice country experiences show that the transition from low to high or
universal access can be made within two decades. In recent years, Indonesia, Lao
PDR, and Vietnam have accomplished this feat. The Bank Group played a key role
in this process for Lao PDR and Vietnam, and in the earlier stages of establishing
momentum and accelerating new connections in Indonesia’s program until access
levels reached about 68 percent.

The Bank’s approach to the electricity sector in Rwanda and Kenya is demonstrating
the usefulness of a sectorwide program of sustained engagement in enabling
systematic and fast scale-up. In keeping with international good practice principles,
the Bank Group has helped the governments to develop national electricity access
rollout plans based on geospatial mapping and using least-cost combinations of
coordinated grid and off-grid electrification. The geospatially determined
implementation plan in turn anchors the sector level Investment Financing
Prospectus for access scale-up and facilitates the syndication of sufficient overall
investment financing required for the access program on an ongoing basis. This
approach, along with demonstrated government commitment, has led to very
significant financing commitments from various development partners. After a long
period of stagnation, the grid connected access levels have increased from 6 percent

CHAPTER 5
FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
to 15 percent in Rwanda, and 23 percent to 30 percent in Kenya over the past four
years.

Lessons from successful country experience pointing to the principles of success are
as follows:

    •   Planning the rollout of national electricity access needs to be comprehensive
        and synchronized, integrating grid and off-grid means and bringing
        development partners together within an organizing architecture of “many
        partners, one team, and one plan.”
    •   Financial viability of the electricity sector and its agents depends on clear
        institutional roles and accountability, and may require appropriately
        targeted subsidies.
    •   Affordability, equity, and inclusion need to be addressed by targeting the
        poor and those in remote and inaccessible areas.
    •   Government vision and its enabling engagement in addressing all of the
        above issues is the crucial binding factor.

This evaluation holds a mirror to the Bank Group’s performance record with
improving electricity access during FY2000–2014 to inform its approach to helping
countries move toward universal electricity access by 2030. In the large array of
Bank Group efforts in this regard, several aspects are not aligned well with the scale
and urgency for achieving the universal access goal.

First, continuing to follow a project- and transaction-based approach alone will not
be sufficient for achieving SE4All universal access targets by 2030. The Bank Group’s
own experience with scaling up access shows that timely and efficient achievement
of universal access requires a sustained sector-level engagement, with a
programmatic framework for syndication of the entire investment financing that can
be sustained for at least a decade and possibly longer.

Second, several strengths, and promising trends in the Bank Group’s lending
experience can be built upon. Among them are IFC’s transactional experience and
strength in investment financing for building electricity generation capacity projects,
and its potential for promoting public-private partnerships. The World Bank’s role
contributed extensively in T&D in the past 15 years. MIGA built valuable experience
in providing critical risk mitigation comfort through its guarantees, particularly in
low-access and low-income countries. These strengths and country experiences hold
promise for Bank Group cooperation that goes beyond joint projects to strategic
engagement, particularly in supporting low-access countries to undertake

                                              FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
systematic national access rollout programs that will achieve the universal access
goal within the next 15 years.

Recommendations
Recommendation 1

Engage decisively and intensely on countries with low electricity access (most of
which are in Sub-Saharan Africa). This evaluation highlights large gaps in country
coverage and weak engagement in low-access countries. In line with the Country
Partnership Frameworks, the Bank Group should broaden and deepen its
engagement in low-access countries to help them address the huge shortfalls in
investment, capacity building and knowledge resources needed to move towards
universal access in 15 years.

Recommendation 2

Move from a predominantly project-by-project approach—which lacks the scale
and speed to achieve universal access by 2030 in low-access countries—to a far
greater use of a sector-wide organizing framework and process for mainstreaming
the sustained engagement needed for implementing rapid access scale-up. The
scope and timing of the sector-wide frameworks and engagement plans should be
led and coordinated by the government, and take into account the starting sector
context and readiness. The core principles and strategic drivers underlying the best
practice programs should inform the new strategic framework and country plans,
and the Bank Group’s operational engagement going forward. These are: systematic
implementation of national electricity access, enabling sector policies and regulation,
commercial viability of service providers, affordability of connections costs for the
poor, and overarching government commitment and leadership.

Recommendation 3

Design an engagement strategy to enable low-access countries to mobilize sector-
level investment financing on the scale required, and sustained over the next 15
years, 2015–2030. Specifically, design an investment financing platform led by the
government to crowd-in necessary financial resources from both public and private
sources well beyond what would be possible with the Bank Group’s own
contributions under conventional project and transaction modes of operation. In this
effort, IBRD, IDA, IFC, and MIGA should draw upon their strengths and expertise
in generation and in T&D, respectively, and tailor syndication mechanisms,
differentiated as appropriate for generation investments financing, and otherwise
for transmission and distribution investments.

CHAPTER 5
FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 4

Improve the evidence-base related to electricity access and its alignment with the
corporate goals of promoting shared prosperity and ending extreme poverty. (A)
At the project level, (i) design results frameworks for electricity sector projects that
go beyond simple headcount measures of access—grid, off-grid, SHS, end-uses
served—to include attributes such as quality, reliability, affordability of service; and
(ii) where joint Bank Group projects are undertaken, assess value-added of such
joint projects to the private sector and country clients. (B) At sector and country
level, help country clients to appropriately enhance their M&E systems, household
surveys, census and similar undertakings to measure and monitor the economic,
welfare, and gender-related outcomes from increased electricity access. (C) Across
country clients, promote uniformity and comparability in indicators, and help
improve country capacity for designing, implementing, and utilizing the M&E
frameworks.

Sustainable Energy for All
The Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) initiative is a multi-stakeholder partnership
among governments, the private sector, and civil society. Launched by the UN
secretary-general in September 2011, the initiative is co-chaired by the World Bank.
SE4ALL has three objectives, to be achieved by 2030:

    •   Ensure universal access to modern energy services
    •   Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency
    •   Double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.

The vision underpinning the initiative is that energy enables—from job creation to
economic development, from security concerns to women’s empowerment. The
three objectives are intended to contribute to social and economic development, and
though each one is important in its own right, they also reinforce each other in
important ways. Greater access to modern energy reduces poverty and improves
health and education. Energy efficiency increases energy security for countries
without domestic fossil fuel resources, reduces costs, and frees up energy for
alternative uses. Investing more in renewables contributes to reducing greenhouse
gases emissions and pollution. Achieving the three objectives together should
maximize development benefits and help stabilize climate change in the long run.

The SE4All initiative also supports the 2014–2024 Decade of Sustainable Energy for
All declared by the UN General Assembly in December 2012.

To chart global progress in the years leading to 2030, the Global Tracking
Framework was established, coordinated by the World Bank Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program and the IEA in collaboration with experts from 15
organizations, and in public consultation with more than 100 stakeholder groups.

The first Global Tracking Framework Report was released in 2013, and it established
a comprehensive baseline of energy data not previously available because of data
fragmentation and inconsistency. The Global Tracking Framework provides regular
biannual updates on trends in energy access, renewable energy, energy efficiency,
and energy consumption.

The SE4All Global Tracking Framework built on available global databases, which
only supported binary global tracking of electricity access (households either having
electricity access or not). The definition of electricity access adopted to establish the

baseline was “availability of an electricity connection at home or the use of
electricity as the primary source for lighting.” However, the report acknowledges
that although the binary approach serves the immediate needs of global tracking,
there is growing consensus that “measurements of energy access should be able to
reflect a continuum of improvement.” For this reason, the first Global Tracking
Framework Report established a multi-tier metric—complemented by a multi-tier
framework capturing the use of key electricity services—in which the attributes for
measuring household access to electricity supply and electricity services are
quantity, duration of supply, affordability, quality, and legality.

Methodology

The purpose of this electricity access evaluation study by the Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG) is to obtain evidence-based findings, derive lessons of experience, and present
an analytical and action agenda aimed at enhancing the Bank Group’s effectiveness in
meeting its declared commitments in support of achieving universal electricity access.
These commitments are embodied in the WBG’s Energy Directions Paper (2013e) aligning
with those of the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All). In this context, this study assessed
the Bank Group’s role in supporting country clients to achieve electricity access through
the required physical investments in generation, transmission and distribution, and its
instruments such as guarantees, policy advice, and analytical work and technical assistance
to support enabling frameworks.

This study assessed what has worked well and what it would take to meet the SE4All goals
and deliver on the electricity access agenda within its stated energy directions. First, the
study assessed the Bank Group’s effectiveness in fully delivering electricity access by going
beyond basic connectivity and ensuring that, in an integrated and comprehensive manner,
the electricity supply also has the attributes of adequacy, affordability, reliability, and
quality. The study also analyzed the underlying drivers of successful performance and the
extent to which consensus still needs to be built among many country governments as to
what universal access means and requires. Second, since one size does not fit all, and
electricity access development is highly complex, the study assessed the Bank Group’s role
in strengthening institutions and bolstering country-specific efforts to deliver access more
effectively. The study evaluated the Bank Group’s results in supporting the development of
the national capacity to deliver electricity access with the required attributes. Third, since
public resources are inadequate to meet the scale of access demand, the study assessed the
Bank Group’s role and effectiveness in leveraging the large amounts of private capital that
need to be harnessed, and in helping to set the right regulatory and fiscal conditions for
investors to come in, while ensuring the financial sustainability of the electricity sector,
particularly the off-taker. Fourth, the study addressed the importance of having strong
national commitment, for which the countries must be in the driver’s seat.

The study brought out an analytical agenda to help the Bank Group while maintaining its
selectivity, to focus more directly on the accelerated speed and scale necessary to meet
SE4All goals. The study focused on the need to mobilize the private sector and the global
development community toward delivering electricity access at much higher levels and
faster rates than in the past. The study highlighted the work remaining to strengthen

                                                                                                METHODOLOGY
capacity for rolling out programs that are country-specific in their goals and design,
particularly for off-grid interventions. The study also assessed the issues and opportunities
for achieving financial viability and sustainability at the utility and sector levels.

Achieving the desired speed and scale while enhancing selectivity would require more
effective leveraging of synergies within the Bank Group. Consequently, the study was
designed to take into account the clustering of Bank Group country clients into distinct
groups of low, medium, high, and near-universal electricity access—each of which has
specific underlying factors and lessons that explain their relative success or failure in access
delivery. This knowledge proved important in determining where the Bank, IFC, and
MIGA can best leverage their individual comparative advantages—or where they can work
jointly—to achieve greater synergies and higher value added for clients.

In summary, the study derived findings and lessons to inform the Bank Group as it
continues to engage in electricity access delivery and address the challenges of achieving
effectiveness and efficiency, and the challenges of mobilizing the required capital and
forging collaboration within the Bank Group itself. The study was conducted with a view
to providing insights on how the Bank Group can build on its key areas of comparative
advantage and thereby improve the synergy toward operating as One Bank.

As seen in table E.1, much has already been covered by previous IEG studies that had
aspects related to electricity access. This study avoids repetition and builds upon those
prior analyses and their corresponding findings and lessons. For example, regarding the
critical role of the private sector, this study takes project-level performance ratings into

account but places much stronger emphasis on analyzing the relative effectiveness of the
Bank, IFC, and MIGA in low, medium, high, and universal-access countries; it also
emphasizes analysis of their potentially synergistic strengths in leveraging much-needed
private capital for delivering energy access. Similarly, this study goes beyond assessing the
scope for scaling up the Bank’s new and renewable energy interventions toward more
comprehensive analysis of the role of off-grid solutions within electricity access rollout
programs.

The evaluation study’s primary audiences are the Bank Group Boards of Directors,
management, and staff involved in electricity access operations; concerned civil society
organizations, client governments, and beneficiaries of electricity access; and the Bank
Group’s partners in the bilateral donor and multilateral development bank community,
especially those engaged in SE4All.


Main Evaluation Question, Approach, and Scope
The study addressed this overarching question: To what extent has the Bank Group been
effective in the past and, going forward, how well is it equipped to put its country clients
on track to achieve universal access to electricity that is adequate, affordable, and of the
required quality and reliability?

COUNTRY-FOCUSED EVALUATIVE ANALYSIS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS

The study mainly adopted a country-focused evaluative approach, which develops an
integrated assessment of the electricity access effort using the country as the unit of
inquiry. The analysis started with a holistic look at the electricity access effort in the
country context. This country-focused evaluative analysis drew upon several evaluative
instruments: project portfolio review, literature review, country strategy review, field-
based inputs, a systematic review of impact evaluations, interviews with staff, government,
and beneficiaries, and thematic notes. Evidence was triangulated across the various sources
of information.

Thirty-five countries were chosen for in-depth country-focused analyses—including
several field-based review—based on the importance of access issues, population without
electricity access, potential lessons from successful and less successful national access
programs, and Bank Group–wide involvement. The electricity access experiences of some
countries that are not World Bank clients were also examined to draw lessons.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS
To support learning lessons, the IEG study first assessed both quantitative and qualitative
results data at the level of individual projects, investments, or guarantee operations. A

further step was to carryout in-depth Project Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs) for
a sub-sample of countries and projects selected to represent major categories (Appendix D).
To supplement this assessment at the project and country levels, the study also conducted
in-depth analyses of important themes that emerge as drivers of performance for successful
delivery of electricity access.

PERIOD OF THE STUDY
The study covered all projects, investments, guarantees, and non-lending technical
assistance and advisory services supporting electricity access, and approved during the 15-
year period from FY2000 to FY2014. The emphasis was on closed and mature projects and
investments and other activities, and countries that received significant Bank Group
support and offer potential for learning lessons. When this period started, the Bank Group
had broadened its strategy from addressing mainly rural electrification toward scaling up
electricity access nationwide, and supporting the energy infrastructure at its center. The 15-
year period also allows for five-year period comparisons.

DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES

This evaluation analyzed the development outcomes for electricity sector projects that
closed (IBRD and IDA) or have reached early operating maturity (IFC and MIGA) with
evaluations completed during FY2000–2014. These performance measures are based on the
respective evaluation methodologies of the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA (Table E.2).

METHODOLOGY
PROCEDURE FOLLOWED FOR RATING KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Criteria for Classifying Key Performance Indicators

The study looked at all key performance indicators (KPIs) reported in the implementation
completions reports (ICRs) for closed projects during FY2000-2014. The analysis classified
KPIs according to access dimensions presented below. Such categorization informed the
study on the Bank’s portfolio performance vis-à-vis the SE4all agenda.

      •   Access: Number of customers, households, and public centers connected by grid or
          off-grid measures
      •   Adequacy: Provide, expand, increase, or upgrade generation capacity; alleviate
          power shortages
      •   Reliability/quality: Decrease system technical losses and voltage fluctuations
      •   Affordability: Improvements in electricity affordability, especially for the poor,
          addressing tariffs, connections costs, consumer and lifeline subsidies, cash
          transfers, etc.
      •   Financial viability: Improvements in system financial management, cost-reflective
          tariffs, decrease in nontechnical losses, improvements in bill collection rates,
          metering, and corporate governance
      •   Welfare: Income generation, gender equity, health, education, telecommunication,
          and safety measures and improvements associated with increased access to
          electricity.

Rating Key Performance Indicators

Ratings of key performance indicators were assigned according to the following scale:
   4 = target overachieved
   3 = target achieved by 50 percent or more
   2 = target achieved by 25–50 percent
   1= target achieved by 0–25 percent.

Ratings were assigned when a baseline, a target, and an achieved target were available, or
at least a target and the achieved value. Revised targets were used where applicable.

GENERATION CAPACITY IN COUNTRY CLIENTS
For the World Bank, data from key performance indicators for additions in generation
capacity in IBRD and IDA core projects closed during FY2000–2014 were considered,
including either added or rehabilitated capacity (MW). IEG notes that the key performance
indicators reported in WB implementation completion reports sometimes include
generation numbers that can only partly be attributed to direct support by the Bank. The

in Table E.3.

The portfolio review covered: (a) IFC investments and advisory services projects with
commitments during the FY2000-FY2014 period; and (b) MIGA guarantee projects issued
during the same period. IEG also reviewed evaluative evidence from project-level
evaluations of IFC investments, advisory services and MIGA guarantee projects completed
in the FY2000-FY2014 period.

China).

ELECTRICITY ACCESS FIGURES IN COUNTRY CLIENTS

To assess the Bank’s contribution in providing access to electricity in client countries, data
on KPIs for closed projects during FY2000-2014 were collected from ICRs. Indicators
include grid based households (HH) connections, as well as off-grid connections via Solar
Home Systems (SHSs), Solar PV and mini grid solutions. IEG notes that the KPIs reported
in WB implementation completion reports sometimes include connections numbers that
can only partly be attributed to direct support by the Bank.

PROJECTIONS FOR 2030 AT CURRENT PACE

The source used for population projections figures for 2030 is the UN Department of
Economic and Social Affairs- Population Division. As regards electricity access, IEG
projections assume that new connections are added at the average annual rate achieved
during 2000–2010. Assuming five people per household, figures on the percentage of
population connected were derived, compared with the SE4all access data.

LIMITATIONS
The study covered non-energy sector World Bank projects, or projects that are primarily
mapped to sectors other than the energy sector only to the extent that any of their
objectives or components are directly or substantially relevant to delivering or improving
electricity access. IFC and MIGA projects covered by this study include only those that
categorized “Electric Power” and “Power” sub-sectors, respectively. Some Bank Group
activities may not be intended to have a systemic impact on electricity access at the sector
or country level. When such cases arose, the study recognized the specific objectives of
those operations and assessed the direct project-level results and the indirect spillover
effects. In some projects, this involved demonstration effects or increased competitiveness
in productive sectors served by greater electricity access. As expected, the availability and
quality of data for the various attributes of access varied widely across countries.

Appendix I
Global Programs’ Contribution to Knowledge on
Electricity Access
This appendix is a summary of an Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) learning product
on global programs for electricity access covering the Energy Sector Management
Assistance Program (ESMAP), Asia Sustainable and Alternative Energy (ASTAE), and the
activities of the Global Partnership on Output-based Aid (GPOBA) and the Lighting Africa
program.

The question posed by this learning product is: To what extent have the four programs
contributed to knowledge on energy access? A common mandate for the creation,
dissemination, and application of knowledge was expected to be a key added value of the
four programs. Given this, the learning product reviewed in depth a sample including 13
reports published from 2009–2014 that cover issues related to electricity access.. The sample
was purposely selected to include substantive publications from all four programs and
cover a wide range of energy access issues at the global or regional level, along with a few
publications that focused on field study countries of IEG’s Evaluation of the World Bank
Group’s Support for Electricity Access.

The quality and relevance of the selected reports was assessed based on the following
criteria (IEG 2007):

    •   Contribution to new knowledge that is not available from other sources
        (subsidiarity principle)
    •   Good use of the World Bank Group’s comparative advantage (objectivity and
        global perspective)
    •   Readability
    •   Fitness for purpose.

Contribution to new knowledge that is not available from other sources

IEG’s review found that 13 of the 20 sample reports made a significant contribution to the
global body of knowledge on energy access. They generated new data, information, and
analyses that are useful to inform policy, program, and project decisions for the promotion
of universal access to energy. The contribution was modest in five publications and minor
in two cases.

The greatest contributions to new knowledge tended to be made by reports that combined
sound conceptual analysis with documentation of field-based evidence from surveys,


                                                                                          121

piloting, and experimentation. Precise and objective recording and interpretation of results
from the ground offer the greatest contributions.

An excellent example is provided by a tightly focused ESMAP-funded paper on the issues
associated with the estimation of electricity demand curves (World Bank 2011a). The paper
presents a brief overview of the underlying theory and demonstrates its application with
an econometric analysis using the database from a 3,000-household energy survey in the
Republic of Yemen. The results are compared with those of similar studies in other
countries and show the importance of basing electricity benefit estimates on survey data
instead of the commonly employed shortcuts. Similarly, an ESMAP-supported evaluation
of the impacts of a rural electrification project in Vietnam based on a representative survey
of 1,200 beneficiaries in seven provinces solidly established that the benefits exceeded its
costs (Khandker and others 2009). The statistical robustness with which this conclusion is
supported makes it particularly valuable for future decisions on grid-based rural
electrification in Vietnam and other countries with similar socioeconomic conditions.

Without ground truthing, even conceptual rigor can lead to inaccurate conclusions. For
example, a GPOBA paper makes a tightly argued, theoretically sound case for the
effectiveness and efficiency of results-based financing as an instrument for leveraging
private investors to focus the delivery of energy services on the poor.1 But the case is
mainly based on logical reasoning with illustrative examples from a few World Bank
projects. One of these involved the subsidization of solar home systems (SHS) in
Bangladesh, which the paper asserts are “typically purchased by poorer consumers” since
“by definition…off-grid consumers are low-income.” The evidence from the follow-up
impact evaluation, however, did not support this conclusion. The survey-based impact
evaluation found that about one-third of the households, at most, purchased the system,
and they tended to be the higher-income households in the villages where SHS had been
offered—which themselves tended to be the more prosperous of the off-grid villages in the
country (Asaduzzaman and others 2013).

Use of World Bank Group’s comparative advantage

To what extent did the publications reflect sound analysis based on international good
practice and unquestioned objectivity? The results are mixed. Just over half (11 of 20) of the
reports provided an objective analysis of the issues based on international best practice,
and the remainder did not fully meet this standard. The best reports take full advantage of
the World Bank Group’s ability to offer impartial analyses with a global perspective.

A good example is an ESMAP report on integrating gender into energy operations. The
report consolidates available information into a step-by-step approach, each step supported
with illustrations from the global experience and reference to additional online resources

GLOBAL PROGRAMS’ CONTRIBUTION TO KNOWLEDGE ON ELECTRICITY ACCESS
(World Bank 2013). ESMAP and GPOBA also funded a comprehensive overview and
analysis of the financial and technical issues associated with electricity connection
charges—solidly grounded on data collected from every utility in Africa—which
concluded with practical, actionable strategies for lowering these costs and enhancing their
affordability by the poor (Golumbeanu and Barnes 2013).

In reports that fall short of the desired standard, the most common flaw is the lack of a
sound analytical framework for deriving conclusions from facts and analysis. This can lead
to important issues being left unaddressed in the concluding recommendations. For
example, an ESMAP-supported review of World Bank’s investments in modernizing
energy services discusses the “inordinate effort” required to access grant funds for
technical assistance needed in preparing energy access projects, but offers no insight on
how to address this issue (Barnes, Singh, and Shi 2010).

A second common flaw is the omission of key aspects or information that should be
essential for a balanced discussion of the issues. For example, an ASTAE-supported
regional flagship report on how to achieve universal energy access in East Asia and the
Pacific region by 2030 carefully considers the economic, financial, and institutional factors,
and leads up to long-term investment scenarios for seven countries (World Bank 2011b).
Surprisingly, the recommended scenarios take account of only capital costs and omit
estimates of the required operational subsidies, even though they would be expected to be
of a similar magnitude.

The credibility of some reports is undermined by an insufficiently sober and objective tone.
For example, a diagnostic market assessment that underpins Lighting Africa strategy
applies a bullish, excessively confident tone by using “will” instead of “may” about its
findings (“…cost reductions will translate into lower prices” and “…industry leaders will
consolidate”). This tone makes the assessment sound more like an advocacy piece than a
balanced assessment of the market (Lighting Africa 2010). Similarly, an ASTAE-supported
review of Vietnam’s rural electrification strategies intended for policy makers and
practitioners in other countries is characterized by a consistently positive slant that detracts
from the credibility of the important messages emerging from the country’s experience
(Gencer and others 2011).

Readability

Most of the sample publications were found to the well-articulated and easy to understand
for the appropriate audience. A frequent issue revolves around the need to reach the target
audience through appropriate labeling or packaging of the report—as a policy note,
working paper, discussion paper, research paper, knowledge brief, and so on. More than
half (12 of 20) of the reports are written for well-informed decision makers and



                                                                                             123

practitioners. A few are quite technical and mainly intended for technical specialists. Three
of the reports are technical, but also difficult to read except for the most dedicated
specialists. Conversely, the raw, unedited candor and integrity of a few of the most densely
written technical reports yielded some of the more robust and revealing contributions to
the understanding of energy access issues.

A good example is an ESMAP-supported evaluation of the impacts of electrification on
small- and microenterprises in Sub-Saharan Africa exemplifies a solid technical report
(Mayer-Tasch, Mukerjee, and Reiche 2013). It provides a comprehensive survey of the
global experience with electrification impact studies and of methodological issues
associated with the estimation of benefits, illustrated with the example of three survey-
based studies in Benin, Ghana, and Uganda. This analysis fills an important gap since the
productive uses of electrification can, under certain circumstances, substantially contribute
to the financial viability of rural electrification, and there have been few methodologically
rigorous, survey-based studies that could provide a solid basis for decisions in this area.

Fitness for Purpose

The reports’ fitness for purpose was assessed on the basis of the extent to which their
conclusions, lessons, and recommendations are grounded in analysis and relevant for the
intended objective. Fewer than half (8 of 20) of the sample publications fully met this
benchmark. In several of the reports that fall short, their fitness for purpose is impaired by
their lack of objectivity and analytical soundness, as previously noted. In a few additional
cases, the value of the reports is limited by a failure to bring out the full implications of
their findings, even when the underlying analysis was sound. Thus, the GPOBA-funded
impact evaluation of SHS in Bangladesh found that the demand for SHS was highly
inelastic, which suggests that the subsidies had been unnecessary, at least for the better-off
portion of households that had benefitted from the program (Asaduzzaman and others
2013). But the implications of reducing or eliminating the subsidies are analyzed only from
the perspective of the households that had already purchased the SHS, without any
discussion of the potential welfare implications for the poorer two-thirds of households
that had not purchased a SHS, which could have easily been derived from the available
data.

Another example of fuzziness about the purpose is provided by a series of country notes
that analyze policy and regulatory issues affecting the scale-up of the solar lighting market
in Africa 1. Intended in principle to “level the playing field” by removing existing
distortions, the notes instead favor off-grid lighting solutions by advocating their
exemption from all taxes and duties, without considering the potential impacts on
competing fiscal priorities, and flying in the face of broader efforts to harmonize tax and
tariff regimes across product categories.

Systematic Review
Access to Electricity for Improving Health, Education and Welfare in Low- and Middle-
Income Countries: A Systematic Review
Kavita Mathur, Sandy Oliver, and Janice Tripney

Objective of the Systematic Review
The primary objective of this review is to critically analyze and synthesize the existing
evidence to answer the following question:
      What is the impact of electricity access on health, education and welfare outcomes in
      low- and middle-income countries?

Literature Review
A review seeking studies investigating relationships between energy, welfare and gender
captured predominantly observational studies with population samples sufficiently large
to support multivariate regression for controlling potential confounders (Kohlin et al.,
2011). The authors summarized desired outcomes from electrification as longer working
days, better access to information, better and safer lighting, greater efficiency in domestic
and caring responsibilities and expanded opportunities for income generation. Their
putative pathway between household electrification and derived benefits were drawn from
the literature, but were supported by few robust studies of impact:

In general, light and TV are the first common uses of electricity, accounting for at least 80
percent of rural electricity consumption. Electricity displaces more expensive candles and
kerosene lamps, thereby reducing indoor air pollution and fire and burn risk, and provides
higher quality light. Lighting and television help improve access to information, the ability
to study, and extends the effective working day. Lighting also improves the productivity of
many household activities.

Kohlin et al. (2011) also found observational studies addressing electrification of
communities. These indicated potential positive effects through better schools (where
teachers are less absent and spend more time planning lessons), better health care (through
refrigerated storage), better security (with street lighting, for example), greater social
capital (through lighting for evening gatherings) and better economic opportunities (for
example, through improved communication with the market and processing or storage
facilities). Lastly, the generation and transmission of electricity offer employment
opportunities.

This literature also suggests differential gender impact:
Providing electricity to communities and homes and motor power for tasks that are
typically considered women’s work can promote gender equality, women’s empowerment,
                                                                                          128

and women’s and girl’s access to education, health care and employment. Kohlin et al.
(2011) identified household studies that associated electrification with: reduced time spent
by women collecting firewood and water; disproportionate increases in female
employment, possibly by freeing women from time-consuming domestic tasks such as
cooking; and even greater impacts when accompanied by social marketing, finance
schemes for appliances, or enterprise schemes for women to access electricity services.
Studies of rural electrification also indicate increased women’s work outside the home,
especially for younger women. Evidence of education and health benefits from
electrification appear less differentiated by gender, although fertility rates are lower in
rural areas with consequent benefits for women. Studies also implicate television as a route
to women’s empowerment possibly through exposure to role models of emancipated
women in fictional TV dramas.

Figure J.1 illustrates the logic model employed to frame the review. The logic model was
constructed based on investigation of the welfare gains associated with electricity access
(IEG 2008b), and gendered analysis (Kohlin et al. (2011).

Types of studies included
Eligible research designs included those studies in which the authors used a control or
comparison group, and in which: (i) participants were randomly assigned (using a process
of random allocation, such as a random number generation); (ii) a quasi-random method of
assignment was used where pre-treatment equivalence information was available
regarding the nature of the group differences; (iii) participants were non-randomly
assigned but matched on pre-treatment outcomes and/or time invariant variables such as
relevant demographic characteristics (using observables, or propensity scores) and/or
according to a cut-off on an ordinal or continuous variable (regression discontinuity
design); or (iv) participants were non-randomly assigned, but statistical methods were
used to control for differences between groups (for example, using multiple regression
analysis, including difference-in-difference, cross-sectional [single differences], or
instrumental variables regression). Studies using an experimental or robust quasi-
experimental design were eligible for a detailed impact synthesis.

Ineligible study designs include:
   •       Single group, post-test only design.
   •       Single group, pre-test/post-test design (i.e., where participants act as their own
           controls).
   •       Non-equivalent comparison group design, with no additional controls (that is,
           design involves use of non-random treatment and comparison groups -
           concurrent or historical - but does not employ an appropriate method of
           statistical analysis for causal identification). Inappropriate methods include
           measurement of statistical association between participation and outcomes, such
           as ANOVA or bivariate regression-based studies without incorporation of
           additional control variables.
   •       Interrupted time-series with less than three periods of data collection both before
           and after the intervention.
   •       Studies that attempt to predict the impact of an intervention using data
           simulation techniques. Such 'hypothetical' studies are attempting to predict how
           something will behave without actually testing it in the real world (i.e., they are
           estimating parameters that have not been measured from field data).

      The following types of studies were outside the scope of the review:
      •      Studies examining certain new energy sources, such as biofuels.
      •      Studies addressing commercial enterprises that built their own power
             transmission systems to access electricity for their own use only.

Types of participants
Studies were eligible if they included individuals, households, community-based
organizations (for example, schools, health clinics, and community centers) or commercial

enterprises (except those that build their own power transmission systems to access
electricity for their own use alone).

Studies were eligible if they were conducted in low- and middle-income countries, where
low and middle income are defined in accordance with the current World Bank
classification. Studies were eligible if they focused on people living in rural, peri-urban
and/or urban areas. Participants of any age were eligible, and there were no restrictions on
any other demographic characteristics.

Types of outcome measures
The review included studies that addressed the outcomes for individuals, households,
community-based organizations (for example, schools, health clinics, and community
centers) or micro, small- or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the following areas:
   •       Health - mortality and morbidity;
   •       Education - educational achievement;
   •       Welfare - time use, livelihoods (including firm level production), human rights,
           and security.

Search Method Used for Identification of Studies

Electronic searches:
A comprehensive search strategy was used to search the international research literature
for qualifying studies. To reduce the omission of relevant studies and ensure our search
was unbiased, both academic and ‘grey’ literature were searched. Manual searching
techniques were used to supplement the electronic searching of bibliographic databases
and library catalogs.
We searched electronic databases, including general social science databases and subject
specific data bases covering the energy sector. Because of time constraints we restricted
ourselves to English language databases.

The following major commercial electronic bibliographic databases were searched:
   •      ProQuest: Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA)
   •      ProQuest: Education Resources Information Center (ERIC)
   •      ProQuest: International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS)
   •      ProQuest: Medline
   •      ProQuest: Sociological Abstracts
   •      EBSCO: Business Source Premier
   •      EBSCO Econlit
   •      EBSCO PsycINFO
   •      Thomson Reuters: Web of Science

For each bibliographic database, a tailored search query was developed using controlled
vocabulary and/or free-text terms. A comprehensive list of terms related to the main

                                                                              SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
concept of this review (electrification) was used in the search. Database thesauri, were
consulted to ensure that all relevant synonyms were included, and wildcards were applied
as appropriate. A publication year filter to identify studies published since January1, 1994
was used.

Searching other resources:

Websites: The websites of relevant bilateral and multilateral organizations, including the
Inter-American Development Bank and Asian Development Bank, were searched.

Backward citation tracking: The bibliographic information contained within the reference
lists of included studies and relevant reviews was scanned to identify studies that meet the
eligibility criteria.

Search engines: To ensure maximal coverage of unpublished literature, Google was used to
follow up on potentially relevant named programmes. Google Scholar was used to track
citations of included studies.

Conference proceedings, dissertations and theses: One specialist source for dissertations
and theses searched was ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland, and ERIC (for
example, includes more than 14,000 dissertations/theses published since 1990). As part of
the Web of Science search, a search for conference proceedings was also undertaken.

Search Results

The electronic searching of databases resulted in the identification of 16,250 citations, and
1,009 duplicate records were removed up front, resulting in 15,241 records. Non-electronic
searching yielded an additional 98 studies. A total of 15,339 records were entered into EPPI
Reviewer 4 and manually screened against the eligibility criteria on title and abstract.
About 52 percent (8,039) studies were excluded because these studies were outside the
scope of the review, that is, these studies were not about electricity as a domestic or
commercial power source. These studies were about energy/electricity in biological
sciences (medicine, and cardiac failure, for example); electrical safety; electricity with
regard to testing voltages in lab settings; the role of energy in the body (purely biological);
and technical aspects such as testing of solar cells in a laboratory setting (with no
beneficiaries/participants). Since the focus of the systematic review is on low- and middle-
income countries, 22 percent (3,413) of the studies were excluded because they were in
high-income countries. Also, 1,478 studies were excluded because they were not primary
empirical studies, and another 1342 studies were excluded because they were not impact
evaluations.

In total 390 studies were identified for full report review. Of these 390 studies, there were
25 studies for which the full length reports were unavailable. The full length reports for 365

SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
studies were retrieved and reviewed. From these 365 studies which were reviewed on full
text, 263 studies were dropped because they were not robust impact evaluations, and 13
were excluded because they were focusing on ineligible outcomes. In all, fifty one studies
met the inclusion criteria, of which thirty two unique studies were identified and were
included in this review. There remaining nineteen studies were linked studies.

Selection of studies
The review management software, EPPI-Reviewer 4, was used to manage the entire review
process (Thomas, Brunton, and Graziosi 2010). Potentially relevant items identified
through the electronic search of bibliographic databases were imported into EPPI-Reviewer
4. Details of eligible studies identified through the non-electronic searches were also
entered into the reviewing software manually.

Selection of primary studies was based on the pre-developed selection criteria to identify
studies for full text screening. A guidance note for reviewers was prepared to assist the
reviewers during the screening process. The criteria were piloted by two researchers who
screened the studies on titles and abstracts. Six rounds of piloting were carried out
covering 10 percent of the sample. Any differences of opinion were resolved through
discussion.

Therefore, full texts were retrieved for all studies that appeared to meet the inclusion
criteria on the basis of the information in their titles and abstracts, and each of these papers
was reviewed by a minimum of two reviewers to determine eligibility. The final
included/excluded studies were reviewed by all three researchers. Agreements were
reached through discussion.

Study characteristics: country and regional composition
Most of the included studies, about 63 percent were conducted in middle-income countries
(thirteen in lower-middle income countries and seven in upper-middle income countries).
Twelve studies were in low-income countries. The studies covered twenty four countries
from five regions – Sub-Saharan Africa (Fourteen); South Asia (nine); Latin America and
the Caribbean (eight); East Asia (two); and Middle East and North Africa (one). There were
no studies from Europe and Central Asia Region.

Only five of the included impact evaluation studies related to World Bank Supported
programs. These are Asaduzzaman et al. (2013), Bangladesh; Banerjee et al. (2011), Nepal;
Khandker et al. (2012), Bangladesh; Khandker et al. (2012), India, and Khandker et al.
(2013), Vietnam.

Intervention characteristics
Of the thirty two included studies, the majority of the studies (twenty four) were on the
provision of electricity through grid expansion. Only eight studies were for off-grid
provision of electricity – of which six evaluated Solar Home Systems (SHS) and two

evaluated Micro Hydro projects. Most of the studies, about 85 percent focused on rural
electrification.

In terms of specific interventions:
    • Fourteen studies evaluated different projects/programs funded by the donors or the
       Governments of the country studied (table J.1);
    • Ten studies compared different levels of coverage (table J.2);
    • Six studies evaluated different levels of reliability /quality of electricity supply
       (table J.3); and
    • Two studies investigated incentives for connecting to the grid (table J.4).

Risk of Bias Analysis

A risk of bias analysis for included studies was carried out, focusing on the following key
domains: selection bias and confounding; spillovers; outcome reporting bias; and analysis
reporting bias. This involved use of a tool developed by researchers at the International
Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) specifically for assessing risk of bias in experimental
and quasi-experimental designs based on statistical methods. The approach taken to
formulate the summary assessments of risk of bias was adapted from Baird et al. 2013.
Based on the risk assessment, 53% of the studies were classified as high risk, 44% medium
risk and 3% as low risk.

Findings
In this review, authors of included studies often did not provide all the necessary data for
calculating effect sizes. Also, the studies did not measure exactly the same outcomes. The
findings from the studies which had all the pertinent data and for which outcomes could be
pooled together have been statistically combined using meta-analytic technique to analyze
the impact of electricity on health, education and welfare outcomes 1.

Impact of electricity access on education outcomes
The systematic review found evidence that electricity access has a positive impact on
children’s study time at home, years of schooling, and school enrollment (figures J.2, J.3
and J.4).

electricity is an effective intervention. Compared to children without access to electricity,

children with access to electricity increased the number of hours they studied at home
(figure J.2).

Seven studies measured the effect of electricity access on years of schooling completed. The
pooled estimate of effect (g=0.04) suggests that electricity access has a positive impact on
years of schooling completed (figure J.3).

Impact of electricity access on health outcomes

There are few studies measuring the impact of electricity access on health outcomes. This
signifies the existence of an evidence gap and an area in which future impact evaluations
could provide significant value-added. There is one study that found evidence that
electricity access has significant impact on reduction in indoor pollution (Rollins et al.
2004). The Asian Development Bank (2010) study found that the incidence of cough,

APPENDIX J
SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
respiratory problems, eye irritation, and headache are lower in electrified households than
in unelectrified households. The ADB study found that rural electrification had the greatest
impact on the incidence of eye irritation compared with the incidence of coughs or
respiratory ailments, since electrified households were 13.4 percentage points less likely to
have suffered from eye irritation. Incidence of cough was reduced by 2 percent and
respiratory ailments by 5 percent.

Five studies investigated the impact of electricity access on fertility and found mixed
evidence. Two studies (Asaduzzaman et al. 2013 and ADB (2010)) show significant effect of
electricity access on reduction in fertility. However, Banerjee et al. (2011) found no effect.
Two studies (Burlando (2014) and Fetzer (2013) investigated the impact of power outages
on fertility and found that power outages resulted in a significant increase in the number of
children born.

Impact of electricity access on welfare outcomes

The evidence base for the impact of electricity access on microenterprise profits is thin.
There are only four studies evaluating this. Peters et al. (2013) shows that in Benin the
profits of connected microenterprises in five small villages are considerably higher than
those of non-connected micro-enterprises in the other five small villages. However, two
studies - Peters et al. (2013) for peri-urban region in Ghana and Rao (2013) for five states in
India found no significant impact on profits. One study in Kenya examined the farmer
profit through experimental design, randomizing three chicken sheds of the farmer with
kerosene lamps, florescent lamps and LED solar lamps for raising chicken. The study found
increased profits for the shed with LED solar lamps.

There are seven studies examining the effect on household income (logged form), and the
pooled estimate of effect (g= 0.05) suggests electricity access has overall positive impact on
total income (figure J.5). Four studies examined the effect on non-farm income and the
pooled estimate of effect (g= 0.05) suggests that electricity access has positive impact on
non-farm income too (figure J.6).

Four studies measured the effect of electricity access on number of hours worked. The
pooled estimate of effect (g=0) suggests that electricity access has no impact on the number
of hours worked (figure J.7). This is because Alcazar (2007) drives the overall effect to the
null. Alcazar (2007) study in Peru investigated the effect of quality of electricity provision.
In this study all the households have access to electricity, but the quality of service is
different between treatment and comparison area. Consumers with better quality of service
face fewer service failures (less dimming in electric services, fewer hours of blackouts, and
a lower number of failures) and have more hours of electricity. This study found negative
significant effect. This is puzzling, but the author speculates that better quality of electricity
could allow individuals to increase their efficiency, reduce their total work burden,
increase their leisure time, or earn more income using the same number of working hours.
Electricity access is found to increase the number of hours worked for females, while for
males it is not significant. Note that Alcazar (2007) does not have gender wise estimates,
but if it had, it would affect the gender wise estimate.

In terms of hours spent on leisure, five studies evaluated the time spent on leisure. The
pooled estimate of effect (g=0.08) suggests positive impact but the confidence intervals do
not exclude a negative effect (95% CI [-0.05, 0.21]) (figure J.8). The 2007 study on Peru by
Alcazar shows a significant positive effect (this is for both males and females). The study
on Nepal by Banerjee et al. (2011) looked at females only and found positive effect. Bernard
et al. (2014) study on Ethiopia found no effect and Barron and Torero (2014) looked at
males in El Salvador and found negative effect. The study found that adult males in the 30 -
40 age group reduce time allocated to leisure, while increasing time in other labor activities.
This time reallocation is reflected in income impacts.

The findings from these studies raise questions that need to be further evaluated: Is the
leisure effect different on men and women, and under what circumstances? Given the
paucity of evidence in this aspect, further impact evaluations could provide interesting
insights.

Impact electricity access on women empowerment

The evidence base for women’s empowerment outcomes is particularly thin. Overall, only
three studies in Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan analyzed the impact of electricity access on
different aspects of women’s empowerment in mobility, general decision-making (children,
family planning and health/education), and economic and financial decision making. First,
the two studies in Bangladesh and Nepal that looked at mobility, found no impact on
women’s mobility in visiting family or friends. These studies also looked at mobility in
visiting public places, and the Bangladesh study found a significant impact, but in the one
in Nepal did not. Second, with respect to general decision making, both studies show that
electricity access has significant impact on women’s ability to make decisions regarding
their children. About family planning, the Nepal study found a significant positive effect,
but the study in Bangladesh found no significant effect. The Bhutan study is the only one
investigating health and education decision-making, and it found significantly positive
effects. Regarding effects on economic and financial decision-making, only the study in
Bangladesh found a positive and significant effect (in the other two cases it was not
significant).

Conclusion

The systematic review found that electricity access has significant positive effects on study
time, years of schooling, as well as school enrollment, which are important inputs that may
contribute to improved educational outcomes. The review finds mixed evidence on
fertility. As for impact on health, women’s empowerment, income, and firm profits, the
evidence-base is thin. The only two studies identified that look at health effects show that
electricity access reduces the incidence of cough, respiratory problems, eye irritation, and
headache.

There are areas where more work is needed, such as health outcomes, women’s
empowerment, and the impact on microenterprise profits. The Bank contributed to the
evidence base – five out of thirty two studies were funded by the Bank and evaluated Bank
programs. However, this is not enough, and the Bank needs more impact evaluations to
measure and build the evidence base for the benefits of electricity access. Also, there is little
evidence on the effects of urban electrification.

Source: Based on various sources, mostly on annual reports of national utilities or proxies when available, and Project Appraisal
Documents, Country Assistance Strategies, Country Partnership Strategies, and other relevant sources.
Notes: In unbundled sectors with mixed state and private ownership, a major national utility (for example, KEGOC, the national
transmission company for Kazakhstan) was chosen as proxy indicator. When data were not available for 2000, 2010, and 2013, the
closest available year was chosen for which data could be found. Net income is after tax.
