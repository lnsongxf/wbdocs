               Development Centre (PPDC) has created a robust web-based system : the Procurement Monitoring
               Portal Observatory. This central online portal provides train ing for procurement monitors across
               Nigeria and a mechanism to collate, analyze and channel their mon itoring feedback. The
               resulting evidence-based reports are then used to promote accountabil ity and transparency

                    government initiated a three-pronged system . It centralized the procurement of medicines for
                    all institutions through the use of electronic reverse auctions, and signed two-year framework
                    agreements with chosen suppliers to commit them to agreed terms. Medicines were then listed
                    in an electronic catalogue through which individual health institutions could requisition supplies
                    as needed . Ecuador's health system now enjoys both the purchasing power of centralized
                    procurement and the benefits of local autonomy in ordering medicines.

was seriously undermining planning, efficiency and
control. It caused duplication and erratic supply, and
reduced the state's ability to negotiate favorable prices
and delivery times. The ultimate effect was on the health
of Ecuador's people.




INNOVATION

In 2010, INCOP began developing a new system that                       a centralized system that would enable it to see

national oversight bodies to participate in the process,                this properly, which made it difficult to consol idate

                 own irrigation pumps from a pre-selected databank drawn up through a competitive process.
                 This demand-driven process is transparent and cost-effective. It enables farmers to tailor
                 purchases to their preferences and encourages dealers to provide quality after-sales service, while
                 still permitting economies of scale. Farmer empowerment resulted in a high uptake of pumps -
                 leading to increased productivity of more than 95 percent and a high rise in cropping intensity.

              International (Tl) Slovakia saw the need to create a new, public, accessible procurement database.
              It developed the Open Procurement Portal, a single-stop website for procurement analysis in
              Slovakia. The site provides easy and effective tools to browse, filter and visualize procurement
              data worth more than 023 billion. Providing high-quality data, it has become an indispensable
              source for evidence-based analysis (such as estimates of the financial impact of mandatory
              e-auctions). The portal could easily be replicated across the EU, allowing for pan-European
              monitoring and analysis.

                 disadvantage. Paraguay's challenge was to develop a user-friendly system that would support
                this vital sector of the economy, while also generating significant government savings. In 2008
                the electronic reverse auction was successfully introduced, with measures to give small businesses
                 a second chance to improve their bids, in an attempt to help them win government contracts.
                 In 2011, the system resulted in savings of almost 12 percent in relation to Paraguay's acquisitions

                 almost a quarter of which supported the country's small business sector.

SUMMARY
In the world's youngest nation, South Sudan, a team of national procurement officials has been
built after decades of conflict to enable budgets to be spent and service delivered to citizens in
war-torn towns and villages. In place of procurement agents contracted after competitive selection
processes, a government scheme is now training young South Sudanese graduates to form
the core of a new procurement service. With no prior procurement training or experience,
they are learning on-the-job, working alongside specialist procurement consultants, recruited
individually to build capacity comprehensively on a one-to-one basis. The process requires
a delicate balancing act between the need to rapidly supply highly expectant citizens with
peacetime services and infrastructure, and to create procurement capacity mainly through
'learning-by-doing ', to ensure good governance and sustainable service delivery.

SUMMARY

0 trade and market access, a Canadian firm specializing in sustainable supply chain and
community development solutions, wanted to harness the potential of large procuring entities
(public or private) to impact a community's livelihood and development. In 2007, it developed
the Local Community Procurement Program, a market access and capacity-building model
which aims to provide small and medium-sized community enterprises with the necessary skills
to access their local supply chains and become competitive suppliers in their local economies
on a susta inable basis. The program brings together private or public procuring entities, local
communities, governments and industry associations, to identify opportunities and provide the
necessary training to enable community enterprises to enter the supply cha in.

0 trade realized that as procurers, the private and public         entities in their region and so are often excluded from
sectors both have a powerful ability - and responsibility -        the bidding process. This exclusion often resu lts in
to impact a community's livelihood and development.                conflict between local communities and large players.
But this potential is often overlooked . In particular,            This is particularly true in the extractives industries,
the private sector can be either a source of conflict              which bring together big international business and
for communities or a strong force for development,                 small local communities. So 0 trade sought to develop
helping local people create meaningful and sustainable             a way to help local communities by enabling them to

• Cost and efficiency savings
  With monitors overseeing the bidding process,
  suppliers became more competitive. "Contractors

  procurement cost efficiency, highlighting further
  room for improvement. Procurement timelines were
  followed, but inflated cost estimates for the school
