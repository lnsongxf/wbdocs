Executive Summary
Azerbaijan’s development at the beginning of the XXI century is characterized by the great success
story of its petroleum industry, which has propelled Azerbaijan to the level of the most rapidly
growing economies in Europe and Central Asia.
While oil and gas reserves are finite and their extraction and transportation is largely impacted by
exogenous factors the Government of Azerbaijan has recently focused its policies on economic
diversification, which, among others, prioritizes public investment spending to boost the
information and communication technologies (ICT) sector. It is envisaged that by 2020
Azerbaijan’s ICT sector should become one of the main contributors to the non-oil GDP and should
facilitate country’s transition into the knowledge economy.
Telecommunications liberalisation, modernization and extension of the national telecom
infrastructure, implementation of e-government, and other sector-specific policies have helped
stimulate the growth of the local ICT sector which since 2005 has been expanding at an average rate
of 25-30%. The telecom industry, especially its mobile segment, has fueled the overall ICT sector
development. The number of Internet users has soared from only 17% in 2008 to 73% in 2013. By
2014, the wireless penetration per capita grew at over 100%, around one third of the population
gained mobile broadband access, and 30% of Azerbaijan’s households subscribed to fixed (wired)
broadband Internet.
Gradual extension of mobile and fixed broadband networks, coupled with significant reduction in
broadband access wholesale and retail prices for country’s Internet service providers (ISPs) and
customers, has resulted in increasing penetration growth and improving affordability performance.
When compared to Central Asian peers, Azerbaijan boasts the lowest prices for fixed and mobile
broadband access in proportion to the average disposable monthly income. Yet, the quality of
broadband service is strikingly low: the number of higher speed connections (over 4Mbps) is
persistently lower than 10% of all connections in the country, with a very slow increase over the last
two years. Prevalence of low speed broadband connections holds back arrival of socioeconomic
benefits associated with higher speed broadband rollout, including, but not limited to, online job
creation, human skills development, attraction of FDI, etc.
The analysis performed in this sector assessment has established that the countries which facilitate
infrastructure-based and technology neutral competition perform exceptionally well in terms of the
fixed and wireless penetration while enjoying high quality of service at low and affordable prices
(eg. Lithuania, Norway). Infrastructure-based competition is usually fostered through regulatory
approaches which encourage the market players to invest in national backbone infrastructure
through the use of bitstream and invest in regional infrastructure through the local loop unbundling.
The top performing countries in the benchmark sample have transposed EU telecom regulatory
framework and are marked by regulatory independence and separation between broadband strategy
formulation and implementation.
Due to the absence of the level-playing field between state-owned incumbents and alternative
operators Azerbaijan’s ISPs do not seem to be sufficiently incentivized to develop their own access
fixed networks through regulatory means and therefore increase the quality of their service
provision. Regulatory bottlenecks at the wholesale level and low fixed broadband infrastructure
coverage outside of Baku further impede private sector deployment of the access networks. The
MCHT is responsible for establishing and enforcing the state policy of electronic communications
acting both as a policymaking and regulatory body. The Ministry also formulates proposals on the
provision of public investments into the sector while the sector itself is dominated by two state-

                                                  v
owned enterprises. The main challenge arising from this conflict of interest is to sustain healthy
competition and private investment inflow in the long run.
Given the strong leverage the Government of Azerbaijan has over the telecom sector, which is a
backbone of the ICT sector, it is highly recommended that Azerbaijan policymakers act on their
country’s broadband potential through enactment of sector governance reform and adoption of
measures stimulating infrastructure-based competition, specifically in the fixed broadband market.
Such a “recipe” will ensure long-term sustainability of the sector growth as well as achievement of
the state diversification goals aimed at non-oil GDP development.

    I.       Introduction
1. Today Azerbaijan relies on the energy sector for 92% of its exports, 42% of GDP, and
   70% of the budget revenues.1 Recognizing the need to reduce the country’s dependence on
   hydrocarbon exports, the Government of Azerbaijan has adopted a long-term diversification
   plan focused on non-oil industry development. The plan foresees introduction of second
   generation regulatory reforms and economic incentives aimed at developing non-oil sectors,
   such as ICT. A strong ICT infrastructure base is a prerequisite for the diversification of a
   country, as it creates opportunities to leapfrog through strengthening country’s physical capital,
   fuelling acceleration of growth, and reducing income disparities. ICTs facilitate increase in
   labour productivity, economic growth and profitability in organizations across all sectors.

2. In addition to other priorities, one of the main targets of „Azerbaijan 2020 – Vision for Future“
   Development Concept is to double non-oil sector GDP in coming 8-10 years by using ICT.2
   Significant public investment in ICT infrastructure is expected to accelerate development
   of the ICT sector and grow its share in the non-oil GDP, which currently stands at 4.74%.3
   In 2005-2012, ICT sector grew at a rate of 25-30% per annum reflecting the overall faster
   growth of the economy and regulatory reforms, which liberalized the market.4 As part of this
   agenda, the government has developed a National Broadband Development (FTTH) Plan on
   deploying broadband networks over fibre optic cables in the country’s un- and under-served
   rural areas at a cost of over US$550mln for the period of 2014-2016. The government intends to
   proceed with implementation of the FTTH Plan in the near future.

3. By developing appropriate policies aimed at accelerating broadband diffusion, countries
   can increase domestic competitiveness and the likelihood of sustained economic growth .
   Over the last few years, there was a notable burst of studies analysing the contribution of
   broadband Internet to GDP growth (World Bank,5 ITU,6 OECD, McKinsey,7 and others8). In
   spite of some contrarian views, the evidence is fairly conclusive – broadband has a positive
   impact on GDP growth.9

4. This note analyses development of the broadband10 Internet market in Azerbaijan and
    preconditions for its sustainable positive growth. The note starts with a brief overview of the

     relevant economic developments and performance of the ICT sector within economy. In Section
     III, Azerbaijan’s broadband market performance is benchmarked against peers in Central Asia,
     Europe, and the Gulf. The benchmarking exercise elucidates impediments to the broadband
     access adoption in Azerbaijan on the supply side of the broadband market value chain relating
     to the peculiar local market structure, level of domestic competition, governance model, and
     affordability and availability of the services for the country’s poorest. While there are many
     factors influencing broadband market development, including taxation and trade policy in
     telecom and IT as well as user demand, among others, this assessment focuses primarily on the
     supply side bottlenecks. The note ends with a set of recommendations on how to accelerate
     performance of Azerbaijan’s broadband market and sustain its positive trajectory in the long
     run.

     II.     Economic Profile and Development of ICT Sector
5. The Government of Azerbaijan has placed a high emphasis on economic diversification
   realizing that reliance on the energy sector alone is not sustainable in the long term. Today
   Azerbaijan relies on the energy sector for 92% of its exports, 42% of GDP, and 70% of the
   budget revenues.11 In 2013, the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) used 83.5% of its
   revenues to subsidize the state budget.12

6. Fostered by significant amount of public spending, especially in construction, the share of the
   non-oil sector in GDP and non-oil exports has been steadily growing over the recent years.
   However, with declining oil production and lack of other sustainable sources of government
   revenue, non-oil sector growth could be quickly curtailed.13 The country has become
   increasingly dependent on its annual energy revenues as a trigger for the non-oil sector
   growth.14

7. Oil wealth allowed Azerbaijan to rapidly propel to the level of upper middle income countries.15
   In 2012, Azerbaijan’s GNI per capita reached US$6,220 nearing the average of upper
   middle income group estimated at US$6,968, yielding only to Kazakhstan among
   comparators in Central Asia (Figure 1).16

8. According to World Bank’s ECA poverty estimates (ECAPOV), Azerbaijan achieved an
   impressive 47% drop in the ratio of moderately poor (vulnerable) population in 2005-
   2008,17 which led to strengthening of the country’s middle class. This result may be
   attributed to a strong performance of social welfare transfers and implementation of the
   government plan on socioeconomic development of the regions.

9. Extreme poverty, which fell from 11.5% in 2002 to 5.3% in 2013, concentrates mostly in urban
   areas.18 Similar to an average upper middle income country, but unlike the majority of
   comparators in Central Asia, more than a half of Azerbaijan’s population lives in the cities (54%
   of the population, or over 5 million inhabitants). Moreover, 40% of urban population resides in
   a single metropolitan area – the City of Baku.19 In addition to Baku (6.6% of poverty headcount
   rate), Lankaran (5.1%) and Yukhari Qarabag (5.2%)20 are two regions with a high share of the
   poor in the local socioeconomic structure.21

10. Since 2005, ICT sector of Azerbaijan has experienced stable positive growth at an average
    growth rate of 25-30%, attributed to a number of reasons, including, among others,
    introduction of telecom licensing reforms, implementation of three state programs on
    development of ICTs that promoted ISP sector liberalization, modernization of national telecom
    infrastructure, and stimulation of end user demand for ICTs. In 2013, the number of Internet
    users has soared to 73% from 17% in 2008, and the number of those who have used computers
    has reached 62% from 24.9% in the baseline year22. Increased individual usage of Internet has
    been reflected in Azerbaijan’s ranking internationally (Figure 3).

   ECAPOV estimated that $2.5 a day constitutes the extreme poverty limit for households in the ECA region. In 2008, 5.4%
of the very poor people were urban dwellers and 3.4 % of the very poor people lived in rural areas. Ibid.

11. The sector growth is characterized by increasing involvement of the private sector whose
    share of the overall ICT market has reached 80% in 2011, increasing from 67.3% in
    2003.23 In the telecom sector, mobile operators are private companies, while the largest
    fixed broadband providers remain under the state ownership. A total of over US$3 billion
    was invested in the telecom sector in 2002-2013, and a quarter of this amount came from
    foreign investors in 2005-2012.24 The greatest portion of the investment was allocated for
    mobile network infrastructure.

12. In 2013, income of information and communication services in real prices peaked at
    AZN1,528mln or ~US$1,960mln25, out of which the revenues of telecommunication services
    (e.g. mobile telephony, trunk and international telephony, broadband Internet, etc.)
    roughly accounted for 88% of the total income (Figure 2). Over the last two decades,
    communication services, as a whole, have generated over 90% of general ICT service industry
    revenues, with the culmination at 96% in 2007. Since 2008, the income of broadband Internet
    services has been slowly moving upward and in 2012 it for the first time forged ahead of
    landline telephony, generating 7% of income as a share of total telecom services.26

13. Azerbaijan’s ICT sector development is reflected in the World Economic Forum (WEF)
    Global Information Technology rankings: slightly lagging behind Kazakhstan, the country
    is demonstrating second highest ICT performance among the Commonwealth of
    Independent States (CIS). In 2012, the country moved nine positions up WEF’s Network
    Readiness Index, five positions up in 2013, and seven positions up in 2014, thus reaching the
    49th rank among 148 countries globally.27 Over the last years, the country has shown overall
    progress on nearly all sub-indexes, with the highest positive change in value ranking
    occurring on infrastructure and digital content, and on individual ICT usage . Azerbaijan
    has been performing best on the Affordability sub-index (40th rank globally), even though the
    ranking has slightly decreased from 2013. On the rest of the pillars, Azerbaijan shows lower
    performance, with economic impacts of ICT being the weakest link of the chain.

14. Throughout this sector assessment Azerbaijan is benchmarked against Central Asian
    countries, oil-exporting economies (Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Norway) as well as
    select European countries (Lithuania, Turkey, and Norway) on different aspects of
    broadband market development. The choice of the benchmark countries is deliberate:
    Azerbaijan is juxtaposed to the comparators which share common Soviet legacy and ensuing
    development challenges (Central Asia and, to a lesser extent, Lithuania), similar geography and
    oil exporting structure of the economy (United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and, to a lesser extent,
    Norway), and those countries that have successfully applied European regulatory framework to
    boast penetration of broadband services through creation of competitive environment and could
    serve as role models for Azerbaijani policymakers (Lithuania, Turkey, and Norway). While the
    choice of Central Asian and Gulf countries may be intuitively explained, the choice of
    Lithuania, Turkey, and Norway needs additional explanation.

15. Both Lithuania and Azerbaijan started their telecom market development in the early 1990s
    after gaining independence from the Soviet Union. Over the years, Lithuania has been
    harmonizing its telecom regulatory framework in accordance with EU Directives thus
    promoting infrastructure-based competition. Since 2009 Lithuania is a leader of European
    rankings for FTTx penetration and is a good role model in terms of regulatory achievements. 29
    Unlike Lithuania, Turkey and Norway are not members of the European Union however both
    are implementing European regulatory framework driven by the intention to create a level-
    playing field for all technologies and operators. Adherence to the EU telecom regulatory
    framework resulted in good market developments in both countries: Norway, for example,
    boasts one of the lowest broadband prices and highest penetration rates for both fixed and
    mobile broadband services.

     III. Affordability and Availability of Broadband Internet Access
          Services
     3.1.       Analysis of the affordability of broadband services
16. The price of broadband services plays a critical role in fostering broadband diffusion.
    According to ITU, broadband penetration grows rapidly after the level of retail broadband price
    falls below 3–5% of average monthly income.30 The correlation between the price of broadband
    packages and fixed and mobile broadband penetration could be well observed on a sample of
    select benchmark countries (Figure 4).

17. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have made a particularly remarkable progress in bringing
    down the cost of the fixed broadband services: in the case of Azerbaijan, the decrease in
    prices throughout 2009-2012 was 13 times.31 (Figure 5) Average prices for mobile broadband
    became more affordable, too, and consequently, both fixed and mobile broadband prices in the
    country are currently the lowest in Central Asia (Table 1). The price of the cheapest average
    fixed broadband package with the connection speed of 1Mbps accounts for 13.82% of the
    average disposable monthly income and the price of the similar mobile broadband package
    stands at 10.36% of the average disposable monthly income. Experience of the European
    countries which have facilitated infrastructure-based competition proves that the level of prices
    could be much lower, e.g. Norway or Lithuania. Further analysis shows that the level of
    broadband prices is lower when the market concentration is lower (See Figure 9c).

    Azerbaijan (lowest 40% of the total population by income) needs to allocate 20.64% of
    his/her monthly disposable income to afford the cheapest mobile broadband package and
    27.52% of the monthly disposable income – for the cheapest fixed broadband package. A
    member of the moderately poor household (lowest 60% of the total population by income)
    needs to pay 17.16% and 22.87% for the cheapest mobile and fixed broadband package,
    respectively (Table 2).

19. Differences in the wages across the country are significant because they have impact on
    the purchasing power of the population. In addition, low population density across some of
    the regions impacts viability of the business case for the network operators. For the
    inhabitants of the regions with lower wages, broadband services are less affordable and
    broadband take-up in these regions is subsequently more hindered, as opposed to the
    regions with higher incomes. For example, an average household located in the poorest
    regions of the country - Yukhari Garabagh and Daghlig Shirvan - annually makes AZN2,691.6
    or US$3,450.77 and AZN2,767.2 or US$3547.69, correspondingly, which constitutes between
    40% and 41% of what an average household in Baku earns per annum. Lowering broadband
    Internet offering rates can have an immediate positive impact on fixed broadband penetration in
    Absheron and Lankaran, Azerbaijan’s most highly populated regions where an employee’s

   The lowest-priced packages chosen are: (i) ADSL 1024 Kbps packages by Aztelecom and BakInternet and (ii) 4Gb, 3Gb,
and 1Gb mobile broadband packages by Azercell, Bakcell, and Azerfon, correspondingly.

     average annual income is 52% and 56% lower than of identical employee in Baku (Figure 6).45
     Inequality in the context of broadband affordability additionally reveals itself in the uneven
     distribution of personal computers/laptops among households depending on the average income
     of a household. According to AzSTAT survey conducted in 2013, only 5.4% of households with
     monthly income under AZN200 or ~US$256 and 39.8% of households with monthly income of
     AZN200-399 or ~US$256-512. could afford a computer.46

20. With MCHT’s support the State Statistical Committee of Azerbaijan conducts annual
    surveys measuring the level of ICT application and identifying issues related to its
    development. According to the 2013 survey, high computer prices were listed among the
    main reasons that hinder usage of Internet across the country: for 38.8% of the survey
    respondents a high computer price constitutes an issue. By contrast, only 7.0% of those

     interviewed attribute their low Internet usage to the high broadband service price. 49 When
     compared internationally, 53.2% of households in Azerbaijan own a computer and 71.6% of
     households have Internet access at home,50 whereas in the developed countries 75.5% of
     households have a computer and 77.7% of households have Internet access at home.51 The
     higher share of Internet users over computer users may attest to the fact that there is rapid
     mobile broadband take-up even among those who cannot afford computer devices, which is
     supported by the findings that around 29% of all households are connected to the Internet via
     mobile phone connection,52 the cheapest mobile broadband packages are more affordable than
     the fixed ones, and that deployment of fixed broadband networks is mostly limited to the urban
     areas.

21. Affordability of the broadband Internet access appears to be among the factors
    withholding broadband uptake in the regions of Azerbaijan with lower living standards. In
    contrast, broadband Internet access is considered fairly affordable in the wealthier parts of the
    country thanks to increasing income levels that drive spending on Internet connectivity and
    devices. Development impediments are additionally influenced by low understanding of the
    value of broadband Internet and its value-added services (e.g., online payments, consolidated
    billing, content delivery, and messaging) as well as by limited broadband coverage outside the
    major cities and high computer prices for the part of population with lower income.

22. Licensing Reform implemented in 2002 lowered administrative barriers to enter the
    telecom market, for instance, licensing of Internet services was cancelled, basically
    allowing any entity to become an ISP.53 There are some 40 ISPs operating in the market,54 the
    majority of them are privately-owned companies (Table 3).55 State-owned Aztelekom and Baku
    Telephone Production Association (BTRIB) together control over 56% of the market share
    (subscribers); private ISPs serve the remaining part of the market (Figure 9). The market base
    for Aztelekom and BTRIB is split along geographical lines: the former serves Azerbaijani
    regions, whereas the latter operates in the capital56.

23. MCHT-led sharp reduction in retail broadband access tariffs since 2008 stimulated
    subscriber service uptake the annual growth of which peaked at 162.5% in 2010. Decrease
    of retail prices catalyzed the market’s recent growth which was further strengthened in 2011
    when national backbone operator Delta Telecom made a decision to reduce the cost of leasing
    international channels. At the end of 2013, the number of fixed broadband subscribers in
    Azerbaijan was 605,233 translating to 30.26% household penetration – the highest penetration
    in Central Asia. Household broadband penetration in Azerbaijan is, however, substantially
    lower than in benchmark countries, e.g. two times lower than in Lithuania, three times lower
    than in Qatar or the United Arab Emirates, and four times lower than in Norway57 (Figure 7).

                                           24. Strong growth of the fixed broadband penetration in Azerbaijan could be accompanied by
                                               more efficient competitive environment. Cumulative market share of the alternative ISPs
                                               has dropped by 7% between 1Q 2014 and 1Q 2013, market concentration (HHI or
                                               Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) increased from 2753 to 3443 during the same period of time
                                               (Figure 9c). Market shares (subscribers) of the largest alternative ISPs are not significant and
                                               are, in fact, rapidly decreasing. As an example, in 2010, the market share of UniNet was 24%
                                               and of Ultel MMC – 15% whereas in March 2014 the market share of the former is only 6,4%
                                               and of the latter –4%.59 On the positive side, Azerbaijani broadband market structure can be
                                               characterized by quite high cumulative share of small ISPs (with market shares of <2%) (Figure

25. Alternative operators’ growth and competition, necessary to sustain a sharp growth
    trajectory, are affected by the state-owned incumbents’ dominant position in the market
    and absence of the market regulation on the wholesale level. There is no independent
    regulatory body in the country which results in a deficient sector specific regulation, making it
    difficult to sustain competition in the market. Regulatory function is mainly performed by the
    Department on Regulation within MCHT. According to MCHT, wholesale markets related to
    the fixed broadband networks, such as wholesale unbundled local loop and bitstream access,
    wholesale access to terminating and trunk segments of the leased lines are not currently
    regulated.60

26. When compared to regional peers, the number of households per ISP in Azerbaijan is
    higher than that of Uzbekistan or Kyrgyz Republic - two countries that have a higher
    market share of alternative operators (Table 4). The number of households per ISP is even
    smaller in Lithuania and Norway which boast the highest fixed broadband penetration among
    the benchmark countries. Nonetheless, in view of the overall sharp growth of the fixed
    broadband market, the lower number of ISPs should not be seen as a major concern for
    Azerbaijan. Instead, greater attention should be given to ensuring the level playing field among
    the state-owned incumbents, backbone providers with significant market power, and alternative
    private companies already present on the market. Creation of more favourable conditions for
    their operation will increase competition and naturally attract more businesses into the market.

27. Most of the alternative operators, including the largest ones, are primarily competing for
    the business segment of the broadband market in the country’s capital and major urban
    centers, which is consistent with the low level of market maturity. Lack of interest from
    alternative operators to serve the country’s rural and remote areas is also caused by potential
    difficulties in developing the rural infrastructure, including the absence of adequate wholesale
    access offers, which could help stimulate connectivity rollout outside the capital and major
    urban centers.62
28. The majority of all fixed broadband connections are provided over xDSL infrastructure of
    the incumbent operators which is indicative of the low level of infrastructure-based
    competition (Figure 9a). Similarly, most of the fiber optic connections are set up by incumbent
    operators Aztelekom and BTRIB. In service provision alternative players mainly rely on the
    xDSL infrastructure of the state-owned incumbents, although to a very limited extent. For
    instance, UniNet operates in the City of Baku offering retail services to residents and businesses
    mainly over xDSL. Ultel MMC offers broadband service over xDSL mainly to Baku businesses.
    Only the second largest alternative operator Azeronline, thanks to its affiliation with the
    country’s largest mobile operator Azercell, offers broadband services over xDSL on the national

       beneficial for Azerbaijan to pursue infrastructure-based competition approach as it exerts
       positive effects on network coverage, prices, and quality of services (See Box 1).

Box 1: Infrastructure-based competition: Case of Lithuania

Infrastructure based competition is known for attraction of new investments and, subsequently coverage increase. It also
results in more sustainable competitive environment and has stronger effect on prices and quality of services. Recent
analysis of EU27 member states (2005-2011) concluded that sole promotion of service-based competition via cost-
based access regulation will not elicit the huge new investment needed for a comprehensive Next-Generation Access
(NGA) network roll-out, while infrastructure-based competition positively affects NGA deployment.

Lithuania is among those countries that have been promoting infrastructure-based competition. Following introduction
of the cross-sector passive infrastructure-sharing framework in 2004-2005, FTTx deployment in Lithuania has been
driven by alternative operators making use of existing passive infrastructure. FTTx became the dominant broadband
technology in Lithuania in mid-2008 and spurred intense infrastructure-based competition amongst the ISPs, especially
in the larger cities. At the end of 2013, FTTx accounted for 52.21% of all fixed broadband connections with over 60%
of all FTTx connections being supplied by alternative operators.

At the end of 2012, FTTx coverage in Lithuania reached 100% of households and one year later, overall broadband
penetration stood at 87% of households. As a result, Lithuania now belongs to the countries with the most affordable
access to broadband services and the highest level of high-speed broadband take-up – according to the Communications
Regulatory Authority of the Republic of Lithuania (RRT), at the end of 2013, 37.3% of connections were between 30
Mbps and 100 Mbps, and 9.6% were faster than 100 Mbps, while only 4.4% of all connections were below 2 Mbps.

    higher technological diversity and better quality of services, whereas in the countries with
    high market concentration there is no place for inter-platform competition (Figures 9b and

30. Speaking about existing technology mix, FTTx/LAN, DSL, Cable, and WiMax have been
    present in Azerbaijani market, the growth of the market, however, is mainly sustained by
    increase in the number of xDSL connections (Figure 10). Similarly to other markets, except
    for Turkmenistan and Tajikistan, Azerbaijan is witnessing some increase in development of
    FTTx (See Table 5). Main FTTx networks in the City of Baku and the neighbouring villages
    have been developed and utilized for providing connectivity to residential customers by
    Az.StarNet, Aile Net, CityNet, Aktiv-Ol, Eurosel, Connect, and among other smaller players.
    Outside Baku, FTTx networks are growing in Sumgait (by Azeronline, Eurosel), Ganja (by Aile
    Net), other regional urban centers (by DataPlus, Eurosel), and in a number of rural villages and
    towns (by AzTelekom). Further increase of the FTTx connections is expected to take place
    when the state-led FTTx broadband plan will start to be tentatively implemented by AzTelekom,
    BakTelekom, and Nakhchivan MCHT.
31. Azerbaijan enjoys high household penetration of PSTN fixed telephony lines (72.6%), but
    only 27% of all broadband connections were delivered over xDSL technology, indicating
    higher utilization of existing infrastructure could still be possible (Figure 11).65 Out of
    benchmark sample, only United Arab Emirates and Qatar have higher PSTN penetration. Across
    the EU, in particular in Western Europe, fixed-line connections have been decreasing over the
    past decade driven by fixed-mobile substitution effect. However, Azerbaijan was able to
    improve and later retain a rather stable level of fixed-line penetration. Yet, only a small portion
    of existing connections is wholesaled in Azerbaijan, while the average in European countries is
    ~65%. This implies that another 30% of Azerbaijani households can still be connected to
    broadband Internet at reasonable costs assuming that copper networks are well maintained.
    Regulatory decisions are essential for this alternative to materialize. Experience of the EU
    proves that the local loop unbundling may be a pragmatic solution to boast broadband
    penetration at reasonable costs and within a short time frame (Box 2 and Box 3). Local loop
    unbundling may yield even greater benefits for Azerbaijan given its widespread PSTN network
    whose potential remains untapped.

Box 2: Utilization of PSTN infrastructure: success stories from Germany and France

The existing fixed-line PSTN infrastructure usually provides some potential for fast broadband growth at a reasonable
cost. Most often fixed telephony infrastructure (PSTN local loops) is upgraded for delivery of broadband services,
typically through application of xDSL technologies on copper networks.

For instance, in Germany out of 28,7 million PSTN connections provided by Deutsche Telekom AG (DTAG), 23,3
million xDSL lines were in service at the end of 2012 and near 12.4 million of those xDSL connections were retailed to
end customers by DTAG competitors. While xDSL remains dominant technology for fixed broadband provision in
Germany, speeds of broadband connections are high with more than 80% of overall connections being above 2Mbps
and over 40% - above 10Mbps.

Similar to Germany, most of modern broadband coverage in France is supplied by xDSL technologies over the France
Telecom (FT) telephone network. Out of around 33 million PSTN lines deployed across the country, 88% are eligible to
supply triple play service over xDSL. As of 2012, over 80% of all existing PSTN lines in France were wholesaled.

Box 3: Ladder of investment and regulated wholesale broadband offers

In the telecommunications sector the "ladder of investment" (Cave 2006) refers to a regulatory approach that aims to
reconcile service-based competition (where entrants lease access to incumbe nts’ facilities) and facilities-based
competition (where they build their own infrastructure).

By setting low wholesale DSL regulated prices the regulator encourages service-based competition. Then, once entrants
have built a customer base and gained market information, they can move up "the ladder of investment" and invest in
their own facilities. The regulator should then increase the access price in order to encourage entrants to climb up to the
next rung, i.e., invest in national backbone infrastructure through the use of bitstream and invest in regional
infrastructure through local loop unbundling. Ultimately, entrants can develop their own access network, with full
facilities-based competition.

32. However access to the existing infrastructure could only partially support broadband
    take-up, as there are still many more broadband connections that need to be deployed,
    particularly outside Baku. A striking discrepancy persists between the urban and rural areas
    and between the fixed telephony coverage in Baku v. rest of the country. By end-2012, under
    80% of all landlines were located in the urban areas while the remaining 20% of landlines were
    found in the regions. The access divide is even more striking if one considers that the capital of
    Baku alone has 47% of total fixed landlines and that this situation has not changed significantly
    over the last decade.66 In the worst underserved municipality (Salyan region), only one rural
    family out of twelve has a telephone line.67

33. Overall, Azerbaijan’s fixed broadband market is still in its emerging phase. Regulatory
    reform is increasingly crucial for further development given increasing market
    concentration and absence of the level playing field, in particular, between incumbents
    and alternative operators. Government control over the sector has been cited as one of the
    reasons for fixed broadband sector under-development; the mandate of the MCHT as a policy
    maker, regulator and owner of the two largest incumbents has been raising concerns among
    local and foreign investors.68

     3.2.2. Characteristics of supply of the mobile broadband services

34. In contrast to fixed, development of Azerbaijan mobile market so far has been a good
    example of how efficiently competition can drive the growth of the market and lead to
    provision of affordable high quality services. First mobile network in Azerbaijan was
    launched in 1994 and from 1996 until 2005 there were just two operators in the country –
    Azercell and Bakcell. With introduction of the third market player (Azerfon) in 2005 total
    number of subscribers increased by an average of 45% in 2006 and 2007 and 25% during the
    following two years. Growth was also catalysed by the privatisation of biggest network operator
    in 2008. More recently as market approaches the saturation point the annual rate of growth has
    begun to decelerate – slowing to 9.0% in 2011, 6.2% the following year and by less than 2% in
    2013.69

35. However, mobile telephony penetration in Azerbaijan is significantly lower than the
    average penetration in Eastern Europe - 157.1%70 or in the selected Central Asian countries
    – 116%.71 With 10872 mobile subscriptions per 100 people Azerbaijan underperforms in
    comparison with the developed world which boasts over 120.73

36. Mobile telephony market is regulated with all three mobile operators considered to be
    holding a significant market power. Mobile termination rates first were established at 0,05
    AZN/min, but were cut in 2009 to 0,02AZN/min which is below the EU average.74 When it
    comes to market definition, Ministry seems to selectively follow European Union (EU)
    approach for market analysis with list of 18 pre-defined markets susceptible for ex-ante
    regulation.75 Market analysis and interconnection between the telecom operators is regulated by
    the secondary legislation adopted by the Ministry. Overall regulatory framework in case of
    mobile telephony market analysis seems to be transparent and allowing legal certainty.

37. Comparison of market concentration index (HHI)76 reveals that Azerbaijan enjoys the
    third most competitive market structure among benchmark Central Asia countries with
    positive development dynamics (Figure 12). It is expected that positive dynamics will be
    supported by the recent launch of the Mobile Number Portability in February 2014,77 which
    should intensify competition and benefit Azerbaijani consumers. Countries with more intense
    competition (lower HHI) also enjoy higher penetration, and vice versa (one exception in the
    region is Kazakhstan), e.g. in the case of Russia, one of the fastest growing mobile market
    globally, HHI was on the level of 2009 in 2012.78 While high mobile telephony penetration can
    be noticed in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, as it will be shown later, lack of competition
    results in the lower level of service quality, which in the case of broadband services is directly
    related to the quality of connection speeds.

38. The same three mobile operators also share the entire mobile broadband market in
    Azerbaijan with more evenly distributed market shares than in the case of mobile
    telephony market (Figure 13). In terms of the coverage, Bakcell owns the most extensive
    network with over 99% of the population covered according to the company, while in case of
    4G Azercell has launched commercial 4G services in couple of major urban centers (See Table
    6). In the period of June 2012-December 2013, the company signed up 50,000 4G customers
    who represent a little over 1% of company’s total subscriber base and are based in Baku and
    Absheron Peninsula.80 The competition in the mobile broadband segment intensified starting
    from the end of 2011 when Azercell and Bakcell were finally allowed to launch 3G services.81

39. Azerbaijan shows the strongest growth rate in the region in terms of mobile broadband
    surpassing Kazakhstan and more recently Tajikistan, however even better results could be
    achieved if the mobile broadband services were launched earlier (Figure 14). As of end-
    2013, the country’s mobile broadband population penetration (3G & 4G) was estimated at 32%.
    This figure is, however, two times lower than the average mobile broadband penetration per
    capita in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, which are two oil-exporting economies, similar to
    Azerbaijan (Table 7). The difference may be explained by the later launch of 3G services in
    Azerbaijan as compared to the other two countries. Azerfon got permission to launch 3G
    services in 2009; Bakcell and Azercell – 4Q 2011. Until now only one operator (Azercell) is
    permitted to use frequencies to provide 4G services which cover the city of Baku and Absheron
    peninsula. According to MCHT all involved parties, including State Commission on
    Radiofrequencies, and operators, work toward release and redistribution of remaining frequency
    bands that required for Bakcell and Azerfon83 Operators and NGOs would like to see process

40. The ratio between mobile telephony and mobile broadband subscribers indicates that one
    third of total mobile subscribers are subscribed to mobile broadband services in
    Azerbaijan, which is a good result at the regional revel, yet the market is far from
    saturation as is the case of Norway or the United Arab Emirates. To reach the point of
    saturation both markets need to continue pursuing a positive growth trajectory, which is likely
    to be strengthened following the launch of Mobile Number Portability and LTE services by
    Bakcell and Azerfon in the second and fourth quarter of 2014, respectively.87

41. Taking into account rather underdeveloped fixed broadband market with weak
    competition, mobile broadband may be considered to be a more realistic alternative in the
    short term for broadband coverage in rural Azerbaijan, even despite the fact that only one
    of three operators is offering mobile broadband services in the country’s regions. Whether
    mobile broadband networks will be deployed in the rural areas depends on the nature of
    geographical and/or population coverage obligations included into the licenses and financial
    incentives provided by the state. As for today, each mobile operator is rolling out individual
    network infrastructure for mobile broadband.89 Experience of other countries, in particular when
    it comes to the roll out of the 4G networks, shows that better (in terms of costs) and faster (in
    terms of the roll-out) results could be achieved if operators would look for potential synergies
    and network sharing opportunities (Box 4).

42. Essential for coverage of rural areas low frequency bands still need to be freed up from
    the broadcasting services through the switchover from analogue to digital TV. MCHT
    announced plans to allocate spectrum in 790MHz-862MHz bands for mobile operators, however
    no timeframe for such allocation is established at the moment of writing this paper.90

Box 4: Mobile Network Operators are Pioneers in the Optimization of Network Costs

Mobile network operators are pioneers in the optimization of network costs. With penetration reaching saturation point
and increasing margin pressure toward competitive levels, optimization solutions have already gone far beyond
traditional infrastructure sharing on active (e.g., radio access network) or passive (towers, sites, and so on) levels to
creation of more advanced capacity outsourcing models. Indeed, beyond more “traditional” network optimization
approaches (one network–one operator), alternative network models (many operators–one network, many operators–
outsourced network) promise new cost savings and are being explored in particular between mobile operators. Below
are briefly presented some of the possible approaches:
(1) Network outsourcing is a partnership between a telecom operator and an equipment vendor under which the
equipment vendor builds and operates network infrastructure for which a telecom operator is purchasing capacity
needed to provide its services. This kind of partnership is also known as a managed capacity agreement;
(2) Network sharing is a form of partnership between telecom operators aiming to decrease capital investment in
infrastructure and lower operational costs through rollout and operation of shared network infrastructure. This model is
increasingly popular in the case of third generation of mobile telecommunications technology (3G) and fourth
generation of mobile telecommunications technology (4G) network rollout. Under the deal, separate networks of
participating operators are transformed into a single network infrastructure that is shared by all the participants. In the
case of new deployments, each operator may be responsible for coverage of a certain geographic area;
(3) Network outsourcing combined with network sharing is a form of partnership between telecom operators and an
equipment vendor under which an equipment vendor builds and operates network infrastructure that is shared by
multiple operators.

     3.2.3. Assessment of the speed of Internet connections

43. Azerbaijan strikingly underperforms in terms of Internet connection speeds when
    compared to the benchmark countries. To reach the level of the consumer download speed
    of Kazakhstan, a speed frontrunner in Central Asia, the download speed of Azerbaijan
    needs to increase over three times. According to the Household Download Index developed
    by Ookla,91 Azerbaijan was ranked 115th on the list of 190 countries, with consumer download
    broadband speed of 6.3 Mbps and upload speed of 4.3 Mbps. Mobile broadband download
    speed is measured at 6.5 Mbps and upload – 2.1 Mbps. The highest consumer download
    broadband speed recorded in Baku during the analyzed period was provided by the following
    ISPs: UniNet (18.72Mbps); Azertelecom (8.68Mbps), and Delta Telecom (8.53Mbps). On these
    parameters, Azerbaijan lags significantly behind the EU, APEC countries, and global average
    (Figure 16).92 In 2012, the country had a high number of dial-up Internet access connections
    which are becoming less and less common in the region, e.g. in EU.

44. It important to mention that countries with a high market concentration index (HHI),
    despite having a high and very high level of broadband penetration (e.g. Qatar, United
    Arab Emirates or Turkey), may be similarly characterized by a low level of both upload
    and download connection speeds. In this regard, these countries follow suit of Central
    Asian countries. By contrast, the countries with a high level of competition (Lithuania or
    Norway) overperform in terms of connection speeds not only the sample countries, but also EU,
    APEC or global averages. The same observation could be drawn when average connections

45. The number of higher speed connections (over 4Mbps) is persistently lower than 10% of
    all connections, with a very slow increase over the last two years. For instance, in
    Kazakhstan such connections make up one third of all connections. The higher the prevalence of
    high speed broadband Internet in a country, the more favourable effects can be expected in the
    short-term. Availability of high-speed, reliable, and reasonably-priced Internet access is also
    considered a key determinant in FDI decisions.93 The average connection speed in Azerbaijan
    has been improving since 2008 and reached 2,868 Kbps in the fourth quarter of 2013,94 but still
    remains among the lowest in the sample (Figure 17).95 According to Akamai, the majority of
    connections in Azerbaijan are under 4Mbps but greater than 256Kbps (Figure 18).

46. The number of dial-up connections is still quite high in Azerbaijan, which may imply
    lower performance in terms of connection speeds. AzSTAT’s 2013 survey of Internet access
    at enterprises shows that 24.4% of all connections are dial-up, 26.0% are DSL below 2Mbps,
    29.6% - DSL over 2Mbps, 6.8% - wireless, 10.3% - other (with a dedicated line).96 A similar
    survey on the household level posits that 11.2% of all households have a dial-up connection,
    28.9% get connected via a mobile phone, and 59.6% by broadband.97 A significant share of the
    dial-up connections and mobile phone 3G connections is a possible reason for low average
    connection speed.

47. In terms of International Internet bandwidth per Internet user, Azerbaijan outperforms
    most of the peers in Central Asia. International bandwidth of Azerbaijan has been growing
    over the years, with the compound annual growth rate being 111% in 2005-2013. The fastest
    growth was observed in 2007-2008 (409%) and 2011-2012 (272%). In 2013, the country’s
    bandwidth reached 81,810Mbps, which is higher than median bandwidth of 54,897Mbps among
    172 measured countries.98 However, comparing to global leaders, traffic per person in
    Azerbaijan is 12 times lower than in Norway, and over 13 times lower than in Lithuania.

48. In contrast to the removal of entry barriers to telecom activities for ISPs, wholesale access
    to international gateways is still under state-owned control. There are only two operators
    in Azerbaijan (Table 8) licensed to connect international IP traffic, with Delta Telecom
    handling the majority of ISP traffic in the country. A privately-owned company Delta
    Telecom is a primary provider of international IP transit in the country supplying international
    connectivity to at least 90-95% of all users and a transit operator of Azerbaijan’s segment of
    Europe Persia Express Gateway (EPEC). The company has created the first Internet backbone in
    Azerbaijan and in Trans-Caucasus, carrying large capacity Internet traffic through the primary
    existing gateways with Russia, secondary – with Georgia, and a backup gateway via Iran. Delta
    Telecom has external fiber-optic connections with Russia via TransTelecom and with Turkey
    via RosTelecom. Indirectly, Delta Telecom serves Georgian users, since a local service provider
    TransEuroCom purchases international traffic from Delta Telecom and then carries it using fiber
    connections to Georgia. Through the TRACECA Fiber Optic Cable line, TransEuroCom is also
    connected to the TurkTelecom in Turkey.100 Delta Telecom owns a direct link to the Stockholm
    traffic exchange, while DWDM technology supports 40Gbps data transmission capacity on its
    domestic network.101 According to the backbone provider, the price of its wholesale Internet

49. The other licensee – Azertelecom – has its fibre-optic cable network covering all major regions
    and cities of Azerbaijan, including Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. It also connects
    Azerbaijan to international partners at the borders with Russia, Iran, Georgia, and Turkey. The
    network is based on DWDM technology, thus the capacity is easily scalable in each direction.104

50. Duopoly structure of the market raises concerns among national ISPs and creates
    potential regulatory bottlenecks, which may result in the market failure. As a way to
    bolster its telecom infrastructure, the Government of Azerbaijan plans to allocate US$550mln of
    public investment for deployment of fiber optic technology in the rural area and selected urban
    settlements in 2014-2016. By the end of 2016, the government plans to provide broadband
    access services to 85% of the country’s population. The target bandwidth foreseen ranges
    between 10-30 Mbps for the rural villages and 30-100 Mbps for the urban settlements.106 To
    make use of this modern infrastructure Azerbaijan needs to put in place proper regulatory
    incentives to attract private ISPs and thus receive return on its large investment.

      IV. Governance Model and Regulatory Framework
51. Azerbaijani State plays the leading role in the overall domestic broadband market
    development not only through the state-owned telecom companies, but also through
    governmental institutions such as ministries and committees (Figure 20). Looking at the
    regulatory environment of Azerbaijan, the first thing one can notice is the lack of an
    independent sector-specific regulator. The Ministry of Communications and Information
    Technologies (MCHT), responsible for the formulation and implementation of the state
    regulation, was created by Presidential Decree 94 of February 2004, replacing the former
    Ministry of Communications. The latter has just recently been renamed into the Ministry of
    Communication and High Technologies (MCHT) those structures and mandate have been
    recently reconsidered and confirmed by a Presidential Decree107. Regulatory functions related to
    the spectrum management are performed by the State Commission for Radio Frequencies,
    which is a subordinate body to the MCHT established under the Cabinet of Ministers. Tariff
    (Price) Council established under the Ministry of Economy and Industry is responsible for
    considering and assigning tariffs for telecom services following proposals from MCHT as well
    as on its own initiative. The function of ex-post competition surveillance is performed by State
    Service for Anti-Monopoly Policy and Consumer Protection (ASIHM) established under the
    same Ministry. Through its representatives MCHT participates in every stage of the regulatory
    process.

mandate is to participate in prevention and elimination of the monopoly activity and unjust competition in the telecom and IT
sectors.
                                                             34
52. MCHT is also actively involved in the coordination of incumbents’ activities. The conflict
    of interests is evident and should therefore be resolved. In October 2008, the pre-
    privatization inventory of Aztelekom and BTRIB was finalized and the sale of both telcos was
    planned by the end of that year. However, the sell-off did not take place and the talks on the
    matter renewed only in November 2010. In May 2011, MCHT announced a plan according to
    which the privatization will be preceded by the transformation of both entities from state-owned
    to joint-stock companies and their subsequent merger, the government retaining 100% of the
    stocks. In December 2013, MCHT confirmed that the merger would be possibly carried out in
    2014.109

53. Not only is MCHT responsible for establishing and enforcing the state policy of electronic
    communications, but the Ministry also makes proposals on the provision of state financial
    support to the sector. The government of Azerbaijan is planning a pilot LTE project that will
    see high speed mobile broadband expanded to remote areas of the country. The country’s two
    state-owned telecoms operators Aztelekom and BakTelekom were assigned to implement
    the LTE pilot project. It is expected that implementation will start in the next few months.110 As
    well, MCHT confirmed its plans to develop a Broadband Strategy addressing market
    development, and, as part of this plan, the Government plans to allocate up to US$550 mln from
    the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) for funding of fiber optics access infrastructure in
    the regions (FTTH Plan). According to the initial announcements, this project should be
    launched in 2014 and accompanied by the major regulatory reform. However, few project
    implementation details are known to date, and a number of details remain obscure: the nature of
    the business model, amount of forecast return on public investment (or operational model),
    scope of participation of the private sector, coverage specifics, etc. The infusion of funds will
    definitely stimulate the fiber market. But the real challenge is to ensure that the state
    intervention is a proportionate measure which would not crowd out investments from the private
    sector and which would put in place an efficient and open-access model allowing for the
    maximized infrastructure usage. The issue then becomes how to boost competition and
    maximize the benefits from the infrastructure in place for inhabitants of the region. State aid
    principles adopted by the EU may provide an actionable guidance for Azerbaijan (Box 6).
54. To sum up, the need to address the current governance model cannot be over-emphasized as the
    Government acts as a policy maker, as a regulator, and as an important market player through
    the entire value chain of the broadband market. Private sector players and industry
    associations111 have the following expectations of the next steps for the government to take: e.g.
    establish an independent regulatory body; fully or partially privatize government-owned
    enterprises or otherwise open them to private investors; proceed with construction of the
    nationwide fiber optic network with open access for all service providers. International
    organizations have previously raised concerns regarding the National Regulatory Authorities’
    lack of independence in some countries, especially when some governments retain considerable
    voting rights in communications providers.

Box 5: Draft National Broadband Development Plan for Azerbaijan
During the meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan which discussed the country’s
socioeconomic development in the first quarter of 2012 President Aliyev defined a set of targets which would make
broadband and related services accessible in each settlement of the country. The draft FTTH Plan reflects the
targets set by the President while accounting for the opinions of the private sector and non-government entities
functioning in the telecom area.
The draft FTTH plan foresees the following modernization of the network: (i) installation of fiber optic cable lines
in various directions of the telecommunication network, remote settlements, and telephone boxes that are located in
the backbone network at a distance of more than two kilometres from Automatic Telephone Exchange; (ii)
modernization of switching and transmission facilities; and (iii) installation of wireline in the un- and underserved
residential districts and high rise buildings. Subsidizing coverage with LTE technology for provision of mobile
broadband depends on the peculiarities of the geographic locations that need to be provided with broadband
connectivity.
Through this project the Government of Azerbaijan will realize a goal of bringing “fiber to each home” through
provision of access to a network of fiber-optic high-speed broadband Internet and other advanced
telecommunication services. The population living in the metropolitan area of Baku will be provided with
broadband Internet with at least 100 Mbps, while other major cities and regional centers – with at least 30 Mbps,
and towns and rural areas – with at least 10 Mbps.
Along with infrastructure development, the draft FTTH Plan envisages a set of measures to support telecom
reforms and to create a favourable regulatory environment. Among the envisaged reforms are structural reforms
which foresee adoption of new legislative acts and regulations, changes to the current tariff policy, and
implementation of measures aimed at stimulating end-user demand for broadband services.
MCHT expects that this project will help achieve the following objectives: (i) bridge the "digital gap" in the
development of ICT infrastructure in the urban vs. rural areas; (ii) modernize country's telecom networks and
infrastructure; (iii) provide ubiquitous access to affordable and high-quality Internet services; (iv) boost the
broadband Internet penetration rate to the broadband target of 85%. Simultaneously, this project aims at creating
favourable conditions for the use of e-services and expansion of web- and mobile apps in education, health,
commerce and other service industries throughout the entire territory of Azerbaijan.
The FTTH Plan will be financed through the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) and will be
implemented by incumbent operators and other interested ISPs. The project is expected to be implemented in 2014-
2016. The initially calculated cost of the project amounts to approximately US$550 mln.
Establishment of a project management authority for implementation of the FTTH Plan is currently under
consideration. The main objective of establishing such an authority is to increase transparency, attain government
broadband targets, and effectively manage the FTTH Plan.
The FTTH Plan is projected to be started by end-2014.

Box 6: State aid principles: Lessons from the EU

In the area of the state aid application for broadband development the EU seems to have accumulated the widest
experience globally while supporting 25 member states over 11 years in their efforts to extend broadband network
coverage to the areas where market operators are unlikely to invest on commercial terms.
Through the course of state aid application the EU has developed relevant principles and an overall workable
framework. The main principles applicable to the design of any state aid intervention in the EU are summarized
below:
     (1) Contribution to the achievement of objectives of common interest : State aid should contribute to the
         achievement of the objectives of common interest, such as goals of national broadband plan;
     (2) State aid should address absence of market delivery due to market failures or important
         inequalities: In general, we speak of a “market failure” if a market, left to its own devices, fails to
         deliver an efficient outcome for society. In the case of broadband, the investments in infrastructure may
         not be undertaken even though the economic benefits for society (i.e. positive externalities) exceed the
         cost. It is important to ensure that investment in broadband is also addressing another important
         objective of common interest – equity (social or regional divide);
     (3) Appropriateness of State aid as a policy instrument : State aid intervention is appropriate if there is no
         alternative to public support to overcome the lack of broadband connectivity, such as ex-ante regulation
         measures, spectrum (re)allocation, and demand side measures.
     (4) Existence of incentive effect: State aid should take place only if investment would not have been
         undertaken within the same time frame without any public intervention. As an example, there may be no
         infrastructure currently deployed, but mobile operators may have coverage obligations to cover certain
         geographic area in question (as part of their LTE, LTE-advanced licensing procedures) or certain
         operator may be designated as universal service provider assisting same area;
     (5) Aid should be limited to the minimum necessary and has limited negative effects: This set of
         measures is required to demonstrate that State aid project is proportionate to address connectivity gap. In
         this regard:
             a. detailed mapping and analysis of coverage should be performed;
             b. project should undergo public consultation to minimize distortions of competition with
                  existing providers and with those who already have investment plans;
             c. whenever a third-party operator should be selected to deploy and operate subsidized
                  infrastructure, selection process should be open and transparent;
             d. tender should follow technologically neutral approach and most economically advantageous
                  (not necessarily the cheapest) offer should be selected;
             e. State aid project should take advantage (reuse) to the extent possible from existing
                  infrastructure (e.g. ducts, masts, etc. also from other sectors like energy);
             f. subsidized broadband infrastructure is required to offer effective wholesale access (“open
                  access”) for third parties;
     (6) The overall balancing exercise and the compatibility conditions: Taking into account that public
         intervention is always the distortion of natural market conditions, State aid project should be designed
         in a way that the overall balance of the effects of the project is positive .

   V.      Sector Issues and Recommendations
55. Broadband Internet is a powerful enabler for sustainable economic growth, job creation, human
    skills development, and social transformation. Broadband infrastructure and services contribute
    directly to countries’ productivity, competitiveness, and economic diversification by fostering
    development of the ICT sector, manufacturing industry, and energy sector. Affordable
    broadband services and increasing income levels, dynamic mobile broadband market, and
    government readiness to implement relevant programs in the area of broadband infrastructure
    development provide Azerbaijan with an opportunity to develop vibrant and competitive
    broadband market with a remarkable upward growth trajectory.

56. Yet, Azerbaijan is not realizing most of its broadband potential. The competition on the national
    level, particularly in the segment of fixed broadband market, is currently not viewed as a tool to
    achieve and sustain market growth and development. Low Internet connection speeds suggest
    that the high-speed Internet has not yet gained ground in the country while delayed recognition
    of the importance of competition and sector governance reform continues to withhold efficient
    broadband market development and investment attraction from the private sector side, including
    FDIs.

57. Below are the major sector recommendations what would support Azerbaijan’s broadband
    market development and sustainability of its positive growth trajectory in the long term:

   1) Ensuring regulatory independence and separation between strategy formulation and
      implementation will ensure legal certainty and will attract more investments into the telecom
      market and new entrants. This subsequently will put the basis for development of service-
      based followed by infrastructure-based competition benefitting ISPs and customers;
   2) Resolving regulatory bottlenecks at the wholesale level is necessary for efficient use of
      existing fixed network infrastructure which will result in increasing broadband penetration
      at lower costs and within a reasonable time frame as well as increase in the quality of
      broadband services;
   3) Development of strategy and (or) action plan to promote efficient deployment of the
      infrastructure by network operators can tackle the issue of high costs of broadband rollout.
      Best global experience posits that Azerbaijan can save up to 80-90% of construction costs
      by utilizing excess fiber capacity owned by energy, road, and railroad infrastructure
      operators if infrastructure sharing is allowed;
   4) Addressing the low level of infrastructure development in the regions is critical for ensuring
      sustainable economic and social development of the entire country. A discrepancy exists
      between the level of development of Baku and Absheron peninsula and the rest of the
      country. Broadband rollout can become an important foundation for bringing investments,
      improved public service delivery, and access to online jobs and marketable skills to the rural
      areas.
