Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins    v
Foreword

Water issues are at the heart of economic and social development and are thus critical for
reducing poverty. Emerging economies, including those in South Asia, require improved
water management in order to overcome key water challenges. Recurrent flooding is one
of those challenges.
  The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river basins in South Asia are prone to tremendous
flood-related human suffering and economic loss. Their transboundary character further
complicates efforts to protect people and their livelihoods. In recognition of these chal-
lenges, many groups are actively and cooperatively engaged in reducing South Asia’s vul-
nerability to flooding. As a contribution to these efforts, the World Bank recently
commissioned specialist teams to assess and map flood risk across the Ganges River basin
and to design and evaluate flood forecasting tools for the greater Ganges-Brahmaputra-
Meghna basin. These teams detailed their findings in over 500 pages of technical reports
plus several new online resources.
  To make the technical findings and advances more accessible to a wider audience, a
World Bank team led by Satya Priya and William Young distilled the original reports into
the present summary document, “Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-
Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins.” This distillation includes technical highlights of the
work, plus links to the full technical reports and new interactive online resources, as well
as references to related work and resources for context.
  On behalf of the World Bank, I would like to express my gratitude to the many experts
who contributed to the preparation of this important publication and in particular to con-
tributors from across the region. Many of these people are affiliated with organizations
working to encourage and facilitate the cross-border sharing of hydrometeorological
data, technologies, learning opportunities, and capacity building. Examples include not
only the World Bank but also the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for
Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the International Centre for Integrated Mountain
Development (ICIMOD), the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), the
Regional Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System for Africa and Asia (RIMES), and
the national meteorological and hydrometeorological services of the riparian countries.
Their combined accomplishments and members’ contributions all helped to improve this
document. We look forward to continued regional collaboration toward cooperative flood
management in South Asia.

x   Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins
Executive Summary

This report summarizes recent analytical work on flood risk management in South Asia
through the implementation of transboundary knowledge generation and sharing. The work
included two distinct but linked activities, conducted with the support of the South Asia
Water Initiative (SAWI; http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/sawi)
•	 A transboundary flood risk assessment for the Ganges River basin
•	 An improved transboundary flood forecasting system for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-
   Meghna basins
  These activities are more fully described in the original technical publications:
•	 Flood Risk Assessment for the Ganges Basin in South Asia: Final Report, Volume I
   (technical report) and Volume II (risk atlas) (RMSI 2016a, 2016b)
•	 Evaluation of Flood Forecasting Predictability: Technical Report (Hopson and Priya
   2017)
  The reports and tools from these studies are available to guide flood planning and the
development of operational platforms for flood forecasting, decision support, and early
warning systems. For more information, including the original technical documents, see
http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch?query=P153299.
  South Asia is one of the world’s most disaster-prone regions, with floods posing a severe
threat. In 2015, South Asia accounted for nearly two-thirds of the global fatalities
attributed to natural disasters. Floods were the most frequent cause, and economic
impacts were severe and widespread. The people most affected by flood impacts are the
poor and vulnerable, especially women and children.
  Two new contributions to reducing flood risk in South Asia are now available: a flood risk
assessment for the Ganges River basin and an improved flood forecasting system for the
Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basins. Both projects provide information directly to
decision makers and other stakeholders through interactive online displays, and both
have developed methods that could be applied to other river basins. Flood risk assessment
and flood forecasting are essential elements of managing flood risks in order to save lives,
livelihoods, and assets.
  Integrated flood management and people-focused, end-to-end early warning systems are
key to reducing flood losses. In transboundary river basins, some elements require
international cooperation. Integrated flood management simultaneously considers water
resources, land use, and risk management in order to minimize flood losses while also
allowing for flood benefits. Operational end-to-end warning systems include the building
of risk knowledge and response capabilities, real-time monitoring and forecasting of
rainfall and river conditions, expert translation of forecasts into targeted warning
messages, dissemination and communication of warnings to community members, and
people’s responses to the warnings. Both approaches are adaptive, with formal monitoring
of outcomes (including user feedback) and the charting of course corrections as needed.


Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins      xi
        Flood risk assessments are an essential first step in managing flood risks. These assessments
      help decision makers to identify vulnerability hotspots and establish mitigation priorities.
      The overall objective of a risk assessment is to understand the geographical impacts of
      floods on people and economic sectors. The key steps are to map the populations and
      assets at risk and to develop a flood simulation model and asset-specific vulnerability
      descriptions (damage functions). These tools are then used to map estimated losses due
      to model floods of various magnitudes.
        The new transboundary flood risk assessment for the Ganges basin provides, for the first
      time, a quantitative basin-wide view of affected populations, major assets, flooding hazards,
      and damage estimates by sector for floods of various magnitudes. The findings are also
      available in the form of easy-to-use maps. Major physical assets considered include
      buildings, infrastructure (roads and railways), and crops. The methods and major findings
      are published in a technical report and accompanying atlas. For the portion of the risk
      assessment relating to India, maps and findings are also available in an interactive online
      atlas that provides basin-level to block-level information directly to users. The assessment
      findings can be used to identify priority areas for targeted risk management—for example,
      risk mitigation, flood forecasting, and resilience building.
        The most severely affected subbasin was found to be the densely populated Lower Ganges.
      At the country level, average annual losses due to flooding were estimated to be highest
      for India (approximately US$609 million), followed by Bangladesh (approximately US$19
      million) and Nepal (approximately US$4 million). For a relatively minor flood (two-year
      return period), the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have the highest numbers of
      people exposed to flood impacts (approximately 35 million people combined). In
      Bangladesh, the Rajshahi Division has the highest number (0.99 million) and in Nepal, the
      Eastern Province has the highest number (0.15 million). The Lower Ganges subbasin was
      identified as a priority candidate for future mitigation work.
        Flood forecasting and warning together provide a proven, cost-effective option for
      reducing flood losses. Longer forecasting and warning lead times go beyond saving lives to
      ensuring livelihood support. For small farmers in Bangladesh, a flood-warning lead time
      of one day results in asset-specific damage reductions of up to 33 percent (reduced losses
      of aquacultured fish). A lead time of seven days yields estimated damage reductions of
      up to 90 percent (in household settings). For the moderate 2007 floods of Bangladesh, a
      forecasting and early warning system could have reportedly reduced damages by an
      estimated US$208 million. Estimated benefits over a decade of typical flooding would be
      about US$1,700 million—more than 500 times the cost of the hypothetical forecasting
      and warning system.
        Significantly for decision makers, the new long-lead flood forecasting scheme for the
      Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basins provides forecasts that inherently express not only a
      prediction of future water levels but also the appropriate level of confidence regarding each
      forecast. Such forecasts do not answer the question, “Is the river predicted to flood above


xii   Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins
the danger level, yes or no?” but rather, “What is the probability that the river will flood
above the danger level?” Knowing whether the probability is 10 percent or 90 percent
helps people decide what actions to take (if any). The forecasting scheme described in
this report was developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).
  Evaluation of the NCAR forecasting scheme indicates that a “blending” approach—
incorporating multiple data sets and multiple computational models—significantly improves
flood forecasting skill. The NCAR evaluations indicate benefit in incorporating rainfall
predictions from multiple weather centers, as well as rainfall and river observations from
multiple platforms and institutions. Satellite data are useful where on-the-ground
measurements are sparse. Forecasts are generally most skillful for locations with larger
upriver catchments. Using locally optimized combinations of rainfall forecasts yields
roughly two additional days of flood warning time. For some stations, skillful forecast
lead times are as long as 16 days. This blending approach could also incorporate other
forecasting models. A pilot project has commenced in Bihar to develop an operational
flood forecasting platform. Forecasting skill will be assessed in terms of reduced flood risk
and losses.
  The operational NCAR system delivers up-to-date transboundary flood-related information
directly to online users: rainfall, river conditions, and 16-day flood outlooks. Near-real-time
maps show predicted and observed rainfall for individual catchments, as well as observed
water levels at selected river locations. Operational 16-day water-level forecasts are
provided for 87 locations across the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins. An important next
step will be to incorporate these tools and outputs into accessible and usable platforms
that include mechanisms for user feedback and upgrades.
  A cooperative regional platform for flood forecasting and warning would help to prevent
deaths, reduce property losses, build technical and management capacity, and strengthen
participatory processes in the region. Such a platform would provide multiple benefits that
would ultimately contribute to the reduction of flood-related deaths and other losses: for
example, the identification and filling of data and knowledge gaps; a greater understanding
of regional, basin, and subbasin-level hydrological processes and conditions; greater
capacity of water resources organizations in areas related to transboundary cooperation;
greater trust and confidence in regional and basin water management; more timely
delivery of information to decision makers and other stakeholders; and stronger
stakeholder input to government decision making through participatory processes.
  In recognition of the need for greater transboundary cooperation, the United Nations
Economic and Social Commission for Asia (ESCAP), in association with the Regional Integrated
Multi-Hazard Early Warning System for Africa and Asia (RIMES), is carrying forward a new
regional program on end-to-end flood forecasting and warning in South Asia. The framework
for this program was designed by participants at the 2015 Regional Flood Early Warning
System Workshop. The cooperative program will use existing regional mechanisms to
build capacity and share information, integrate flash flood and riverine flood concerns at

      the basin level, and incorporate new forecasting technologies into user-oriented flood-
      risk information systems, thereby enhancing early flood warning capacity. ESCAP will
      begin the stepwise process by convening an intergovernmental panel of meteorologists,
      hydrologists, and disaster risk management professionals from the operational
      organizations of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna riparian countries.

Section 1   Introduction

            Across South Asia, iconic large rivers—the Ganges and the Brahmaputra—flow down from the
            Himalayas, across country borders, and into the Bay of Bengal. Along the way, nearly 650
            million people depend on these waterways for their life-supporting services—providing
            drinking water, agricultural irrigation, electricity, inland transport, and the many goods
            and other benefits that accrue from healthy river ecosystems.
              These great rivers and their tributaries and distributaries play a central role in South Asia’s
            vulnerability to flood disasters. Each year, monsoon-driven floods cause disruption and
            loss of life, livelihoods, property, infrastructure, and other assets. Many of the floods are
            transboundary in nature. High population densities, rapid population growth, widespread
            poverty, and ongoing cross-border tensions, in combination with frequent flooding, act to
            undermine development and well-being in the region.
              The people most severely affected by flooding are the poor and vulnerable, especially
            women and children. Poverty constrains people’s choices of where to live while also
            limiting their ability to protect homes and belongings. The socioeconomic consequences
            of floodwater inundation are severe, especially for those without adequate resources for
            recovery. Women and children are generally more vulnerable than men to the impacts of
            floods and have more limited coping options. Poverty is therefore a key consideration in
            managing flood risks. This is especially true for South Asia where an estimated 40 percent
            of the world’s poor live on or near major transboundary river systems. The United Nations
            Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) notes that managing
            transboundary river basin floods is essential for achieving sustainable development.

        Greater regional cooperation would greatly benefit the millions of people at risk from river
    flooding. Throughout the region, a number of groups are working to encourage and
    facilitate    cross-border     sharing     of   hydrometeorological       data,   technologies,
    learning     opportunities,     and      capacity   building.     Examples    include    ESCAP
    (http://www.unescap.org/),       the     International   Centre    for   Integrated    Mountain
    Development (ICIMOD; http://icimod.org/), the International Water Management
    Institute (IWMI; http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/), the Regional Integrated Multi-Hazard Early
    Warning System for Africa and Asia (RIMES; http://www.rimes.int/), and the World Bank
    Group (http://www.worldbank.org/), all working in collaboration with the national
    meteorological and hydrometeorological services of the riparian countries.
        These collaborative efforts and the implementation of their recommendations would bring
    significant accompanying benefits, including:
    •	 Enhanced technological contributions toward filling data and knowledge gaps
    •	 Greater understanding of regional, basin, and subbasin-level hydrological processes
         and conditions
    •	 Greater capacity of water resources organizations in areas related to transboundary
         cooperation
    •	 Greater trust and confidence in regional and basin water management
    •	 Adoption of new technologies to deliver convenient and accessible information to
         decision makers and other stakeholders
    •	 Stronger stakeholder input to government decision making through participatory
         processes
        This summary report describes two recent transboundary contributions to the development
    of end-to-end flood early warning systems in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river
    basins. The overall intent of these efforts was to advance the operationalization of flood
    forecasting methods and technologies. The first step was a robust spatial assessment of
    flood risk—considering hazard, exposure, and vulnerability—in order to guide flood
    forecasting priorities. This work led to an evaluation of forecasting services and options
    for improving flood forecasting skill, with a focus on capitalizing on recent advances in
    weather prediction.

                                  Section 1 of this summary report introduces the GBM river basin, the concepts of
                              integrated flood management and end-to-end early warning systems, and selected aspects
                              of current forecasting activities. A new regional program for transboundary flood forecasting
                              and warning, designed at the 2015 Regional Flood Early Warning System Workshop, is also
                              described. Sections 2–3 share selected highlights from the risk assessment and forecasting
                              efforts mentioned above. Section 4 provides concluding thoughts and recommendations.


                              The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River System
                              The GBM river system defines a vast transboundary basin that encompasses portions of six
                              countries and almost 2 million square kilometers of varied terrain, reaching from the high
                              Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal (map 1.1; figure 1.1; tables 1.1–1.2). All three rivers converge
                              in the low delta country of Bangladesh. By the time the conjoined waters discharge into
                              the Bay of Bengal, they constitute the world’s third largest source of freshwater flow to
                              the ocean. All three rivers are prone to flooding (table 1.3), especially during the monsoon
                              season. The GBM delta is the world’s most populous river delta.

                                                   floodplains. According to the World Resources Institute, India has the world’s highest
                                                   absolute value of GDP regularly exposed to inland flooding (US$14.3 billion on average
                                                   per year) and the highest number of people exposed (4.84 million).
                                                      Bangladesh encompasses the confluence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna
                                                   rivers as they approach the Bay of Bengal. Situated on the great delta plain formed by
                                                   their sediments, this low-lying country is especially prone to riverine flooding. During
                                                   monsoon season, nearly a fifth of the country can be inundated. During severe floods,
                                                   more than a third can be inundated. In the catastrophic flood of 1998, about two-thirds of
                                                   the land was affected. According to the World Resources Institute, Bangladesh ranks first
                                                   in the world in terms of percentage of country GDP regularly exposed to inland flooding
                                                   (nearly 5 percent on average per year) and second in terms of population exposed
                                                   (3.48 million).
                                                      Climate change introduces an element of uncertainty into the region’s water outlook.
                                                   Current trends include warming air temperatures and rising sea levels. Future projections
                                                   include changes in the timing of the South Asian monsoon and increased monsoon
                                                   strength. For the upper basins of High Asia, increased precipitation and runoff are
                                                   projected for mid-century (figure 1.4). An increase in extreme precipitation events would
                                                   exacerbate flooding hazards of all sorts (box 1.1). Changes in the timing of the monsoon
                                                   floods could increase the chance that river floods may coincide with cyclone-driven
                                                   coastal floods, with potentially catastrophic effects. Even with the uncertainty regarding
                                                   future rainfall and runoff, it is likely that today’s water challenges—including drought and
                                                   flood—will be even greater challenges tomorrow.

    Integrated Flood Management
    The concept of “integrated flood management” provides a useful framework for considering
    flood protection in South Asia. This approach considers both land and water resources,
    both the benefits and damages that floods can bring, and both structural (“hard”) and
    nonstructural (“soft”) options for flood mitigation. Dams and embankments are examples
    of structural options (box 1.2). Floodplain zoning and early warning systems are examples
    of nonstructural options. Among nonstructural interventions, flood forecasting and early
    warning systems are particularly efficient and cost-effective, with proven benefits. These
    measures are especially important where the relocation of vulnerable communities is
    impractical.
      Integrated flood management recognizes that floods have beneficial impacts and that
    floods can never be completely eliminated or controlled. The overall goal is to act
    proactively to minimize loss of life and maximize the efficient use of floodplains. The
    Associated Programme on Flood Management (http://apfm.info) promotes the concept
    and its implementation.




        BOX 1.2.   Embankments	

        Embankments are a widely used type of flood-control structure, now lining thousands
        of kilometers of tributary and river banks within the Lower Ganges and Brahmaputra
        basins. Embankments are designed to prevent floodwater spilling over from river
        channels onto adjacent floodplains. The structures are relatively inexpensive and can
        be quickly built.
          The practice of confining river flow, however, can force flowing waters to rise to
        higher levels, with higher peak discharges. Embankments also deprive floodplains of
        sediment and may encourage development in vulnerable areas. Through time,
        embankments may become incrementally less effective due to sedimentation within
        the channels. Embankment erosion and failure can be major problems, in terms of
        both the costs of ongoing maintenance and the potential for catastrophic failure.
        When embankments are overtopped, they then prevent floodwaters from draining
        back to the channel when river levels fall—especially if sedimentation has led to the
        channel being “perched” above the level of the floodplain. In these situations, the
        duration of flooding is extended and thus the prolonged waterlogging causes
        additional damage.
          The dual, mixed-blessing nature of embankments has been the subject of thoughtful
        discourse in the region. Some governments, nongovernmental organizations, and
        other groups now encourage a blend of flood-management approaches, including a
        greater emphasis on nonstructural measures. The toolbox of complementary measures
        includes floodplain zoning and flood forecasting and warning.




8   Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins
  A robust and responsive plan for integrated flood management aims to:
•	 Manage the water cycle as a whole
•	 Integrate land and water management
•	 Manage risk and uncertainty
•	 Adopt a best mix of strategies
•	 Adopt integrated hazard management approaches
•	 Promote a participatory approach
  Integrated flood management incorporates a holistic view of river basins, from headwaters
to deltas. Ideally, flood management is part of a broader program of integrated water
resource management, wherein managers and policy makers consider the many complex
connections between sometimes competing interests within a river basin. The goal is to
find a cooperative, healthy balance that manages a variety of risks and improves overall
community and ecological resilience (box 1.3).
  From an economic point of view, the success of integrated flood management depends
to some extent on how the costs of flood risks are shared between those who directly
benefit from occupying the floodplains and those who do not occupy the floodplains but
do indirectly benefit from floodplain services and the economic activities conducted
there. Economic instruments for sharing flood risks include taxes, subsidies, and
insurance. IWMI is currently piloting an index-based flood insurance project in selected
flood-prone districts in India and Bangladesh.
  Integrated flood management is adaptive. Managers and other decision makers
continually assess program outcomes in a structured, formal way. The aim is to
incorporate, in a timely manner, the benefits of new findings and lessons learned.
  Integrated flood management is consistent with recent regional support for basin-based
knowledge sharing and cooperation in South Asia. For example:
•	 A recent comprehensive strategic assessment of the Ganges River basin (World Bank
   2014) supports a shift in emphasis from flood control to flood management. This
   adjustment would entail the use of structural and nonstructural measures, with a
   greater emphasis on regional forecasting and warning systems, management of river
   embankments, and drainage. More locally focused “soft” responses would also be
   included. Examples include disaster preparedness, land use zoning, safe havens,
   flood insurance, and training and communications campaigns.
•	 Participants at a recent international workshop on early warning systems (World Bank
   2016a) likewise noted the value of a basin-oriented approach. They highlighted, in
   particular, the value of sharing flood monitoring, forecasting, and warning information.


End-to-End Flood Forecasting and Early Warning Systems
An essential aspect of flood risk management is the development of people-focused, end-to-
end flood forecasting and warning systems. The chain of events (figure 1.5) incorporates
both technical and societal considerations.

          BOX 1.3.   Cross-Country Capacity Building: Lessons from the Mississippi River Basin	

          Cross-country exchanges are one way to build capacity in integrated flood
          management. In 2014 and 2015, senior officials and technical specialists from China,
          Bhutan, India, and Bangladesh visited the United States on study tours to the
          Mississippi River basin. These tours included field visits and technical discussions.
          Topics included analytical tools for modern flood management and institutional
          frameworks for managing large river basins. The study tours sought to assess good
          practices that could be applied to the Brahmaputra basin.
            In both the Mississippi and Brahmaputra basins, many factors drive change and
          adaptation in flood management—for example, major flood events, new technologies,
          and changing societal values. The tours provided a platform for multi-country
          dialogue and knowledge sharing, thus improving diplomacy and providing
          opportunities to build toward the cooperation needed for holistic solutions to basin
          challenges.
            Key lessons from the study tours include:
          •	 Successful flood management relies on robust institutions and supportive laws
              and policies.
          •	 Effective flood risk management requires not only structural interventions but
              also softer measures such as river flood and cyclone forecasting, strategic
              communications, and well-planned evacuations.
          •	 A suite of decision support tools is required to make informed decisions and
              plans at a basin scale.
          •	 Adaptive management requires resilience and coordination at all levels at all
              times.

       The key elements of an end-to-end flood forecasting and early warning system include:
     •	 Risk assessment. To quantify and map where people and material assets are at risk
        from flooding.
     •	 Real-time monitoring. To continuously measure precipitation and water levels and
        then share that information.
     •	 Flood forecasting. To predict future water levels and inundation extent and duration,
        based on weather forecasts and monitoring data.
     •	 Warning. To interpret flood forecasts, assess potential impacts, and generate
        advisories.
     •	 Dissemination and communication. To issue clear, authoritative, targeted messages
        that enable well-informed individual decisions.
     •	 Preparation and response. To help people minimize and recover from flood damage.
     •	 Feedback. To assess how well the end-to-end system worked; includes stakeholder
        input, identification of good practices and lessons learned, and recommendations for
        improvement.
       Transboundary cooperation, both national and international, would greatly facilitate some
     of these essential activities.


     Flood Forecasting in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Basins
     Forecasting different types of flood requires different tools and approaches (figure 1.6).
     Flash floods are relatively small and brief, but intense. Large river basin floods are
     widespread and longer lasting. The different tools used to forecast water levels (for
     example, rain gauges, weather forecasts) also operate over a range of spatial scales
     (geographic extent) and time scales. Each tool makes its own distinct contribution to the
     goal of increasing forecast lead times and usefulness for the different types of flood.
       Observations of river conditions, for example, are essential for flood forecasting but can
     never directly provide lead times longer than the time required for a flood wave to make
     its way downstream through the basin (figure 1.6 and map 1.2). Rainfall measurements
     can improve lead times but never directly beyond the time required for upper-basin
     rainfall to make its way into the river and then downstream to the river outlet (called
     “time of concentration”). For longer lead times, weather forecasts should be incorporated
     into a flood-forecasting methodology. The “global circulation models” mentioned in
     figure 1.6 are one source for these forecasts of future precipitation.
       The countries of the GBM basin have varying capacities for flood forecasting and warning.
     Flood forecasting has proven effective in reducing human and economic losses due to
     flooding, but gaps remain in forecasting capabilities within the region. Areas for
     improvement include the enhancement of flood monitoring systems, data exchanges,
     technical cooperation, and institutional and capacity development (boxes 1.4 and 1.5).

        Note: Knowing about upstream rainfall and river flow helps forecasters to predict floods at downstream locations. The map colors show the average number of days that water
        takes to travel from upstream areas down to the Ganges (G) and Brahmaputra (B) outflow points into Bangladesh. For example, water takes about three weeks or more to
        travel from the blue areas down to the outflow points. Water from the red areas takes about a week or so. Forecasters can use these travel times to improve flood predictions,
        especially when combined with forecasts and measurements of upstream rainfall and river flow.

          Through its South Asia Regional Program on Hydromet Modernization, Disaster
          Risk Management and Climate Resilience, the World Bank supports the
          modernization of hydromet services and early warning systems. The program is
          strengthening national capacities for weather forecasting and disaster risk
          management to build climate resilience and enhance regional collaboration in these
          areas. The program sees improved national systems and capacity as necessary for
          subregional and regional collaboration.
            By working with providers and users of hydromet services, the program supports
          country capacity to develop and share tailored weather, water, and climate
          information tools for planning and decision making. Users span multiple sectors,
          including agriculture, water resources, and disaster risk management. Support for
          flood forecasting and early warning systems is an integral part of this broader
          support for the modernization of hydromet services across the region. The program
          currently includes investments in Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh, and investments
          in other countries are being prepared.




          BOX 1.5.   Two Types of Forecast: Deterministic and Probabilistic

          Deterministic forecasting models provide a single forecast of expected future
          conditions. A deterministic forecast might say something like, “The water level at
          station X is expected to crest at 22 meters elevation between noon and midnight on
          August 22, one meter above the danger level.” This forecast will turn out to be either
          accurate or inaccurate.
            Probabilistic (ensemble-type) forecasting models provide multiple forecasts of
          expected future conditions, each with a quantitative estimate of likelihood. A
          probabilistic forecast might say something like, “There is an 80 percent probability
          that the water level at station X will exceed the danger level of 21 meters elevation
          between noon and midnight on August 22.” If the probabilistic model is well
          calibrated, this statement is accurate.
            Agencies that issue weather forecasts or flood forecasts are increasingly shifting
          from deterministic to probabilistic models. The additional “likelihood” information
          included in a probability-based forecast is useful for decision making. Probabilistic
          models are also well suited for adjusting forecast schemes to accommodate climate
          change and other drivers of changes in flood patterns. Section 3 further discusses
          the advantages and implications of using probabilistic models.




14   Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins
                                               In China, flood-control departments and meteorological administrations maintain a
                                            storm-monitoring network that includes ground observations, a meteorological radar
                                            network, and satellite capabilities. The hydrological monitoring and flood forecasting
                                            system includes rain gauges, water-level gauges, and hydrological stations that measure
                                            rainfall, water level, and discharge. Flood forecasts and warnings are issued by Flood
                                            Control and Drought Relief Headquarters. In 2006, the Honorable President of the People’s
                                            Republic of China visited India, and it was agreed to establish an expert-level mechanism
                                            for discussion, interaction, and cooperation regarding flood season hydrological data,
                                            emergency management, and other issues regarding transboundary rivers.
                                               In Nepal, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (http://www.dhm.gov.np/)
                                            monitors 286 hydrometeorological stations. Most are manually operated, but some have
                                            been automated to continuously monitor rainfall and water levels, with data
                                            transmitted to the department every five minutes. Nepal’s Flood Forecasting Section
                                            (http://hydrology.gov.np/new/bull3/index.php/hydrology/home/main) provides web-
                                            based public access to real-time water-level and rainfall data (figure 1.7). Flood warning
                                            bulletins are also available online.

                                            Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins   15
                                             Along rivers that flow from Nepal to India, 46 hydrometeorological stations have been
                                           cooperatively established within Nepal under a 1988 bilateral agreement. Real-time data
                                           transmitted from these stations to India’s Central Water Commission (CWC) is shared
                                           with the flood-prone Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
                                             In Bhutan, the Department of Hydro Met Services (http://www.hydromet.gov.bt/)
                                           maintains 92 meteorological stations, 26 hydrological stations, and 15 flood warning
                                           stations. Some of these stations have been recently upgraded to include telemetry
                                           systems. The department also provides online, interactive, real-time data maps (figure
                                           1.8) and operates satellite-based warning systems for glacial lake outburst floods in three
                                           basins. Two hydrological models have been tested for flood forecasting but have not yet
                                           been made operational.
                                             Along rivers that flow from Bhutan to India, 32 hydrometeorological stations are
                                           maintained by the Royal Government of Bhutan with funding from India. India’s CWC
                                           uses the data to formulate flood forecasts. A joint expert team of officials from the
                                           governments of Bhutan and India continuously review the cooperative scheme.
                                             In India, the CWC (http://www.cwc.nic.in/) provides 12-, 24-, and 36-hour deterministic
                                           flood forecasts for 175 sites, including 28 inflow-forecasting sites. For some sites, simple
                                           statistical correlations of gauge-to-gauge, gauge, and discharge data are used. For other

sites, rainfall data, soil moisture data, and stream-gauge data are used. These measurement-
based approaches lend skill to short-range forecasts (figure 1.6). The water level and inflow
forecasts are assessed in terms of their accuracy relative to later observations.
  For several major rivers that flow from India to Bangladesh, flood forecasting data is
transmitted to Bangladesh during the monsoon season. These data sites are located on
the Ganges (two sites), Teesta (one site), Brahmaputra (four sites), and Barak rivers (one
site). This data transmission has enabled civil and military authorities in Bangladesh to
evacuate threatened populations to safer locations.
  In Bangladesh, the Flood Forecasting & Warning Centre (http://www.ffwc.gov.bd/)
provides online, interactive, real-time data maps (figure 1.9). The center also provides
24-, 48-, 72-, 96-, and 120-hour deterministic river-level forecasts for 54 locations. A one-
dimensional fully hydrodynamic model provides these forecasts across all major rivers
and floodplains. The forecasts are based on rain-gauge data and runoff estimates, stream-
gauge data, and upstream-to-downstream travel times (figure 1.6 and map 1.2).
  Bangladesh is unique in that roughly 90 percent of the catchment area supplying water
to its rivers lies upstream of its country borders; forecasts with 5-day lead times can
therefore be generated by observing river flows at the border-crossing sites, coupled with
simple time-series forecasting. In 2006, experimental Climate Forecasting Applications
for Bangladesh (CFAB) river discharge forecasts were coupled to the in-country MIKE 11–
based forecasts at the Ganges and Brahmaputra border crossings (Hardinge Bridge and
Bahadurabad, respectively). The CFAB forecasts provide 1- to 10-day probabilistic flow
forecasts based on probabilistic rainfall forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-
Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF; 1 to 10 days lead time) and rainfall observations
from satellites and rain gauges. The coupled MIKE 11 and CFAB forecasts provide 12 to 13
days of skillful lead-time flood warning to lower reaches of the country. Recently, ICIMOD
has been providing experimental 8-day lead-time forecasts for Bangladesh based on
river-gauge data, upriver satellite water-level observations, and new techniques in
hydraulic modeling (http://www.icimod.org/?q=20075).
  Table 1.4 lists country priorities for further improvements in flood forecasting.
  Several efforts are under way to help facilitate international collaboration on transboundary
flood issues. For example, ICIMOD’s Hindu-Kush-Himalayan Hydrological Cycle Observing
System (HKH-HYCOS) has provided a venue for Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh
to work together to establish a flood-observing network in selected basins and also flood
information systems to facilitate real-time data exchange and increase flood forecasting
and warning lead times. The establishment of a new ESCAP-facilitated effort for the South
Asia region (box 1.6) is a welcome step in this endeavor.

the region, see the following reports published in 2016:

        BOX 1.6.   A New Regional Program on End-to-End Flood Forecasting and Early
        Warning	

        Participants in the 2015 Regional Flood Early Warning System Workshop in Bangkok
        designed and adopted a framework for a regional program on end-to-end flood
        forecasting and warning in South Asia. Workshop attendees came from Bangladesh,
        Bhutan, India, and Nepal, as well as from regional and international organizations.
        Discussions considered the risk assessment and flood forecasting advances described
        in this summary report, as well as other important work in the region. The workshop
        was organized by the World Bank and RIMES.
          The overall objective of the proposed regional program is to reduce human and
        economic losses from flooding in the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna basins.
        The action plan includes three intermediate aims:
        •	 Improve user responses to flash flood warnings.
        •	 Improve user responses to riverine flood warnings.
        •	 Improve regional coordination and information- and data-sharing between the
           national hydrological services.
          In its implementation, the program will:
        •	 Integrate flash flood and riverine flood concerns.
                                                                                             box continues next page

            Participants noted that a basin-oriented collaborative approach to the sharing of
          monitoring, forecasting, and warning information would be cost-effective and of
          high socioeconomic value. Table B1.6.1 provides a summary of the final framework as

          professionals from the operational organizations of the riparian countries of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-
          Meghna basins initially and then to scale up to other transboundary river basins, including the Indus
          basin. ESCAP is moving forward with a stepwise strategy toward the fulfillment of this mandate.

20   Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins
     ESCAP will carry forward the new regional program. This leadership role is
     consistent with ESCAP’s mandate to strengthen regional cooperation for flood
     forecasting in transboundary river basins and with its commitment to the promotion
     of intergovernmental, multistakeholder cooperation. Activities within this mandate
     include the facilitation of data exchanges, the integration of recent scientific
     advances into operational systems, and the sharing of best practices. For more
     information, see Resolution 71/12, adopted in 2015: “Strengthening Regional
     Mechanisms for the Implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk
     Reduction 2015–2030 in Asia and the Pacific” (United Nations Economic and Social
     Council 2015).
       RIMES will serve as technical secretariat. This leadership role is consistent
     with RIMES’s support for building national capacities for enhanced flood warning
     systems and for the pilot testing of new-generation forecast technologies for
     community-level applications.

Section 2   Flood Risk Assessment for the Ganges Basin

            Introduction
            In any flood risk management or adaptation strategy, risk assessment is a critical first step.
            Making wise choices about how to reduce flood losses requires a quantitative
            understanding of where people and material assets are at risk. A formal risk assessment
            therefore uses a variety of tools to estimate the impacts of flooding on people and on
            assets such as buildings, roads, and agricultural crops. These findings can then be used to
            identify priority areas for targeted risk management—for example, risk mitigation and
            flood forecasting.
              A comprehensive flood risk assessment was recently completed for the Ganges River basin.
            The Ganges basin was chosen for the first such assessment in the region because of its
            history of major economic losses and loss of lives as a consequence of flooding, together
            with relatively good data availability compared with other basins.
              The overall aim of this risk analysis was to help planners, decision makers, and other
            stakeholders in their efforts to reduce losses due to frequent flooding. The objective was
            twofold:
            •	 Estimate and map flood risks for the entire Ganges basin, across a variety of
                socioeconomic sectors and at a scale that would be useful to local planners.
            •	 Support a river basin approach for developing a shared knowledge base and an
                analytical framework for flood risk assessment.

       The results of this assessment include a series of maps and tables that identify areas and
     assets that are most at risk from river flooding. This type of information is useful to a wide
     variety of users in the private and public sectors—for example:
     •	 Decision makers and policy makers
     •	 Government agencies and departments
     •	 Nongovernmental organizations
     •	 Engineers and disaster managers
     •	 Insurers and reinsurers
     •	Farmers
     •	 Residents of flood-prone areas
     •	Researchers
       Similar risk assessment studies would be beneficial for other basins of the South Asia
     region.
       The following pages describe the methods and selected major findings of the Ganges
     basin risk assessment.

     The Government of India recently revised the Indian portion of the original risk
     assessment, using classified data. The updated information is available in the online,
     interactive Ganges Basin - Flood Risk Atlas, available through the website of the Central
     Water Commission (CWC) of India (CWC and RMSI 2016).




24   Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins
                                               Millions of people suffer from flooding in the Ganges basin. Most flooding is due to heavy
                                            rains that fall during the monsoon season—July through September for most of the basin
                                            (figure 1.2). The western portion of the basin experiences the shortest monsoon season
                                            and the least rainfall. The eastern portion experiences a longer monsoon season and the
                                            greatest rainfall. Tropical cyclones also bring heavy rains and damaging floods.
                                               The Ganges River basin sprawls across four countries: China, Nepal, India, and Bangladesh
                                            (map 2.1). The Ganges basin is one of the world’s largest, most fertile, and most densely
                                            populated river basins.

                                                 The information base for the risk assessment (figure 2.1) covers all of the Nepalese, most
                                              of the Indian, and some of the Bangladeshi parts of the basin. China was included for the
                                              hydrological modeling, but no exposure data were available. The analysis considered the
                                              Ganges River catchment area from the upper basin to the river’s confluence with the
                                              Brahmaputra River in Bangladesh. The Damodar River basin in India (the hatched area on
                                              map 2.1) was excluded because this river has a separate source and flows to a separate
                                              outlet. Much of Bangladesh was excluded because modeling floods across the Bangladesh
                                              delta would require incorporation of the entire Brahmaputra (and Meghna) river basins.
                                              Importantly, the government of India has recently updated the underlying modeling for
                                              the Ganges risk assessment, using classified government hydrological data that were
                                              unavailable for the original analysis.


                                              Exposure: People and Property in the River Basin
                                              The first step of the risk assessment was to determine the number of people and the value of
                                              properties or assets within the Ganges basin (figure 2.1). These data were compiled and
                                              mapped for Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. China was not included because there was
                                              insufficient data.

                                              data. India encompasses the largest share of the basin area (about 80 percent) and
                                              population (more than 90 percent). (The population estimate for the Ganges Basin in

Note: The Ganges flood risk assessment mapped populations and asset classes within the basin. The examples shown here are population, houses, health facilities, and road
networks. The risk assessment also characterized the basin-wide distribution of railroads, major crops, and other types of buildings. On panels a–c, the darker the color, the
greater the number of people or buildings. The most populous states, divisions, or districts (panel a) in each country are Uttar Pradesh (India), Province No. 2 and Province
No. 3 (Nepal), and Nawabganj (Bangladesh). House numbers (panel b) follow the same pattern. Health facilities (panel c) are of particular interest because of the critical role
they play in disaster mitigation and recovery. The greatest number of health facilities is in Uttar Pradesh.

                                                            Finding: The total estimated value of material assets in the basin is approximately US$1
                                                         billion. Most of these assets are located in India (96 percent), where the greatest land area
                                                         and highest populations occur. Basin-wide, almost all of the total value is in buildings (95
                                                         percent). The most expensive buildings to replace, per square meter, are those made of
                                                         reinforced cement concrete.

                                                         The second step of the risk assessment was to determine which areas of the basin are
                                                         susceptible to flooding. This analysis starts with basic information about the basin itself,
                                                         including terrain, soils, land use, and flood protection structures (map 2.3). Much of the
                                                         study area is cropland (approximately 62 percent), open/grassland areas (approximately
                                                         24 percent), or forest (approximately 7 percent). Other inputs include historical river flow

                                            and flood data. The flow data exhibited some quality issues, and details about historical
                                            flood damage were generally sparse.
                                               Analyses were performed for Ganges River discharges with return periods of 2, 5, 10, 25,
                                            50, and 100 years. The longer the return period, the more severe the flood. A flood with a
                                            100-year return period has a 1 percent probability of occurring in any given year. A flood
                                            with a return period (RP) of 2 years has a 50 percent chance of occurring in any given year.
                                            A flood with a return period of 100 years is less common—with a 1 percent probability of
                                            occurring in any given year—but more severe.

                                            Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins                        29
       The Hydrologic Engineering Center’s River Analysis System (HEC-RAS; United States
     Army Corps of Engineers) was used for the hydraulic modeling. The model output is
     expressed in a series of flood hazard maps that depict inundation extent and water depth
     for simulated small to large floods (as in map 2.4, for example).
       Finding: A Ganges basin flood with a 100-year return period inundates an estimated 75,000
     square kilometers of land. A Ganges basin flood with a two-year return period inundates an
     estimated 47,000 square kilometers of land. This extent is approximately 60 percent of the
     estimated inundation area of a 100-year flood. The majority of the inundated area is in the
     low-lying plains of the Lower Ganges River (that is, the Lower Ganges subbasin).
       Modeling floods across a large floodplain like that of the Ganges River requires
     calibration and validation to ensure that the models accurately reproduce observed
     flooding behavior. This analysis used an iterative approach. The flood models were
     initially calibrated and validated by using hydrological data mainly from open-source
     data websites such as the Dartmouth Flood Observatory. Some data were also used from
     the CWC of India and the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology of Nepal. During the
     later stages of this analytical work, the CWC made available classified daily gauge
     discharge data and corresponding water surface elevations for 179 stations across the
     basin.
       Information was provided for seven flood events: 1978, 1981, 1988, 1996, 1998, 2004,
     and 2008. The selection of events was based on historical flood records. Five events were
     used for calibration, and two were used for validation. The use of high-quality hydrological
     data significantly improved the calibration and validation of the models and therefore
     also the quality of the results and the level of confidence regarding the findings.
     Comparison of the simulated and observed flood events showed general agreement.
       The flood hazard maps were also compared to maps provided by the Flood Risk Mapping:
     South Asia online application of the International Water Management Institute (IWMI
     2016). A comprehensive comparison of flood-inundated areas on the two sets of maps (for
     example, figure 2.2) showed a reasonable match.


     Vulnerability: Susceptibility to Damage or Loss
     The vulnerability module links information about exposure (step 1) and flood hazard (step 2)
     in order to deduce the probability of specific loss scenarios. Damage or vulnerability
     functions (quantitative expressions of damage as a function of hazard severity) are used
     to relate flood intensity (flood extent and depth) to the economic loss potential. Damage
     functions are often based on engineering knowledge combined with information about
     insurance claims. Such data, however, are very difficult to obtain.
       For buildings, for example, seven different types of structure were considered, based on
     their vulnerability to flood damage. Some construction materials are more robust than
     others. For each building type, damage loss was expressed in terms of a building damage

                                                         ratio—the event-related repair or replacement cost divided by the total replacement cost.
                                                         Similar damage functions were formulated for infrastructure and agricultural elements.
                                                           The resulting loss estimates are conservative (low-end); actual losses are likely much
                                                         higher. In estimating vulnerability, this study considered flood extent and depth. For
                                                         certain types of flood damages and losses, flood duration is also important. However,
                                                         inadequate data prevented assessment of flood duration. Floodwaters also disrupt
                                                         commerce and business productivity and interrupt critical services, such as water supply,
                                                         power supply, telecommunications, and medical services. These impacts were not
                                                         assessed (again, because of a lack of data), but an indication of these types of losses is
                                                         provided by the maps and loss estimates for buildings (including commercial and
                                                         residential buildings), roads, and railroads.


                                                         Risk: Probability and Impact
                                                         The final step of the analysis was to estimate the number of people and the value of assets
                                                         likely to be affected or damaged by floodwater inundation. Risk refers to the possibility, not
                                                         the certainty, of future losses. (If a future loss is perfectly known, then it is a cost—not a
                                                         risk.)
                                                           Estimated losses associated with the simulated flood events are expressed in two ways
                                                         (figure 2.3):
                                                         •	 Average annual loss (AAL)—the average of yearly losses through time
                                                         •	 Loss exceedance curve (LEC)—a graphical representation of the probability that a

 Note: In panel a, the bars represent yearly losses associated with a random sequence of flood events. The blue horizontal line represents the AAL over that time period. That
 information feeds into the generation of the LEC information shown in panel b—that is, the probability of exceeding a certain level of loss in a year. The risk assessment atlas
 (RMSI 2016b) provides AAL tables for the entire Ganges basin and for individual subbasins—by country and by asset class—for floods ranging from a 2-year return period to a
 100-year return period. An LEC is also provided for each subbasin. AAL = average annual loss; LEC = loss exceedance curve.



 32                                                      Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins
                                               AAL (figure 2.3, panel a) is particularly important to the insurance industry for risk
                                             pricing. LECs (figure 2.3, panel b) are useful for understanding whether the risk is driven
                                             by large or small events. Panel b of figure 2.3 shows, for example, that the probability of
                                             incurring a loss of US$200 million within a single year at this location is about 50 percent
                                             (a 2-year return period event). In other words, the probability of at least some flood-
                                             related losses over the course of a year is quite high. For higher levels of loss, the
                                             probability is lower. This type of information is useful for public policy making and for
                                             insurance applications.
                                               For the Ganges flood risk assessment, an LEC was fitted to the modeled flood events
                                             using standard regression techniques. The return period of any loss could therefore be
                                             estimated, and the AAL could be calculated. Based on the flood hazard maps, direct losses
                                             were calculated for each flood scenario (2- to 100-year return periods) for all at-risk
                                             exposures. Hazard-related financial losses are different for different types of structure or
                                             asset.

Note: The Ganges flood risk assessment produced a comprehensive set of flood risk maps for a variety of asset classes. These examples of flood risk maps are from the Kosi
subbasin, for a flood with a 100-year return period, showing number of people affected (panel a); commercial buildings, AAL (panel b); road networks, AAL (panel c); and
maize crop, AAL (panel d). On each map, the darker the color, the greater the disruption or loss. The risk assessment atlas provides similar maps for all subbasins and asset
classes. AAL = average annual loss.

                                               Finally, a comprehensive set of risk maps was generated for selected return periods,
                                            showing the geographic distribution of affected populations and assets. Map 2.5, for
                                            example, shows selected risk assessment maps for the Kosi subbasin. Maps are often the
                                            simplest and most powerful way to convey crucial hazard and risk information.
                                               Findings: A complete set of loss tables, LECs, and risk maps is provided in the risk assessment
                                            atlas. The atlas includes risk maps for a dozen different attributes (populations and
                                            various asset classes) for 18 Ganges subbasins (map 2.5). This type of information is useful
                                            to a wide range of people—from policy makers to individual farmers and residents.

                                            An augmented, updated version of the risk assessment maps for India is available online
                                            as the interactive Ganges Basin - Flood Risk Atlas (figure 2.4), which is hosted by India’s
                                            CWC (CWC and RMSI 2016b).
                                               The online atlas provides easy-to-use access to the flood risk assessment data and
                                            results. This information is available for a wide range of spatial scales—from the basin
                                            level down to individual blocks. Anyone with Internet access can use the interactive atlas
                                            to visualize flood impacts, analyze base exposure and risk data, and also generate reports.
                                               Examples are shown in figures 2.5–2.6.

                                              Flood frequency. The Ganges basin has a very high flood frequency. Some states and
                                              provinces experience very high losses due to floods every year or nearly every year. These
                                              areas would benefit from immediate attention to flood risk reduction. Possible measures
                                              might include the construction of protective walls, elevation or realignment of roads,
                                              improvements to drainage systems, migration of assets and people from high-risk zones
                                              to safer areas, and changes in cropping patterns and other land use practices.
                                                 Affected populations. For a Ganges River flood with a two-year return period (a relatively
                                              minor flood), the number of people affected is approximately 47 million (10 percent of the
                                              total basin population). About 45 percent of this affected population lives in India. The
                                              Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have the highest numbers—about 18 million and
                                              17 million people, respectively. In Bangladesh, the Rajshahi Division has the highest
                                              number—0.99 million. In Nepal, Province No. 2 (defined by the latest constitution to be
                                              completely within the Tarai region) would be hardest hit, with about 0.16 million people
                                              affected. Figure 2.7 shows the various populations affected by a modeled two-year flood,

Within this Indian subpopulation, 10.53 million are children (ages 0–6 years), 10.81 million
are members of scheduled castes, and 0.87 million are members of scheduled tribes.
About 5.03 million are girl children, 5.15 million are women from scheduled castes, and
0.42 million are women from scheduled tribes.
  For a Ganges River flood with a 100-year return period (a major flood event), the number of
people affected is approximately 73 million (16 percent of the total basin population; map
2.7). Out of the total affected population of 73.37 million (about 52 percent male and 48
percent female; figure 2.7), 70.75 million persons (96 percent) are from India. Within this
Indian subpopulation, 11.54 million are children (ages 0–6 years), 11.89 million are
members of scheduled castes, and 0.94 million are members of scheduled tribes. About
5.51 million are girl children, 5.67 million are women from scheduled castes, and 0.46
million are women from scheduled tribes.
  Economic losses: Average annual losses. The AAL due to floods basin-wide is more than

Note: The Ganges risk assessment mapped the populations affected by floods of various return periods. This example is for a 100-
year flood. On the map, the darker the color, the greater the number of people affected. The total number of people estimated
to be affected is about 73.37 million—roughly 16 percent of the total basin population. RP = return period.

       The largest fraction of AAL (65 percent) is associated with damaged residential buildings
     (table 2.2). Commercial buildings also contribute significantly.
       Most severe impacts: Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in India and some areas of Bangladesh. For a
     two-year return period flood, the following blocks and districts are among the most
     significantly affected: Patna Rural, Bihar, India, and Kushtia, Bangladesh, in terms of
     numbers of affected persons; Patna Rural and Dinapur-Cum-Khagaul, Bihar, India, in
     terms of residential building losses; Mohiuddinagar and Patepur, Bihar, India, in terms of

     terms of industrial building losses. All of these losses are concentrated in the Lower
     Ganges subbasin.
       Most severe impacts: The Lower Ganges subbasin. Flood disruption, damage, and losses are
     concentrated in low-lying areas of the Lower Ganges subbasin, which includes the Indian
     state of Bihar and parts of Bangladesh. Here, the flat topography allows even a two-year
     flood to spread over a vast swath of densely populated and extensively cultivated
     floodplain, thereby causing great damage. For a 100-year flood, overbank waters spread
     beyond the densely populated low-lying areas into sparsely populated outskirts. Thus,

                                                           difference in disruption and damage is not proportional to the difference in flood discharge.

                                                           estimated to include approximately 8,000 people in Nepal, 717,000 people in Bangladesh,
                                                           and 9,573,000 people in India. If these numbers are compared with the total population

                                                           flood is estimated to impact approximately one-tenth of the population living in the

       The Lower Ganges AAL is approximately US$150 million (table 2.3), with residential
     buildings contributing the greatest proportion (US$110 million, or nearly three-quarters
     of the total). Commercial buildings (US$29 million) and the rice crop (US$4 million) also
     contribute significantly. Figure 2.9 shows the LEC for the Lower Ganges subbasin.
       Table 2.4 shows the state or province-level AALs within the Lower Ganges subbasin.
     The highest AAL, by far, occurs in Bihar—more than an order of magnitude greater than
     any other state or province in the subbasin. West Bengal in India and Rajshahi in
     Bangladesh also contribute significantly to the subbasin AAL (10.8 percent and 3.5 percent
     of the total, respectively).
       According to media reports, the 2016 Bihar floods (along the main-stem Ganges) caused
     huge losses and damages—reportedly the worst in 10 years. The flood magnitude was not
     of a very high return period, but the damage was considerable and widespread. The
     primary reason, as noted above, was Bihar’s gently sloping terrain and the concentration
     of extensive settlements and agriculture close to the river.
       An important consideration for the Lower Ganges region is its extreme poverty. The
     monetary value of household assets (that is, individual economic exposure to floods) is
     very low, with some areas being poorer than Sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, floods that
     cause extreme suffering for the poorest of the poor do not show significant economic
     disruption and losses at the household level, even for return periods as great as 50 years.
     For a 100-year flood, the significant increase in estimated economic losses is driven by
     damage to high-value assets such as railways and roads. Impacts to agricultural assets are
     variable, depending in large part on flood duration.


     Looking to the Future
     According to the IWMI, global flood losses are expected to increase in the future—from
     more than US$100 billion to approximately US$450 billion by the year 2030. Large
     transboundary basins such as the Ganges and the Brahmaputra will contribute a significant
     share of these losses. Contributing factors include unplanned development, high

population densities, modifications to the natural geography, and more frequent high-
intensity rainfall events due to the changing climate. With these changing conditions,
transboundary cooperation will become increasingly important.
  Another important aspect of climate change is the increasing likelihood that the region
may experience extreme weather events and climate conditions with no historical
precedent. Flood risk assessments may therefore need to consider not only historical
events but also the likely evolution of future conditions. Risk managers may need to
consider the possibility of more catastrophic events in the future.
  The Ganges basin risk assessment is static in the sense that it considers a “snapshot” of
fixed assets in the basin (for example, roads and buildings) at a certain point in time, plus
historical information about flood intensity. However, the framework of the analysis is,
notably, probability-based. Because risks may change through time in response to climate
change (among other factors), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
views probabilistic risk assessment frameworks as an acceptable way forward for the
consideration of climate change scenarios and climate risk management.
  Policies to address uncertain risks—such as those that arise from climate change and
future socioeconomic development—must be based on a robust but flexible approach.
Adaptive management, wherein decisions are made as part of an ongoing science-based
process, can be expected to become increasingly important in an era of rapid climate
change combined with ongoing human-induced changes in the basin catchments.
Adaptive management involves planning, acting, and then monitoring and evaluating
outcomes. Adaptive management also incorporates new knowledge as it becomes
available. This approach is already a core element of integrated flood management (see
Section 1).


Recommendations for Further Risk Assessment Improvements
This risk assessment, though comprehensive, can in the future be further refined.
Recommendations to improve the Ganges basin risk assessment include the following:
•	 Improve data availability
•	 Include additional asset classes (for example, bridges, pipelines, livestock) and losses
   due to business disruption
•	 Further analyze the sector-specific economic impacts of weather-related disasters
•	 Give greater consideration to social vulnerability and the adaptive capacity of people
   living in flood-prone areas
•	 Identify optimal mitigation measures for specific sites that are vulnerable to flooding
  Additional technical recommendations can be found in the original RMSI risk
assessment report (RMSI 2016a).

       Even without additional refinement, the current findings can be used to address urgent
     needs—by applying the assessment results in management planning and resilience
     building by stakeholders.


     Concluding Remarks
     The findings of this risk assessment can help policy makers, disaster management authorities,
     and district and block development officials to minimize flood losses and flood impacts.
     Quantitative details and local-scale maps are available in the final technical report and
     the accompanying risk atlas. These resources show not only the areas that are highly
     flood prone but also the assets that are at risk. The results are expressed in terms of AAL,
     LECs, and thematic risk maps. As such, the results can help officials to identify priority
     areas for immediate flood-mitigation and risk-reduction activities, including flood
     forecasting.
       Highly vulnerable areas of the Ganges River basin include the states of Bihar and Uttar
     Pradesh in India, as well as areas of Bangladesh. Many of these vulnerabilities—in terms of
     numbers of people affected and in terms of losses to various asset classes—are concentrated
     in the Lower Ganges subbasin.
       The most severely affected subbasin, in terms of both affected population and flood losses,
     is the densely populated Lower Ganges. This subbasin is flood prone due to its downriver
     location and flat topography. The downriver location also gives the Lower Ganges
     subbasin the advantages of a potentially longer lead time for flood forecasting and
     warning. Longer lead times are most valuable in cases where flood risk is very high—for
     example, at the downstream part of the subbasin. Advance warning provides time for
     authorities to evacuate people, to better plan, and to protect critical assets from flood
     losses.
       The Lower Ganges subbasin is therefore an ideal candidate for future flood mitigation and
     flood forecasting work. Other priority subbasins might include the Kosi, Bagmati, Ghagra,
     Gandak, Kamla-Balan, Middle Ganges, and Mahananda. These areas, too, are highly prone to
     devastating floods each year or at least every other year. A skillful flood forecasting system
     for these subbasins would be useful to the people, local authorities, and monetary
     organizations of the region. As an initial measure, flood protection measures could be
     provided along river banks.
       Comprehensive flood risk assessment at the subbasin level goes hand in hand with flood
     forecasting. The risk assessment makes a strong case for operational flood forecasting in
     the Ganges subbasins that are extremely vulnerable to floods of low return period (that is,
     relatively frequent flooding). Risk assessment and flood forecasting are both essential
     components of a people-centered, end-to-end flood risk management and early warning
     system. Together, they can be used to give a broader, clearer picture of flood risk in the
     entire Ganges basin and to facilitate the estimation of potential damages.




44   Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins
  Comprehensive flood risk assessment and flood forecasting are needed by public and
private institutions across a variety of socioeconomic sectors. As demonstrated here, the
scope of a flood risk assessment can include losses in terms of numbers of people affected;
physical damage to residential, commercial, and public infrastructure; and losses to
agriculture. Such information has many applications. For example, a forward-looking
residential organization such as a housing society may require a flood risk assessment
during a project’s planning and management phase. Public disaster management
institutions must have adequate information to demarcate flood-prone areas, manage
land use and land development, develop flood control measures, alert public and acting
authorities to impending flood threats, define zones of action during a flood, and then
finally estimate damages after the flood. Small- and medium-size organizations need
probable estimates of loss to direct human and financial resources to deal with flood
disasters, whereas large companies and institutions may look at the overall effects of
flood risk on their organizational systems. Agriculture sectors depend heavily on
measures taken and warnings issued by public sector organizations. Risk assessment is
central to the insurance industry and other financial planning agencies.
  A comprehensive flood risk assessment and forecasting system, bolstered by cooperation
from relevant institutions, would greatly aid in the mitigation of adverse flood effects. Such
information, especially at the state or subbasin levels would also facilitate planning and
management for the optimum utilization of water resources and the development of
early flood warning systems.
  A comprehensive flood risk assessment and forecasting system would also consider the
evolution of flood risks and flood characteristics through time in response to climate change
and human alterations in basin catchments. Such a system would include the ability to
incorporate new knowledge as it becomes available. The risk assessment methods and
forecasting developments highlighted in this report are probability-based and are
therefore well suited to incorporate consideration of changing flood characteristics
through time.
  Detailed map-based risk assessments could be usefully initiated for other river basins in
the region. Because every basin is unique, it is difficult to provide a detailed roadmap for
the process. Nevertheless, the Ganges procedures might be useful in other basins; details
are provided in the original technical report (RMSI 2016a). Important considerations in
launching a risk assessment include the urgency of need, as well as the constraints of
available funding, time, and data. The Brahmaputra River basin—known for its complex
topography, very high annual rainfall (in some areas), and frequent flooding—would be a
sensible next candidate.

Section 3   Improving Flood Forecasts through Innovative
            Modeling and Data Incorporation

            Introduction
            Anticipating and preparing for the arrival of floodwaters is a proven cost-effective option for
            minimizing flood damage. According to the Asian Development Bank’s Early Warning
            Study (as reported by Subbiah et al. 2008), for small famers in Bangladesh:
            •	 A one-day flood-warning lead time yields estimated damage reductions ranging from
                1 percent (reduced losses of chickens and ducks) to 33 percent (reduced losses of
                cultured fishes).
            •	 A seven-day flood-warning lead time yields estimated damage reductions ranging
                from 15 percent (for school or office settings) to 90 percent (for household settings);
                estimated reductions for the agricultural and cultured-fisheries sectors are about 70
                percent.
              Longer warning times go beyond saving lives to ensuring livelihood support (box 3.1).
              In 2007, Bangladesh experienced moderate floods (return period of five years).
            According to a 2009 background paper prepared for the World Bank (Teisberg and Weiher
            2009), a forecasting and early warning system for these floods could have reduced
            damages by an estimated US$207.9 million. The sources of these benefits would have
            been the evacuation of movable assets, including livestock, plus the early harvesting of
            crops, fishes, and shrimp. The estimated benefits over a decade of typical flooding would
            amount to approximately US$1,700 million—more than 500 times the cost of the
            hypothetical forecasting and warning system.

             The longer the forecast lead time, the greater the forecast uncertainty. ESCAP
             therefore recommends to complement longer-lead (less certain) flood forecasts
             with shorter-range (more certain) forecasts.

          Several groups are currently working to improve flood forecasts and increase flood
     warning times for the South Asia region.
          This section reports on recent advances from a Ganges-Brahmaputra project at the
     National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), United States.
          A fuller description of the NCAR project is available in this publication: Evaluation of
     Flood Forecasting Predictability: Technical Report (Hopson and Priya 2017).
          NCAR flood forecasts, data, and maps are available online on this website: World Bank
     – South Asia Water Initiative: Ganges and Brahmaputra Hydrometeorologic Predictability
     (http://indiawbg.rap.ucar.edu).


     Addressing Gaps in Transboundary Flood Forecasting
     Following up on regional assessments of operational flood capacity, NCAR conducted a
     technical study to develop and evaluate an advanced lead-time flood forecasting system for
     the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers. The focus was on riverine flooding. Flash
     floods are inherently more difficult to predict, especially with long lead times.
          The NCAR project included:
     •	 Assessment of foundational data sets, with a focus on satellite-derived data and
           numerical weather prediction
     •	 Integration of these data sets into an enhanced forecasting scheme, including an
           emphasis on operational forecasts for societal benefit
     •	    Online posting of data and forecast files and web displays (visualizations), for potential
           benefit to on-the-ground operations and decision making
     •	 Assessment of the overall skill of the system in forecasting river flooding

  Rainfall is the driving force behind most South Asia floods, especially in lower basin reaches.
Therefore, the flood forecasting process starts (figure 3.1) by looking at weather-center
predictions of rainfall for the next two weeks, rainfall measurements during the preceding
weeks, and various measures of river flow. Computer models and statistical methods
then blend and process that information to produce a set of river forecasts for selected
locations. Finally, the forecasts and some of the underlying data are packaged for
dissemination to water-resources agencies, decision makers, and other stakeholders.
  The NCAR forecasting scheme is unique in its reliance on “blending” techniques and
redundancy safeguards. Specifically, the scheme is unique in its use of multiple probability-
based rainfall forecasts, multiple sets of rainfall observations, and multiple internal
forecasting models.

     or data set can compensate for weaknesses in another (figure 1.6).
•	 Redundancy safeguards. Having duplicate data sources helps to guard against system
     failure. If one instrument goes down—for example, if a satellite stops transmitting
     rainfall data—others are still available to guide the flood forecast.
  The NCAR operational forecasting scheme provides short- to medium-range forecasts, with
lead times ranging from one day to two weeks. Lead times of this length are useful for
saving lives and preserving livelihood assets (box 3.1; table 3.1). NCAR focuses on riverine
flooding (box 1.1), but some of the rainfall data and maps may also be useful for flash flood
warnings (figure 1.6).


Probability-Based Information for Decision Making
The NCAR flood forecasts are probability-based (“ensemble”) forecasts, which provide
extra information that is useful to decision makers. In an “ensemble”-type forecast, the
predictions of river conditions are expressed as a collection (ensemble) of forecasts (figure
3.2). These calibrated collections express the likelihood (probability) that future water

  Note: The NCAR flood forecasts are actually collections (ensembles) of individual member forecasts. The group as a whole conveys information about not only future water
  levels but also the appropriate level of confidence in the forecast. In this redrawn screenshot, the forecast outlook is for 16 days (from early July, 2017), and each blue line
  represents one member of the forecast ensemble. The spread of the blue lines indicates forecast uncertainty. Typically, near-term forecasts are more certain than longer-term
  forecasts—as indicated by the tight bunching of the blue lines for the early days of the forecast. The envelope of blue lines also indicates probabilities, which is useful for
  decision making. A download button (not shown here) allows users to download the forecast in table form. This example is for the Baltara stream-gauge station on the Kosi
  River in India.




                                                levels will fall within a certain range or above or below a certain threshold. This type of
                                                information is especially useful for deciding whether to respond to a possibly developing
                                                flood event—and if so, how.
                                                  Ensemble-type forecasts inherently express the level of confidence that is appropriate for
                                                each forecast. Tightly clustered ensemble members indicate a higher degree of confidence
                                                (figure 3.2). The wider the spread, the greater the forecast uncertainty and the lower the
                                                confidence.
                                                  In other words, this type of forecast reports not only the most likely water-level value
                                                but also the likely range. Consider a flood forecast that predicts that next week’s water
                                                level will be 70 meters. A 70-meter forecast with an accompanying (narrow) probable
                                                range of 69–71 meters is very different from a 70-meter forecast with an accompanying
                                                (wide) probable range of 60–80 meters—especially if the danger level is 75 meters.
                                                Knowing not only the most likely value but also the likely range helps people to make
                                                better-informed decisions.
                                                  Figure 3.2 illustrates an important forecasting principle: uncertainty (typically)
                                                increases as the forecast extends farther into the future.
                                                  Ensemble-type forecasts inherently express danger-level probability. In other words, this
                                                type of forecast does not answer the question, “Over the next three days, is the river
                                                predicted to flood above the danger level—yes or no?” Instead, this type of forecast

                                                 answers the question, “Over the next three days, what is the probability that the river will
                                                 flood above the danger level?” Knowing whether the probability is 10 percent or 90
                                                 percent helps people decide when to take action (or not) and to judge what actions (if any)
                                                 might be most appropriate.
                                                    Panel a of figure 3.3 shows the 12-day-ahead ensemble forecast for the Bahadurabad
                                                 stream gauge during three monsoon seasons, 2014–2016. The thin colored lines show the
                                                 individual members of the forecast collection (ensemble). The blue area shows the
                                                 “critical discharge” (danger) flood level. The solid black line shows actual river flow. Every
                                                 year danger-level floods were predicted (when the colored lines enter the blue zone), and
                                                 every year danger-level floods did occur (when the black line enters the blue zone).
                                                    Panel b of figure 3.3 shows a different type of flood forecast. Here, the red line shows the
                                                 12-day-ahead predicted probability (likelihood) that river flow would exceed
                                                 Bahadurabad’s danger-level threshold. The predicted likelihood of a dangerous flood was
                                                 very low most of the time. Then the likelihood increased sharply on three occasions.
                                                 Disaster-preparedness officials can use this type of forward-looking “how likely?”
                                                 information to help fine-tune their flood warnings and preparations.
                                                    Ensemble-type forecasts can map directly to decision-making considerations, including
                                                 economic decision making. The value of a flood forecast depends not only on forecasting
                                                 skill but also on how people use the forecast. For example, risk management officials
                                                 must decide at what point public warnings should be issued and what recommendations

     should be made. For individual residents, many considerations go into deciding whether
     to act on a flood warning or not: Is my livelihood or life threatened? How much will it cost
     me to respond to the warning? How much damage might I incur if I ignore the warning?
     Probability-based forecasts can help people to make these decisions.
       As a simple example, consider a community that farms large fields of paddy (rice). In 10
     days, the rice will be fully mature and can be sold for US$100—but the 10-day flood
     forecast indicates a 60 percent chance of the nearby river flooding and ruining the crop
     during that time (table 3.2).
     •	 Should the community act, given the 60 percent probability that the river will flood?
          Harvesting early comes with a cost: lower crop yield and quality, plus a longer drying
          time. The harvested crop will be 100 percent safe but worth only US$70.
     •	 Should the community not act, given the 40 percent probability that the river will not
          flood? If the river stays within its banks, the crop will be worth US$100. But if the river
          does flood, the community loses everything.
       If the flood forecasting model is properly calibrated, then the forecast probabilities
     provide guidance for these questions. For the scenario in table 3.2, simple mathematical
     calculations lead to the following conclusions:
     •	 The community that consistently plays it safe and harvests the crop early will, over
          time, realize an average profit of US$70 per event.
     •	 The community that consistently takes a chance and leaves the crop in the field will,
          over time, realize an average profit of US$40 per event.
       The bottom line is that under these conditions, acting on the flood warning makes good
     economic sense.
       But what about other conditions and other scenarios? More general insight comes from
     considering, for a given forecast user, the ratio of (a) the cost of acting on a flood warning
     to (b) the loss incurred by not acting and then losing assets to the flood. As a simple
     example, consider users at two extremes:

•	 Acting on a warning costs little, but the user’s potential losses are high: this person
   will be inclined to act on a danger-level warning even if the probability of flooding is
   low.
•	 Responding to a warning is expensive compared with the user’s potential losses: this
   person will be inclined to wait until the probability of flooding is high.
  In fact, the break-even danger-level probability for any user to act on is theoretically
equal to their cost-to-loss ratio. In the case of the rice-growing community of table 3.2,
the cost of acting on the flood warning is US$30. The loss incurred by not acting and being
flooded is US$100. So the community’s cost-to-loss ratio is 0.3. Over the long term, then,
the community will benefit economically by acting on a flood warning (harvesting early)
whenever the danger-level probability is higher than 30 percent. When the danger-level
probability is less than 30 percent, the best strategy is to leave the crop in the field.
  Ensemble-type (probability-based) flood forecasts can provide objective guidance for
decision making. This hypothetical rice harvest example, though highly simplified,
illustrates how probability-based flood forecasts can be used to provide objective
guidance for making decisions. In “real life,” similar principles—but with more
sophisticated calculations—would be used. Similar considerations can be applied to
flood-related choices in other sectors—for example, decisions about dam management or
the relocation of livestock. Because of the usefulness of links like these, calibrated
probabilistic flood forecasts are being increasingly used to guide objective decision
support systems and to provide helpful visualizations related to flood risk.


Evaluating the Utility of New Forecasting Methods
Many types of information can be useful in predicting river conditions (figure 1.6). NCAR
therefore evaluated and refined several tools relevant to its flood forecasting scheme, in
the following ways:
•	 Developed a method to optimally site rain gauges
•	 Developed protocols to retrieve and process hourly data from hundreds of stream
   gauges (map 3.2)
•	 Identified appropriate stream-gauge locations to serve as forecasting locations
   (map 3.1)
•	 Developed methods to estimate river flow from measurements of river water level
   (“river height”) (see http://indiawbg.rap.ucar.edu/RateFit/)
•	 Developed methods to predict river flow based on measurements of upstream water
   levels
•	 Evaluated accuracy of satellite-derived rainfall measurements and utility of satellite-
   based estimates of upstream river level and width
•	 Developed automated quality-control procedures for incoming data
•	 Developed methods to blend and calibrate rainfall and river forecasts, in order to
   produce flood forecasts tailored to specific catchments

                                              therefore developed an automated procedure to gather and blend input from a variety of
                                              sources, to produce “multi-model,” catchment-specific, calibrated ensemble forecasts of
                                              future rainfall and stream flow:
                                              •	 Blending multi-model input is important because the resulting forecasts are generally
                                                   more skillful than forecasts that rely on only a single input.
                                              •	 Catchment-specific weighting is important because some weather centers perform
                                                   better for some catchments than others (the weighting is based on past performance).
                                              •	 Calibration is important because it removes biases in the data and attaches an accurate
                                                   estimate of likelihood to future rainfall or river conditions.

                                              particular point, but flood forecasting requires estimates from a large area. Satellites
                                              provide a basin-wide view and can help provide necessary information where rain gauges
                                              alone are insufficient.
                                                 Satellite observations of rainfall are especially valuable where rain gauges are widely

                                              basins, especially outside of India, ground-based measurements of rainfall are spaced far
                                              apart. Obtaining adequate rain-gauge data can be especially challenging in mountainous
                                              regions, where close spacing is required but the terrain is difficult to work in. Cost can
                                              also be a limiting factor. In some cases, rain-gauge data may be collected but may not be
                                              freely available to others. Satellite rainfall estimates (map 3.3) are therefore important for
                                              producing skillful flood forecasts throughout the basin catchments. The NCAR forecasting
                                              scheme uses rainfall measurements at scattered points (rain-gauge locations) across the
                                              basin, as well as basin-wide satellite-based rainfall estimates from three different
                                              organizations.
                                                 Satellite measurements complement but do not replace rain gauges. For specific (small-
                                              scale) locations, rainfall estimates from satellites are far less accurate than rain-gauge
                                              measurements.
                                                 Finding: Blending rainfall measurements from multiple sources can improve flood forecasts:
                                              •	 Rain gauges work best (are most accurate) when used to represent rainfall over small

Note: The NCAR flood forecasting scheme uses rainfall data from rain gauges and from satellites to help predict river flow. The map colors show average August rainfall, which
ranges from less than 2 millimeters per day (white) to more than 26 millimeters per day (purple). The small graphs, which show average rainfall over the course of a year,
illustrate that the estimates of rainfall from rain gauges (blue lines) and satellites (red lines) are mostly similar (January–December averages, 2000–15). The agreement is less
good within basins where rain gauges are widely spaced (Meghna, for example).

                                              300 ensemble members daily). The NCAR flood forecasting scheme is one of the world’s
                                              first to incorporate information from so many different weather centers.

Note: Flood forecasts can be improved by using different rainfall forecasts for different catchments. Panels a–d show evaluations of rainfall forecasts from four different
weather centers, each evaluated within individual catchments. The “hotter” the color, the better the rainfall prediction. For example, the UKMET forecast provides the best
predictions for the Manas (M) catchment but the worst predictions for the Lower Ganges (LG) catchment. The single best overall forecast is the ECMWF. Panel e shows the
results for a “multi-model” blended (simple average) forecast. In most catchments, the multi-model forecast is the best choice—as good as or better than the single best center.

                                            NCAR combines information about upstream river conditions with estimates of water
                                            travel times (map 1.2). NCAR therefore evaluated the usefulness of incorporating different
                                            types of river data from locations upstream of the forecast sites:
                                            •	 River level measured by stream gauges
                                            •	 River level estimated by satellite (new)
                                            •	 River width estimated by satellite (new)
                                               Map 3.2 shows the locations of the satellite-based estimates. Figure 3.4 illustrates the
                                            concept of the new estimates of river width.
                                               Information about upstream river conditions can be especially useful where rainfall is
                                            difficult to measure—for example, in areas of steep terrain. River-condition data from
                                            satellites are particularly useful for monitoring locations between stream gauges, as well

Note: Satellite-derived measurements of river width can be useful in forecasting later water levels at a downstream location. Satellite (microwave emissivity) measurements
within the red box can differentiate the extent of inundation seen in these two example images from the Wabash River (United States). Map 3.2 shows where these types of
measurements are made in the GBM basins.

     as locations where data sharing may be slow or nonexistent. Even where stream gauges
     are closely spaced, satellite measurements can provide a helpful layer of redundancy.
       Satellite measurements complement but do not replace stream gauges. Stream gauges are
     especially valuable because forecasters use them not only to generate river forecasts but
     also to evaluate new forecasting methods. Stream gauges must be accessible, calibrated,
     and regularly maintained. To be most effective, site-specific guidance must be used to
     convert gauge measurements of water level (“river height”) to estimates of river discharge.
       Finding: The new satellite-derived estimates of river water level (“height”) yield significant
     benefits. NCAR has therefore developed routines to use this information in its flood
     forecasts. An improved satellite mission is scheduled to launch in about 2020 (the Surface
     Water and Ocean Topography mission).
       Finding: The new satellite-derived estimates of river width range from useful to not useful,
     depending on location. Operational use of these measurements is promising but must
     include strict quality control. Overall, the satellite measurements of upstream river width
     can enhance forecast accuracy and are used routinely in the NCAR scheme.


     Evaluating NCAR Forecast Skill and Reliability
     There are many different ways to assess the skill and reliability of a flood forecasting
     system. A few examples are presented here.
       Finding: The longer the forecast lead time, the greater the forecast uncertainty. NCAR
     provides flood forecasts for the next 16 days—but just as with weather forecasts, a flood
     forecast for tomorrow is (typically) more certain than a forecast for next week. This
     characteristic can be seen in the flood forecast shown in figure 3.2.
       Finding: The blended NCAR forecast scheme provides generally greater skill and reliability
     than forecasts based only on individual data inputs. An important question is whether
     significant benefit accrues from using a complex (multi-model, multi-data) forecasting
     scheme rather than a simpler, more convenient approach. NCAR therefore assessed forecast
     skill for the different approaches at 18 different locations. The results were as follows:
     •	 Forecasts based only on gauge measurements of upstream water levels provide lead
        times of 1 to 16 days.
     •	 Forecasts based only on satellite measurements of upstream river widths provide lead
        times of 0 to 12 days.
     •	 Forecasts based on both upstream gauges and satellite information provide lead times
        of 3 to 16 days.
       Forecasts based on the full NCAR model provide the best skill and reliability—well past
     16 days in all cases. These estimates of skillful lead times are conservative (because they
     are based on a demanding economics-based metric).
       Map 3.5 illustrates, in a different way, the same point—that the multi-model, multi-data
     approach of the NCAR forecasting scheme does provide significant benefit in improving
     forecasting skill.

Note: These maps show outcomes for three different types of flood forecasts at 16-day lead times: panel a based on local river gauges, panel b based on local river gauges
and upstream river information (river gauges and satellite-based river width), and panel c based on local and upstream river information, plus predicted and measured rainfall
(the NCAR scheme). The outlines on the maps show catchments within the GBM basins. The “warmer” colors (purple, red, orange) indicate more skillful forecasts, and the
“cooler” colors (blues) indicate less skillful forecasts. The hatched areas indicate catchments where data were not available.




                                                Finding: Rainfall information is especially powerful in improving flood forecasts. Map 3.5
                                              illustrates the increase in skill that rainfall information can provide. Panel a shows the
                                              skill of a multi-model forecast that relies only on river-level information from a local
                                              gauge. Panel b shows the improvement that comes with the addition of river information
                                              from upstream locations—about a one-day improvement in useful lead time. Panel c
                                              shows the dramatic improvement that comes from including rainfall information (weather
                                              forecasts + rainfall observations). This improvement translates to forecasts with skill out
                                              to more than three weeks in lead time.
                                                Finding: For almost all basins, the NCAR flood forecasts show significant utility, even at
                                              long (16-day) lead times. Figure 3.5 shows one measure of forecast skill. The higher the
                                              “skill score,” the better the forecast. For all basins, regardless of size, the NCAR forecasts
                                              score significantly better than zero. Other measures of forecast skill (not shown here)
                                              yield essentially the same result. The NCAR system limits its forecasts to 16 days because
                                              the underlying rainfall forecasts are available for only the next 16 days.

                                                 for systems where extreme thresholds are a primary concern, as in the case of river
                                                 flooding (see figure 3.3, for example).
                                                   Finding: The NCAR ensemble forecasts exhibit clear economic benefit for a wide range of
                                                 users. As noted above, a theoretical “cost-loss” analysis is one way to identify whether
                                                 users might benefit from an improved flood forecast. NCAR case studies suggest that
                                                 users over a wide range of cost-to-loss ratios would economically benefit from the new
                                                 probabilistic multi-model, multi-data forecasting scheme. The details of the benefits
                                                 depend on forecast lead time.

                                                Rainfall, predicted and measured. Many flood events can be anticipated just by identifying
                                             areas of severe rainfall. This capability can be especially useful for anticipating flash

                                                Most of the forecast locations are along primary river channels. India’s CWC and

                                                For most of the stations, monsoon-season water-level information is available from
                                              February 2015 to the present time.

                                              seasonal rainfall forecasts are the latest addition. The seasonal forecasts are available here:

                                              averaging period,” choose “1 month” or “3 months.”)
                                                Next steps: Linking river discharge forecasts and inundation maps. NCAR and the
                                              Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) are collaborating to integrate two types of river flow
                                              information: the operational NCAR forecasts of future river flow and the experimental
                                              River Watch satellite observations of historical inundation. The prototype website for the
                                              Ganges-Brahmaputra Flood Awareness and Prediction System can be viewed here:
                                              http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/GangesBrahmaputra/GangesBrahmaputraIndex.html.
                                                Converting the forecasts of river flow to maps of predicted inundation would be especially
                                              useful. Such maps provide an immediately accessible, visual sense of the likely extent of
                                              oncoming floodwaters. One approach (among several possibilities) is to relate NCAR’s
                                              predicted discharge to DFO historical imagery from times of similar discharge (map 3.6).
                                              Other methods of integration are also being considered.

Note: Forecast maps of predicted flooding would be especially useful for decision makers. Panel a shows inundation associated with normal flow conditions. Panel b shows a
flood with a two-year return period, as was seen July 7–8, 2016. In late June (15 days earlier), the NCAR flood forecast had noted a 31 percent chance of this level of flooding
(or more) for July 8. On July 7 (one day earlier), the forecast gave a 90 percent probability. This type of probability information helps people to make informed decisions
about whether and when to take action to prepare for possible flooding. The Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) produced these pilot-program maps using its archived River
Watch imagery.

       This approach would be most useful where river channels and overbank conditions
     have not changed appreciably over the period of record. The highly dynamic Brahmaputra
     River, with its rapid bank erosion and frequent channel shifts, is not an ideal candidate.
     The fact that inundation extent depends also on water contributions from downstream
     tributaries (that is, “backwater” effects) lends an additional complexity.


     Recommendations and Options for Further Forecasting Improvements
     Improve the networks of instruments that measure flood-related processes. Diverse
     observational networks provide the strongest input for flood forecasting. Different
     measurements provide different, complementary views of the processes that influence
     inland flooding and inform flood forecasting schemes. Strengths in one data set can offset
     weaknesses in another. Redundant or overlapping measurements help guard against
     detrimental data gaps. Stream gauges provide the most accurate information about
     flooding but also, by themselves, the shortest forecast lead times. Satellite data are
     relatively inexpensive and are especially useful for augmenting on-the-ground
     measurements of rainfall and river characteristics.
       To strengthen observational networks, the following measures could be considered:
     •	 Introduce additional gauges to measure rainfall and river flow at strategic locations
        (for details, see the original technical report, Hopson and Priya 2017).
     •	 Consider using remotely sensed measurements to augment the gauge data, especially
        in inaccessible transboundary areas.
     •	 Consider installing ground radar stations to measure precipitation.
     •	 Implement a robust quality-control system.
     •	 Consider using crowd-sourced “reporting” as a source of low-cost observations of
        river levels.
       Improve the use of rainfall forecasts. Combining weather forecasts from a variety of
     weather centers provides the best predictions of catchment rainfall. The skill level of
     individual forecasts varies depending on location. Greatest benefit is attained through
     combining multiple weather forecasts.
       To strengthen weather-forecast inputs to flood forecasting schemes, the following
     measures could be considered:
     •	 Combine multiple rainfall forecasts for input to the flood forecasting scheme—ideally,
        the blending process should weight the incoming forecasts according to their past
        performance in the location of interest.
     •	 If only a single weather forecast is to be used a priori (that is, without quantitative
        evaluation), use the ECMWF forecast.
       Improve flood forecasting models. The use of multiple forecasting models that can work
     independently and in combination with each other provides advantages over the use of a
     single model. All three forecasting systems evaluated in this study were found to be




68   Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins
effective: forecasting based on local time series, forecasting based on upstream river
gauges, and full NCAR hydrological forecasting. Applying each scheme separately allows
for identification of the strengths and skill of each. Applying the schemes in combination
optimizes overall forecast skill. An example of a move toward an operational multi-model
system can be seen in the Bagmati River subbasin (box 3.2).
  To strengthen flood forecasting utility, the following measures could be considered:
•	 Use independent flood forecasting systems that can be combined to produce a single
   forecast informed by the different approaches.
•	 Explore the use of models that more adequately account for water-management
   practices that alter river flow (for example, reservoir storage and releases).
  Improve online displays of flood information. Web-based displays and objective decision
support systems can greatly improve the effective communication of flood risk. Mobile
access can further enhance access and convenience.
  To strengthen the communication of forecast-related information, the following measures
could be considered:
•	 Invest in systems to display forecast information (including mobile access), hand in
   hand with investments in improving the forecasting models.
•	 Provide automated “push” alert systems to communicate flood threats (for example,
   emails or text messages to mobile phones).
•	 Explore the use of site-specific visual messaging (for example, the coupling of river
   flow forecasts with historical imagery of flood inundation).
  General recommendations. To further enhance flood forecasting and communication for
societal benefit, the following measures could be considered:
•	 Develop forecasting systems that provide accurate estimates of their own forecasting
   uncertainty.
•	 Consider using blended (multi-model) approaches.
•	 Continue to encourage collaborative research and data sharing, data quality control,
   and the use of international standards for data handling and sharing.
•	 Integrate flood forecasts into decision support and flood warning systems.

report (Hopson and Priya 2017).




Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins     69
          BOX 3.2.   Flood Forecasting: Next Steps for Bihar

          Bihar, located along the Ganges River, is one of India’s most flood-prone states. The
          Bihar Flood Management Information System (FMIS), administered by the state
          Water Resources Department, works to advance regional flood forecasting and
          communication. As a part of that effort, FMIS is setting up a new flood-forecasting
          model for the Bagmati River subbasin.
            FMIS-Bihar is moving to a multi-modeling approach to flood forecasting. FMIS
          currently uses rain-gauge data and in-house forecasting models to provide
          deterministic flow forecasts with a few days lead time. The agency plans to begin
          incorporating “multi-model” 1- to 16-day rainfall forecasts. Through a World Bank
          initiative, NCAR has developed an algorithm to statistically assemble these forecasts,
          which are based on predictions provided by eight global weather centers around the
          world (the “global circulation models” shown in figure 1.6). For the Kosi basin
          simulations, these multi-model forecasts maintain a level of skill out to 16-day lead
          times. Going forward, multi-model rainfall forecasts from the eight global centers
          will be combined with the operational forecasts of the India Meteorological
          Department in a manner similar to the NCAR statistical blending approach.
            In parallel, NCAR ensemble-type discharge forecasts and probability-based
          alerts will also be provided. This second set of water-flow predictions, developed
          through a 2015–16 South Asia Water Initiative (SAWI) and World Bank initiative, uses
          multi-model rainfall predictions, rain-gauge data, and two independent satellite-
          derived estimates of rainfall. Flood alerts from this system will be provided
          automatically through email, SMS, and websites for mobile devices.
            These new forecasting tools will be used to improve flood warnings. The Bihar
          project will serve as a pilot exercise in the development of an operational flood
          forecasting system based on recent technical advances. Improvements in forecasting
          skill will be assessed in terms of reduced risks and losses in the coming years.

Section 4   Concluding Remarks and Recommendations

            In the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river basins, historical and potential future losses
            to flooding are high, in terms of both human and economic costs. Large areas of the basins
            are considered to be high-risk flood zones.
            •	 River floods can be both beneficial and catastrophic, with adverse effects sometimes
                exacerbated by human choices.
            •	 Flood-related losses and suffering can be diminished through the use of integrated flood
                management—the interweaving of land use management, water resources management,
                and risk management.
            •	 Flood-related losses and suffering can be diminished through the use of people-focused,
                end-to-end early warning systems—which include both technical and societal
                considerations.
            •	 ESCAP considers the enhancement of end-to-end early warning systems to be an area in
                need of urgent attention.
              Transboundary cooperation—between and within the countries of South Asia—will help to
            reduce human and economic losses to flooding. The GBM basins, which together constitute
            one of the world’s largest river catchments, encompass portions of six countries and serve
            as home to about 10 percent of the world’s population. In such basins, flood risk
            management requires international cooperation.
            •	 The success of technical advances in flood risk management (such as those highlighted in
                this report) depends ultimately on their operationalization—that is, on routine
                (operational) government-level inter-state (within the country) or transboundary



            Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins    71
        (international) cooperation and on the translation of that cooperation into beneficial
        action.
     •	 Opportunities for transboundary cooperation include collaborative research and the
        timely exchange of flood-related data, knowledge, experiences, forecasts, and warnings—
        for example, weather and river forecasts, rainfall and river data, and easy-to-understand
        visualizations.
     •	Operational        sharing   of   transboundary      flood-related    information    between
        hydrometeorological services and other stakeholders could usefully improve flood
        forecasting outcomes.
     •	 ESCAP considers the promotion of regional cooperation in addressing risks associated
        with transboundary river basin floods to be an urgent regional need.
       Some formal data sharing already occurs between the countries of the South Asia region.
     Formal sharing mechanisms have been established, for example, between China and
     India, Nepal and India, Bhutan and India, and India and Bangladesh. ICIMOD’s Hindu-
     Kush-Himalayan Hydrological Cycle Observing System (HKH-HYCOS) has also provided a
     venue for Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh to work together to establish a flood-
     observing network in selected basins, as well as flood information systems to facilitate
     real-time data exchange and increase flood forecasting and warning lead times. There can
     be significant upstream-downstream and regional economic incentives for data sharing
     for flood forecasting and early warning.
     •	 Cross-border cooperation on data sharing has a humanitarian dimension, but also helps
        to lower the risk of displaced people (“environmental refugees”) and to reduce impacts on
        production, especially in agriculture, which can minimize disruption to cross-border
        commodity trade.
       In an important step toward further operationalizing basin-level cooperation, participants
     at the 2015 Regional Flood Early Warning System Workshop expressed a desire to share
     national data and forecast information in the interest of reducing flood-related human and
     economic losses. This sharing will require a regional mechanism. Workshop participants
     therefore designed a regional program to address the challenges and capitalize on existing
     opportunities.
     •	 Regional cooperation on flood risk assessment, modeling, monitoring, response, mapping,
        and impact assessment could be usefully strengthened through agreed-upon regional
        and subregional strategies to share data, good practices, and knowledge.
       As another important step toward operationalizing basin-level cooperation, ESCAP, with
     support from RIMES, is now carrying forward the regional program designed by participants
     at the 2015 Regional Flood Early Warning System Workshop. As a part of its stepwise strategy
     toward extending regional cooperation for flood forecasting and early warning, ESCAP
     will convene an intergovernmental panel of meteorologists, hydrologists, and disaster
     risk management professionals from the operational organizations of the GBM riparian
     countries. Key partners may include ICIMOD, IWMI, and SAWI among others.


72   Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins
•	 Policy makers and other stakeholders may consider supporting the new ESCAP platform
      for regional collaboration on transboundary flooding.
     Risk assessment is an essential first step in flood risk management. The quantitative, map-
based flood risk assessment now available for the Ganges basin can help policy makers,
planners, and other stakeholders to identify priority focus areas and strategies. Maps are a
simple and especially powerful tool for conveying hazard and risk information—especially
for events that occur infrequently compared with human lifetimes (for example, major
flood events with a 100-year return period).
•	 The findings of the 2016 Ganges basin flood risk assessment can usefully guide future
      floodplain planning—for example, land use and evacuation planning.
•	 The methods of this analysis could be usefully applied in other river basins—for example,
      the Brahmaputra basin.
     Flood risk assessment shows that the most severely affected subbasin, in terms of both
affected population and flood losses, is the Lower Ganges. Average annual losses (AAL) in
this subbasin are more than US$100 million, due primarily to damage to residential and
commercial buildings and the rice crop. Residential buildings alone account for nearly
three-quarters of the total AAL.
•	 Due to its high vulnerability and its downstream location, the Lower Ganges subbasin is
      an ideal candidate for targeted flood mitigation and forecasting improvements.
•	 Other priority subbasins might include the Kosi, Bagmati, Ghagra, Gandak, Kamla-
      Balan, Middle Ganges, and Mahananda, which are also highly flood prone.
     Risk information—though essential—is by itself insufficient to effect significant change.
•	 The 2005 Hyogo Framework for Action named the identification, assessment, and
      monitoring of disaster risk as one of its top five priority actions.
•	 Accessible and usable risk information helps to increase risk awareness.
•	    Risk information empowers decision makers at every level to reduce flood risks by making
      informed decisions about land use planning, insurance, emergency response planning,
      water supply management, and the engineering and construction of infrastructure and
      buildings.
•	 Effective risk management requires not only information but also effective governance
      that places a high priority on disaster risk management.
     Flood forecasting is one of the most cost-effective nonstructural options for flood risk
reduction. In South Asia and elsewhere, flood management is increasingly turning to
nonstructural methods to complement traditional structural methods such as dams and
embankments. Forecasting in combination with early warning has proven to be effective
in saving lives and property. However, scientific forecasting advances may face delays in
transitioning to operational systems.
•	 The findings and methods of the NCAR flood forecasting evaluation project could be
      usefully implemented within other operational forecasting schemes.




Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins             73
     •	 The operational NCAR flood forecasts could be usefully incorporated into objective
           decision support systems and flood warning and visualization products.
     •	 Decision makers and other stakeholders may benefit from guidance in fully utilizing the
           benefits and capabilities of probability-based flood forecasts.
          Lack of data remains a major challenge for the region. The GBM countries have differing
     capacities in terms of risk assessment and flood forecasting, but lack of data is a challenge
     shared by all. Essential on-the-ground networks are being expanded, and complementary
     satellite-derived data have already proven helpful in quantifying flood drivers and flood
     impacts. Satellite-derived information, when used with a clear recognition of its
     limitations, can be especially useful in areas that are remote or otherwise inaccessible. All
     forms of risk-related information (hazard, demographic, statistical, and economic) tend
     to be less available in developing countries, especially in the least developed countries
     such as Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh.
     •	 A useful first step in data-gathering activities is the collection and recording of relevant
           hazard information (for example, rainfall amounts and river discharge).
     •	 Demographic, economic, statistical, and insurance data are also important, as is
           information about disaster occurrences, characteristics, and impacts.
     •	 Data gaps highlighted at the 2015 Regional Flood Early Warning System Workshop
           include insufficiencies in topographical data, river-channel hydrographic survey data,
           and hydrometeorological data.
     •	    Satellite-derived information would be especially useful for the Ganges and Brahmaputra
           basins, which both encompass large areas that are remote or otherwise inaccessible.
     •	 Dedicated data centers can help to ensure that data are not only collected but also
           monitored for quality control and then made available to end users in a usable form (for
           example, according to international standards).
          Technologies play a key role in not only data acquisition but also risk assessment, data
     sharing, flood forecasting and warning, and information dissemination and communication.
     •	 Efforts to design and expand cost-effective observing networks and capitalize on new
           sensor technologies could help to address current data gaps.
     •	 The adoption of relevant linchpin technologies—such as geographic information system
           (GIS) mapping, data ingestion and processing algorithms, and information visualization
           and communication tools—could help to strengthen operational end-to-end flood
           warning systems.
     •	 ESCAP has identified the promotion of innovative technology as an area in need of urgent
           attention.
          Capacities for flood forecasting and other flood-risk mitigation activities vary widely
     between countries, districts, states, and divisions. All of the GBM countries need to build
     capacity in terms of technology and staff training. A great deal of flood-relevant
     information, including critical geospatial data, is freely available. Often, however,
     agencies may not house the technical capacity to obtain or process these data. For full


74   Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins
benefit, relevant institutional, community, and human resources must be developed at a
pace commensurate with technological developments.
•	 Data availability can be improved by strengthening the capabilities of local scientific and
      technical institutions to monitor hazards and collect and record data.
•	    Risk information is best utilized when developed alongside efforts to strengthen the public
      institutions responsible for delivering that information and guiding appropriate
      responses.
•	 Ongoing training and capacity building at every level would serve the region well in
      efforts toward reducing flood-related human and economic losses.
     Climate change increases the likelihood that the region may experience extreme weather
events and climate conditions that have no historical precedent. According to the Fifth
Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is
expected that the average seasonal rainfall of the South Asian monsoon will increase, as
will its duration. Variability is also expected to increase, leading to larger swings in
extreme conditions such as periods of drought or increased flooding.
•	 Consideration of future risks must be firmly grounded in a clear understanding of current
      risks.
•	 Flood risk assessments may eventually need to consider not only historical events but
      also the likely evolution of future conditions.
•	 Risk managers may need to consider the possibility that more catastrophic events may
      occur in the future.
     Stakeholder partnerships are important in user-relevant, end-to-end flood forecasting and
warning systems and integrated flood management. As noted at the 2015 Regional Flood
Early Warning System Workshop, the development of an end-to-end system is expensive,
not only in terms of funding but also in terms of investment of time and people. The same
is true of integrated flood management. These costs are, however, low compared with the
typical scale of flood damage.
•	 Stakeholder partnerships can provide supplementary or complementary resources,
      facilitate user engagement, and contribute to program sustainability.
•	    Examples of stakeholder partners include government agencies, media outlets, emergency
      responders and relief services, community/amateur radio groups, academic and research
      institutions, and members of the business community.
     Stakeholder involvement and effective information dissemination and two-way
communication are essential ongoing processes in integrated flood management. The work
highlighted in this summary report is not an end in itself. Ongoing efforts include
interactive workshops and other forms of stakeholder collaboration designed to maximize
the benefits of this work—for example, with the National Hydrology Project (India), the
Bihar Kosi Basin Development Project, and the Uttar Pradesh Water Sector Restructuring
Project (all financed by the World Bank)—as well as the national and state agencies
responsible for monsoon flood warnings. Under the National Hydrology Project, a


Flood Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins          75
     real-time decision support system for flood risk management is planned for pilot testing
     within some Ganges and Brahmaputra river subbasins in India. To fully realize the benefits
     of technical advances in flood risk management:
     •	 The design of the technical work and its outcomes would, from the outset, be deliberately
        aligned with the work of stakeholders engaged in managing floods and responding to
        flood events.
     •	 New tools and techniques would be incorporated into accessible and usable operational
        platforms—for example, real-time, operational decision support systems are one
        important way of translating technical advances into real-world benefit.
     •	 An effective communications strategy would be deployed, to ensure that new tools and
        other technical outcomes are accessed and used, with a variety of participatory
        approaches targeting a wide range of stakeholders.
     •	 Mechanisms for effectively gathering feedback and incorporating continuous upgrades
        would be developed.
     •	 Advances would be continually assessed in terms of real-world benefits, such as reduced
        flood risks and losses, and new knowledge would be incorporated as it becomes available.
