Indonesia’s Banking Law (Law No. 7 of 1992, as amended by Law No. 10 of 1998) defines banks as
corporate entities that mobilize funds from the public in the form of deposits and channel these
funds to the public in the form of credit. The Banking Law applies to all “commercial” and “rural”
banks. A commercial bank provides services in payment transactions based either on conventional or
Sharia principles. A rural bank also bases its activities on conventional or Sharia principles but has
restricted operational areas, and does not provide any service in payment transactions. While all banks
are prohibited from conducting insurance business, rural banks cannot accept funds in the form of
demand deposits and cannot conduct business in foreign exchange.

Indonesia has 120 commercial banks and 1,837 rural banks. The former consist of 4 State banks (one
of which has an Islamic banking unit), 26 Provincial Government Regional Development Banks covering
all 33 of Indonesia’s provinces (14 of which have an Islamic banking unit), 79 private conventional
commercial banks (8 of which have an Islamic banking unit), and 11 purely Islamic commercial banks. Of
the total of 1,837 rural banks, 154 (or some 8%) are Islamic.

Taken together, the assets of all banks, estimated at some 4,716.8 trillion IDR (or about USD 387.9
billion) as of October 2013, account for more than 75% of the assets of Indonesia’s financial
         1
system.

The banking market is highly concentrated, with just under 50% of all banking assets being held
by five commercial banks, of which three state-owned banks own 35% of all assets. Table 1
summarizes this concentration.

The ratio of bank credit to GDP is relatively low compared to other economies. Although private
                                                        3
credit represents only about 31% of the country’s GDP, the sector is rapidly expanding. Indeed, as
indicated in Table 2, growth in total bank assets exceeded 200% from December 2007 to December
2012.

Rural bank credit is also increasing. From January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2012, rural bank credit for
individual and household purposes increased by some 27%, while rural bank lending to this segment has
fluctuated in the same period from a high of 17.3% to a low of 14.9% of all rural banks’ lending in this
same period (see Table 4).

Another relatively recent feature of the Indonesian banking sector is the expanding range of
financial service delivery options available to consumers, including through money transfer and
mobile and internet banking products. This is especially the case with branch and ATM networks,

                                                                    6

The number and value of credit cards in circulation in Indonesia is also on the rise. From May 2011
to May 2012, the number of credit cards in circulation increased by 6.35 % and, in the same period, in
                                                                                                  7
terms of value, outstanding credit-card loans grew 12% year-on-year to IDR 17.51 trillion. As of
December 2012, there were approximately 7.8 million credit card holders, 15.7 million credit cards and 19
commercial banks and one Islamic bank as credit card issuers in Indonesia. Regular accounts then
constituted approximately 70% of the total number of cards, while so-called “premium” accounts made up
the balance. The top five credit card issuers then in order were BCA, Bank Mandiri, BNI, Citibank and
CIMB Niaga, with BCA having some 2.4 million credit cards held by 1.1 million credit card holders, out of
                                                      8
a total banking customer base of about 12 million. As of January 2013, BI has capped the monthly

SECTION A            CONSUMER PROTECTION INSTITUTIONS


Good Practice A.1.   Consumer Protection Regime
                     The law should provide clear consumer protection rules regarding banking
                     products and services, and all institutional arrangements should be in place
                     to ensure the thorough, objective, timely and fair implementation and
                     enforcement of all such rules.
                     a. Specific statutory provisions should create an effective regime for the
                        protection of a consumer of any banking product or service.
                     b. A general consumer agency, a financial supervisory agency or a
                        specialized financial consumer agency should be responsible for
                        implementing, overseeing and enforcing consumer protection regarding
                        banking products and services, as well as for collecting and analyzing
                        data (including inquiries, complaints and disputes).
                     c. The designated agency should be funded adequately to enable it to carry
                        out its mandates efficiently and effectively.
                     d. The work of the designated agency should be carried out with
                        transparency, accountability and integrity.
                     e. There should be co-ordination and co-operation between the various
                        institutions mandated to implement, oversee and enforce consumer
                        protection and financial system regulation and supervision.
                     f. The law should also provide for, or at least not prohibit, a role for the
                        private sector, including voluntary consumer organizations and self-
                        regulatory organizations, in respect of consumer protection regarding
                        banking products and services.
Description          As of 1 January 2014, OJK has obtained regulatory and supervisory responsibility
                     for the banking sector (including in relation to consumer protection). In addition, a
                     clear role remains envisaged for consumer protection NGOs. There are, however,
                     overlapping consumer protection regulators, laws and regulations. Also, it is not
                     clear that adequate resources and expertise for consumer protection supervision
                     exist within OJK. And, it is unclear to what extent consumer organizations actually
                     carry out their role. Other regulators include the Ministry of Trade (MoT) and the
                     National Consumer Protection Agency (NCPA) and there is a concern around the
                     lack of coordination among relevant regulatory bodies.

                     Paragraphs (a) and (b)

                     The relevant existing statutory provisions constitute an unclear patchwork for the
                     protection of a consumer of any banking product or service.

                     The Banking Law No. 7 of 1992, as amended by Law No. 10 of 1998 (the Banking
                     Law) has limited specific consumer protection provisions but requires banks to
                       have as their overriding objective the improvement of “ the welfare of the common
                                10
                       people”.

                       The Consumer Law also appears to apply to banking services. This is because the
                       definitions of “consumer”; “entrepreneur” and “services” in Article 1 of the
                       Consumer Law support the view that the Law applies to all financial services
                       (including banking services) and that the responsibilities of both MoT and the
                       NCPA cover such services. Although the mission team was told that the inclusion
                       of a reference to “services” in the Consumer Law was a last minute change that
                       was made in Parliament and it is generally considered that the Law is poorly
                                11
                       drafted, there seems to be no doubt that any entity providing financial services
                       (including banking services) must comply with the Consumer Law.
                       In summary, the Consumer Law covers the following subjects (many of which
                       overlap with the provisions of the FCP Regulation – See Annex II).
                          General rights and obligations of consumers and entrepreneurs (Articles 4-8);
                          Misleading and deceptive conduct (Articles 9-14);
                          Annoying consumers in the way that services (or goods) are offered (Article
                           15);
                          Breaking an agreement with a consumer (Article 16);
                          Advertising (Articles 17 and 24);
                          Standard clauses (Article 18);
                          Compensation for consumers (Articles 19 and 23);
                          The government’s responsibility for consumer protection (Article 29) and the
                           responsibility of the government, the public and consumer protection NGOs for
                           supervision of consumer protection (Article 30);
                          The establishment of the NCPA (Articles 35-43 and see above);
                          Recognition of the role of consumer protection NGOs (Article 44 and see
                           below);
                          Dispute settlement (Articles 45-48 and Good Practice E.2 below); and
                          Establishment of the Consumer Dispute Settlement Board – or BPSK (Articles
                           49-59 and see Good Practice E.2); and
                          Administrative Sanctions (Articles 60-63).


                       Further, the Ministry of Trade (MoT) and the National Consumer Protection Agency
                       (NCPA) have functions which appear to overlap with those of OJK. The MoT
                       responsibilities include supervision and enforcement of the Consumer Law, which
                       is of general application. The NCPA was established under the Consumer Law and
                       its functions include (in summary) advising the government on consumer protection
                       policies; conducting surveys of relevant laws and consumers’ needs; encouraging
                       NGO consumer protection foundations and working with the media on consumer
                       issues. The breadth of the definitions of “ consumer”, “entrepreneur” and “services”
                       in Article 1 of the Consumer Law support the view that the Law applies to all
                       financial services (including banking services) and that the responsibilities of both
                       MoT and the NCPA cover such services.

 See Banking Law, Article 4
11
 The mission team was told that the Consumer Law was drafted and passed by Parliament in less than 6 months to
meet an IMF requirement for such legislation post the 1987 Asian crisis.
The mission team was told that a Bill has been drafted which will make it clear that
the Consumer Law does not apply to financial services. However, the Bill has not
yet been tabled in Parliament and it is understood this is not likely to occur for
some time.


In practice until December 31, 2013, the Ministry of Trade deferred to BI as the
agency responsible for implementing, overseeing and enforcing consumer
protection regarding banking products and services, as well as for collecting and
analyzing data (including inquiries, complaints and disputes). It seems likely that
this practice will continue with OJK now having taken over BI’s roles in these
respects. Nevertheless, it remains the case that there is no single authority that
has sole jurisdiction over matters of consumer protection in the banking sector.

OJK’s responsibility for the financial s ervices sector (including the banking sector)
is now provided for by Articles 5 and 55 of the OJK Law. Importantly, Article 5
provides that “The Financial Services Authority shall have the functions to
implement the integrated regulatory and supervisory system for the entire activities
of the financial services sector. Article 55 then deals with timing issues by providing
that: (emphasis added):
“(1) As of December 31, 2012, the regulatory and supervisory functions, duties,
and powers of financial services activities in the sectors of Capital Markets,
Insurance, Pension Funds, Finance Institutions, and Other Financial Services
Institutions shall pass from the Minister of Finance and the Capital Market and
Financial Institution Supervisory Agency to the Financial Services Authority.
(2) As of December 31, 2013, the regulatory and supervisory functions, duties, and
powers of financial services activities in the Banking sector shall pass from Bank
Indonesia to the Financial Services Authority.”

OJK’s objectives are expressly stated to include consumer protection:
“The Financial Services Authority is established with the objectives that the entire
activities of the financial services sector:
c). can protect the interests of Consumers and the public “ (Article 4 (c)).

In two specific areas directly bearing on consumers, however, BI retains
responsibility, namely the payments system and, for the foreseeable future at least,
BI’s Credit Reporting System.

The FCP Regulation, which was made by OJK on 6 August 2013, will commence
on 7 August 2013 and contains broadly expressed provisions for consumer
protection in most parts of the financial sector, including the banking sector. The
FCP Regulation, in summary:
       Sets out general principles of consumer protection relating to
        transparency, fair treatments, reliability, confidentiality and security of
        customer data and “complaint handling and resolution of consumer
        disputes in a simple, fast, and affordable manner” (Article 2).;
       Describes in broad terms the information to be provided by financial
        services providers to consumers and by a consumer to a financial services
        providers (Articles 4-13);
       Requires financial services providers to carry out education in order to
        improve the financial literacy of consumers and/or the community (Article
        14);
       Requires financial services providers to provide equal access to their
        products and services, subject to specific classifications which are
        permitted (e.g. in relation to income) (Article 15) and to provide services to
        customers with special needs (Article 24);
       Contains provisions relating to product suitability requirements (Articles 16,
        21 );
       Prohibits “marketing strategies that harm the consumers by taking
        advantage of consumers who do not have other options in making
        decisions” (Article 17) and prohibits private marketing without consent
        (Article 19);
       Contains provisions relating to product forcing (Article 18 and see Good
        Practice A.5);
        Requires financial service provider details to be included in offers (Article
        20);
       Requires “standard contracts” to be prepared in accordance with statutory
        regulations and prohibits certain types of standard clauses (Article 22 and
        see also Article 18 of the Consumer Law which also deals with this topic
        but is differently worded and does not provide for standard contracts to be
        prepared in accordance with regulations);
       Contains provisions relating to security of deposits and assets etc, of
        customers (Articles 25 and 27);
       Contains provisions dealing with conflicts of interest and making it clear
        that financial services providers are responsible for the any losses etc.
        caused by employees and other representatives (Articles 23, 29 and 30);
       Provides data protection provisions (Article 31);
       Requires financial services providers to have internal complaint resolution
        procedures (Articles 32- 39 and see Good Practice E.1);
       Provides for a facilitation service to be conducted by OJK (Articles 40-47
        and see Good Practice E.2); and
       Requires financial services providers to have internal control systems to
        protect consumers (Articles 47-50);
       Gives OJK the ability to impose sanctions for breaches of the FCP
        Regulation (Article 53); and
       Provides for existing consumer protection implementation provisions to
        remain valid so long as not inconsistent with the FCP Regulation (Article
        55).

Annex II provides a table that compares relevant provisions of the Consumer Law
and the FCP Regulation applicable to all providers of financial services to
consumers, including banks.

Paragraph (c)
With some 1,100 BI supervisors of banks supervising 120 commercial banks and
1,837 rural banks, it could be argued that BI has been under-resourced in order to
be able to carry out its mandate efficiently and effectively in respect of consumer
                            protection. That OJK is planning on increasing the number of bank supervisors by
                            some 600 individuals as soon as feasible in 2014 is testament to this concern.

                            Paragraph (d)
                            Although there is no reason to doubt that the work of BI has been carried out with
                            integrity, there has been: (a) no division of resources within BI regarding its efforts
                            at prudential and business conduct regulation, supervision and enforcement; and
                            (b) no clear mechanism for accountability in respect of any weak BI performance
                            regarding matters of banking consumer protection. Further, although BI is required
                                                                                                            12
                            to prepare an annual financial report and publicize it through the mass media, this
                            report has not routinely dealt explicitly with issues regarding the business conduct
                            of banks towards their customers.

                            Paragraph (e)
                            While the role of NGO consumer protection foundations, the Ministry of Trade and
                            other so-called “technically related Ministries” is explicitly set forth in the Consumer
                            Law as being essential for purposes of supervising the application of this Law,
                            there does not appear to be any mechanism for co-ordination and co-operation
                            among BI, the Ministry of Trade, other technically related Ministries and consumer
                            protection foundations in devising, implementing, overseeing and enforcing
                            banking consumer protection requirements.

                            Paragraph (f)
                            Finally, both the Consumer Law and the OJK Law provide a role for voluntary
                            consumer organizations in respect of consumer protection regarding banking
                            products and services. There is, however, no provision in law that explicitly looks to
                            any banking association as a self-regulatory organization.

                            The OJK Law only provides for the organization, governance and authority of OJK.
                            Established with the objective of protecting the interests of consumers and the
                                   13
                            public, OJK has authority to regulate and supervise financial service activities in
                                                 14
                            the banking sector. In carrying out its responsibilities, OJK may enact regulations,
                            grant or revoke licenses, examine and investigate violations and impose sanctions.
                            Since the Enactment Law makes it clear that Regulations are subordinate to Laws,
                            to the extent that any Regulation concerning matters of financial consumer
                            protection in respect of all banks in Indonesia is in conflict with existing Law,
                            including most importantly for the banking industry the Banking Law, the latter will
                            govern. As the OJK Law makes clear, existing banking laws and regulations prevail
                            unless they are contrary to the OJK Law. Also, OJK will be required to coordinate
                            with BI in formulating banking policies.

                            Legal Framework
                            Although there are many laws and regulations relating to banking products and
                            services of relevance to consumers, there is a lack of clarity as to the extent to

   Ibid., Article 6
                       which will continue to apply once the FCP Regulation comes into effect on 7
                       August 2014. The Consumer Law and the Bank Transparency Regulation of
                           15
                       2005 are two examples.

                       Against this background, Article 70 of the OJK Law refers to the various sector
                       specific laws (such as the Banking Law), their “ ancillary regulations” and “other
                       laws and regulations in the financial services sector” and then provides that these
                       laws and regulations “remain valid to the extent not in contravention of and not yet
                       replaced by this Law”.

                       The OJK Law itself does not contain detailed consumer protection provisions.
                       However the FCP Regulation does and provides in Article 55 that:
                       “The implementation of the provisions governing the protection of consumers in the
                       financial services sector shall remain valid as long as not contrary to Financial
                       Services Authority regulations.”


                       The mission team were advised that the intent is that the existing law and
                       regulations should continue to apply “except to the extent” the umbrella provisions
                       in the FCP Regulation are clearly inconsistent and regardless of which regulatory
                       agency is responsible for existing regulations (such as the Minister of Finance).
                       However, the provisions of a regulation such as the FCP Regulation cannot
                       override the provisions of a law approved by Parliament (such as the Consumer
                       Law), and there is doubt as to whether the general consumer protection provisions
                       of the FCP Regulation could override sector specific regulations (such as the Bank
                                                     16
                       Transparency Regulations).          This overlap and ambiguity in the consumer
                       protection framework is likely to be of concern to relevant financial institutions that
                       have to consider how they can comply with all relevant laws and regulations and
                       work out what differences in language between the FCP Regulation and other laws
                       and regulations means in practice.

                       The ability of the FCP Regulation to override Laws and earlier regulations is not
                       however clear. A law can, of course, amend or revoke a previous law. A regulation,
                                                17
                       however, cannot do so. And, thus, the efficacy of the statement that “ any existing
                       provisions governing financial consumer protection” (such as the Consumer Law
                       and the Banking Law) are to remain valid, but only “ to the extent they are not
                                                       18
                       contrary to the FCP Regulation”, appears legally dubious at best. Also, it appears
                       doubtful in law that the FCP Regulation can trump any BI Regulation.

                       The above analysis means that there may be confusion as to the extent to which
                       consumer-related laws and regulations apply to the financial sector. This includes
                       in relation to the Consumer Law which, as mentioned above, applies to financial
                       services. The difficulty is that the Consumer Law contains some provisions which
                       are not included in the FCP Regulation, some of which are inconsistent with the
                       FCP Regulation and others which, while not being entirely inconsistent, are worded

                         harassment and which give consumers the right to “test or try” financial products).
                         Although the mission team was informed that a draft Bill has been prepared which
                         makes it clear that the Consumer Law does not apply to financial services, the
                         position may well be confusing to regulated institutions until such a provision is
                         enacted.

                         Finally, there are a number of important matters of relevance to consumer
                         protection which are still to be the subject of regulations. These include future OJK
                         regulations specifically concerning: (a) “ supervision in the financial services
                                  20
                         sector”; (b) “procedures for issuing written orders against Financial Services
                         Institutions and certain parties”; (c) “procedures for determination of statutory
                         managers in Financial Services Institutions ”; and (d) “procedures for imposition of
                         sanctions”.

                         Non-Governmental Consumer Agencies
                         By the terms of the Government Regulation on Non-Governmental Consumer
                                             21
                         Protection Agencies, (and in order to implement Article 44 of the Consumer Law),
                         a regime is provided for the formal registration of such agencies. Once registered,
                                                                                               22
                         they may engage in consumer protection in all parts of Indonesia which for
                         purposes of the Regulation means:
                             “Disseminating information in order to increase awareness of rights and
                              obligations as well as consumer caution, in the consumption of goods and / or
                              services;
                             Providing advice to consumers who need it;
                             Working with related agencies in an effort to realize the protection of
                              consumers;
                             Helping consumers fight for their rights, including receiving consumer
                              complaints; and
                         
                                                                                      23
                              Helping government supervision of consumer protection.”

                         The dissemination of information by consumer agencies about consumer
                         protection specifically includes knowledge about the legislation related to consumer
                                            24
                         protection issues. In addition, consumer agencies are empowered to provide
                                                               25
                         counseling and consumer education. Also, consumer agencies have authority to
                         “empower consumers to be able to fight for their rights on their own, either
                                                      26
                         individually or in groups”. Furthermore, consumer protection agencies are to
                                                                                                           27
                         provide oversight for goods and services by way of research, testing and surveys.
                         There is, however, no provision for funding such agencies.

                        There is a need to consider possible revisions to the supervisory structures and
                        reporting lines within OJK. Whilst appreciating that the structure of the Board of
                        Commissioners has been established by the OJK Law, consideration should be
                        given as to how the specialized supervisory arrangements for market conduct (and
                        consumer protection) supervision might be best managed within OJK. Several
                        countries have been evaluating their most appropriate institutional arrangements
                                                                           28
                        for financial consumer protection in recent years . According to the Global Survey
                        on Financial Consumer Protection undertaken by the World Bank, the number of
                        economies that have agencies with dedicated resources and staff in financial
                        consumer protection increased from 46 in 2010 to 70 in 2013. Accordingly, 72% of
                        agencies with responsibility for financial consumer protection had a dedicated team
                        or unit in place to perform this function in 2013, as compared to 62% of economies
                        in 2010. OJK does not have such a dedicated team.
                        The overlap between OJK, the MoT and NCPA functions should be clarified. The
                        mission team was not able to meet with the NCPA and so it is not entirely clear to
                        what extent there is an overlap in practice with OJK’s consumer protection
                        functions.

                        Legal Framework
                 13.    There is a need to clarify the interaction between the FCP Regulation and the
                        Consumer Law as well as other existing consumer-related laws and regulations.
                        Ideally, this would be achieved by enacting a new Financial Consumer Law which
                        would cover the principles of the FCP Regulation plus the more specific
                        consumer protection aspects of existing laws which should continue. However, it
                        is appreciated that this is likely to be a long-term objective. In the interim, the OJK
                        proposal to issue Circulars which clarify the application of the FCP Regulation to
                        the banking sector is helpful.

                        The work begun by the enactment of the FCP Regulation should be expanded to
                        deal in greater depth with important matters of financial consumer protection in
                        the banking industry. For example, further regulations would be particularly
                        helpful in setting forth detailed disclosure rules for banks depending on the
                        banking product, in providing rules applicable to retail customer account switching
                        from bank to bank, and in banning the practice of charging unreasonable
                        prepayment penalties (in some cases as high as 5% on the outstanding balance)
                        on early repayment of loans. Whilst a reasonable fee might be charged with early
                        repayment of a fixed rate loan when interest rates have dropped, it is not
                        considered reasonable that prepayment penalties should be able to be charged
                        for a variable rate loan. Similarly, unreasonable fees on closing a deposit account
                        should not be permitted.       OJK Circulars dealing with such issues would be
                        helpful, whilst acknowledging they would not be binding.
Good Practice A.2       Code of Conduct for Banks
                        a. There should be a principles-based code of conduct for banks that is
                           devised by all banks or the banking association in consultation with the
                           financial supervisory agency and consumer associations, if possible.

FINAL.pdf
                 Monitored by a statutory agency or an effective self-regulatory agency,
                 this code should be formally adhered to by all sector-specific
                 institutions.
              b. If a principles-based code of conduct exists, it should be publicized and
                 disseminated to the general public.
              c. The principles-based code should be augmented by voluntary codes of
                 conduct for banks on such matters as facilitating the easy switching of
                 consumers’ current accounts and establishing a common terminology in
                 the banking industry for the description of banks’ charges, services and
                 products.
              d. Every such voluntary code should likewise be publicized and
                 disseminated.
Description   There is no principles-based code of conduct for banks of the type contemplated
              by this Good Practice. Nor are there any voluntary codes of conduct as envisaged
              by this Good Practice.

              Of the six banking associations in Indonesia, the first, and by far the most
              significant, is the Indonesia Banks Association (PERBANAS), a voluntary
              association of Indonesian Commercial Banks established in Jakarta in 1952. There
              is also a State-owned Banks Association (HIMBARA), an Association of Regional
              Development Banks (ASBANDA), one for Islamic Banks (the Indonesia Islamic
              Banking Association) and one for Rural Banks (PERBARINDO). And finally, there
              is a Foreign Banks Association of Indonesia (FBAI). With the exception of regional
              banks (all 26 of which are required to be members of ASBANDA), membership on
              the part of banks is not compulsory in any of these Associations and there is no
              overlapping of membership.

              PERBANAS has 15 full-time staff and, in recent years, its budget has averaged the
              extremely modest sum of about IDR 300,000,000 (or some USD 26,700) per year.
              Taken together, however, the member banks of PERBANAS have some 90% of all
              assets in the banking sector. Apart from the Chairman, there are five volunteer
              Deputy Chairs of PERBANAS who focus on: (i) State-owned Banks; (ii) Big Private
              Banks; (iii) Medium and Small-size Private Banks; (iv) Regional Banks; and (v)
              Islamic Banks. All office holders provide their time on a voluntary basis. The
              mission team was told that PERBANAS strongly favors a possible future statutory
              requirement that all commercial (as opposed to rural) banks in Indonesia (including
              Indonesian subsidiaries of banks with head offices outside Indonesia) be required
              to join PERBANAS as a condition of obtaining or maintaining a banking license.

              None of the six Associations of banks has formulated any detailed principles-based
              code of conduct for its member banks and their consumers. Resource constraints
              suggest that this is not likely to occur in the near future.

              Rather, each association has devised its own internal Code of Ethics. By way of
              example, the PERBANAS Code of Ethics has five sentences, as follows:
               “Our national banks are loyal to the Republic of Indonesia based on the
                 Constitution of 1945.
               Our national banks as one unit take responsibility for the implementation of
                 economic and financial development to achieve a prosperous and fair society
                 blessed by Allah.
                           Our employees are Indonesian nationals that uphold their national character,
                            both in the work place, as well as in their daily lives.
                           Our employees, in carrying out our daily devotion, always maintain ethics,
                            honesty, vigilance, solidarity, and thoroughness in managing money entrusted
                            to us by the community.
                           We bankers always uphold the national bank secrecy e ntrusted to us.”

                        Individual banks are left to devise their own code of conduct or ethics. While a
                        Code of Ethics is required of every bank, no prescription exists as to what any such
                        Code must contain. Inevitably, therefore, the wording of these Codes varies widely.
                        As far as treatment of consumers is concerned, these Codes typically only recite
                        the general staff requirement to keep all customer information confidential. In
                        addition, there invariably is no recourse provided to a consumer in the event of any
                        breach by a bank of the terms of its Code. Thus, banks’ Codes of Ethics are of
                        little, if any, practical relevance to consumer protection in the delivery of banking
                                                   29
                        products and services.

                        The present situation will continue under the FCP Regulation, with all officers and
                        employees of any Financial Services Provider being required “ in [their] dealings
                                                                                              30
                        with consumers [to] abide by the [their employer’s] Code of Ethics ”.
Recommendation          In order to strengthen the role of industry associations in financial consumer
                        protection, OJK could develop guidance on the principles and minimum content of
                        industry codes of conduct. Such Codes could be enforced by the associations or
                        by OJK (if the industry associations do not have the resources or the capacity to do
                        so). Guidance should also be provided on the mechanisms to disseminate the
                        code among industry employees and consumers and to enforce the industry code
                        by the association’s members (e.g. through “naming and shaming” members who
                        do not comply and ultimately by giving the association power to suspend their
                        membership). At a minimum, any such Code should be contractually binding
                        between a bank and its customers through inclusion of an appropriate term in the
                        contract for the banking service.

                        In the medium to long-term, consideration should be given to encouraging
                        PERBANAS to formulate a Code of Conduct for the commercial banking industry.
                        Such a Code should be widely publicized and disseminated, including thorough
                        being made available at branches, any banking agents, and on the on the websites
                        of OJK, PERBANAS and all commercial banks. PERBANAS could require all its
                        members to subscribe to the Code. The development and enforcement of such a
                        Code would, of course, require significant resources.

                        The content of an industry Code of Practice would be a matter for consultation but,
                        at a minimum, it could be expected to deal with the following subjects:

                           The objectives of the Code;
                           Scope of coverage;
                           Supervision and enforcement mechanisms;

                             those distributed by banks);
                            Advice to consumers concerning the enquiries they should make and
                            Other subjects not comprehensively covered by exisiting law (such as
                             disclosure requirments, responsible lending rules, cooling off periods,
                             advertising and obligations for informatiom to be legisble, clearly expressed, in
                             plain language and with a minimum font size).

                        With over 1,800 rural banks, not all of which are members of PERBARINDO, it is
                        recognized that formulating a voluntary Code of Conduct that applies to all rural
                        banks in their dealings with consumers is unrealistic.
Good Practice A.3       Appropriate Allocation between Prudential Supervision and Consumer
                        Protection
                        Whether prudential supervision of banks and consumer protection regarding
                        banking products and services are the responsibility of one or two
                        organizations, the allocation of resources to these functions should be
                        adequate to enable their effective implementation.
Description             Although OJK has a strong policy focus on consumer protection, at present it does
                        not separate its prudential and market conduct supervisory arrangements.
                        Individual staff members at OJK perform both prudential and market conduct
                        supervisory functions and do not appear to have a particular focus on consumer
                        protection issues. The concern is that consumer protection and prudential
                        supervision require different types of supervisory profiles, skills and approaches,
                        with the latter focusing more on quantitative skills and analysis of an institution’s
                        financial soundness, and the former on qualitative skills and assessment of how an
                        institution deals with consumers. Further, staff do not use, in any systematic way,
                        many of the specific tools relevant to this area (such as mystery shopping,
                        customer focus groups and surveys, review of advertising materials or a systematic
                        analysis of customer complaints made to the various mediation services on offer).
                        There are also concerns as to whether OJK is adequately resourced for the broad
                        CPFL functions it has to carry out.

                        In addition, having consumer protection and prudential responsibilities within the
                        same unit may make it harder to resolve situations when conflicting objectives
                        arise. For example, if the consequences of sanctioning a financial institution for
                        noncompliance with one or more consumer protection provisions would have a
                        negative impact on the soundness (or public perception of soundness) of a financial
                        institution, or if a requirement for a financial institution to compensate customers

                    would have a negative impact on prudential requirements, a supervisor may opt to
                    avoid making a decision or even considering consumer protection issues in order to
                    minimize prudential impact. Alternatively, when high political or public pressure
                    exists to identify problems with consumers, the attention of supervisors may focus
                    too much on consumer protection - rather than prudential - issues.

                    The position was similar with BI’s supervision of business conduct by banks.
                    Supervision appears to have been limited to requiring quarterly reports concerning
                    consumer complaints and periodic reports from banks to BI’s Payments
                    Department regarding matters such as the operation of the Funds Transfer System.
                    Important consumer materials such as terms and conditions, application forms, and
                    sales and disclosure documentation were not revie wed by BI. As BI’s Banking
                    Overview webpage still makes clear, the approach BI used regarding supervision
                    was to encourage “self-regulatory banking in which banks consistently implement
                    their own internal regulations for operational activities within the overall guidelines
                    of prudential principles”. BI also did not apparently use the market conduct
                    supervision tools referred to above.
Recommendation      There is a need to consider possible revisions to supervisory structures and
                    reporting lines within OJK.

                    Whilst appreciating that the structure of the Board of Commissioners has been
                    established by the OJK Law, consideration should be given as to how the
                    specialized supervisory arrangements for market conduct (and consumer
                    protection) supervision might be best managed within OJK. It is worth noting that
                    several countries have been evaluating their most appropriate institutional
                    arrangements for financial consumer protection in recent years. According to the
                    Global Survey on Financial Consumer Protection undertaken by the World Bank,
                    the number of economies that have agencies with dedicated resources and staff in
                    financial consumer protection increased from 46 in 2010 to 70 in 2013.
                    Accordingly, 72% of agencies with responsibility for financial consumer protection
                    had a dedicated team or unit in place to perform this function in 2013, as compared
                    to 62% of economies in 2010. OJK does not have such a dedicated team.

                    Special consideration should be given as to how market conduct supervision in
                    OJK could be separated from prudential supervision, and be resourced with
                    adequate tools, approaches and capacity. Ideally market conduct supervision in
                    OJK should be separated from prudential supervision and have adequate expert
                    staff and resources in order to perform its specialized responsibilities effectively
                    and in order to avoid any conflicts of interest.
Good Practice A.4   Other Institutional Arrangements
                    a. The judicial system should ensure that the ultimate resolution of any
                       dispute regarding a consumer protection matter in respect of a banking
                       product or service is affordable, timely and professionally delivered.
                    b. The media and consumer associations should play an active role in
                       promoting banking consumer protection.
Description         Paragraph (a) - Judicial System
                    The Indonesian judicial system does not appear able to meet the standards
                    required by this Good Practice.

                    In general, it is understood that neither consumers nor financial organizations trust
                        the courts since their processes are perceived to be slow, expensive, and
                                                                                                    33
                        unpredictable, as well as handled by low-paid judges susceptible to bribery. The
                        mission team was also told there are cultural considerations which make
                        consumers uncomfortable bringing their disputes before a court.

                        Paragraph (b) - The Media
                        The media and consumer associations do not yet play an active and effective role
                        in promoting banking consumer protection. While press coverage of important
                        developments appears from time-to-time, the mission team was informed that there
                        have only been a few instances, to date, of television and radio programming
                        devoted to banking consumer protection issues.


                        Paragraph (b) - Consumer Associations
                        With few exceptions, it appears that consumer associations lack the funds and
                        human resources needed to play an active and sustained role of significance in
                        promoting banking consumer protection. However, some consumers have asked
                        YLKI or other formal consumer associations for help, and they have contacted
                        financial institutions to correct wrongdoing. OJK and the Ministry of Trade have
                        been receptive to the actions of YLKI and similar consumer associations, for
                        example by participating in consumer awareness campaigns or events (e.g. a
                        campaign carried out last year encouraging consumers to present complaints
                        regarding credit cards). YLKI has also shared with OJK information about the
                        complaints they receive regarding business practices and contract terms of multi-
                        finance companies. Annually YLKI also organizes a press conference to
                        disseminate the main activities they undertook during the year, and share
                        information about the main types of complaints they receive.
Recommendation          Judicial System
                        See the recommendations in Good Practice E.2 concerning the importance of
                        developing an effective alternative dispute resolution system in Indonesia.

                        Media
                        Consideration should be given to mounting a public and media awareness
                        campaign in relation to financial products and services, as well as in respect of the
                        statutory and other obligations that OJK, the Government, banks and other
                        financial institutions have towards consumers. There also appears to be a need to
                        educate journalists on financial issues, a role which could at least partially be
                        undertaken by OJK.

                        Consumer Associations
                        Consideration should also be given to providing funding to consumer associations
                        to promote their capacity to deal with consumer protection matters regarding
                        financial services in general, and banking services in particular. In addition, it will
                        also be important for OJK to promote the participation of consumers associations

Good Practice A.5          Licensing
                           All banking institutions that provide financial services to consumers should
                           be subject to a licensing and regulatory regime to ensure their financial
                           safety and soundness and effective delivery of financial services.
Description                All Indonesian banks that provide financial services to consumers have been
                           required to be licensed by BI. By Article 16 of the Banking Act, all institutions that
                           aimed to take deposits from the public whether as commercial bank or a rural bank
                           had first to be licensed by BI after having met all specified statutory requirements

                           As of January 1, 2014, OJK has authority to do the following: (1) issue a license for
                           the establishment of a bank; (2) supervise bank activities in respect of such
                           matters as business plans, mergers and acquisitions and amendments to their
                           articles of association; (3) regulate and supervise all bank’s regarding prudential
                           norms and requirements, including in respect of capital adequacy, liquidity,
                           reserves and standards of accounting, as well as the management of risk, bank
                           governance and know your customer principles; (4) regulate and supervise all
                           commercial and rural banks in respect of their conduct in dealing with consumers;
                           and (5) impose sanctions on any bank for its breach of any regulation regarding
                                                          34
                           banking consumer protection.

                           By its FCP Regulation, OJK has set high-level criteria for the business conduct of
                           banks as of August 7, 2014 which could be relevant to future decisions regarding
                           the licensing of banks.
Recommendation             OJK should consider making it a licensing condition that an applicant is able to
                           demonstrate compliance with all market conduct laws (such as the FCP
                           Regulation). Consideration might also be given to requiring licensed banks to
                           provide an annual certificate to OJK certifying their compliance with these laws.



SECTION B                  DISCLOSURE AND SALES PRACTICES

Good Practice B.1          Information on Customers
                                a. When making a recommendation to a consumer, a bank should
                                   gather, file and record sufficient information from the consumer to
                                   enable the bank to render an appropriate product or service to that
                                   consumer.
                                b. The extent of information the bank gathers regarding a consumer
                                   should:
                                     (i) be commensurate with the nature and complexity of the
                                          product or service either being proposed to or sought by the
                                          consumer; and
                                     (ii) enable the bank to provide a professional service to the

     Besides the FCP Regulation itself, these presumably include all relevant BI Regulations.
                                           consumer in accordance with that consumer’s capacity
Description              The “Know Your Customer” (KYC) rules contained in the Law on Anti -Money
                                                                                 35
                         Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism require commercial - but
                         not rural - banks to record an array of information regarding every retail customer
                         but are focused more on matters of financial integrity rather than the product or
                         service needs of customers.
                         Paragraphs (a) and (b)
                         When any commercial or rural bank makes any recommendation to a consumer,
                         however, it is under no legal obligation to gather, file and record any, let alone
                         “sufficient”, information from the consumer to enable the bank to render an
                         appropriate product or service. Also, there is no legal obligation on any commercial
                         or rural bank to make the extent of its consumer information gathering exercise be
                         commensurate with the nature and complexity of what is being offered to, or
                         requested by, the consumer.

                         There is, though, a provision in Article 15 of the FCP Regulation aimed at enabling
                         banks to provide a professional service in accordance with the consumer’s own
                         capacity. In this respect, a bank is obliged to provide any consumer equal access
                         to its products and services according to his or her “class”, as devised solely by the
                         bank based upon such factors as: (a) the consumer’s “profile”; (b) his or her
                         occupation; (c) “average” income; (d) the purpose for which a product and/o r
                         service are to be used; and (e) any other information according to which “classes
                                                             36
                         of consumers” may be determined.
                         In addition, all banks are entitled to rely upon the consumer’s good faith and to
                         have access to accurate, honest and clear information on, and documents from, a
                                    37
                         consumer.
Recommendation           OJK should give consideration to requiring all banks, by Regulation, to adhere to
                         all aspects of this Good Practice.
Good Practice B.2        Affordability
                         a. When a bank makes a recommendation regarding a product or service to
                             a consumer, the product or service it offers to that consumer should be
                             in line with the need of the consumer.
                         b. The consumer should be given a range of options to choose from to meet
                             his or her requirements.
                         c. Sufficient information on the product or service should be provided to
                             the consumer to enable him or her to select the most suitable and
                             affordable product or service.
                         d. When offering a new credit product or service significantly increasing the
                             amount of debt assumed by the consumer, the con sumer’s credit
                             worthiness should be properly assessed.
Description              Although there is no legal requirement for any bank to attempt to ascertain the true
                         “needs” of its consumers as provided for by this Good Practice, there are



35
   See BI Regulation 14/27/PBI/2012, Articles 12 and 14
36
   Ibid., Article 15 Query, however, whether, by allowing each bank to devise its own classes, the result is tantamount
to legal authority to discriminate.
37
   See FCP Regulation, Article 3
                          requirements relating to credit – worthiness assessments that must be undertaken
                          by banks. Specifically, under the BI Act, a commercial bank is required, before
                          extending credit (or financing based on sharia principles) to “ have confidence” that
                          the customer will repay his or her debt (or the financing) according to the agreed
                          terms. And this confidence must be based upon “ a thorough analysis of the
                                                                             38
                          intention, capability and ability of the customer”.

                          Further, by August 7, 2014, all banks and other financial services providers will be
                          required to consider the “suitability of needs and capability of Consumers ” for the
                                                                              39
                          products and/or services being offered to them. No guidance is given, though, as
                          to basis for any such consideration or its required extent. Also, there is no
                          obligation to inform the consumer of the results of this consideration, nor is there
                          clarity as to the implication(s) of a bank’s failure to comply with this requirement.

                          Also, banks and all other Financial Services Providers will be prohibited from using
                          any marketing strategy for a product or service that harms a consumer by taking
                                                                  40
                          advantage of the consumer’s condition. It is unclear, however, how any bank can
                          possibly know, say, of a consumer borrower’s “ condition” unless it is obvious or the
                          bank has been fully and accurately informed about it by the consumer. And, in this
                          respect, the only somewhat relevant legal provision comes from the Consumer
                          Law which, among other things, obliges consumers “ to act in good faith in
                                                                                            41
                          conducting the transaction of purchasing goods and/or services”.
Recommendation            The existing provisions relating to understanding a customer’s needs should be
                          considerably strengthened to deal with the above-mentioned gaps. This might be
                          achieved by OJK providing regulatory guidance as to its expectations as to how
                          financial institutions might comply with Article 16 of the FCP Regulation. It is
                          considered especially important that a bank should be required to obtain
                          independently verifiable evidence of its consumer’s assets and liabilities in or der to
                          ascertain whether the consumer has the financial capacity to repay the credit
                          without substantial hardship.

                          The new rules could also appropriately include a requirement for a signed waiver
                          by the customer if a recommendation of non-suitability of a product or investment
                          is ignored.
                          The following may be useful references in this regard: the EU Directive on Unfair
                          Terms in Consumer Contracts 1993/13/EEC and EU Directive on Credit
                          Agreements for Consumers, 2008/48/EC; the Peruvian Regulation 6941-2008

Good Practice B.3         Cooling-off Period

provided by way of example.

   Ibid., Article 17
41
   Consumer Law, Article 5 b.
                             should provide the consumer a cooling-off period of a reasonable
                             number of days (at least 3-5 business days) immediately following the
                             signing of any agreement between the bank and the consumer.
                        b. On his or her written notice to the bank during the cooling-off period, the
                           consumer should be permitted to cancel or treat the agreement as null
                           and void without penalty to the consumer of any kind.
Description             Unlike in the insurance industry, where a 14 day cooling-off period is required, no
                        cooling off period is mandated for banks. By the terms of its own loan
                                     42
                        agreements, however, a bank may introduce a cooling-off period of any length for
                        its customers. It would appear, though, that doing so is rarely done. Rather, if a
                        consumer wants to terminate a loan after having received all or a portion of the
                        principal sum, it would appear that the consumer is typically required to forfeit all
                        up-front fees and to pay interest on the outstanding sum no matter how soon notice
                        to terminate has been lodged with his or her bank. It would also appear that, in
                        many cases, the consumer is required to pay a fee by way of penalty.

                        There are no statutory or regulatory requirements in these respects.
Recommendation          Unless explicitly waived in advance by a consumer in writing, banks should be
                        required to provide their consumers a cooling-off period43 of a reasonable number
                        of days (say, three to five business days) immediately following the signing of any
                        loan agreement.44 There should also be an obligation on all banks to advise their
                        retail customers of their rights in this regard when they take out their loans. Ideally
                        debtors should always have the right to prepay any credit provided this right is
                        subject to the payment of reasonable administrative fees and reasonable break
                        costs in the case of fixed rate loans.
Good Practice B.4       Bundling and Tying Clauses
                        a. As much as possible, banks should avoid bundling services and
                           products and the use of tying clauses in contracts that restrict the choice
                           of consumers.
                        b. In particular, whenever a borrower is obliged by a bank to purchase any
                           product, including an insurance policy, as a pre-condition for receiving a
                           loan from the bank, the borrower should be free to choose the provider of
                           the product and this information should be made known to the borrower.

                          i.   any duty to act with skill, care and diligence toward the consumer in



42
    By Article 8 (2) of the Banking Law, each Commercial Bank is required to formulate and implement its own
procedures for the extension of Credit (or Financing based on Sharia Principles). Thus, a bank is free to allow for
cooling-off if it would like to do so.
43
   For a description of cooling-off periods in several EU Member States, see the EC’s Discussion Paper for the
amendment of the Directive 87/102/EEC concerning consumer credit.
44
   Ideally debtors should always have the right to prepay any credit provided this right is subject to the payment of
reasonable administrative fees and reasonable break costs in the case of fixed rate loans.
                            connection with the provision by the bank of any financial service or
                            product; or
                      ii.   any liability arising from the bank’s failure to exercise its duty to act
                            with skill, care and diligence in the provision of any financial service
                            or product to the consumer.
Description         There is no law which expressly prohibits the practices described in this Good
                    Practice. However the standard contracts provisions in Article 22 of the FCP
                    Regulation provide some protection for consumers in this regard.
Recommendation      No recommendation.
Good Practice B.6   Regulatory Status Disclosure
                    In all of its advertising, whether by print, television, radio or otherwise, a
                    bank should disclose the fact that it is a regulated entity and the name and
                    contact details of the regulator.
Description         The requirements of this Good Practice will substantively be met when the
                    FCP Regulation takes effect, although there will be no obligation to disclose
                    contact details for OJK. Specifically, all financial services providers, including all
                    banks, must affix and/or mention in any offer or promotion of their products and/or
                    services: (a) the name and/or logo of the Financial Services Provider; and (b) a
                    statement that the Financial Services Provider is registered with, and under the
                    supervision of, the Financial Services Authority.
Recommendation      Consideration should be given to requiring all regulated financial services
                    providers to include OJK’s full name (i.e. without an option to provide merely its
                    logo), as well as OJK’s street address, email address and telephone number in all
                    their advertising.
Good Practice B.7   Terms and Conditions
                    Before a consumer opens a deposit, current (checking) or loan account at a
                    bank, the bank should make available to the consumer a written copy of its
                    general terms and conditions, as well as all terms and conditions that apply
                    to the account to be opened. Collectively, these Terms and Conditions
                    should include:
                    a. disclosure of details of the bank’s general charges;
                    b. a summary of the bank’s complaints procedures;
                    c. a statement regarding the existence of the office of banking ombudsman
                        or equivalent institution and basic information relating to its process and
                        procedures;
                    d. information about any compensation scheme that the bank is a member
                        of;
                    e. an outline of the action and remedies which the bank may take in the
                        event of a default by the consumer;
                    f. the principles-based code of conduct, if any, referred to in A.2 above;
                    g. information on the methods of computing interest rates paid by or
                        charged to the consumer, any relevant non-interest charges or fees
                        related to the product offered to the consumer;
                    h. any service charges to be paid by the consumer, restrictions, if any, on
                        account transfers by the consumer, and the procedures for closing an
                        account; and
                    i. clear rules on the reporting procedures that the consumer should follow
                        in the case of unauthorized transactions in general, and stolen cards in
                              particular, as well as the bank’s liability in such cases facilitates the
                              reading of every word.
Description              Although the mission team was informed that all banks have written terms and
                         conditions for retail products and services, there is currently no statutory
                                                                                  45
                         requirement to meet the provisions of this Good Practice. Further it is not usual
                         practice for banks to comply with many aspects of the Good Practice.

                         In addition, it appears to be common practice for commercial banks to produce
                         terms and conditions that are difficult for the non-lawyer to understand. Also, they
                                                                                                  46
                         are usually in font size 7 which makes them difficult to read.              This is
                         notwithstanding the Consumer Law requirement that they not include standard
                         clauses “in the form which is difficult to see or cannot be read clearly, or in a
                                                                        47
                         statement which is difficult to understand”. Finally, it is to be noted that the
                         general terms and conditions of some commercial banks can extend to more than
                         20 pages.

                         While the Banking Act does not currently deal with Terms and Conditions, per se, it
                         provides that, “in extending credits … and conducting other forms of business ”,
                         banks are “required to adhere to methods not detrimental to the Bank and the
                                                                                    48
                         interests of Customers entrusting their funds to the Bank”. Also, “in the interest of
                         its customer, a bank [must] provide information concerning the risk of possible
                                                                                                     49
                         loses relating to [any] customer transaction conducted through the Bank”. These
                                                                                   50
                         provisions have transferred to OJK as of January 1, 2014.

                         Some aspects of the Good Practice will be covered when the new FCP
                         Regulations come into effect in August 2014. However there will still be a need for
                         detailed regulations (and at minimum, guidelines) as to the required content and
                         format of terms and conditions.

                         From August 2014, a bank will be required by the FCP Regulation to provide its
                         potential customers with a document containing the terms and conditions regarding
                         the product or service on offer “prior to a Consumer signing any product or service
                         document or agreement”. And these terms and conditions must include “at least:
                             a) detailed charges, benefits and risks; and
                             b) procedures for complaints handling and redress by the bank ”.
                                                                                              51



                         In formulating a loan or any other agreement with a consumer, a bank will also be
                                                                                      52
                         required “to maintain balance, fairness, and reasonableness”. These terms are,
                         however, undefined.

   After the CPFL Review, OJK Circular Letter No.12/SEOJK.07/2014 concerning the Delivery of Responsible
Information on Financial and Marketing Products and/or Services was issued, but was not the object of the mission
team’s analysis.
46
   In this respect, banks clearly do not comply with the requirement of Article 18 (2) of the CP Law which prohibits
banks from including a standard clause that is difficult to see, cannot be read clearly or is difficult to understand.

Recommendation   In the first place, it would be helpful if all banks were required to comply with all
                 aspects of this Good Practice. This would ideally be done by way of regulation so
                 as to ensure enforceability. At a minimum, OJK should issue detailed guidelines for
                 the purposes of the abovementioned provisions of the FCP Regulation.

                 Secondly, contract documents could also be made comprehensible through
                 summaries of key information, clear language and format and explanations from
                 bank staff in appropriate cases. This might be achieved by implementing the
                 following specific recommendations:
                        A Key Facts Statement should be provided on the first page of every
                         contract summarizing the key terms (see Good Practice B.8).
                        Contracts should be both intelligible and legible. Contract documents
                         should be plainly expressed, in a minimum of a 10 point font size and
                         provided to a customer in the official language most relevant to the
                         customer.
                        Contract documents should be explained to customers who would not
                         otherwise understand them. If a customer is clearly not able to read and
                         understand contract or security disclosure documents they should be
                         required to be explained to him or her by the institution concerned. This
                         might be required if, for example, if the customer is illiterate or blind.
                        Customers should be given time to consider documents. Customers
                         should also be given a reasonable time (say at least one day) to consider
                         the information provided to them before the contract is signed. Similarly,
                         banks should explain the effect of giving any security (including a
                         mortgage or a guarantee) and the implications of default.

                 Thirdly, of high priority in the medium term, OJK could develop and require the
                 application by all banks of a standard methodology for financial institutions that
                 discloses the total price or cost of financial products to consumers (‘effective
                 interest rate‘) and is comparable across all banks. A future OJK Regulation should
                 specify a standard methodology required to be applied by all banks and OJK
                 should then monitor compliance in using it. Banks should be required to disclose
                 their effective interest rates, in advertising, marketing and sales materials and on
                 request. For example, Peru’s Regulation of Transparency requires banks to
                 disclose the “TCEA”, or Annual Effective Cost Rate, which is expressed as an
                 interest rate, but includes all costs associated with a consumer credit. See also in
                 this respect, B.8 below regarding Key Facts Statements.

                 Fourthly, in the medium term, OJK should consider establishing a price comparison
                 webpage on its website to provide consumers with the means to compare the cost
                 (or return) and terms of similar financial products and to provide an incentive for
                 providers to compete to improve product design and pricing. The webpage could
                 also include easy-to-use financial tools, for example to compare similar products,
                 or to plan for expenditures (such as the birth of a child, or for health insurance). As
                 a complement to that webpage, price comparison tables could also be made
                 available by means of newspapers, community leaders, consumer associations,
                 and through suitable outlets in rural areas. In time, agents for mobile money
                 providers could use this webpage information and make tools available to
                 customers for example, including those customers that are semi-literate or not able
                 to read. National price comparison websites have increased competition and
                 reduced consumer prices, for example in the case of the financial regulator’s
                                           53
                        website in Peru.
Good Practice B.8       Key Facts Statement
                           a. A bank should have a Key Facts Statement for each of its accounts,
                               types of loans or other products or services and provide these to its
                               customers and potential customers.
                            b. The Key Facts Statement should be written in plain language and
                               summarize in a page or two the key terms and conditions of the
                               specific banking product or service.
                            c. Prior to a consumer opening any account at, or signing any loan
                               agreement with, the bank, the consumer should have delivered a
                               signed statement to the bank to the effect that he or she has duly
                               received, read and understood the relevant Key Facts Statement from
                               the bank.
                            d. Key Facts Statements throughout the banking sector should be
                               written in such a way as to allow consumers the possibility of easily
                               comparing products that are being offered by a range of banks.
Description             N/A.
Recommendation          As a matter of some priority in the near-term, all banks should be required to have
                                                54
                        a Key Facts Statement for each of its commonly used consumer products
                        accounts and provide these to its customers and potential customers, after testing
                        consumers understanding of proposed mandatory disclosure.

                        This Regulation should require every Key Facts Statement to be written in plain
                        language, in a minimum of font size 11 and to summarize in a page or two the key
                        terms and conditions of the specific banking product or service being offered. Also,
                        prior to a consumer opening any account at, or signing any loan agreement with, a
                        bank, the same Regulation should require the consumer to have delivered a signed
                        statement to the bank to the effect that he or she has duly received, read and
                        understood the relevant Key Facts Statement from the bank.

                        Furthermore, Key Facts Statements throughout the banking sector should be
                        written in such a way as to allow consumers the possibility of easily comparing
                        products that are being offered by a range of banks. For this to happen, however,
                                                                                     55
                        OJK would need to specify the required standard format. For example, there
                        should be explicit OJK instructions as to how interest rates and monthly minimum
                        balances must be calculated and presented.

                        Consideration should also be given to including a requirement to disclose the total

   Superintendence of Banking, Insurance and Private Pension Funds of Peru found that online publication of
consumer loan rates reduced the average consumer lending rate by 1000 basis points (or ten percentage points) at
the time of stable interest rates – see: http://www.sbs.gob.pe
54
   Examples of Key Facts Statements include the UK FSA’s initial disclosure documents applicable to housing credit
products, the EU’s Standard European Consumer Credit Information (SECCI) form, the US Truth in Lending Act’s
"Schumer Box" for credit cards, Peru’s “Hoja Resumen” (Summary Sheet), South Africa’s Pre-Agreement Statement
& Quotation for Small Credit Agreements, Ghana’s Pre -Agreement Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement and
Australia’s Key Facts Statements for Home Loans and Credit Cards . Copies of these examples, and others, can be
provided on request.
55
   By way of example, such a statement for a loan contract should include the interest rate, fees and charges, the
total amount to be repaid, the term of the loan and the repayment details.
                        cost of credit which shows as a single rate the applicable interest rate and
                        mandatory fees (such as a loan application fee) and charges (such as for a credit-
                        life insurance premium).

                        A Key Facts Statement should also indicate the mechanisms for recourse available
                        to the consumer in the event of any complaint.

                        Finally, in addition to extensive consultations with Indonesia’s banking industry,
                        these measures would benefit from consumer pre-testing of the formats created by
                        OJK to be sure they are useful and understandable. Also, all standard formats
                        should be published on OJK’s website and in the media and other means in order
                        to increase public awareness.
Good Practice B.9       Advertising and Sales Materials
                           a. Banks should ensure that their advertising and sales materials and
                               procedures do not mislead customers.
                           b. All advertising and sales materials of banks should be easily
                               readable and understandable by the general public.
                           c. Banks should be legally responsible for all statements made in their
                               advertising and sales materials (i.e. be subject to the penalties under
                               the law for making any false or misleading statements).
Description             Although Indonesia does not have a Law of Advertising, as of August 7,
                        2014, all banks and other financial services providers “must provide
                        accurate, honest, clear and not misleading information on its products
                                            56
                        and/or services”. Further, such “information … must be:
                         provided when giving an explanation to Consumers of their rights and
                            obligations;
                         provided when entering into an agreement with a Consumer; and
                         included when published in the media, inter alia, through advertisements on
                                                        57
                            print or electronic media.”

                        In addition, as of the same date, all banks and other financial services
                        providers:
                         “must provide up-to-date and easily accessible information to Consumers on
                            its products and/or services”; 58 and
                            shall not use marketing strategies that “harm the consumers by taking
                                                                                                       59
                            advantage of consumers who do not have other options in making decisions”.

                        There is, however, nowhere stated the need for an easily legible print font size
                        for advertising or sales materials of a bank, nor for the application of any
                        objective test of how readily any such material is generally understandable.
                        Finally, although it is obviously in a bank’s best, long -term interest to ensure
                        that all of its advertising and sales materials are in no way misleading to
                        customers, there appear to be few effective sanctions for failure to do so.

58
   Ibid., Article 5 What constitutes information that is “easily accessible”, however, is not defined.
59
   Ibid., Article 17 The meaning of the words here in quotes is somewhat ambiguous, however, as the implication is
that the prohibition only applies where the sole source of information is the advertising material in question.
                        By the terms of the Consumer Law, advertising agencies are prohibited from
                        producing advertisements which:
                            deceive consumers regarding the quality, quantity, … use and prices of goods
                             and/or rates of services and the timeliness of receiving goods and/or services;
                            deceive in respect of a guarantee on certain goods and/or services;
                            provide incorrect, wrong or inaccurate information on any good and/or
                             service:
                            do not provide information on the risks of using any good and/or service;
                            exploit an incident and/or someone without permission from authorized
                             officials or the approval of the person concerned; or
                            violate ethics and/or legal provisions on advertising.
                                                                                    60



                        In addition, advertising agencies are prohibited from continuing the circulation of an
                                                                                            61
                        advertisement which has violated any of a. through f. above and they are
                        responsible for the advertisements they produce and all of the consequences
                                         62
                        caused by them.
Recommendation          The FCP Regulation should be amended as follows:
                         to provide a clear prohibition on misleading and deceptive conduct in relation
                            to any sales and advertising materials in Article 17;
                         to make it clear that Article 7 (1) applies to marketing and sales materials; and
                         to ensure that Article 7 requirements also apply where a language other than
                            Indonesian is used for materials or information given to a consumer (e.g.
                            English).
                        Pending any such changes, it is recommended that regulatory guidance be
                        provided in an OJK Circular issued for these purposes.
Good Practice           Third-Party Guarantees
B.10                    A bank should not advertise either an actual or future deposit or interest rate
                        payable on a deposit as being guaranteed or partially guaranteed unless
                        there is a legally enforceable agreement between the bank and a third party
                        who or which has provided such a guarantee. In the event such an
                        agreement exists, the advertisement should state:
                            i.  the extent of the guarantee;
                           ii.  the name and contact details of the party providing the guarantee;
                                and
                          iii.  in the event the party providing the guarantee is in any way
                                connected to the bank, the precise nature of that relationship.
Description             A bank is “prohibited from misleadingly offering, promoting or advertising any
                        specific goods and/or services if doing so would involve the offering of something
                                                                               63
                        containing a promise or guarantee that is not secured”.

                        It is not made explicit, however, that a legally enforceable agreement must exist
                        between the bank and a third party who or which has provided such a guarantee.
                        And, if such an agreement does in fact exist, there is no requirement for the
                        advertisement to state any of (i) to (iii) above.
Recommendation          Consideration should be given to covering all aspects of this Good Practice.

Good Practice            Professional Competence
B.11.                    a. In order to avoid any misrepresentation of fact to a consumer, any bank
                            staff member who deals directly with consumers, or who prepares bank
                            advertisements (or other materials of the bank for external distribution),
                            or who markets any service or product of the bank should be familiar
                            with the legislative, regulatory and code of conduct guidance
                            requirements relevant to his or her work, as well as with the details of
                            any product or service of the bank which he or she sells or promotes.
                         b. Regulators and associations of banks should collaborate to establish
                            and administer minimum competency requirements for any bank staff
                            member who: (i) deals directly with consumers, (ii) prepares any Key
                            Facts Statement or any advertisement for the bank, or (iii) markets the
                            bank’s services and products.
Description              There are no industry-wide minimum requirements of professional competence for
                         any bank staff member, including for those who deal directly with consumers, who
                         prepare bank advertisements (or other materials of the bank for external
                         distribution), or who market any service or product of the bank.

                         As a general rule, however, the various banking associations in Indonesia do not
                         appear to have the resources to take on any such role whether on their own or
                         together. Rather, as the mission team was informed by PERBANAS, what training
                         exists is typically provided exclusively within each bank. Although some banks do
                         provide credible on-the-job training in respect of financial terminology, legislative
                         and regulatory requirements and the range of products and services the bank has
                         on offer, the extent and quality of training inevitably differs from bank-to-bank.

                         Furthermore, the mission team was informed that BI and the various associations
                         of banks have never collaborated to establish and administer minimum
                         competency requirements for any bank staff member.

                         Rural and commercial banks are encouraged, however, to provide “Education and
                         Training Funds” on an annual basis of no less than 5% of the actual expense
                         incurred for human resources in the previous year for the purpose of training their
                                64
                         staff.

                         The only other legislative provision of some relevance comes from the FCP
                         Regulation which requires all financial services providers to maintain and apply
                                                                                  65
                         written policies and procedures for consumer protection.

                         What the abovementioned policies and procedures must specify is, however, left
                         entirely to the discretion of each individual Financial Services Provider. That said,




64
   See BI Regulation No. 5/14/PBI of 2003 concerning Obligation of Funds Provision for Education, Training and Human
Resources Development, Article 2. A similar requirement applies to commercial banks. See: BI Indonesian Banking
Booklet 2013, Part 12 re: Human Resources Development in the Banking Sector
65
   See FCP Regulation, Article 49, section (1)
                           these policies and procedures must become “ a guideline on any operating
                                                                         66
                           activities of the Financial Services Provider” and “complied with by the officers
                                                                              67
                           and employees of the Financial Services Provider”.

                           Financial products are increasingly complicated, products overlap, and the
                           delineation between banking and non-banking products is no longer clear. Thus, it
                           is important that consumers fully understand any product, let alone a complex
                           product before buying it.
Recommendation             OJK, the banking associations and relevant consumer associations should
                           collaborate to establish and administer minimum competency requirements for any
                           bank staff member who: (i) deals directly with consumers, (ii) prepares any Key
                           Facts Statement or any advertisement for the bank, or (iii) markets the bank’s
                           services and products. At the very least, banking industry employees who deliver
                           products and services to consumers need to be financially literate, fully
                           knowledgeable about these products and services, aware of the Financial
                           Consumer Laws and regulations and able to explain the nuances to consumers.

                     13.   In the long-term and at a minimum, there should be a licensing requirement for
                           bank staff and intermediaries who deal face-to-face with financial institution
                           consumers or who prepare advertising and sales brochures to undertake
                           standardized training programs which meet OJK requirements. In particular, there
                           should be training and qualification requirements for staff or third party agents who
                           advise on financial products and services, as well as requirements to ensure that
                           sufficient information about the customer’s needs is gathered so as to ensure that
                           appropriate products and services are provided.



SECTION C                  CUSTOMER ACCOUNT HANDLING AND MAINTENANCE


Good Practice C.1          Statements
                           a. Unless a bank receives a customer’s prior signed authorization to the
                               contrary, the bank should issue, and provide the customer free of charge,
                               a monthly statement of every account the bank operates for the
                               customer.
                           b. Each such statement should: (i) set out all transactions concerning the
                               account during the period covered by the statement; and (ii) provide
                               details of the interest rate(s) applied to the account during the period
                               covered by the statement.
                           c. Each credit card statement should set out the minimum payment
                               required and the total interest cost that will accrue, if the cardholder
                               makes only the required minimum payment.
                           d. Each mortgage or other loan account statement should clearly indicate
                               the amount paid during the period covered by the statement, the total
                               outstanding amount still owing, the allocation of payment to the principal
                               and interest and, if applicable, the up-to-date accrual of taxes paid.

                            e. A bank should notify a customer of long periods of inactivity of any
                               account of the customer and provide a reasonable final notice in writing
                               to the customer if the funds are to be treated as unclaimed money.
                            f. When a customer signs up for paperless statements, such statements
                               should be in an easy-to-read and readily understandable format.
Description                 Banks are currently not under an obligation to issue and provide any customer,
                            free of charge, a monthly statement of every account the bank operates for the
                            customer (unless the customer has provided his or her bank with a prior signed
                            authorization to the contrary). That said, it appears that bank statements account
                            do generally meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) to (d) above but not
                            paragraphs (e) and (f).


                            The FCP Regulation also requires the provision of statements. By Article 27, “ a
                            Financial Services Provider must provide a Consumer with a statement on the
                            balance position and deposit transactions, funds, assets, or obligations of a
                            Consumer accurately, timely, and in a manner and means under the agreement
                            with a Consumer.” The obvious implication is that, provided the agreement states a
                            regular time frame for such statements, any time frame (say, even once a year) is
                            permissible.
Recommendation              The Disclosure Regulation should deal with all aspects of this Good Practice, with
                            all banks being required to apply every aspect.
Good Practice C.2           Notification of Changes in Interest Rates and Non-interest Charges
                               a. A customer of a bank should be notified in writing by the bank of any
                                    change in:
                                        (i) The interest rate to be paid or charged on any account of the
                                             customer as soon as possible; and
                                        (ii) A non-interest charge on any account of the customer a
                                             reasonable period in advance of the effective date of the
                                             change.
                               b. If the revised terms are not acceptable to the customer, he or she
                                    should have the right to exit the contract without penalty, provided
                                    such right is exercised within a reasonable period.
                               c. The bank should inform the customer of the foregoing right whenever
                                    a notice of change under paragraph a. is made by the bank.
Description                 When the Financial Services Regulation comes into effect, a Financial Services
                            Provider will be required to inform its customer of the cost to be borne by him or
                            her for any of its products or services. And, without written consent from a
                            consumer, a Financial Services Provider will be prohibited from providing the
                                                                                      68
                            consumer with automatic facilities that increase charges.


                            More particularly, however, a Financial Serv ices Provider will be required to “inform
                            Consumers of any changes in the benefits, charges, risks, terms and conditions
                            stated in the documents and/or agreements on the products and services of the
                                                         69
                            Financial Services Provider”. And this information must be “notified to Consumers

     FCP Regulation, Article 10, sections (1) and (2)
69
     Ibid., Article 12, section (1)
                        within thirty (30) working days prior to the changes in the benefits, charges, risks,
                        terms and conditions of the products and services of the Financial Services
                                                      70
                        Provider coming into effect”. Furthermore, where a consumer “gives no consent
                        to the changes in the terms of the products and/or services …, the Consumer is [to
                                                                                              71
                        be] entitled to terminate the products and/or services at no cost ”. And, finally,
                        where a consumer “has been allowed reasonable time to give [no consent] … and
                        fails to do so, a Financial Services Provider may deem the Consumer has given
                                                  72
                        consent to the changes”.


                        Various issues arise with the abovementioned requirements. In particular, there is
                        no requirement as to how a customer should be informed of the relevant changes
                        (e.g. in writing or electronically or in newspapers) or as to how the consumer can
                        exercise his or her right to object. Further, there is not an obligation to inform a
                        customer of their right to object and how the objection should be made and the
                        time period for doing so.
Recommendation          The abovementioned issues should be clarified in regulations or, at a minimum, in
                        guidelines to be issued by OJK.
Good Practice C.3       Customer Records
                                   a. A bank should maintain up-to-date records in respect of each
                                         customer of the bank that contain the following:
                                   (i) a copy of all documents required to identify the customer and
                                         provide the customer’s profile;
                                   (ii) the customer’s address, telephone number and all other
                                         customer contact details;
                                   (iii) any information or document in connection with the customer
                                         that has been prepared in compliance with any statute,
                                         regulation or code of conduct;
                                   (iv) details of all products and services provided by the bank to
                                         the customer;
                                   (v) all documents and applications of the bank completed, signed
                                         and submitted to the bank by the customer;
                                   (vi) a copy of all original documents submitted by the customer in
                                         support of an application by the customer for the provision of
                                         a product or service by the bank; and
                                   (vii)any other relevant information concerning the customer.
                        b. A law or regulation should provide the minimum permissible period for
                           retaining all such records and, throughout this period, the customer
                           should be provided ready access to all such records free of charge or for
                           a reasonable fee.
Description             BI’s Regulation on Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting the Financing of
                                  73
                        Terrorism meets the requirements of this Good Regulation to some extent. The
                        gaps include:
                         The customer’s telephone number, email address and all other customer

   BI Regulation 14/27/PBI/2012
                        contact details;
                       Any information or document in connection with the customer that has been
                        prepared in compliance with any statute or regulation;
                       Details of all products and services provided by the bank to the customer;
                       All documents and applications of the bank completed, signed and submitted
                        to the bank by the customer;
                       A copy of all original documents submitted by the customer in support of an
                        application by the customer for the provision of a product or service by the
                        bank; and
                       Any other relevant information concerning the customer.

                    Furthermore, no regulatory provision ensures that a customer can have ready
                    access to his or her bank records either free of charge or for a reasonable fee.
Recommendation      In addition to the requirements of the Regulation on Anti-Money Laundering,
                    commercial and rural banks should be required by OJK Regulation to maintain an
                    up-to-date file in respect of each customer containing the above-mentioned items
                    identified as missing.

                    Also, the Regulation should require banks to maintain a loan file as long as the
                    loan in question has not been repaid or liquidated in some other manner.
Good Practice C.4   Paper and Electronic Checks
                       a. The law and code of conduct should provide for clear rules on the
                           issuance and clearing of paper checks that include, among other
                           things, rules on:
                           (i) checks drawn on an account that has insufficient funds;
                           (ii) the consequences of issuing a check without sufficient funds;
                           (iii) the duration within which funds of a cleared check should be
                                 credited into the customer’s account;
                           (iv) the procedures on countermanding or stopping payment on a
                                 check by a customer;
                           (v) charges by a bank on the issuance and clearance of checks;
                           (vi) liability of the parties in the case of check fraud; and
                           (vii) error resolution
                       b. A customer should be told of the consequences of issuing a paper
                           check without sufficient funds at the time the customer opens a
                           checking account.
                       c. A bank should provide the customer with clear, easily accessible and
                           understandable information regarding electronic checks, as well the
                           cost of using them.
                       d. In respect of electronic or credit card checks , a bank should inform
                           each customer in particular:
                           (i) how the use of a credit card check differs from the use of a credit
                                 card;
                           (ii) of the interest rate that applies and whether this differs from the
                                 rate charged for credit card purchases;
                           (iii) when interest is charged and whether there is an interest free
                                 period, and if so, for how long;
                           (iv) whether additional fees or charges apply and, if so, on what
                                 basis and to what extent; and
                           (v) whether the protection afforded to the customer making a
                                      purchase using a credit card check differs from that afforded
                                      when using a credit card and, if so, the specific differences.
                               e. Credit card checks should not be sent to a consumer without the
                                  consumer’s prior written consent.
                               f. There should be clear rules on procedures for dealing with
                                  authentication, error resolution and cases of fraud.
Description                There is limited compliance with this Good Practice to some extent, but there are
                           gaps.

                           In particular, there does not appear to be a minimum prescribed period for check
                           clearing or in relation to fees for issuing or clearing checks or the liability of the
                           parties to a check in the case of fraud. Detailed provisions regarding fraud
                           generally and the penalties entailed, however, are found in Chapter XXV of the
                           Indonesia Penal Code.

                           The law of checks finds its basis in the Commercial Code, but has been
                                                                                74
                           significantly expanded by a BI Regulation of 2006 and the BI Circular Letter of
                                  75
                           2007. The Regulation and Circular together provide rules pertaining to checks
                           drawn on an account that has insufficient funds and the consequences that flow
                           from the issuance of dishonored checks. If three checks of relatively small sums
                           are dishonored within six months or one check in a sum greater than IDR 500
                           million is issued without sufficient funds, the issuer is “blacklisted” and forbidden
                                                                            76
                           from holding checks at any bank for one year. The Regulation and Circular also
                           deal with how “stop payment” on a check can be realized by a customer and
                                                               77
                           provide rules for error resolution.

                           Furthermore, all banks are under an obligation to educate each one of their deposit
                           or checking account customers by giving oral and/or written information regarding
                           the law applicable to checks and the consequences of issuing a check with
                           insufficient funds, including the provisions regarding compulsory blacklisting for
                           issuing non-sufficient funds (NSF) checks.


                           Finally, Indonesia does not permit electronic or credit card checks.
Recommendation             Consideration should be given in the medium- to long-term to introducing
                           requirements that cover all aspects of this Good Practice. Any new law or
                           regulation should consolidate what exists, as well as provide clear rules on the
                           issuance and clearing of paper checks that deal with:
                           •   the duration within which funds of a cleared check should be credited into the
                               customer’s account;
                           •   charges by a bank on the issuance and clearance of checks; and
                           •   the liability of the parties in the case of check fraud.
Good Practice C.5          Credit Cards
                              a. There should be legal rules on the issuance of credit cards and

                                     related customer disclosure requirements.
                                b.   Banks, as credit card issuers, should ensure that personalized
                                     disclosure requirements are made in all credit card offers, including
                                     the fees and charges (including finance charges), credit limit, penalty
                                     interest rates and method of calculating the minimum monthly
                                     payment
                                c.   Banks should not be permitted to impose charges or fees on pre-
                                     approved credit cards that have not been accepted by the customer.
                                d.    Consumers should be given personalized minimum payment
                                     warnings on each monthly statement and the total interest costs that
                                     will accrue if the cardholder makes only the requested minimum
                                     payment.
                                e.   Among other things, the legal rules should also:
                                     (i) restrict or impose conditions on the issuance and marketing of
                                           credit cards to young adults (below age of 21) who have no
                                           independent means of income;
                                     (ii) require reasonable notice of changes in fees and interest rates
                                           increase;
                                     (iii) prevent the application of new higher penalty interest rates to
                                           the entire existing balance, including past purchases made at a
                                           lower interest rate;
                                     (iv) limit fees that can be imposed, such as those charged when
                                           consumers exceed their credit limits;
                                     (v) prohibit a practice called ―double-cycle billing‖ by which card
                                           issuers charge interest over two billing cycles rather than one;
                                     (vi) prevent credit card issuers from allocating monthly payments in
                                           ways that maximize interest charges to consumers; and
                                     (vii) limit up-front fees charged on sub-prime credit cards issued to
                                           individuals with bad credit.
                                f.   There should be clear rules on error resolution, reporting of
                                     unauthorized transactions and of stolen cards, with the ensuing
                                     liability of the customer being made clear to the customer prior to his
                                     or her acceptance of the credit card.
                                g.   Banks and issuers should conduct consumer awareness programs
                                     on the misuse of credit cards, credit card over-indebtedness and
                                     prevention of fraud.

                         Paragraph (g)
                         As a general rule, however, banks and issuers do not conduct consumer
                         awareness programs on the misuse of credit cards, credit card over-indebtedness
                         and prevention of fraud.


                         The basic provisions for the use of card-based payment instruments are found in
                                                  82              83
                         BI Regulations of 2009 and 2012. The Card Based Payment Amendment
                         Regulation of June 2012 took effect in January 2013, with issuing banks and other
                         credit card issuers and their credit card customers having until January 2015 in
                         order to comply with it fully. Individuals whose monthly income is between IDR 3
                         million (about USD 251) and IDR 10 million (USD 838) are, as a general rule,
                         allowed to have a maximum of two credit cards, while those earning less than IDR
                         3 million per month have been required to cancel their cards as of January 2013
                                                                     84
                         and are barred from acquiring a new card.


                         The Card Based Payment Amendment Regulation has been significantly expanded
                         upon by BI Circular Letter No. 14 of June 2012, which contains detailed consumer
                         protection provisions concerning the information to be received by prospective and
                         actual cardholders including in respect of procedures for use of the card, risks,
                         rights and obligations, interest and fees and charges, transaction and billing
                                                                                      85
                         information and information about how to close the facility.


            1)           The BI Payments System Department will clearly require major resources to
                         implement the above mentioned requirements and to educate and monitor the
                         credit card industry in respect of compliance. So far, it appears that some issuers
                         of credit cards are still learning of their responsibilities in the above and related
                         respects and are only slowly adjusting long-standing practices, including, by way of
                         example, providing customers their terms and conditions for credit cards in less
                         than comprehensible language, less than readable font size and less than
                         complete documents.
Recommendation           BI should consider: (i) whether it has the required resources to ensure effective
                         supervision of the thorough application of all of the requirements recently placed
                         upon issuers of credit cards; and (ii) increasing its resources for these purposes in
                         the event existing staff are found to be insufficient.
                                                                             86

   “Internet banking” is defined as banking services that customers may access via the Internet. The access to the
Internet could be through a computer, mobile phone (“mobile phone banking”), or any other suitable device. Payment
services that are only initiated via the internet using a mobile phone (e.g. by a mobile banking application using an
                            a. The provision of internet banking and mobile phone banking (m-
                               banking) should be supported by a sound legal and regulatory
                               framework.
                            b. Regulators should ensure that banks or financial service providers
                               providing internet and m-banking have in place a security program
                               that ensures:
                                   (i) data privacy, confidentiality and data integrity;
                                   (ii) authentication, identification of counterparties and access
                                         control;
                                   (iii) non-repudiation of transactions;
                                   (iv) a business continuity plan; and
                                   (v) the provision of sufficient notice when services are not
                                         available.
                            c. Banks should also implement an oversight program to monitor third-
                               party control conditions and performance, especially when agents
                               are used for carrying out m-banking.
                            d. A customer should be informed by the bank whether fees or charges
                               apply for internet or m-banking and, if so, on what basis and how
                               much.
                            e. There should be clear rules on the procedures for error resolution
                               and fraud.
                            f. Authorities should encourage banks and service providers to
                               undertake measures to increase consumer awareness regarding
                               internet and m-banking transactions.
Description             With the exception of the rules applicable to electronic fund transfers (see Good
                        Practice C.7 below) and customer data privacy and confidentiality (see Section D
                        below), no sound framework existed at the time of the mission regarding any
                        aspect of this Good Practice as it pertains to consumer protection in the provision
                        of internet and mobile phone banking.
                        However BI’s Branchless Banking Guidelines, compliance with which is entirely
                        voluntary, potentially go some way towards meeting the requirement of this Good
                        Practice. They apply to all banks and telecommunication companies (telcos) that
                        have chosen to join BI’s pilot branchless banking program which was launched in
                        May 2013. Under this program, these banks and/or telcos may, with BI oversight,
                        offered banking and payment system services to Indonesians through agents
                        known as Financial Intermediary Service Units (UPLK).


                        Of relevance regarding this Good Practice, Part V of these Guidelines suggests the
                        following:
                            1. Banks and telecommunication companies should educate their potential
                               customers in order that every user of a service through UPLKs is aware of



app on a smart phone) are not considered to be mobile payments; instead they are categorized as internet payments.
This interpretation is consistent with the view of the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) of the
Bank for International Settlements (BIS), who is the relevant standard setting body on payment and settlement
systems. However, for practical reasons and due to the importance of mobile money in the country, Good Practice
C.6. is intended here as also covering mobile payments and, to some extent, e-money. Further analysis on e-money
issuers in Paraguay is provided in Section IV.
                        and understands the benefits and risks he or she faces.
                     2. Such education should be given to potential customers by means of
                        booklets, brochures or leaflets or by means of verbal explanation, which
                        among other things, makes clear:
                         i) the benefits and risks of the proposed products and related costs;
                         ii) the identity of the applicable UPLK and the status of the cooperation
                              between the bank and/or telco and the relevant UPLK;
                         iii) the procedures to access customer service units (call centers), as well
                              as those regarding the submission of any complaints to the applicable
                              bank and/or telco; and
                         iv) the need for safeguarding measures to be employed by every
                              customer, such as:
                                       keeping his or her password/PIN secret, as well as
                                          changing it from time to time;
                                       not providing any personal information, such as name,
                                          address, account number and name of natural mother to
                                          any unauthorized party;
                                       keeping proof of all transactions;
                                       being vigilant and thorough in making transactions;
                                       safeguarding any cell phone used in making transactions;
                                          and
                                       employing other safeguarding measures, such as blocking
                                          an account should the need arise.
                     3. And finally, banks and telecommunication companies should ensure
                        customer protection at least in the following respects.
                         i) The secrecy of all customers’ data should be protected in accordance
                              with the laws and regulations in force. Also, every cooperation
                              agreement between a bank and/or telco and a UPLK should require
                              the UPLK to keep secret the data it obtains regarding any customer.
                         ii) Other than as expressly agreed between a bank and/or telco and a
                              UPLK, the UPLK should not conduct any activity regarding a
                              customer, nor add any additional cost payable by a customer.
                         iii) The electronic system that is employed should notify the UPLK and
                              the customer in case the transaction has been successfully carried
                              out and, in the event that it is refused or fails, besides notification to
                              the UPLK and the customer, information on follow up procedures
                              should also be given.
                         iv) Procedures should exist: (a) for UPLKs to receive and attempt at least
                              to settle any complaint made by a customer; as well as (b) for
                              transmitting and processing complaints that cannot be solved at the
                              UPLK level.
Recommendation   The early issuance of the above-mentioned Regulation is to be encouraged.
                 Also, more generally, consideration should be given to the consumer protection
                 issues associated with innovative products and distribution channels in the
                 financial system, as well as the appropriate methods to provide flexibility for future
                 innovations. In particular, there should be consideration of: (i) the issues specific to
                 different types of new products and channels; (ii) the different international models;
                 (iii) the regulatory and self-regulatory options; and (iv) capacity building for
                 supervisors. It would be appropriate for OJK and BI to consult closely in this
                    regard, given BI’s role in relation to the payments system. Such consultation could
                    occur pursuant to the OJK/BI coordination and cooperation provisions provided for
                    by Chapter X of the OJK Law. It is, of course, important that care should be taken
                    not to unnecessarily dampen innovation and to ensure that any new regulatory
                    regime provides a balance between relevant risks and the cost of compliance.
                    Further, relevant institutions should be encouraged to consult with Bi and OJK in
                    relation to proposed new innovative product and distribution channels.
Good Practice C.7   Electronic Fund Transfers and Remittances
                        a. There should be clear rules on the rights, liabilities and
                           responsibilities of the parties involved in any electronic fund transfer.
                        b. Banks should provide information to consumers on prices and
                           service features of electronic fund transfers and remittances in easily
                           accessible and understandable forms. As far as possible, this
                           information should include:
                               (i) the total price (e.g. fees for the sender and the receiver,
                                     foreign exchange rates and other costs);
                               (ii) the time it will take the funds to reach the receiver;
                               (iii) the locations of the access points for sender and receiver;
                                     and
                               (iv) the terms and conditions of electronic fund transfer services
                                     that apply to the customer.
                        c. To ensure transparency, it should be made clear to the sender if the
                           price or other aspects of the service vary according to different
                           circumstances, and the bank should disclose this information
                           without imposing any requirements on the consumer.
                        d. A bank that sends or receives an electronic fund transfer or
                           remittance should document all essential information regarding the
                           transfer and make this available to the customer who sends or
                           receives the transfer or remittance without charge and on demand.
                        e. There should be clear, publicly available and easily applicable
                           procedures in cases of errors and frauds in respect of electronic fund
                           transfers and remittances.
                        f. A customer should be informed of the terms and condition of the use
                           of credit/debit cards outside the country including the foreign
                           transaction fees and foreign exchange rates that may be applicable.
Description         Paragraph (a)
                    The Fund Transfers Law of 2011, the Fund Transfers Regulation of 2012, and the
                    Fund Transfers Circular of 2013 together provide at least certain clear rules on the
                    rights, liabilities and responsibilities of the parties involved in any electronic fund
                    transfer, whether within Indonesia or between Indonesia and any other country.
                    They all relate exclusively to fund transfers in written and electronic form.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    The practice among banks seems to vary, however, regarding the extent of
                    information they provide to consumers on prices and service features of electronic
                    fund transfers and remittances. Also, what information is provided in writing is not
                    necessarily in an easily accessible and understandable format. Although, as seen
                    above, banks generally are required to provide written information to their
                        customers in a way which is understandable and easily read, there is no explicit
                        statutory obligation to do so in respect of any terms and conditions applicable to
                                                           87
                        electronic fund transfer services.


                        Paragraphs (c), (d)
                        The requirements of these Good Practices are not met.


                        Paragraph (e)
                        Statutory procedures exist in relation to errors (but not frauds) but are rarely made
                        publicly available.


                        Paragraph (f)
                        Finally, while banks that issue credit and debit cards are under a statutory
                        obligation to provide their customers with terms and conditions applicable to the
                        use of such cards, there is no explicit requirement to inform their cardholders of the
                        foreign transaction fees and foreign exchange rates that may be applicable in the
                        event a card is used outside Indonesia.


                        However, for all incoming and outgoing international transfers of funds, a written
                        agreement is required which “must stipulate at least the following:
                               application of the principle of reciprocity between the parties;
                                                                                                   88

                               rights and obligations of the parties;
                               mechanism for determination of exchange rate, fees and settlement; and
                               mechanism for resolution of problems that may arise in the course of
                                                                                           89
                                collaborative activities in provision of Funds Transfers ”.


                        There is, however, no description of any appropriate “mechanism” whether for the
                        determination of exchange rates and fees or for the resolution of any problems.


                        In addition, Article 68 of Law No. 3 of 2011 allows fees to be charged “within
                        reason”. However this term is not defined.


                        Further provisions deal with the essential information that must be supplied by the
                                                              90
                        Originator of a Funds Transfer Order, as well as certain rights of the Originator.
                        These are the right:
                        
                                                                                                        91
                             to specify the Execution Date in his or her Funds Transfer Order;



87
   Note though that this could very well change under the anticipated BI Payments Department Regulation dealing
with consumer protection in respect of internet and mobile phone banking.
88
   As indicated in the applicable Elucidation, “Reciprocity is intended to safeguard equal treatment between domestic
Providers and foreign Providers”.
89
   See BI Regulation No. 14/23/PBI/2012, Article 8 (3)
90
   Law No. 3 of 2011, Article 8 by Article 1, a “’Funds Transfer Order’ is an unconditional order from a Sender to a
Receiving Provider for payment of a specified amount of Funds to a Beneficiary .” And the “’Originator’ is the party
issuing a Funds Transfer Order in the first instance”.

                             to learn from the Originating Provider the estimated time frame for execution of
                                           92
                              the transfer; and
                         
                                                          93
                              to specify a Payment Date.


                         The treatment of error resolution is dealt with in Chapter V of the Funds Transfer
                         Law and Part III of the Fund Transfers Regulation, as well as in a separate section
                                                                                                           94
                         of the Fund Transfers Circular Letter. The latter deals with a Provider’s
                                                                          95
                         obligations in the event that, after Acceptance, the Provider is late or makes an
                                                                                                  96
                         error in executing a transfer or fails to execute a Funds Transfer Order. And, in
                         these respects, the Circular indicates the method of calculating the amount of fees,
                         interest or compensation to be paid by the Provider.
Recommendation           In the medium-term, BI should consider revising its Fund Transfers Regulation to
                         deal with those aspects, if any, of the Good Practice that remain to be covered
                         following the issuance of the BI Regulation on consumer protection in internet and
                         mobile phone banking.
Good Practice C.8        Debt Recovery
                            a. A bank, agent of a bank and any third party should be prohibited from
                                employing any abusive debt collection practice against any customer
                                of the bank, including the use of any false statement, any unfair
                                practice or the giving of false credit information to others.
                            b. The type of debt that can be collected on behalf of a bank, the person
                                who can collect any such debt and the manner in which that debt can
                                be collected should be indicated to the customer of the bank when
                                the credit agreement giving rise to the debt is entered into between
                                the bank and the customer.
                            c. A debt collector should not contact any third party about a bank
                                customer’s debt without informing that party of the debt collector’s
                                right to do so; and the type of information that the debt collector is
                                seeking.
                            d. Where sale or transfer of debt without borrower consent is allowed
                                by law, the borrower should be:
                                (i) notified of the sale or transfer within a reasonable number of

   Ibid., Article 11 by Article 1, the “’Execution Date’ is a specified date at which a Receiving Provider is required to
execute the Funds Transfer Order from the Originator”.
93
   Ibid., Article 12 By Article 1, “’Payment Date’ is the date at which the Benefi ciary Provider is required to provide
Funds that may be appropriated in favor of the Beneficiary”.
94
   Note: The English translation of the official text of BI Circular Letter No. 15/23/DASP refers to “Operator” but this
term is nowhere defined in this Circular or in the relevant Regulation or Law. What is meant, however, is clearly
“Provider” which is defined in Article 2 of BI Regulation 14/23/PBI/2012 as “ any Bank and non-bank business entity
incorporated in Indonesia that has obtained approval or licensing from Bank Indonesia to operate as: a. member of
the BI-RTGS System; b. member of the SKNBI; and c. provider of any card based payment instrument offering Funds
Transfer services”. RTGS stands for “Real Time Gross Settlement” and “SKNBI” means “BI’s Natio nal Clearing
System”.
95
   Article 1 of Law No. 3 of 2011 defines: “Funds Transfer Order” as "an unconditional order from a Sender to a
Receiving Provider for payment of a specified sum of Funds to a Beneficiary”; “Acceptance” as “an action by a
Receiving Provider indicating approval to execute or fulfil the contents of a received Funds Transfer Order”; and
“Receiving Provider" as “an Originating Provider, Intermediary Provider and/or Beneficiary Provider receiving
a Funds Transfer Order, including the central bank and other Provider conducting settlement activities for inter-
Provider payments”.

                                  (ii) informed that the borrower remains obligated on the debt; and
                                  (iii) provided with information as to where to make payment, as well
                                        as the purchaser’s or transferee’s contact information.
Description              To some extent the provisions of this Good Practice are met by BI Regulations, but
                         there are gaps.


                         Paragraph (a)
                         Although there is no explicit prohibition on giving false statements or false credit
                         information to others, by a recent BI Regulation, any agent of a bank is prohibited
                         from employing abusive debt collection practices against any customer of the
                               97
                         bank. This same Regulation makes a bank liable for any action taken by any debt
                         collector acting as an agent on its behalf that causes injury to a customer.


                         Paragraph (b)
                         However, it would appear to be the case that there is compliance with this Good
                         Practice.


                         Paragraph (c)
                         There are no explicit requirements to the effect of this Good Practice. However BI
                         Regulation No. 13 of 2011 on the Application of the Precautionary Principle for
                         Commercial Banks Transferring the Execution of Work to Others, amongst other
                         things, requires an agreement between a bank and a debt collector to contain
                         ethical billing practices, to only seek to collect debts at the billing address or
                                                                                                          98
                         domicile of the debtor and to prohibit targeting a person other than the debtor.


                         Paragraph (d)
                         Finally, the sale or transfer of debt without borrower consent is allowed by Article
                         613 of the Civil Code which provides as follows:
                         “The transfer of registered debts and other intangible assets shall be effected by
                         using an authentic or private deed, in which the rights to such objects shall be
                         transferred to another individual. Such transfer shall have no consequences with
                         respect to the debtor, until he has been notified thereof, or if he has accepted the
                         transfer in writing or has acknowledged it. The delivery of bearer claims for
                         indebtedness shall take place by handover, the bearer claims for indebtedness by
                         submission and endorsement of the paper.”


                         This Article refers to the transfer of rights and is silent regarding any continuing
                         obligation of the borrower. Also, there is no:
                            Time frame in which the borrower must either have been notified of the sale or
                             transfer; or

   See BI Regulation No. 14/2/PBI/2012 amending BI Regulation No. 11/11/PBI/2009 concerning Card Based
Payment Instruments which deals in part with outsourcing certain bank functions, including debt collection activities.
And see also BI Circular Letter No. 14/17/DASP of June 2012.
98
   Part IV
                       Requirement that the borrower be provided with information as to where to
                        make payment, as well as the purchaser’s or transferee’s contact information.
Recommendation      In the long-term, consideration should be given to introducing requirements on debt
                    collection operations that, among other things, require:
                       the licensing and oversight of all properly registered collection agencies by an
                        appropriate regulatory authority;
                       the provision of services in accordance with stated parameters on the basis of
                        generally acceptable fair and reasonable behavior; and
                       the provision of statistics by each licensed agency to OJK on a regular basis
                        for annual consolidation and wide-spread public dissemination.


                    In addition, consideration should be given to amending Article 613 of the Civil Code
                    to deal with issues related to the assignment of debts. The changes should apply
                    so as to require, where there is a sale or transfer of a debt without the borrower’ s
                    consent, the borrower must be:
                       notified of the sale or transfer within a reasonable number of days;
                       informed that he or she remains obligated on the debt; and
                       provided with information as to where to make payment, as well as the
                        purchaser’s or transferee’s contact information.
Good Practice C.9   Foreclosure of mortgaged or charged property
                       a. In the event that a bank exercises its right to foreclose on a property
                           that serves as collateral for a loan, the bank should inform the
                           consumer in writing in advance of the procedures involved, and the
                           process to be employed by the bank to foreclose on the property it
                           holds as collateral and the consequences thereof to the consumer.
                       b. At the same time, the bank should inform the consumer of the legal
                           remedies and options available to him or her in respect of the
                           foreclosure process.
                       c. If applicable, the bank should draw the consumer’s attention to the
                           fact that the bank has a legal right to recover the balance of the debt
                           due in the event the proceeds from the sale of the foreclosed
                           property are not sufficient to fully discharge the outstanding amount.
                       d. In the event the mortgage contract or charge agreement permits the
                           bank to enforce the contract without court assistance, the bank
                           should ensure that it employs professional and legal means to
                           enforce the contract, including regarding the sale of the property.
Description         This Good Practice is not covered by the laws of Indonesia, including the Civil
                    Code and the Mortgage Law.
Recommendation      OJK should consider formulating rules that capture all aspects of this Good
                    Practice.
Good Practice       Bankruptcy of Individuals
C.10                   a. A bank should inform its individual customers in a timely manner and
                          in writing on what basis the bank will seek to render a customer
                          bankrupt, the steps it will take in this respect and the consequences
                          of any individual’s bankruptcy.
                       b. Every individual customer should be given adequate notice and
                          information by his or her bank to enable the customer to avoid
                                  bankruptcy.
                               c. Either directly or through its association of banks, every bank should
                                  make counseling services available to customers who are bankrupt
                                  or likely to become bankrupt.
                               d. The law should enable an individual to:
                                       (i) declare his or her intention to present a debtor’s petition for
                                             a declaration of bankruptcy;
                                       (ii) propose a debt agreement;
                                       (iii) propose a personal bankruptcy agreement; or
                                       (iv) enter into voluntary bankruptcy.
                               e. Any institution acting as the bankruptcy office or trustee responsible
                                  for the administration and regulation of the personal bankruptcy
                                  system should provide adequate information to consumers on their
                                  options to deal with their own unmanageable debt.
Description                The mission team was advised that, in practice, banks do not comply with
                           paragraphs (a) to (c) and (e) of this Good Practice. However, an individual debtor,
                           having two or more creditors and failing to pay at least one debt which has matured
                           and became payable, may be declared bankrupt through a Court decision, either
                                                                                                     99
                           on the debtor’s own petition or at the request of one or more creditors .
Recommendation             Consideration should be given to requiring compliance with all aspects of this Good
                           Practice, including providing borrowers the statutory right to propose debt
                           agreements with their banks.


                           The benefit of a debt agreement to an insolvent consumer would potentially
                           include: (a) making affordable regular payments over a fixed period and having
                           these payments tailored to the consumer’s budget; (b) unpaid debt being legally
                           written off (including interest); and (c) arrangements being binding on all of the
                           consumer’s creditors. These benefits could be made subject to certain criteria,
                           including: (i) the inability to pay debts as and when they fall due; (ii) regular
                           employment; and (iii) unsecured debts and equity in assets below a specified
                           statutory minimum.



SECTION D                   PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION

Good Practice D.1          Confidentiality and Security of Customers’ Information
                           a. The banking transactions of any bank customer should be kept
                              confidential by his or her bank.
                           b. The law should require a bank to ensure that it protects the
                              confidentiality and security of the personal data of its customers against
                              any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such
                              information, as well as against unauthorized access.
Description                Indonesia has no consolidated data protection law. Rather, the Banking Law,
                           the OJK Law, the FCP Regulation, the Electronic Information and Transactions



99
     See Bankruptcy Law, Article 2 (1)
                        Law, Government Regulation on Implementation of Electronic Systems and
                        Transactions, the Consumer Law, the Law on Human Rights, the Indonesian
                        Criminal Code and the Indonesian Civil Code all have provisions either dealing
                        explicitly with, or of relevance to, privacy and data protection.


                        The Banking Act defines “bank secrecy” as “anything related to information
                                                                        100
                        regarding a depositor and his deposits”.              And, as general rule, banks are
                        required to “keep information concerning deposit customers and their deposits
                                       101
                        confidential”.     A “depositor” is defined as “a customer who places funds in the
                        form of deposits according to an agreement between a bank and the customer
                                     102
                        concerned” . And “deposits” are defined as “funds entrusted to a bank by the
                        public based on an agreement in the form of demand deposits, time deposits,
                                                                                        103
                        certificates of deposit, savings and/or other similar forms”. The same general
                                                                            104
                        rule applies also to so-called “Affiliated Parties” .
                        Thus, the Banking Law leaves open the right of banks and their affiliated parties to
                        disclose information regarding the loan accounts of their retail customers and any
                        other information pertaining to a retail customer that is not deposit-related. The
                        position is confirmed by the Elucidation of Article 40 (1) which reads as follows:
                        “If a Customer of a Bank is a Deposit Customer who at the same time is also a
                        Debtor Customer, the Bank shall keep confidential (undisclosed) the information
                        concerning the Customer in its status as a Deposit Customer. Information
                        concerning Customers other than Deposit Customers is not information that shall
                        be kept confidential by the Bank.”


                        The FCP Regulation holds that an essential principle of financial consumer
                        protection is the “confidentiality and security of consumers’ data and
                                     105
                        information”. Thus, as of August 7, 2014 and as a general rule, any bank and
                        other provider of financial services will be “prohibited from disclosing data and/or
                                                                                                  106
                        information on its consumers to third parties in any manner whatsoever ”.
Recommendation          In the medium - to long-term, Indonesia should have a Personal Data Protection
                        Law that requires all entities, including banks, to protect the confidentiality and
                        security of all personal data in respect of their customers, including all data
                        regarding them stored electronically, against unauthorized access and any
                                                                                                         107
                        anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information.
                        This law should also apply generally to all personal information. This
                        recommendation is made, given:

                              the sensitivity of the personal information held and used in financial services;
                              the extensive information flows which can take place (such as between
                               intermediaries and agents and between members of a corporate group);
                              the increasing potential for information to be received and held electronically
                               with a corresponding increase in the risk of unauthorized access as well as the
                               volume of information which can be easily transmitted;
                              the uncertainty which presently exists in at least some financial institutions as
                               to the extent to which information can be used for purposes such as marketing
                               and shared with corporate group members; and
                              the fact that privacy is treated as a fundamental human right deserving of
                               protection in various international instruments to which many countries are
                               signatories.


                           The OECD Guidelines on the Protection and Privacy and Trans-border Flows of
                           Personal Data, 2013, have been used as the basis for developing many such data
                           protection laws. In summary, the relevant principles in the OECD Guidelines are
                           those dealing with collection, data quality, purpose and use, security, openness,
                           access and trans-border data flows.
Good Practice D.2          Sharing Customer’s Information
                           a. A bank should inform its customer in writing:
                                   a. of any third-party dealing for which the bank is obliged to share
                                      information regarding any account of the customer, such as any
                                      legal enquiry by a credit bureau; and
                                   b. as to how it will use and share the customer’s personal
                                      information.
                           b. Without the customer’s prior written consent, a bank should not sell or
                              share account or personal information regarding a customer of the bank
                              to or with any party not affiliated with the bank for the purpose of
                              telemarketing or direct mail marketing.
                           c. The law should allow a customer of a bank to stop or ―opt out‖ of the
                              sharing by the bank of certain information regarding the customer and,
                              prior to any such sharing of information for the first time, every bank
                              should be required to inform each of its customers in writing of his or her
                              rights in this respect.
                           d. The law should prohibit the disclosure by a third party of any banking-
                              specific information regarding a customer of a bank.
Description                There is limited compliance with this Good Practice, especially in relation to the
                           use of personal information involving electronic data.


                           Paragraph (a)
                           Indonesian law does not meet the requirements of this Good Practice. However,
                                                                             108
                           the Law on Electronic Information and Transactions now provides that:
                               1) Unless provided otherwise by Rules, use of any information through
                                  electronic media that involves personal date of a Person must be made
                                  with the consent of the Person concerned.



108
      Act No. 11 of 2008
                            2) Any Person whose rights are infringed as intended by paragraph (1) may
                                                                                        109
                                 lodge a claim for damages incurred under this Law.

                                                                      110
                        And, by recent Government Regulation,           Electronic System Operators have
                        numerous other obligations, including being required to protect and ensure the
                                                                        111
                        privacy and personal data protection of users. In particular, and in response to
                        consumer complaints regarding the use of personal data for unsolicited marketing
                        purposes, Operators are now obliged to obtain the consent of users prior to the
                        acquisition, usage and utilization of their personal data. The data owner (i.e. the
                        consumer) must approve data usage and disclosure.


                        This rule will extend more broadly when the FCP Regulation comes into force. As
                        indicated in D.1 above, a bank will there after be “prohibited from in any manner
                        whatsoever disclosing data and/or information on its Consumers to third parties ”
                        unless “the consumer gives written consent or [the disclosure is] required by laws
                                          112
                        and regulations”.


                        Paragraphs (b) and (c)
                        A customer may stop or opt out of his or her bank sharing certain information
                                                                                                113
                        regarding the customer, provided this right is exercised in writing.        There is no
                        stipulation, however, to the effect that, prior to any such sharing of information for
                        the first time, a bank is required to inform its customer in writing of his or her rights
                        in this respect.


                        Paragraph (d)
                        There are no explicit requirements to the effect of this Good Practice.
Recommendation          It is suggested that consideration be given to instituting a stipulation in law that
                        would require all banks to comply with every aspect of this Good Practice.
Good Practice D.3       Permitted Disclosures
                        The law should provide for:
                            a) the specific rules and procedures concerning the release to any
                               government authority of the records of any customer of a bank;
                            b) rules on what the government authority may and may not do with any
                               such records;
                            c) the exceptions, if any, that apply to these rules and procedures; and
                            d) the penalties for the bank and any government authority for any
                               breach of these rules and procedures.

                           The Banking Law allows exceptions to a bank’s general obligation to maintain
                                                                                   114
                           secrecy regarding the deposits of any depositor.             They include provisions
                           allowing for certain disclosures for tax purposes in relation to deposit and depositor
                                        115
                           information, to settle a bank’s claims (in respect of a depositor) which have been
                           transferred to the Agency for State Loan Settlement and Auction or to the
                                                                   116

                           involving the depositor ; for or the purposes of civil suits ; as required by the
                                                         119
                           Anti-Money Laundering Law and a board of directors of a bank may disclose a
                                                                            120
                           customer’s financial information to other banks.


                           The Banking Act also provides stiff fines and imprisonment of two to four years for
                           anyone who, without a written order or permission from the Chairman of BI
                                                                                                               121
                           “knowingly and willfully forces a bank or affiliated party to disclose information”
                           contrary to Article 40.


                           Also, a bank is obliged to honor a depositor’s written request to have information
                                                                                                            122
                           concerning his or her deposits released to any party named by the depositor.
                           Surprisingly, however, there is no requirement to ensure the authenticity of any
                           such request. In addition, the legal heirs of a depositor are entitled to obtain all
                                                                                         123
                           information regarding the deposits of the deceased depositor.


                           Customers have certain rights in relation to the disclo sure of information. A “party
                           disadvantageously affected by the disclosed information ” in respect of a tax claim,
                           a criminal investigation or proceeding, a civil law suit, or the exchange of
                           information between or among banks, is “entitled to know the contents of such
                           information, and to request rectification if errors are found in the disclosed
                                        124
                           information.” Nothing is stated, as to how, a party is to know whether any of his
                           or her information has been disclosed in any such instance. Also, as noted in Good
                           Practice, the general prohibition on a bank disclosing data and information on any
                           retail customer to a third party will not apply if the customer consents in writing or if
                           the customer gives written consent and/or [the disclosure is] required by laws and
                                        125
                           regulations”. And as also seen, the consumer can stop or opt-out of consent in
                                                                                      126
                           this respect by means of a follow-up written statement.

Good Practice D.4            Credit Reporting
                             a. Credit reporting should be subject to appropriate oversight, with
                                sufficient enforcement authority.
                             b. The credit reporting system should have accurate, timely and sufficient
                                data. The system should also maintain rigorous standards of security
                                and reliability.
                             c. The overall legal and regulatory framework for the credit reporting
                                system should be: (i) clear, predictable, non-discriminatory,
                                proportionate and supportive of consumer rights; and (ii) supported by
                                effective judicial or extrajudicial dispute resolution mechanisms.
                             d. In facilitating cross-border transfer of credit data, the credit reporting
                                system should provide appropriate levels of protection.
                             e. Proportionate and supportive consumer rights should include the right of
                                the consumer
                                         (i) to consent to information-sharing based upon the knowledge
                                             of the institution’s information-sharing practices;
                                         (ii) to access his or her credit report free of charge (at least once
                                              a year), subject to proper identification;
                                         (iii) to know about adverse action in credit decisions or less-than-
                                               optimal conditions/prices due to credit report information;
                                         (iv) to be informed about all inquiries within a period of time, such
                                              as six months;
                                         (v) to correct factually incorrect information or to have it deleted
                                             and to mark (flag) information that is in dispute;
                                         (vi) to reasonable retention periods of credit history, for instance
                                              two years for positive information and 5-7 years for negative
                                              information; and
                                         (vii) to have information kept confidential and with sufficient
                                              security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access,
                                              misuse of data, or loss or destruction of data.
                             f.   The credit registries, regulators and associations of banks should
                                  undertake campaigns to inform and educate the public on the rights of
                                  consumers in the above respects, as well as the consequences of a
                                  negative personal credit history.

      Ibid, Article 31 (3)
                         The mandate for exercising the oversight function for Credit Reporting Systems is
                         not well defined under the laws of Indonesia. BI has been operating a Credit
                         Registry since 2005 and the Credit Bureau Regulation establishes BI as the
                         supervisory authority for private credit bureaus. OJK now has responsibility for
                                                                                       128
                         regulating and developing the interbank information system . The Ministry of
                         Communication and Information Technology (MCIT) also has a role in relation to
                         data privacy and credit reporting. However there is no provision for any entity in
                         Indonesia to have a comprehensive oversight function in respect of the credit
                         reporting system in Indonesia.


                         Ideally one authority would be identified as the primary overseer of the system,
                         with other relevant authorities collaborating and coordinating actions with the
                         primary overseer. As well as being responsible for supervision of private credit
                         bureaus, the relevant body should have general responsibility for:
                                  the institutions, rules, participants and public policy objectives regarding
                                   the flow of relevant credit information to creditors, financial institution
                                   supervisors and other potential users of the system, consistently with the
                                   relevant national strategy on credit reporting; and
                                  coordination between all relevant government agencies, regulators with
                                   responsibility for any aspect of the credit reporting system


                         The situation is somewhat confused at the moment as BI operates the BIK and
                         supervises LPIPs (Chapter X of the Credit Bureau Regulation) but the OJK Law
                         specifically provides that OJK has power “to regulate and supervise bank
                                                                                                            129
                         soundness that includes: …(iii) debtor information system; (iv) credit testing;…”.


                         Paragraph (b)
                         The Credit Bureau Regulation requires an LPIP to “maintain the accuracy,
                         currency, security and confidentiality of data.” (Article 34 (a)). Article 35
                         then specifies in some detail the issues that must be dealt with in the
                         LPIP’s policies and operational procedures. Members of the Board and
                         Commissioners of an LPIP are also required to have a “strong commitment
                         to preserve the confidentiality and security of data and information” (Article
                         10(1)(a)(5) of the Credit Bureau Regulation).
                         Article 81 also provides for sanctions to be imposed on LPIPs if they are
                         responsible for inaccurate credit information.


                         The Debtor Information System Regulation does not contain provisions equivalent
                         to those above apart from requirements for the timely submission of information to
                         BIK (Chapter V).


                         Paragraph (c)
                         Credit Reporting activities are covered by an array of different laws and


128
    So far as the interbank information system is concerned, OJK now has that responsibility (see Article 69(1)(a) of
the OJK Law and Article 32 of the BI Law).
129
    Article 7(b)
regulations. Of particular relevance in this context are the Credit Bureau
Regulation which applies to LPIPs, the Debtor Information System Regulation
which applies in relation to the BIK and the Electronic Transactions Law.


See the separate report on Credit Reporting for a discussion of relevant provisions
of these laws. The primary point to note in this context is that the Credit Bureau
Regulation has a much stronger consumer protection regime than the Debtor
Information System Regulation.


See Banking Sector Good Practice E.1 concerning dispute resolution systems and
the separate report on Credit Reporting in relation to access and correction rights
in respect of credit reporting. In particular it is to be noted that Chapter IX of the
Credit Bureau Regulation contains extensive provisions on the Handing and
Settlement of Complaints in relation to the conduct of LPIPs. However, the Debtor
Information System Regulation does not contain similar provisions for debtors
whose information is held by BIK, although there are provisions for debtors to
access their credit information.

Finally, it is to be noted that Article 38 of the Electronic Transactions Law provides
for the initiation of actions by individuals, or by way of a class action, “against
parties that provide Electronic Systems and/or
using Information Technology” to the detriment of the relevant party.

Paragraph (d)
Article 42(1)(b) of the Credit Bureau Regulation relevantly provides that an LPIP is
prohibited from “transferring, copying, and/or making the Credit Data and Other
Data accessible to/by other parties both inside and outside the territory of the
Republic of Indonesia.”


There is not, however, an equivalent provision in the Debtor Information System
Regulation.


Paragraph (e)
See separate report on Credit Reporting.


Paragraph (f)
BI has undertaken public awareness campaigns explaining the role of credit
reporting in the overall credit process. Initiatives have included an annual road
show, TV and radio advertisements, participation in trade shows, posters and the
establishment of a clinic at BI so that banks, debtors and other organizations can
see how the BI credit registry operates in practice. However it is considered that
further awareness campaigns are necessary to inform consumers about their rights
and the overall objective of credit reporting systems. This will be especially
important as private credit bureaus start to operate.


See separate report on Credit Reporting.
Recommendation      There should clarification of who has responsibility for the general oversight of the
                    credit reporting system in Indonesia in light of the issues discussed in paragraph
                    (a) above.
                    See also separate report on Credit Reporting for other relevant recommendations.



SECTION E           DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS


Good Practice E.1   Internal Complaints Procedure
                        a. Every bank should have in place a written complaints procedure and
                           a designated contact point for the proper handling of any complaint
                           from a customer, with a summary of this procedure forming part of
                           the bank’s Terms and Conditions referred to in B.7 above and an
                           indication in the same Terms and Conditions of how a consumer can
                           easily obtain the complete statement of the procedure.
                        b. Within a short period of time following the date a bank receives a
                           complaint, it should:
                                (i) acknowledge in writing to the customer/complainant the fact
                                       of its receipt of the complaint; and
                                (ii) provide the complainant with the name of one or more
                                        individuals appointed by the bank to deal with the
                                        complaint until either the complaint is resolved or cannot
                                        be processed further within the bank.
                        c. The bank should provide the complainant with a regular written
                           update on the progress of the investigation of the complaint at
                           reasonable intervals of time.
                        d. Within a few business days of its completion of the investigation of
                           the complaint, the bank should inform the customer/complainant in
                           writing of the outcome of the investigation and, where applicable,
                           explain the terms of any offer or settlement being made to the
                           customer/complainant.
                        e. When a bank receives a verbal complaint, it should offer the
                           customer/complainant the opportunity to have the complaint treated
                           by the bank as a written complaint in accordance with the above. A
                           bank should not require, however, that a complaint be in writing.
                        f.   A bank should maintain an up-to-date record of all complaints it has
                             received and the action it has taken in dealing with them.
                        g. The record should contain the details of the complainant, the nature
                           of the complaint, a copy of the bank's response(s), a copy of all other
                           relevant correspondence or records, the action taken to resolve the
                           complaint and whether resolution was achieved and, if so, on what
                           basis.
                        h. The bank should make these records available for review by the
                           banking supervisor or regulator when requested.
Description         The requirements of this Good Practice are to some extent met in practice and
                    under the BI Regulation No. 7 of 2005 on the Resolution of Consumer Complaints
                       and the Consumer Law. They will also be partially provided for by the FCP
                       Regulation when it comes into effect in August 2014.


                       Paragraph (a)
                       Every bank must have a policy and written procedures that deal with the receipt of
                       consumer complaints, the handling and resolution of consumer complaints, and the
                                                                           130
                       monitoring of complaint handling and resolution. All banks are also required to
                       have a “unit and/or function” established in each branch office to handle and
                       resolve consumer complaints and the powers of the unit and/or function must be
                                                                                 131
                       set forth in the policy and procedures referred to above. Furthermore, banks are
                       required to publish for the public the existence of the dedicated unit and/or function
                                                           132
                       “in written and/or electronic form”. Although less than adequate, it would appear,
                       therefore, that merely publishing this essential information on the web or by email
                       will suffice.


                       There are also general provisions in the Consumer Law relating to entrepreneurs
                       obligations to deal with customer complaints. In this regard Article 19 requires
                       entrepreneurs to compensate consumers for the damages or loss that they suffer
                       as a result of consuming services. Consumers also have the statutory right:
                               to be heard in expressing any opinion and complaint regarding goods
                                and/or services they use or consume;
                               to obtain proper advocacy, protection and settlement in any consumer
                                protection dispute; and
                               to obtain compensation, redress and/or substitution, if the goods and/or
                                services received are not in accord with the agreement or not received as
                                           133
                                requested.

                       Further, once the new FCP Regulation comes into effect all financial services
                       providers (including banks) will be required to have and implement mechanisms for
                                                          134
                       consumer complaint resolution.          In summary, the requirements are for
                       procedures which:
                            Are notified to the consumer (Article 32 (1));
                            Are free (Article 33);
                            Include the financial service provider reporting to OJK on complaints and
                               the status of resolution approximately every 3 months (Article 34);
                            Require the complaint to be resolved within 20 days or, in specified cases,
                               within an additional 20 days (Article 35);
                               Require a work unit to be established to handle and resolve complaints,
                                with one person in each office to handle complaints. Further, if an
                                employee handling the complaint was involved in the relevant transaction
                                then the compliant has to be referred to another employee (Articles 36 and
                                37).

    These provisions are also expanded on in OJK Circular No.2/SEOJK.07/2014 concerning the Service and Dispute
Settlement of Consumer Complaints, which was made after the CPFL Review.
                         Article 38 further requires a financial services provider to:
                               Conduct an internal examination of the complaint competently, correctly,
                                  and objectively;
                               Ensure the correctness of the complaint; and
                                  Submit a statement of apology and offer compensation (redress / remedy)
                                   or repair the product and/or service, if the consumer complained properly.


                         Further, under the FCP Regulation, a financial services provider will be
                         “responsible for the loss of the consumer arising out of the faults and/or failure, of
                         the officers, and employees of the financial services provider and/or any third
                                                                                   135
                         parties in the employ of the financial services provider”.


                         The practices followed by banks also typically include a written complaints
                         procedure and a designated contact point for the proper handling of complaints
                         from retail customers. However a summary of this procedure apparently rarely, if
                         ever, forms part of a bank’s Terms and Conditions and there is no indication of how
                         a consumer can obtain the complete statement of the bank’s procedures in these
                         respects.


                         Paragraph (b)
                         Typically, a bank will acknowledge receipt of a complaint and of the name of the
                         contact point and of the outcome of the investigation of the complaint within a few
                         days of the investigation being received. See also the description of the FCP
                         Regulation in paragraph (a) above.


                         Paragraph (c)
                         A bank is required to provide information on the status of complaint resolution at
                         any time the customer or the customer’s representative requests explanation from
                                                                                    136
                         the bank regarding the complaint that has been lodged.         Furthermore, if the
                         complaint is submitted in writing, the bank is obliged to convey the result of the
                         complaint resolution process to the customer or the customer’s representative in
                         writing within twenty or forty working days as indicated above. If, however, the
                         complaint is submitted verbally, the bank is required to convey the result of the
                         complaint resolution to the customer or the customer’s representative either in
                         writing or verbally within two working days. A bank also, if requested, typically
                         provides the complainant with a regular update on the progress of the investigation
                         of the complaint at reasonable intervals of time.

    Ibid., Article 12
                        Paragraph (d)
                        As contemplated by this Good Practice, there is a statutory requirement “ to resolve
                                                                                             137
                        each complaint lodged by a customer or a customer’s representative”.


                        A bank is also obliged to resolve a complaint no later than twenty working days
                        after receipt of a written complaint. However, provided the customer or the
                                                                 138
                        customer’s representative is notified        before the expiry of the initial twenty
                        working days, a delay of a further twenty working days is permitted in the event
                        that: (a) the bank office receiving the complaint is not the one at which the problem
                        occurred and “there are impediments to communication between the two offices”;
                        (b) “special examination” of the bank’s documents is needed; or (c) a matter
                                                                                                          139
                        outside the control of the bank exists, such as the involvement of a third party.


                        The result of the complaint resolution process as determined by the bank must
                        state:
                                the complaint registration number;
                                the problem cited in the complaint; and
                                the determination of the bank, together with explanation(s) and
                                            140
                                 reason(s).

                        Paragraphs (e) to (h)
                        There is not a specific requirement to the effect of these Good Practices.

Recommendation          OJK should give consideration to reviewing and revising the FCP Regulation on
                        the basis of each of the issues raised above.
                        OJK should also require financial services providers to send statistics on consumer
                        complaints, and then OJK should use this information as input to their supervisory
                        activities. Complaints statistics provide with important warning signs not only on
                        consumer protection, but also on reputational and operational risks. Based on the
                        analysis of complaint statistics, OJK could also propose guidelines, instructions or
                        awareness campaigns that address the common problems identified in complaints
                        reports.


                        In time, it will be helpful for all banks and consumers of banking products and
                        services to have reference only to one set of statutory requirements regarding
                        internal complaints procedures. This, though, will necessitate the repeal of the
                        Consumer Law in so far as it applies to banks and all other providers of financial
                        services. As stated above, the FCP Regulation, itself, does not and cannot
                        impliedly repeal or replace the Consumer Law.


                        Further, it should be clear to what extent the BI Regulation dealing with complaints
                        will continue to apply.

Good Practice E.2       Formal Dispute Settlement Mechanisms
                            a. A system should be in place that allows customers of a bank to seek
                               affordable and efficient recourse to a third-party banking ombudsman
                               or equivalent institution, in the event the complaint of one or more of
                               customers is not resolved in accordance with the procedures
                               outlined in E.1 above.
                            b. The existence of the banking ombudsman or equivalent institution
                               and basic information relating to the process and procedures should
                               be made known in every bank’s Terms and Conditions referred to in
                               B.7 above.
                            c. Upon the request of any customer of a bank, the bank should make
                               available to the customer the details of the banking ombudsman or
                               equivalent institution, and its applicable processes and procedures,
                               including the binding nature of decisions and the mechanisms to
                               ensure the enforcement of decisions.
                            d. The banking ombudsman or equivalent institution should be
                               appropriately resourced and discharge its function impartially.
                            e. The decision of the banking ombudsman or equivalent institution
                               should be binding upon the bank against which the complaint has
                               been lodged.
Description             The current statutory systems for the formal resolution of disputes in the banking
                        system are fragmented and overlapping. Apart from recourse to his or her local or
                        District court, a consumer with an unresolved complaint concerning a banking
                        product or service can access either the Consumer Dispute Resolution Board
                                 141                              142
                        (BPSK)       or the BI Mediation Service.     And OJK also has power to provide a
                        service to facilitate the resolution of outstanding consumer complaints under the
                                                                                 143
                        FCP Regulation (see below re the FCC System).                OJK also has advocacy
                        powers to take measures against financial institutions to resolve complaints and to
                        institute proceedings to reclaim property or to recover damages on behalf of a

                        Indonesia is a participant in the ASEAN Committee on Consumer Protection that
                        provides an avenue for consumers of any service or product to complain and seek

                        OJK is to be commended for the establishment of its Integrated Financial
                        Customer Care System (FCC System). The FCC System was first established in
                        early 2013 but has since been further developed to provide a trackable and
                        traceable system for customer complaints with a view to making the review
                        process more effective, quick and responsive. Financial institutions can trace the
                        handling of complaints and consumers can track progress in OJK’s consideration
                        of the complaints. From 21 January 2013 to 31 December 2013, the FCC System
                        recorded 7,655 reports, including 495 information deliveries (6.47%), 6,271
                        information enquiries 981.92%) and 889 complaints (11.61%). Consumers can

                       See Insurance Sector Good Practice E.2 for a full description of the
                       abovementioned provisions.
Recommendation         In the long term, it is recommended that options for a single, independent ADR
                       scheme for all financial sector consumers be considered. It is understood that OJK
                       is giving some consideration to this objective.

                       However, further analysis is needed to identify the most effective institutional
                       setup. Such an analysis should explore different models, and the costing and
                       effectiveness of each in the Indonesian context. At a minimum, it is considered that
                       the relevant body should be independent of financial institutions and OJK (and any
                       other regulator), be available at no or low cost to consumers, have the power to
                       make decisions which are binding on the financial institutions, and operate in
                       accordance with transparent processes and procedures. It is also recommended
                       that it be a licensing condition that the institution concerned be a member of the
                       external dispute resolution scheme. The overseeing body for the scheme should
                                                                                 147
                       include consumer as well as industry representatives.         In the interim the FCC
                       System appears to be playing a useful role.

                       Prior to the commencement of OJK’s new complaint facilitation powers, it is
                       recommended that OJK conduct a public awareness campaign of the processes
                       and procedures to be followed. Furthermore, consumer call centers in both OJK
                       and the Consumer Protection Division of BI’s Payments System Department
                       should help as a first response to consumers’ concerns, provided their existence is
                       very widely publicized (perhaps as a further bank disclosure requirement). It seems
                       likely however that the vast majority of consumers are not likely to know which
                       center to turn to in the first instance. In any event, the capacity of these two centers
                       to deal with complaints should be assessed.

                       The extent to which the BPSK will continue to have jurisdiction over disputes
                       involving financial services after the FCP Regulation comes into effect should also
                       be clarified (through amending regulations). Consideration will also need to be
                       given as to the transitional arrangements for claims which arise before the FCP
                       Regulation commences. It may be the case that the BPSK should be able to hear
                                                                                          th
                       such claims if they are the subject of proceedings as at August 6 , 2014 but not
                       otherwise.


                       The issues outlined above in relation to the OJK facilitation process should be
                       considered and ideally dealt with through clarifying regulations or (less preferably)
                       guidelines. In summary, the principal issues in this context are:
                           OJK’s inability to make binding decisions;

    Guidance may be obtained from the World Bank’s publication on Resolving disputes between Consumers and
Financial Businesses: Fundamentals for a Financial Ombudsman:
http://www.networkfso.org/Resolving-disputes-between-consumers-and-financial-businesses_Fundamentals-for-a-
financial-ombudsman_The-World-Bank_January2012.pdf
                           The ambiguities in the threshold requirements;
                           The requirement for an insurer (or any other relevant financial institution) to
                            have agreed before a dispute can be bought before OJK);
                           The lack of rules as to the qualifications of a facilitator and as to the
                            procedures to be followed in resolving complaints;
                           It is not clear whether a consumer will have to pay fees (ideally not); and
                           Ideally it would be clear that OJK has an obligation to analyze complaint
                            statistics and publicize issues of concern.


                        In the near term, it is also recommended that OJK undertake the following
                        activities:
                         Advise on the terms of reference and governance arrangements for the various
                          industry association schemes with a view to achieving consistency in
                          approaches;
                         Develop formats for the reporting of statistics on consumer complaints to OJK;
                         Consider related regulatory requirements; and
                         Capacity building for the relevant industry associations.
Good Practice E.3       Publication of Information on Consumer Complaints
                            a. Statistics and data of customer complaints, including those related to
                               a breach of any code of conduct of the banking industry should be
                               periodically compiled and published by the ombudsman, financial
                               supervisory authority or consumer protection agency.
                            b. Regulatory agencies should publish statistics and data and analyses
                               related to their activities in respect of consumer protection regarding
                               banking products and services so as, among other things, to reduce
                               the sources of systemic consumer complaints and disputes.
                            c. Banking industry associations should also analyze the complaint
                               statistics and data and propose measures to avoid the recurrence of
                               systemic consumer complaints.
Description             Statistics and data of customer complaints have been required to be compiled and
                                                            148
                        provided to BI on a quarterly basis     and the FCP Regulation requires a financial
                        service provider to report to OJK on complaints and the status of resolution
                        approximately every 3 months (Article 34). However there is no requirement for this
                        information to be published and analyzed by any bank or by BI. Likewise the
                        mission team was informed that, to date, no banking industry association has
                        analyzed any consumer complaint statistics and data and proposed any measures
                        to avoid the recurrence of systemic consumer complaints.
Recommendation          OJK should publish statistics, data and analyses related to its activities in respect
                        of consumer complaints regarding banking products and services so as, among
                        other things, to identify and eventually reduce the sources of systemic consumer
                        complaints and disputes. Banks should also be required to centralize all data on
                        the complaints they receive and to analyze these data periodically.
                        Ideally further regulations (or, at a minimum guidelines) would be introduced to
                        specify the type and format of information that should be collected by banks and

Rural Banks on the management and settlement of customer’s complaints.
                    the required analysis activities. Examples of the type of information that should be
                    required to be collected should include the nature of the complaint, the branch or
                    banking agent and officer involved, the time taken to deal with the complaint, the
                    terms of any decision which is made and the customer’s response. Reviewing and
                    checking such reports should be part of OJK’s on-site and off-site supervision
                    activities in respect of the business conduct of every bank.



SECTION F           GUARANTEE SCHEMES AND INSOLVENCY


Good Practice F.1   Depositor Protection
                        a. The law should ensure that the regulator or supervisor can take
                           necessary measures to protect depositors when a bank is unable to
                           meet its obligations including the return of deposits.
                        b. If there is a law on deposit insurance, it should state clearly:
                                (i)   the insurer;
                                (ii) the classes of those depositors who are insured;
                                (iii) the extent of insurance coverage;
                                (iv) the holder of all funds for payout purposes;
                                (v) the contributor(s) to this fund;
                                (vi) each event that will trigger a payout from this fund to any
                                     class of those insured;
                                (vii)the mechanisms to ensure timely payout to depositors who
                                     are insured.
                        c. On an on-going basis, the deposit insurer should directly or through
                           insured banks or the association of insured commercial banks, if any,
                           promote public awareness of the deposit insurance system, as well
                           as how the system works, including its benefits and limitations.
                        d. Public awareness should, among other things, educate the public on
                           the financial instruments and institutions covered by deposit
                           insurance, the coverage and limits of deposit insurance and the
                           reimbursement process.
                        e. The deposit insurer should work closely with member banks and
                           other safety-net participants to ensure consistency in the information
                           provided to consumers and to maximize public awareness on an
                           ongoing basis.
                        f.   The deposit insurer should receive or conduct a regular evaluation of
                             the effectiveness of its public awareness program or activities.
Description         Indonesia has a comprehensive depositor protection scheme. As from 1 January
                    2014, OJK and the Deposit Insurance Corporation (IDIC) (and in the case of a
                    failure of a so-called “systemic” bank, a committee made up of the Minister of
                    Finance, the Chairman of OJK’s Board of Commissioners and the Head of IDIC)
                    are empowered to take all necessary measures to protect depositors when a bank
                    proved unable to meet its obligations, including the return of deposits.


                    There are, however, a number of issues to be addressed. The issues include the
                        need: (i) to promote public awareness of the deposit insurance system; (ii) to
                        educate the public on the financial instruments and institutions covered by deposit
                        insurance, and the coverage and limits of deposit insurance and the
                        reimbursement process; (iii) to ensure close working relationships between IDIC
                        and all member banks to ensure consistency in the information provided to
                        consumers; and (iv) by way of receiving or conducting regular evaluations of the
                        effectiveness of public awareness programs or activities regarding deposit
                        insurance.


                        In addition, IDIC does not appear currently to be able to access all pertinent
                        records of a bank in clear financial difficulty until BI has revoked the bank’s
                        business license, thereby initiating the bank’s liquidation. This delay may
                        unnecessarily hinders the performance of IDIC’s subsequent responsibilities.

                                       149
                        The IDIC Law         states:
                            that IDIC is designated as the insurer;
                        
                                                                150
                             the extent of insurance coverage;
                            that every commercial and rural bank must be a member of the Deposit
                             Insurance program;
                            that every member bank must pay a yearly membership fee from its own equity
                             at the end of the previous fiscal year (or in the case of a new bank from its
                                               151
                             initial capital);
                            that IDIC is obliged to pay claims to depositors at a bank only in the event that
                             that Bank’s license has been revoked; and
                            that IDIC has the authority, at least, to carry out public awareness programs for
                             banks and the general public on deposit insurance.


                        IDIC deposit insurance covers a total of 2 billion IDR on deposit by any individual in
                        any member bank.


                        While a bank is required to provide information on the deposit guarantee program
                        in respect of any of its products “if the bank product pertains to the raising of
                               152
                        funds,” it is not clear that there is compliance with this obligation.
Recommendation          Consideration should be given to close supervision of banks’ compliance with the
                        abovementioned obligations.
Good Practice F.2       Insolvency
                             a. Depositors should enjoy higher priority than other unsecured
                                creditors in the liquidation process of a bank.
                             b. The law dealing with the insolvency of banks should provide for



149
    Law No. 24 of 2004
150
    The initial coverage was IDR 100,000,000 (or some USD 9,000). This, though, was increased by IDIC Regulation
No. 2/PLPS/2010 to IDR 200,000,000,000 (or some USD 180,000) following the global financial crisis of 2008. The
same IDIC Regulation also set the maximum “fair interest rate” on a deposit account to January 14, 2014 at 7.00% for
an account denominated in IDR and 1.50% for an account denominated in foreign currency.
151
    Each bank’s initial yearly membership fee was 0.1% of the bank’s equity. This, though, was raised to 0.2% on the
sums on deposit as of December 31 in the preceding year, again following the 2008 global financial crisis.

                                     expeditious, cost effective and equitable provisions to enable the
                                     maximum timely refund of deposits to depositors.
                           Under the IDIC Law, depositors enjoy higher priority than other unsecured creditors
                           in the liquidation process of a bank. As indicated, IDIC deposit insurance covers a
                           total of 2 billion IDR on deposit by any individual in any member bank. In the event
                           that this coverage is inadequate, the IDIC Law sets out the hierarchy of payments
                           to creditors from the disposal of assets and/or the collection of receivables. This
                           order is as follows:
                               accrued and unpaid remuneration for staff;
                               severance payment for staff;
                               judicial fees and court charges, cost of unpaid auction expenses and cost of
                                operational expenses;
                               resolution cost incurred by the IDIC;
                               unpaid taxes;
                               uninsured portion of deposits and ineligible deposits; and
                               other creditors.
                                                 153




                           Also, the IDIC Law provides for expeditious, cost effective and equitable provisions
                           to enable the maximum timely refund of deposits to depositors.

Good Practice G.1          Broadly based Financial Capability Program
                                a. A broadly based program of financial education and information
                                   should be developed to increase the financial capability of the
                                   population.
                                b. A range of organizations, including those of the government, state
                                   agencies and non-government organizations, should be involved in
                                   developing and implementing the financial capability program.
                                c. The government should appoint an institution such as the central
                                   bank or a financial regulator to lead and coordinate the development
                                   and implementation of the national financial capability program.
Description                The Indonesian government's approach to financial literacy has come about
                           organically as different agencies have seen the value of the issue and put
                           programs in place to begin to address discrete parts of the issue. Only recently has
                           Indonesian law and regulation clearly assigned financial literacy duties to a specific
                           government agency and that agency (OJK) has published a national blue print to
                           improve the nation's financial literacy, including literacy regarding banking. The
                           document received presidential approval and was launched in November 2013.


                           Paragraph (a)
                           Coming mostly through the efforts of Bank Indonesia and OJK, the government's



153
      See IDIC Law, Article 54 (1)
young effort on financial literacy, while ambitious and commendable, is still varied
and uneven in its coverage should be seen as a mix of initiatives, which lacks
strong coordination across government agencies and at this stage cannot be
considered as broad based in the subjects it covers or the populations it reaches.


Since 2008, BI has advanced a multi-prong financial literacy program which
includes a variety of different interventions. BI has implemented national
campaigns to promote the use of banks (the Ayo ke Bank "Let's Go to the Bank"
campaign) and general consumer protection (the "3P" campaign). It has also
created and distributed financial literacy materials including books, pamphlets and
comics. Additionally, BI developed and implemented a financial education module
for schools which is presently used in elementary, junior high and high school
classrooms. This project also involved entering a MOU with the Ministry of
Education and conducting teacher trainings to help increase usage of the
materials. Similarly for adults, BI has created materials and conducted seminars for
particular segments of the population such as housewives and workers in the
fishing and agricultural industry as well as migrant workers. Finally, in 2012 BI has
conducted a national survey on financial literacy.


OJK has been working in financial literacy for only two years but already has two
main financial literacy programs. One of the existing programs provides access to
basic financial information through a fleet of cars that visits communities to
distribute materials. This channel is particularly useful in reaching rural locations.
While this program has been operating for a while, the present intention is to re-
launch it with the goal of increasing the size of the fleet from seven cars to 20
before 2014. OJK also provides seminars targeted to housewives. The seminars
are hosted by OJK staff and representatives from the financial services industry
and seek to increase attendees' knowledge of financial products. OJK is planning
on implementing many more programs through its national blue print for financial
literacy that was launched in November of 2013.


OJK launched Indonesia's first National Financial Literacy Strategy (blue print) for
financial literacy on 19 November 2013 at a high profile event which will was led by
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. The blue print development process had
been ongoing since April of 2013 and received technical advice from the World
Bank from mid-September through October. The blue print sets out an aggressive
agenda of establishing the essential elements of the nation's financial literacy
infrastructure which will in time empower Indonesian consumers with the product
knowledge, planning ability and decision-making skills to enter the financial
mainstream and thrive within it.


Specifically, the strategy sets out three pillars to the national plan to improve
financial literacy in Indonesia. The first pillar is to provide financial education
through a national campaign which consists of community-based seminars,
university workshops, cultural programs and media outreach. The second pillar
calls for OJK to strengthen the financial literacy infrastructure which includes
enhancing its customer care call center, increasing its web presence, fielding more
financial literacy cars to less accessible communities and periodically conducting
                           its national financial literacy survey (described in G.5 below). The third pillar is for
                           OJK to work with the financial services industry to develop low cost financial
                           products and services.


                           OJK has chosen to focus on specific segments of the population for educational
                           interventions in each of the next five years according to the following schedule:
                                2014: Housewives and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)
                                2015: Students and Professionals
                                2016: Pensioners
                                2017: Housewives and MSMEs
                                2018: Students and Professionals


                           Paragraph (b)
                           In addition to the work of BI and OJK, other government agencies, some
                           companies and a few NGOs have fielded their own programs in financial literacy.
                           Each of these programs has its own independently developed goals, distribution
                           plan, educational standards and data collection practices. Motivations of program
                           providers vary from serving a specialized training need for a segment of adults (as
                           in the case of a World Bank pilot program to education migrant workers), to
                           meeting an educational system standard for youth, to cultivating a positive image
                           for a financial institution. In most cases program providers and sponsors do not
                           coordinate with other programs providers and frequently are unaware of other
                           programs. This deprives all practitioners of learning from each other's experiences,
                           of assuring that educational gaps are filled and unnecessary overlap is avoided
                           and of making meaningful assessments of the effectiveness of the national
                           financial education effort in the aggregate.


                           Paragraph (c)
                           Dating back to 2007, Bank Indonesia has lead national financial literacy efforts, but
                           since 2011 OJK has been charged with that responsibility. OJK's statutory
                           responsibility to provide financial education comes from the OJK Law which
                           established the agency. Specifically the law states, "For the protection of
                           consumers and the public, OJK is authorized to take necessary actions to prevent
                           consumers and the public from harms, which include: a. providing information and
                           educating the public on the characteristics of financial services sector, services,
                                              154
                           and products..."       Coordination between the agencies on financial education
                           matters is lacking to the detriment of both agencies' programs and ultimately the
                           national effort on this subject. Involvement of one agency does not need to require
                           disengagement by the other, but without communication and planning between the
                           agencies, Indonesia will be hard pressed to reach its financial capability potential.

Good Practice G.2          Using a Range of Initiatives and Channels, including the Mass Media
                               a. A range of initiatives should be undertaken by the relevant ministry or
                                  institution to improve people's financial capability regarding banking

                        products and services.
                     b. The mass media should be encouraged by the relevant ministry or
                        institution to provide financial education, information and guidance to
                        the public regarding banking products and services.
                     c. The government should provide appropriate incentives and encourage
                        collaboration between governmental agencies, banking regulators, the
                        banking industry and consumer associations in the provision of
                        financial education, information and guidance regarding banking
                        products and services.
Description         Through a few of its campaigns, the GoI has used a range of initiatives in support
                    of its financial literacy efforts. Some use of mass media has also been attempted.

                    See the separate Financial Capability report in Annex I.
Recommendation      See the separate Financial Capability report in Annex I.
Good Practice G.3   Unbiased Information for Consumers
                        a. Regulators and consumer associations should provide, via the
                           internet and printed publications, independent information on the key
                           features, benefits and risks –and where practicable the costs– of the
                           main types of banking products and services.
                        b. The relevant authority or institution should encourage efforts to
                           enable consumers to better understand the products and services
                           being offered to consumers by banking institutions, such as
                           providing comparative price information and undertaking educational
                           campaigns.
Description         In 2009, Bank Indonesia launched the "3Ps" education campaign to encourage
                    consumers to carefully consider the terms and conditions of any financial product
                    or service they may wish to obtain, including banking products and services ("3Ps"
                    stand for "ensure benefits, understand the risk and consider the costs").

                    See the separate Financial Capability report in Annex I for details.
Recommendation      To the degree they lack comparative price information, present and future
                    consumer information campaigns should begin to include this information so
                    consumers can shop more effectively for banking products and services.
Good Practice G.4   Consulting Consumers and the Financial Services Industry
                        a. The relevant authority or institution should consult consumers,
                           banking associations and banking institutions to help them develop
                           financial capability programs that meet banking consumers' needs
                           and expectations.
                        b. The relevant authority or institution should also undertake consumer
                           testing with a view to ensuring that proposed initiatives have their
                           intended outcomes.
Description         Regulator consultation with the financial services industry appears to be sporadic
                    and not routine. Moreover, there appears to be no regularly used formal, ongoing
                    structure to work with banking associations and banking institutions on financial
                    capability programs. Instead, input is sought from specific banking industry
                    members on a case-by-case basis to assist with a particular project, instead of
                    consulting with the broader industry on a regular basis on longer range planning
                    and on program development.
                           Paragraph (a)
                           Both Bank Indonesia and OJK have demonstrated some willingness to engage the
                           financial services industry on financial capability matters. Bank Indonesia reports it
                           established a working group on public education in banking in 2007, but evidence
                           cannot be found that it met regularly and developed financial capability programs.
                           OJK regularly consulted with the financial services industry, including the banking
                           industry, during the seven to eight months in 2013 when it was developing the
                           national blue print for financial literacy. This working group, however, did not have
                           a formal structure and appeared to have an ad hoc membership. It appears to
                           have been drawn together for the specific purpose of drafting and launching the
                           national Blue Print and it is not yet clear how this collaboration will continue. While
                           these efforts by both BI and OJK show a positive inclination toward collaborating
                           with industry on financial literacy program development, both agencies and the
                           industry could benefit from a more structured approach to financial industry
                           cooperation on financial capability issues.


                           Paragraph (b)
                           While both BI and OJK have conducted national surveys on financial literacy, there
                           is no documentation of thorough, widespread program evaluation or consumer
                           testing. BI reports to have done some program evaluation on a financial education
                           module it has introduced to students. While national surveys are very useful to
                           strategic planning on financial capability matters, they are not substitutes for
                           rigorous evaluation of specific programs and, in fact, can be counterproductive
                           when used for that purpose.
Recommendation             Financial regulators should formalize their consultative relationships with the
                           financial services industry on matters pertaining to financial capability. Establishing
                           and maintaining such a structure will increase the productivity of this relationship,
                           provide better coordination in the provision and distribution of financial capability
                           programs and lessen the likelihood of programmatic gaps or redundancies.


                           FCP Regulation, Article 14 provides OJK a great opportunity to formalize its
                           relationship with the financial services industry by coupling the industry's
                           requirement to provide financial education with ongoing guidance from OJK on the
                                                                                       155
                           types of programs needed to avoid gaps and redundancies.        Individual financial
                           institutions could use such instruction from OJK as they develop their annual plan
                                                                                                156
                           of financial education activities as required under the regulation.      The FISF
                           proposed technical assistance to OJK on FCP, Article 14 could be instrumental as
                           OJK drafts the explanatory circular to Article 14 of the regulation and as OJK
                           develops the processes to provide ongoing guidance to companies.


                           OJK can also use a national financial literacy website to help coordinate the
                           financial literacy efforts of financial institutions. A government sponsored website
                           can feature industry content and inform consumers about industry sponsored
                           financial education programs and events. The FISF proposed technical assistance

                    on the development of a national financial literacy website could support OJK in
                    this task by researching, explaining and applying lessons learned from other
                    countries' financial literacy websites.


                    Consumer surveys, testing and program evaluation should be utilized extensively
                    as a way to make disclosures, consumer protection rules and financial capability
                    programs more effective.
Good Practice G.5   Measuring the Impact of Financial Capability Initiatives
                        a. The financial capability of consumers should be measured, amongst
                           other things, by broadly-based household surveys and mystery
                           shopping trips that are repeated from time to time.
                        b. The effectiveness of key financial capability initiatives should be
                           evaluated by the relevant authorities or institutions from time to time.
Description         Paragraph (a)
                    Both Bank Indonesia and OJK have recently conducted broadly-based consumer
                    surveys, although evidence of mystery shopping trips is lacking. Specifically, Bank
                    Indonesia conducted a financial literacy survey in 2012 and found, among many
                    other things, that Indonesians' level of financial literacy correlated with gender,
                    age, level of income, geography and level of general education. For its part, OJK
                    conducted a survey in 2013 of over 8,000 consumers spread across 20 provinces
                    and determined both the level of consumer knowledge and utilization of six
                    different types of financial products: banking, insurance, finance (credit), pensions,
                    capital markets and pawnshops. The survey found that for most types of financial
                    products, Indonesian adults had a low amount of knowledge and utilization.
                    Specifically:
                       Banking: 21.8% of respondents believed they were literate on banking
                        products and services while 42.7% reported using banking products and
                        services;
                       Insurance: 17.8% of respondents believed they were literate on insurance
                        products and services while 11.8% reported using insurance products and
                        services;
                       Multi-finance: 9.8% of respondents believed they were literate on multi-finance
                        products and services while 6.3% reported using multi-finance products and
                        services;
                       Pension: 7.13% of respondents believed they were literate on pension
                        products and services while 1.5% reported using pension products and
                        services;
                       Securities: 3.8% of respondents believed they were literate on securities
                        products and services while 0.1% reported using securities products and
                        services;
                       Pawnshop: 14.9% of respondents believed they were literate on pawnshop
                        products and services while 5.0% reported using pawnshop products and
                        services.


                    The results from both of these consumer surveys, if shared with program
                    developers, can greatly assist financial capability efforts. Neither BI nor OJK
                    presented information regarding mystery shopping.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    Neither Bank Indonesia nor OJK have made a regular practice of conducting
                    program evaluations on the programs they field. Some programs from BI, including
                    its school based module, have been subject to limited program evaluation, but
                    evidence of widespread program evaluation has not been forthcoming.
Recommendation      Widespread sharing of consumer financial literacy data by regulators would
                    significantly improve future financial literacy efforts. With better data, program
                    funders and developers could do a better job of allocating resources, setting
                    priorities and designing educational interventions to achieve a particular discrete
                    goal with a specific population segment. Use of a mystery shopping approach
                    would also help regulators spot situations where consumers are likely to be
                    victimized.


                    Program evaluations should be made a regular part of all present and future
                    financial literacy programs. Proper data collection and analysis permits program
                    funders and developers to determine if a certain educational intervention is having
                    a positive effect. If the program is not effective, the data can diagnosis the exact
                    weakness and make program enhancement more likely. If the program is having a
                    positive effect, the program evaluation will give funders the confidence to take the
                    program to scale so as to increase its reach and impact. The monitoring and
                    evaluation activities recommended under the World Bank-led Financial Inclusion
                    Support Framework (FISF) speak directly to this need and offer assistance in data
                    collection and analysis. Specifically, the FISF proposal recommends technical
                    assistance on developing key performance indicators for financial inclusion and
                    financial literacy and in creating a monitoring and evaluation framework.
                    Additionally, the FISF proposal suggests capacity building in collecting data for a
                    variety of financial inclusion interventions.



SECTION H           COMPETITION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION

Good Practice H.1   Regulatory Policy and Competition Policy
                    Regulators and competition authorities should be required to consult one
                    another for the purpose of ensuring the establishment, application and
                    enforcement of consistent policies regarding the regulation of financial
                    services.
Description         There is nothing in the law of Indonesia that requires BI or OJK and the
                    competition authority, namely the Business Competition Supervisory Commission
                    (KPPU) to ensure the application of this Good Practice. Although the Banking Law
                    itself makes no reference to competition, as such, the Elucidation of its Article 16
                    paragraph (2) dealing with requirements to be granted a banking license states, in
                    part, that BI is to “take into account the degree of healthy competition among
                         Banks, the degree of Bank density within certain area, and the distribution of
                                                         157
                         national economic development”. It is unclear, however, on what basis this is to
                         be accomplished and there is no requirement for cooperation with KPPU.
                         However a Memorandum of Understanding between KPPU and OJK in the final
                         stages of being negotiated. It is to deal with the consultations designed to ensure
                         that consistent financial services policies are established, applied and enforced.
Recommendation           As of 2014, OKJ and KPPU should coordinate in establishing, applying and
                         enforcing consistent policies to ensure a consistently high level of competition in
                         the delivery of all banking services to Indonesians. For this purpose, it would be
                         helpful to finalize the abovementioned Memorandum of Understanding as a matter
                         of urgency.
Good Practice H.2        Review of Competition
                         Given the significance of retail banking to the economy as a whole and to the
                         welfare of consumers, competition authorities should:
                              (i)   monitor competition in retail banking;
                              (ii) conduct, and publish for general consumption, periodic
                                   assessments of competition in retail banking (such as the range of
                                   interest rates across banks for specific products); and
                              (iii) make recommendations publicly available on enhancing competition
                                    in retail banking.
Description              While KPPU has carried out and published numerous studies dealing with matters
                                        158
                         of competition, it has not carried out any of the matters referred to in this Good
                         Practice.
Recommendation           KPPU should be staffed, equipped and funded so as to permit it to implement this
                                        159
                         Good Practice.
Good Practice H.3        Impact of Competition Policy on Consumer Protection
                         The competition authority and the regulator should evaluate the impact of
                         competition policies on consumer welfare, especially regarding any
                         limitations on customer choice and collusion regarding interest and other
                         charges and fees.
Description              To date, no evaluations of any kind have been made by KPPU on its own (or in
                         conjunction with either BI or the MoT) of the impact of Indonesia’s competition
                         policies on the welfare of consumers of banking services.
Recommendation           In the medium to long-term, KPPU and OJK should adopt and carry out this Good
                         Practice.

The government of Indonesia and major market institutions are very intent on increasing the use
of the capital markets as a means of providing finance for businesses in Indonesia and as a
source of asset accumulation for retail investors. The Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) has
established representatives in 17 of the 34 provinces of Indonesia to provide information to businesses
and investors on the benefits of using the capital markets to raise capital and invest money. Overall, there
is a dynamic movement in the industry to provide the infrastructure for a sound and robust capital market.

The securities market has generally recovered from the crisis of 2008. Market capitalization has

The number of securities accounts has increased from 302,447 in 2008 to 359,333 in 2012 .
However, this does not necessarily reflect the number of retail investors since it includes duplicate,
dormant and institutional accounts. The number of investment fund accounts has risen from 352,429 in
2008 to 515,714 in 2012. Since the vast majority of investment fund accounts are held by retail investors,
this is a good approximation of the number of retail investors in investment funds.

Article 30(1) of the Capital Market Law requires that all securities companies be registered with
OJK which includes by definition broker/dealers, underwriters and investment managers. Sales
representatives of broker-dealers must also be registered with OJK under Rule No. V.B.1. the number of
broker-dealers has stayed relatively constant in recent years consisting of 158 in 2008 and 146 in 2011.

Investment Managers are regulated under the Capital Market Law and can sponsor non-corporate
open-ended investment funds. Investment managers can sell their funds directly or they can contract
with an Investment Fund Selling Agent to sell investment funds. The Investment Fund Selling Agent must
register with OJK under Rule No. V.B.3. The number of investment managers has declined slightly from
77 in 2008 to 73 in 2012, while investment fund selling agents have declined from 27 in 2008 to 22 in
2012.

Under Article 32 of the Capital Market Law, sales representatives of Investment Managers who sell
investment funds and under Rule V.B.2 sales representatives of an Investment Fund Selling Agent
must be registered with OJK. This allows OJK to determine the qualifications of sales people and
provides for a clear line of authority for their oversight and supervision. In order to obtain the registration,
Rule No. V.B.1 provides that the representatives of investment managers, broker-dealers and
underwriters must pass a competency examination. Rule No. V.B.2 (2) provides that representatives of
investment fund sales agents must also pass a competence examination.

SECTION A           INVESTOR PROTECTION INSTITUTIONS


Good Practice A.1   Consumer Protection Regime
                    The law should provide for clear rules on investor protection in the area of
                    securities markets products and services, and there should be adequate
                    institutional arrangements for the implementation and enforcement of
                    investor protection rules.
                        a. There should be specific legal provisions that create an effective
                           regime for the protection of investors in securities.
                        b. There should be a governmental agency responsible for data
                           collection and analysis (including complaints, disputes and
                           inquiries) and for the oversight and enforcement of investor
                           protection laws and regulations.
Description         Paragraph (a)
                    The OJK Law provides for a framework for the effective protection of investors in
                    securities. Article 28 of the OJK Law gives OJK the power to take any measures
                    to protect consumers and the public. The FCP Regulation provides for a
                    framework for the protection of investors in the capital markets. Together with the
                    previously promulgated regulations to implement the Capital Market Law, this
                    regulation provides for an effective regime for the protection of investors in
                    securities. As discussed in more detail below, the laws and regulations provide
                    for the registration and supervision of the market participants and their sales
                    people who deal with retail investors. Rules on disclosure and sales practices are
                    in place and the sales representatives must pass examinations regarding these
                    rules in order to obtain a license from OJK.


                    However, the previously promulgated regulations appear to have been issued
                    piecemeal to address particular issues that had come up in the market for
                    specific sectors of the market. For example:
                            Investment fund selling agents are required to provide prospective
                             customers with a brochure which explains the investment fund in a
                             simple manner, in addition to the longer and more complicated
                             prospectus of the fund. This brochure is generally known as a Key
                             Facts Statement. However, this requirement is not made applicable to
                             broker-dealers or mutual fund employees that sell mutual funds.
                            There is not an overall requirement for the disclosure of entities that can
                             have an impact on an investor’s account. For example, investment
                             managers and custodians of investment funds must disclose affiliated
                             persons, but this does not cover all relevant entities. Advisors and asset
                             managers must disclose the authors of stock market reports and
                             analyses, but broker-dealers are not required to do so. Article 23 of the
                             FCP Regulation will require the disclosure of any conflicts or potential
                             conflicts, but this does not cover all entities that can have an impact on
                             a securities account.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    OJK is responsible for oversight and enforcement of investor protection laws and
                    regulations and as part of that responsibility collects data on complaints and
                    disputes (See Table 15).

Recommendation      The regulations in the area of the capital markets should be synchronized and
                    harmonized so that there is uniformity in regulatory requirements for all market
                    participants performing the same function.
Good Practice A.2   Code of Conduct for Securities Intermediaries, Investment Advisers and
                    Collective Investment Undertakings
                        a. Securities intermediaries, investment advisers and CIUs should
                           have a voluntary code of conduct.
                        b. If such a code of conduct exists, securities intermediaries,
                           investment advisers and CIUs should publicize the code to the
                           general public through appropriate means.
                        c. Securities Intermediaries, Investment Advisers and CIUs should
                           comply with the code and an appropriate mechanism should be in
                           place to provide incentives to comply with the code.
Description         There are no industry based Codes as contemplated by this Good Practice.


                    Paragraph (a)
                          There are no voluntary codes of conduct for securities intermediaries, investment
                          advisers and CIUs in Indonesia. However, Article 30(2) of the FCP Regulation
                          provides that the officers and employees of a financial service provider must
                          abide by the Code of Conduct issued by the individual financial services provider
                          with whom they are employed. In addition, Section 35 of the Capital Market Law
                          sets forth a Code of Conduct for securities companies and investment advisors.


                          Relevant statutory provisions and regulations are not so much a set of principles
                          of good behavior, as a series of prohibitions against egregious behavior. The
                          codes of conduct that exist in the Capital Market Law are based in the
                                                                                                      160
                          regulations of the BAPEPAM LK which are now administered by the OJK.            In
                          addition, Article 35, Code of Conduct, of the Capital Market Law also provides for
                          a series of prohibitions regarding the conduct of broker-dealers and investment
                          managers. An affirmative framework for good conduct of market participants is
                          sorely missing from the regulatory framework.


                          The various market participants in the capital markets in Indonesia have however
                          established a number of associations to advance the interests of the participants,
                          such as the Association of Indonesian Securities Companies and the Association
                          of Investment Fund Managers. In discussions with the mission team, numerous
                          market participants indicated that that the associations have considered
                          developing a framework for ethics for their members in the form of a Code of
                          Conduct and that a Code or series of Codes would be helpful to guide sales
                          people and market participants in their conduct.


                          Paragraph (b)
                          There is no provision in the law requiring that codes be publicized to the general
                          public.


                          Paragraph (c)
                          There are no incentives for compliance other than that failure to comply could
                          subject the financial service provider to sanctions from OJK.
Recommendation            A strong framework for ethical conduct in the securities sector, such as a Code of
                          Conduct, should be developed in Indonesia by the industry associations and
                          market participants. This Code would cover, among other things, the
                          responsibility of the members to act in the highest ethical manner towards
                          clients, to have sufficient resources to maintain their capacity and infrastructure
                          at a level to meet client and regulatory demands, to have the IT capacity to
                          maintain the confidentiality of client information, to engage with civil society as
                          good corporate citizens, and to conduct their internal affairs with adherence to
                          the highest levels of corporate governance. This Code could be given to new and
                          existing customers of capital markets institutions as one means of developing the
                          trust of investors in the market. This Code would be in addition to statutory


160
   (1) V.E. 1 Code of Conduct for Securities Companies Acting as Broker-Dealers, (2) V.B.4 Code of Conduct for
Investment Fund Selling Agent, (3) Prohibited Investment Manager Conduct, and (4) V.H.1 Prohibited Investment
Advisor Conduct.
                    provisions for conduct and, by obtaining the participation of the industry in the
                    development of the Code, there will be additional “by-in” for the Code.

                    OJK and the MC could also usefully develop guidance on the principles and
                    minimum content of industry Codes of Conduct, including for the secturities
                    sector as well as other sectors.

                    Other countries have adopted codes of the type contemplated by this Good
                    Practice. Examples inlcude France where the industry association for asset
                    managment developed a Code of Ethics for Collective Investments and Australia
                    where the Stock Brokers Association of Australia developed a Code of Ethical
                    Conduct. Many of these codes in other countries are mandated by law, but the
                    industry association or individual market participants are allowed to develop a
                    code within a certain set of minimum requirements. In other countries, the
                    associations develop the codes as part of their responsibility for establishing and
                    maintaining the highest standard of conduct for their members.
Good Practice A.3   Other Institutional Arrangements
                        a. The judicial system should provide an efficient and trusted venue
                           for the enforcement of laws and regulations on investor protection.
                        b. The media should play an active role in promoting investor
                           protection.
                        c. The private sector, including voluntary investor protection
                           organizations, industry associations and, where permitted, self-
                           regulatory organizations should play an active role in promoting
                           investor protection.
Description         Although the legal system is not an efficient or trusted venue for retail securities
                    investors, the other aspects of this Good Practice are largely satisfied.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    The legal system is used for large securities litigation and is a trusted venue in
                    those cases. However, due to the length of time, cost, and inexperience of courts
                    in dealing with capital market issues, it is not an efficient or trusted venue for
                    retail securities investors.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    Based on discussions with the market participants, the financial media in
                    Indonesia actively deals with stock market issues. They do this by publicizing the
                    financial issues and on-going litigation and by conducting analyses of the capital
                    market.


                    Paragraph (c)
                    The industry associations participate in investor education and protection
                    activities with the stock exchange and OJK. For example, during January-
                    December 2012, the IDX established 19 new IDX Corners at various higher
                    educational institutions throughout Indonesia, to provide more information to
                    students and faculty about the stock market - 70 IDX Corners were established
                    as of December 2011. For each IDX Corner, IDX provided Capital Market
                    Schools, stock trading simulations, capital market workshops and capital market
                    competitions. In commemorating the 34th anniversary of Indonesia’s capital
                    market reactivation, IDX in association with Bapepam-LK, KPEI and KSEI held a
                    series of education activities regarding capital market at campuses. The activity,
                    called ‘Roadshow Campus to Campus’, aimed to introduce and improve current
                    knowledge on Indonesian capital markets to students and communities around
                    campuses. In 2013, the IDX hosted a number of training seminars for journalists
                    in the provinces.
Recommendation      No recommendation, but see the Good Practice E.2 recommendation for the
                    establishment of publicly funded, independent arbitration boards to handle small
                    customer complaints.
Good Practice A.4   Licensing
                        a. All legal entities or physical persons that, for the purpose of
                           investment in financial instruments, solicit funds from the public
                           should be obliged to obtain a license from the supervisory
                           authority.
                        b. Legal entities or physical persons that give investment advice and
                           hold customer assets should be licensed by the securities
                           supervisory authority.
                        c. If a jurisdiction does not require licensing for legal entities or
                           physical persons that give only investment advice, such persons
                           should be supervised by an industry association or self-regulatory
                           organization and the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws or
                           other consumer laws should apply to the activity of such persons.
Description         Indonesia has a comprehensive system for licensing capital market participants
                    and professionals who work in the area.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    As described below, there are various relevant licensing requirements in
                    Indonesia. Article 30(1) of the Capital Market Law requires that all securities
                    companies be registered with OJK, including broker/dealers. Sales
                    representatives of broker-dealers must also be registered with OJK under Rule
                    No. V.B.1.


                    Investment managers are also considered securities companies in the Capital
                    Market Law. Sales representatives of investment managers who sell mutual
                    funds must also be registered with OJK under Rule No. V.B.1.


                    Investment managers can also contract with an Investment Fund Selling Agent to
                    sell investment funds and the Investment Fund Selling Agent must register with
                    OJK under Rule No. V.B.3. Sales representatives of an Investment Fund Selling
                    Agent must also be registered with OJK under Rule No. V.B.2.


                    Under Article 18 of the Capital Market Law, investment funds organized as
                    companies must obtain registration from OJK and investment funds organized as
                    contractual entities must be managed by an investment manager that is
                    registered with OJK.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    Article 34 of the Capital Market Law requires that investment advisors be
                    registered with OJK. Rule V.C.1 of OJK provides for the requirements and
                    procedures for the registration of investment advisors.


                    Paragraph (c)
                    Not applicable
Recommendation      No recommendations.



SECTION B           DISCLOSURE AND SALES PRACTICES


Good Practice B.1   General Practices
                    There should be disclosure principles that cover an investor’s relationship
                    with a person offering to buy or sell securities, buying or selling securities,
                    or providing investment advice, in all three stages of such relationship:
                    pre-sale, point of sale, and post-sale.
                        a. The information available and provided to an investor should
                           inform the investor of:
                              (i) the choice of accounts, products and services;
                              (ii) the characteristics of each type of account, product or
                                    service;
                              (iii) the risks and consequences of purchasing each type of
                                    account, product or service;
                              (iv) the risks and consequences of using leverage, often called
                                    margin, in purchasing or selling securities or other financial
                                    products; and
                              (v) the specific risks of investing in derivative products, such
                                    as options and futures.
                        b. A securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should be
                           legally responsible for all statements made in marketing and sales
                           materials related to its products.
                        c. A natural or legal person acting as the representative or tied-agent
                           of a securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should
                           disclose to an investor whether the person is licensed to act as
                           such a representative and who licenses the person.
                        d. If a securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU delegates or
                           outsources any of its functions or activities to another legal entity
                           or physical person, such delegation or outsourcing should be fully
                           disclosed to the investor, including whether the person to whom
                           such function or activity is delegated is licensed to act in such
                           capacity and who licenses the person.
Description         The requirements of this Good Practice are largely met.


                    Paragraph (a)
                 Generally, the capital market law and regulations provide for an adequate level
                 of disclosure to new clients regarding the services for which they are contracting.
                 Specifically, in relation to each of the sub-paragraphs in paragraph (a):
                 (i) There is no requirement that a broker-dealer of investment manager inform
                 the customer of all products and services available.
                 (ii) Rule V.G.1 (6) requires an Investment Manager to disclose the characteristics
                 and costs of the services it is providing.
                 (iii) Article 11(2) of FCP Regulation provides that all benefits and risks must be
                 disclosed prior to signing any document or agreement by the investor. Rule V.B.4
                 provides that Investment Fund Selling Agents must inform potential customers of
                 the risks inherent in each investment fund they are selling to the client.
                 (iv) Regulation V.D.6 provides for the conditions that must be met by the broker
                 and client before margin can be used in an account. In addition, it requires that
                 extensive risk disclosures be made in the margin agreement.
                 (v) Regulation III.E.1 provides that before a customer enter into a stock option
                 contract or futures index contract they must provide written approval to enter into
                 the contract stating that they understand all the risks. There is no requirement as
                 to the specific risk disclosures that must be made by a broker.


                 Paragraph (b)
                 There are various provisions providing for responsibility in relation to statements
                 in marketing and sales materials. Article 29 of the FCP Regulation provides that
                 a financial services provider should be responsible for all losses arising from
                 faults and failures of its officers, employees and third parties in its employment.
                 Article 30(3) reiterates this as to any actions of third party acting for the financial
                 services provider. Rule No. V.B.4 (3) provides that an Investment Fund Selling
                 Agent is responsible for all activities of its representatives related to selling an
                 investment fund.


                 Paragraph (c)
                 The rules relating to disclosure of licensing / registration status are incomplete.
                 Article 20(2) provides that when the services are offered by an individual then the
                 individual must state that they are registered with OJK. However, there is no
                 requirement that a sales agent disclose that he or she is licensed as a
                 representative.


                 Paragraph (d)
                 There is a requirement for disclosure of the person who has prepared a report for
                 an investment advisor. Rule V.H.1 (4) requires an investment advisor to disclose
                 the identity of all persons who have prepared a report or recommendation if that
                 person is someone other than the investment advisor.
Recommendation   OJK may want to consider requiring a sales agent who operates off-site to
                 disclose their registration status. Although risk disclosure for options and index
                 futures is covered under general risk disclosure requirements, OJK may want to
                 consider issuing specific risk disclosures for derivatives.
Good Practice B.2   Terms and Conditions

                              (ix) the procedures for closing an account.

                    and conditions of contracts with capital market participants.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    There is a requirement for disclosure of services and products to be provided.
                    Article 8 of FCP Regulation provides that a financial service provider must
                    provide potential investors with a concise statement of services and products.

                    There are applicable requirements for clarity, readability and format. Article 7 of
                    FCP Regulation provides that a financial services provider must use plain terms
                    and words that are readily understandable by investors. These terms must be in
                    clearly readable words, symbols, and diagrams under Article 7(3).


                    Paragraph (c)
                    There are various applicable requirements as to the content of terms and
                    conditions. Article 8 of FCP Regulation provides that the concise statement of
                    products and services should include all terms and conditions. The position in
                    relation to the sub-paragraphs of this paragraph (c) is as follows:


                    (i) Article 10(1) and 11(2) of FCP Regulation provides that the financial service
                    provider must provide information on all costs to the investor in detail.

                    provide customers with information regarding the complaints handling and
                    redress mechanism.
                    (iii) Since this scheme was just commenced in September, 2013, it hasn’t been
                    integrated into the regulations. For more details on the scheme see Section
                    F.1.B below.
                    (iv) There is nothing in the regulations relating to computing interest rates.
                    (v) Article 10(1) and 11(2) of FCP Regulation provides that the financial service
                    provider must provide information on all costs to the investor.
                    (vi) Article 10(1) and 11(2) of FCP Regulation provides that the financial service

                    investment funds must be completed in seven days. Regulation IV.B.1 (28).
Recommendation      The regulations should be amended to provide for disclosure of the method by
                    which margin interest rates are calculated and deducted from the account.
Good Practice B.3   Professional Competence
                    Regulators should establish and administer minimum competency
                    requirements for the sales staff of securities intermediaries, investment
                    advisers and CIUs, and collaborate with industry associations where
                    appropriate.
Description         Article 32 of the Capital Markets Law provides that representatives of broker-
                    dealers and investment managers must be registered with OJK and provides for
                    minimum competency requirements. In order to obtain the registration, Rule No.
                    V.B.1 provides that the representatives must pass a competency examination.
                    Rule No. V.B.2 (2) provides that representatives of investment fund sales agents
                    must also have passed a competence examination. Under Article 34, investment
                    advisors must also be registered. Rule No. V.C.1. (2) provides that, for an
                    investment advisor in corporate form, the application must show that it has a
                    person who is registered as a representative of an asset manager. An individual
                    investment advisor must also be registered as a representative of an investment
                    manager under Rule No. V.C.1 and must have passed relevant examinations for
                    that position.


                    The examinations are administered by the Committee for Capital Market
                    Professional Standards which was been established by the Association of
                    Indonesian Broker-Dealer Representatives, Association of Indonesian
                    Underwriter Representatives and Association of Indonesian Investment Manager
                    Representatives and are approved by OJK.
Recommendation      No recommendations.
Good Practice B.4   Know Your Customer (KYC)
                    Before providing a product or service to an investor, a securities
                    intermediary, adviser or CIU should obtain, record and retain sufficient
                    information to enable it to form a professional view of the investor’s
                    background, financial condition, investment experience and attitude
                    toward risk in order to enable it to provide a recommendation, product or
                    service appropriate to that investor.
Description         There are extensive regulations regarding the obligation of capital market
                    participants to obtain sufficient information regarding their customers so that they
                    can provide services tailored to their customers’ financial condition and
                    investment profiles.


                    Article 15 of the FCP Regulation provides that a financial service provider should
                    provide services based on the class of the customer which is determined by a
                    customer profile, income and occupation of the investor, investment objectives
                    and other data. In addition, Article 36 of the Capital Markets Law provides that
                    broker-dealers, investment managers and investment advisors must obtain
                    information regarding the background, financial situation and investment
                    objectives of their clients. Rule No. V.D.10 elaborates on the information that
                    must be obtained.


                    Rule No. IV.D.2 requires an investment fund manager to obtain information on a
                    customer to determine the customer’s risk profile to be used in determining the
                    suitability of an investment. Rule No. V.B.4 (h) provides that an Investment Fund
                    Selling Agent must obtain financial information on the customer and his risk
                    profile before selling a fund to him for the first time.
Recommendation      No recommendations.
Good Practice B.5   Suitability
                    A securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should ensure that,
                    taking into account the facts disclosed by the investor and other relevant
                    facts about that investor of which it is aware, any recommendation,
                    product or service offered to the investor is suitable to that investor.
Description         Indonesia has general requirements that financial service providers should
                    consider the condition of the client prior to making buy or sell
                    recommendations, but the rules are not currently developed in detail.


                    Rule No. V.E.1 (2) and (8) provide that a broker-dealer and investment manager
                    must consider the financial condition and objectives of a client before making buy
                    or sell recommendations for securities. Rule No. V.b.4 (f) and (i) provide that an
                    Investment Fund Selling Agent must take into account a customer’s interest and
                    suitability for investing in a fund before selling the fund to him and V.B.5 (e)
                    forbids the recommendation of an unsuitable fund.

                    Article 16 of the FCP Regulation provides that a financial services provider must
                    consider the suitability of needs and capability of an investor for the investments
                    and services being offered to the investor. However, the procedures for doing
                    this are not developed. In addition, the rule does not take into account what
                    actions are to be taken if a customer decides to ignore a warning of unsuitability.
Recommendation      Suitability rules should be developed in more detail.
                    Relevant rules should include a requirement for a signed waiver by the client if a
                    recommendation of non-suitability of an investment is ignored. This would require
                    the client to reconsider the decision to invest in a non-suitable product and would
                    provide protection to the securities company and sales representative.
Good Practice B.6   Sales Practices
                        a. Legislation and regulations should contain clear rules on improper
                            sales practices in the solicitation, sale and purchase of securities.
                            Thus, securities intermediaries, investment advisers, CIUs and their
                            sales representatives should:
                           (i) Not use high-pressure sales tactics;
                           (ii) Not engage in misrepresentations and half truths as to products
                                 being sold;
                           (iii) Fully disclose the risks of investing in a financial product being
                                 sold;
                           (iv) Not discount or disparage warnings or cautionary statements in
                                 written sales literature;
                           (v) Not exclude or restrict, or seek to exclude or restrict, any legal
                                 liability or duty of care to an investor, except where permitted by
                                 applicable legislation.
                        b. Legislation and regulations should provide sanctions for improper
                            sales practices.
                        c. The securities supervisory agency should have broad powers to
                            investigate fraudulent schemes.
Description         Generally, the Capital Market Law and regulations provide for clear rules on
                    sales practices, sanctions and supervisory powers.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    The position in relation to the sub-paragraphs of paragraph (a) is as follows:
                    (i) Article 35 (a) prohibits broker-dealers, investment managers and investment
                    advisers from pressuring clients from acting in ways contrary to their interests.
                    Article 19 of the FCP Regulation provides that a financial services provider is
                    prohibited from offering products and/or services to an investor and/or the public
                    through personal means of communication without consent of the investor.
                    Moreover, Article 17 of FCP Regulation provides that financial service provider is
                    prohibited from using a marketing strategy that harms an investor by taking
                    advantage of his lack of an alternative to make an informed decision. Article 35
                    (a) of the Capital Market Law provides that securities companies and investment
                    advisors are prohibited from influencing or pressuring clients to act in ways
                    contrary to their interests.
                    (ii) Article 35 (c) of the Capital Market Law provides that securities companies
                    and investment advisors are prohibited from concealing material information from
                    clients or making misrepresentations regarding their business capabilities or
                    financial condition. Article 3 and Article 4(1) of the FCP Regulation provides that
all financial service providers are obligated to provide “accurate, honest, clear
and not misleading” information to investors.
(iii) Rule V.B.4 provides that Investment Fund Selling Agents must inform
potential customers of the risks inherent in each investment fund they are selling
to the client. Article 11(2) of the FCP Regulation provides that all risks of
investing in a financial product must be disclosed.
(iv) There is no provision as to disparagement in the existing law or the FCP
Regulation.
(v) Article 22 of the FCP Regulation provides that in contracts of adhesion, a
financial services provider cannot assign liability under the contract to the
consumer for responsibilities or obligations of the financial service provider.
There is nothing in the existing law to this effect


Paragraph (b)
The Capital Market Law, Article 102, gives OJK the right to impose administrative
sanctions such as suspending and revoking licenses and fines. The Capital
Markets Law also provides for criminal fines and imprisonment. OJK Law, Article
52, expands on the criminal penalties for violation of consumer protection
provisions in the law and in Article 49(1) allows the civil investigators of OJK to
have the powers of a criminal investigator.


Paragraph (c)
Under Article 9(c) of OJK Law, OJK has to authority to supervise, examine and
investigate financial service institutions. In addition, Article 9(d)-(h) gives OJK
authority to issue orders and administrative sanctions to financial service
institutions. Further, Article 49 of OJK Law gives the civil servants of OJK broad
criminal investigative powers to obtain documents, examine persons, conduct
audits, conduct searches, freeze accounts and other legal mechanisms to further
their investigation into possible criminal offenses and to protect investors (See
Table 16).

Recommendation      No recommendations.
Good Practice B.7   Advertising and Sales Materials
                        a. All marketing and sales materials should be in plain language and
                           understandable by the average investor.
                        b. Securities intermediaries, investment advisers, CIUs and their sales
                           representatives should ensure their advertising and sales materials
                           and procedures do not mislead the customers.
                        c. Securities intermediaries, investment advisers and CIUs should
                           disclose in all advertising, including print, television and radio, the
                           fact that they are regulated and by whom.
Description         Indonesia has adequate regulations in place regarding the mandate that financial
                    service providers use accurate and fair advertising.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    See Banking Sector Good Practice B.9 for a description of relevant provisions of
                    the existing Consumer Law and the FCP Regulation provisions.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    There are various provisions concerning misleading information. Rule IV.D.1
                    provides that non-misleading information must be provided to investors in
                    investment funds. Article 35 of the Capital Markets Law provides that broker-
                    dealers, investment managers and investment advisers are prohibited from
                    making misrepresentations or concealing material information. Article 3 and
                    Article 4(1) of the FCP Regulation provide that all financial service providers are
                    obligated to provide “accurate, honest, clear and not misleading” information to
                    investors.


                    Paragraph (c)
                    There are adequate provisions for the disclosure of regulatory status. Article 20
                    of the FCP Regulation provides that all financial services providers must affix
                    their name and logo on all promotional material and must state that they are
                    registered with and under the supervision of OJK.
Recommendation      No recommendations.
Good Practice B.8   Relationships and Conflicts
                        a. A securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should
                           disclose to its clients all relationships that it has which impact on
                           the client’s account, such as banks, custodians, advisers or
                           intermediaries which are used to maintain and manage the account.
                        b. A securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should
                           disclose all conflicts of interest that it has with the client and the
                           manner in which the conflict is being managed.
Description         Indonesia has a patch work of requirements for disclosure of related entities and
                    conflicts, but a stronger and clearer rule needs to tie the various requirements
                    together.
                 Paragraph (a)
                 There are limited rules requiring disclosure of relevant relationships. Regulation
                 V.H.1 (4) requires an investment advisor and Regulation V.G.1 (7) requires an
                 investment manager to disclose the identity of all persons who have prepared a
                 report or recommendation if that person is someone other than the investment
                 advisor. These are the only rules that require disclosure even though many
                 capital market institutions rely on a network of experts and professional market
                 participants who can have an impact on an investor’s decision to invest and the
                 performance of the investment.


                 Paragraph (b)
                 The rules relating to disclosure of conflicts of interest should be expanded. Article
                 23 of FCP Regulation provides that a financial service provider should disclose
                 all conflicts of interests or potential conflicts to investors and provide information
                 regarding the conflict. Rule V.H.1 (7) requires that all investment advisors
                 disclose all conflicts of interest prior to rendering any services.


                 Regulation IX.C.6 requires that the prospectus of an investment fund disclose all
                 affiliated entities of an investment manager and custodian for the fund. However,
                 affiliated persons in the Capital Market Law only refer to blood relations or
                 entities that are control or are controlled by the primary person. Many entities
                 that impact on a securities account are not affiliated persons. Moreover, it does
                 not require such disclosure for Investment Fund Selling Agents or broker-dealers
                 for the fund.


                 Rule No. V.B.4 (6) provides for the segregation of activity within a custodian bank
                 when the custodian bank also acts as an Investment Fund Selling Agent.
                 Nonetheless, in Indonesia, investment fund sales agents are most often banks.
                 The sale of a market based financial instrument in an institution that takes
                 deposits and provides time deposits as a financial instrument can be very
                 confusing to customers. Many customers do not distinguish between the
                 instruments or understand the risks of a market based instrument. As a result,
                 notwithstanding extensive disclosures as to the market risks of the investment
                 funds, a degree of inadvertent mis-selling could occur.
Recommendation   Paragraph (a)
                 OJK should implement a rule requiring the disclosure by a capital market
                 participant of all entities that provide services that could have an impact on a
                 customer’s account and investment.


                 Paragraph (b)
                 Banks that sell investment funds should physically separate the sales activity
                 from their banking activity. This can be done by placing the investment fund
                 sales in a different, well marked room or, indeed, in an office in a separate
                 building.
Good Practice B.9    Specific Disclosures by CIUs
                         a. CIUs should disclose to prospective and existing investors:
                              (i) the CIU’s policies with regard to frequent trading and the risks
                                    to investors from such policies;
                              (ii) any inducements that it receives to use particular
                                    intermediaries or other financial firms, such as “soft -money”
                                    arrangements; and
                              (iii) a fair and honest description of the performance of the CIU’s
                                    investments over several different periods of time that
                                    accurately reflect the CIU’s performance.
                         b. In addition, a CIU should provide a Key Facts Statement for each
                            fund that it is offering to the client that succinctly explains the fund
                            in clear language. Such document is in addition to any other
                            disclosure documents required by law.
Description          The disclosures for investment funds do not cover a number of significant
                     modern problems facing investment funds and the rules need to be upgraded
                     accordingly.


                     Paragraph (a)
                     (i) There are no provisions in existing law.
                     (ii) There are no provisions in existing law.
                     (iii) There are no provisions in existing law.


                     Paragraph (b)
                     Rule No. V.B.4 (b) provides that an investment fund sales agent must provide a
                     brochure that describes the fund in clear terms to potential investment fund unit
                     holders.
Recommendation       Paragraph (a)
                     OJK should issue a regulation requiring disclosure of special arrangements with
                     large or otherwise favored clients such as arrangements which permit frequent
                     trading. In addition, any inducements from service providers should also be
                     disclosed.


                     Paragraph (b)
                     OJK should publish a rule that investment funds should provide performance
                     history over periods of given years, such as 3, 5 and 10 years.


                     Paragraph (c)
                     All entities that sell investment funds, not just investment fund sales agents,
                     should provide a brochure or key facts statement that succinctly describes the
                     major characteristics of the fund.
Good Practice B.10   Specific Disclosures by Investment Advisers
                            Investment advisers should disclose to prospective and existing
                             clients:
                               (i) whether the investment adviser is also registered in another
                                   capacity and whether the adviser deals with the client’s
                                   account in the second registered capacity; and
                              (ii) whether the financial instruments that the investment adviser
                                   is recommending are held in the adviser’s own inventory or
                                   the inventory of a legal or natural person related to the adviser
                                   and will be bought from or sold to its own inventory or the
                                   inventory of a related party.
                            An investment adviser should provide prospective and existing
                             clients with a Key Facts Statement for each product or service that
                             is being offered or sold to the client that succinctly explains the
                             product or service in clear language.
Description          Although relevant disclosure requirements seem acceptable, there are no
                     requirements for a Key Facts Statement as contemplated by this Good Practice.


                     Paragraph (a)


                     Disclosures from investment advisors appear generally to be acceptable.
                     (i) There is no requirement of the type described in this Good Practice since
                     investment advisors cannot have two registrations.
                     (ii) Article 35 (d) of the Capital Markets Law provides that an investment advisor
                     is prohibited from recommending that clients buy or sell securities, without
                     revealing that the investment advisor has an interest in such securities. Rule
                     X.F.3 requires an investment advisor to disclose any interest that the advisor has
                     in securities that the advisor is recommending, as well as the advisor’s policy
                     related to interests in securities the advisor is recommending.


                     Paragraph (b)
                     There is no requirement for a Key Facts Statement from an investment advisor
                     although an investment fund selling agent must provide one.


Recommendation       A Key Facts Statement should be required from investment advisors as well as
                     investment fund selling agents.



SECTION C           CUSTOMER ACCOUNT HANDLING AND MAINTENANCE

Good Practice C.1   Segregation of Funds
                    Funds of investors should be segregated from the funds of all other market
                    participants.
Description         Indonesia has excellent regulations related to segregation of assets.


                    Article 37 of the Capital Markets Law provides that broker-dealers and investment
                    management firms must register clients’ assets in accounts separate from theirs
                    and maintain secure facilities for keeping the assets.
                     Rule No. V.D.4 provides for the details for segregation of assets for broker-dealers
                    and asset managers. Article 25 of FCP Regulation states that a financial service
                    provider must maintain the security of investors’ deposits, funds and assets within
                    its responsibility.


                    Rule No. V.B.4 (6) provides for the segregation of activity within a custodian bank
                    when the custodian bank also acts as an Investment Fund Selling Agent.


                    Finally and most importantly, customer funds at the KPEI are segregated into sub-
                    accounts as mandated by BAPEPAM LK in Regulation III.C.7 and are accessible
                    by the investor.


Recommendation      No recommendations.
Good Practice C.2   Contract Note
                        a. Investors should receive a detailed contract note from a securities
                           intermediary or CIU confirming and containing the characteristics of
                           each trade executed with them, or on their behalf.
                        b. The contract note should disclose the commission received by the
                           securities intermediary, CIU and their sales representatives, as well
                           as the total expense ratio (expressed as total expenses as a
                           percentage of total assets purchased).
                        c. In addition, the contract note should indicate the trading venue where
                           the transaction took place and whether (i) the intermediary for the
                           transaction acted as a broker in the trade, (ii) the intermediary or CIU
                           acted as the counterparty to its customer in the trade, or (iii) the trade
                           was conducted internally in the intermediary between its clients.


Description         Indonesian capital market regulations require that a contract note be given to a
                    customer after a trade, but the contents of the note are not specified in the
                    regulations.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    There are requirements for a confirmation of a trade but the required content is not
                    specified. Rule No. V.E.1 (11) provides that a broker-dealer and asset manager
                    must give the customer a confirmation of a trade before the end of the exchange
                    day following the transaction. Rules VI.A.3 provides that the custodian should also
                    provide a confirmation of a trade. The exact information to be contained on the
                    confirmation is not described in either regulation.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    The exact information to be contained on the confirmation is not described in the
                    Rule.


                    Paragraph (c)
                    The exact information to be contained on the confirmation is not described in the
                    Rule.
Recommendation      OJK should amend Rules No. V.E.1 and VI.A.3 to require more detailed
                    information as to the execution of an order in the confirmation, as contemplated by
                    this Good Practice.
Good Practice C.3   Statements
                        a. An investor should receive periodic, streamlined statements for each
                           account with a securities intermediary or CIU, providing the complete
                           details of account activity in an easy-to-read format.
                            (i) Timely delivery of periodic securities and CIU statements
                                  pertaining to the accounts should be made.
                            (ii) Investors should have a means to dispute the accuracy of the
                                  transactions recorded in the statement within a stipulated period.
                            (iii) When an investor signs up for paperless statements, such
                                  statements should also be in an easy-to-read and readily
                                  understandable format.
                        b. If a legal or natural person who provides only investment advice to
                           customers also holds client assets, the client statements should be
                           prepared by and sent from the custodian for the assets and not from
                           the investment adviser.
Description         Indonesia has some regulations on statements of customer accounts, but they are
                    not well developed in terms of the procedure or the time periods in which they
                    should be delivered.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    The requirements of this Good Practice are only met to a limited extent. Article 27
                    of the FCP Regulation requires that a financial service provider must provide
                    investors with their balance positions and transactions and other aspects of their
                    account in a manner and means under agreement with the investor.


                    (i) Broker-dealer statements must be sent out monthly. Rule VI.A.3 (2)(b)(4).


                    (ii) Although there is currently no formal provision for a dispute system as
                    contemplated by this Good Practice, broker-dealer customers can dispute the
                    custodian’s statement of the customer’s sub-account and the type of evidence that
                    can be used is provided in Rule VI.A.3 (2)(d).


                    (iii) There is no provision in the regulations for this Good Practice, although there
                    do not seem to be any complaints in this area.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    There is no provision in the regulations for the practice contemplated in this Good
                    Practice, since it is not permitted in Indonesia.
Recommendation      Although the CPFL team did not hear of any complaints in this area, OJK may want
                    to consider a regulation that is more specific as to content and timing of the
                    periodic statements for customers of investment funds and broker-dealers and the
                    procedure for disputing the statements.
Good Practice C.4   Prompt Payment and Transfer of Funds
                    When an investor requests the payment of funds in his or her account, or the
                    transfer of funds and assets to another securities intermediary or CIU, the
                    payment or transfer should be made promptly.
Description         Investment fund payments must be made in 7 days. Rule IV.B.1 (28). Otherwise,
                    brokerage accounts are settled within several days although there is no rule on
                    this.
Recommendation      OJK may wish to consider including a provision in its rules which specifies required
                    transfer times for funds and assets when a broker-dealer account is closed or a
                    transfer request is made.
Good Practice C.5   Investor Records
                        a. A securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should maintain
                           up-to-date investor records containing at least the following:
                           (i)    a copy of all documents required for investor identification and
                                  profile;
                           (ii)   the investor’s contact details;
                           (iii) all contract notices and periodic statements provided to the
                                  investor;
                           (iv) details of advice, products and services provided to the
                                  investor;
                           (v)    details of all information provided to the investor in relation to
                                  the advice, products and services provided to the investor;
                           (vi) all correspondence with the investor;
                           (vii) all documents or applications completed or signed by the
                                  investor;
                           (viii) copies of all original documents submitted by the investor in
                                  support of an application for the provision of advice, products
                                  or services;
                           (ix) all other information concerning the investor which the
                                  securities intermediary or CIU is required to keep by law;
                           (x)    all other information which the securities intermediary or CIU
                                  obtains regarding the investor.
                        b. Details of individual transactions should be retained for a reasonable
                           number of years after the date of the transaction. All other records
                           required under a. to j. above should be retained for a reasonable
                           number of years from the date the relationship with the investor
                           ends. Investor records should be complete and readily accessible.
Description         Generally, account record keeping rules are adequate, but there are some gaps.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    (i) Rule Number V.D.3 (5)(c) provides for the investor identification data that a
                    broker-dealer or asset manager must keep.
                    (ii) Rule Number V.D.3 (5)(c) provides that addresses, phone numbers and other
                    contact information be maintained for broker-dealer and asset manager customers.
                    (iii) Rule Number V.D.3 (17) provides that all transaction confirmations be
                    maintained. There is no requirement that statements be maintained.
                    (iv) Rule X.F.2 (3) provides that an investment advisor must maintain all records
                    related recommendations, including any changes.
                    (v) Rule X.F.2 (2) provides that an investment advisor must maintain records
                    relating to its recommendations.
                    (vi) No requirement in the regulations but industry practice appears to cover this
                    Good Practice.
                    (vii) Rule X.F.2 (1) provides that an investment advisor must maintain all contracts
                    with a client. Rule Number V.D.3 (5) requires that all contracts with customers and
                    supporting documents be maintained.
                    (viii) Rule Number V.D.3 (5) requires that all contracts with customers and
                    supporting documents be maintained.
                    (ix) No specific provision in the capital market law.
                    (x) No specific provision, but industry practice appears to cover this Good Practice.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    Rule No. V.D.3 (13) provides that all records and documents must be retained for
                    at least 5 years.
Recommendation      Although industry practice appears to cover the practice of keeping the records of
                    customers by securities companies and advisors, OJK may want to consider
                    amending the record keeping rules to specifically require that all communications
                    of any nature or any other documents related to a customer must be maintained for
                    the requisite 5 years.



SECTION D           PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION


Good Practice D.1   Confidentiality and Security of Customers’ Information
                    Investors of a securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU have a
                    right to expect that their financial activities will remain private and not
                    subject to unwarranted private and governmental scrutiny. The law should
                    require that securities intermediaries, investment advisers and CIUs take
                    sufficient steps to protect the confidentiality and security of a customer’s
                    information against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or
                    integrity of such information, and against unauthorized access to, or use of,
                    customer information.
Description         Client confidentiality is mandated by the Capital Market Law.


                    Article 35(b) of the Capital Market Law and Article 4(e) of Rule V.B.4 provides that
                    broker-dealers, investment managers and investment advisors are prohibited from
                    disclosing client identities and business without written consent, unless required
                    by law. Article 31 of the FCP Regulation provides that financial service providers
                    are prohibited from providing data or information of its customers to third parties.
                    However there is no provision in the regulation requiring a financial service
                    provider to establish IT systems for protection of the information. On the other
                    hand, Article 15 of the Electronic Transactions Regulation provides that the
                    electronic system operator must ensure the secrecy, integrity and availability of
                    personal data.
Recommendation      The securities laws and regulations should provide for requirements for IT
                    systems to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of information.
Good Practice D.2   Sharing Customer’s Information
                    Securities intermediaries and CIUs should:
                       (i)   inform an investor of third-party dealings in which they are required
                             to share information regarding the investor’s account, such as legal
                             enquiries by a credit bureau, unless the law provides otherwise;
                       (ii) explain how they use and share an investor’s personal information;
                       (iii) allow an investor to stop or "opt out" of certain information sharing,
                             such as selling or sharing account or personal information to
                             outside companies that are not affiliated with them, for the purpose
                             of telemarketing or direct mail marketing, and inform the investor of
                             this option.
Description         The requirements of this Good Practice are only met to a very limited extent.


                    (i) Article 31(2) of the FCP Regulation provides that information can only be
                    divulged if it is required by law or regulation or if the customer gives consent.
                    There is no requirement that the investor be informed of the various laws and
                    regulations that can require disclosure. Article 15 of the Electronic Transactions
                    Regulation also provides that information can only be divulged with a customer’s
                    consent. There is no provision regarding sharing of information within a financial
                    group.
                    (ii) There is no requirement of an explanation as to how they use information.
                    (iii) There are no provisions for “opting out” since consent is required for such
                    information sharing. There is no provision regarding sharing of information within
                    a financial group.
Recommendation      The regulations of OJK should include a provision regarding sharing of
                    information within a financial group and how personal information is used within a
                    financial group. New requirements to fill the other gaps in this Good Practice
                    should also be considered.
Good Practice D.3   Permitted Disclosures
                        a. If there are to be any specific procedures and exceptions concerning
                           the release of customer financial records to government authorities,
                           these procedures and exceptions should be stated in the law.
                        b. The law should provide for penalties for breach of investor
                           confidentiality.
Description         Permitted disclosures are not set forth in detail in the Capital Market Law or
                    regulations.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    The FCP Regulation only states that information can be disclosed if required by
                    law, but does not state which laws may require it or what procedures or
                    exceptions may exist.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    The Capital Market Law, Article 102, provides for administrative sanctions again a
                    person who has violated Section 35(b).
Recommendation      Paragraph (a)
                    The exceptions to release of customer financial records to governmental
                    authorities should be stated in the law.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    The law should provide for criminal sanctions for violations of the customer data
                    privacy provisions.



SECTION E           DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS


Good Practice E.1   Internal Dispute Settlement
                        a. An internal avenue for claim and dispute resolution practices within
                           a securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should be
                           required by the securities supervisory agency.
                        b. Securities intermediaries, investment advisers and CIUs should
                           provide designated employees available to investors for inquiries
                           and complaints.
                        c. Securities intermediaries, investment advisers and CIUs should
                           inform their investors of the internal procedures on dispute
                           resolution.
                        d. The securities supervisory agency should provide oversight on
                           whether securities intermediaries, registered investment advisers
                           and CIUs comply with their internal procedures on investor
                           protection rules.
Description         There are no current regulations for internal dispute settlement. The provisions in
                    OJK law that will come into effect in August 2014, and the Consumer Law, to
                    some extent cover this area.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    Article 32 (1) of FCP Regulation provides that financial service providers must
                    have a complaints procedure in place. In addition, Articles 47-50 provide that a
                    financial services provider must have a system of internal controls and
                    supervision to maintain compliance with its internal policies, reporting
                    requirements and consumer protection rules and regulations and principles of
                    OJK and OJK law.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    Article 36 (1) of FCP Regulation requires that each financial service provider
                    create an internal unit for customer complaints and Article 36(3) provides that
                    specific employees must be designated to handle and redress customer
                    complaints.


                    Paragraph (c)
                    Article 32(2) of FCP Regulation requires that financial service providers must
                    provide customers with information regarding the complaints handling and redress
                    mechanism.


                    Paragraph (d)
                    Article 34(1) of FCP Regulation provides that financial service companies shall
                    provide reports to OJK on their complaints and how they were handled and OJK
                    shall supervise the activities of the financial service providers.


Recommendation      OJK should give consideration to reviewing and revising the FCP Regulation on
                    the basis of each of the issues raised in Good Practice E.1 of the Banking Sector
                    Good Practice.
Good Practice E.2   Formal Dispute Settlement Mechanisms
                    There should be an independent dispute resolution system for resolving
                    disputes that investors have with their securities intermediaries, investment
                    advisers and CIUs.
                        a. A system should be in place to allow investors to seek third-party
                           recourse, such as an ombudsman or arbitration court, in the event
                           the complaint with their securities intermediary, investment adviser
                           or CIU is not resolved to their satisfaction in accordance with
                           internal procedure, and it should be made known to the public.
                        b. The independent dispute resolution system should be impartial and
                           independent from the appointing authority and the industry.
                        c. The decisions of the independent dispute resolution system should
                           be binding on the securities intermediaries and CIUs. The
                           mechanisms to ensure the enforcement of these decisions should
                           be established and publicized.
Description         Currently, an inexpensive venue for the resolution of small, retail investor disputes
                    in Indonesia does not exist.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    There is a little used independent arbitration mechanism, the Indonesian Capital
                    Markets Arbitration Board (BAPMI) that can be used as an independent resolution
                    mechanism for capital market related disputes. Many customer agreements now
                    contain a provision that any disputes between the customer and broker-dealer
                    should be submitted to BAPMI. Few investors have done this and BAPMI has
                    handled only 6 cases since 2008 (2 involving the management of funds, 2
                    involving margin, 1 involving a dispute between an investment fund sales agent
                    and an investment manager and 1 involving a mediation regarding an exchange
                    event organizer). All of the disputes were resolved by April 2013.
                    Article 29 of the OJK Law provides that OJK should establish instruments and
                    mechanisms to handle customer complaints. Articles 40-46 of the FCP Regulation
                    provide for a mechanism whereby an investor can bring a dispute to OJK for
                    facilitation of the dispute, but it cannot issue a binding opinion resolving the
                    dispute. OJK is currently in the process of requiring the existing arbitration boards,
                    such as BAPMI, to register with OJK and provide free dispute resolution for
                    smaller investors. OJK foresees that the disputes will be resolved in the arbitration
                    boards and it will oversee the process. However, it is unclear how this process at
                    the arbitration boards will work and how the arbitrations of small disputes will be
                    funded.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    The Indonesian Capital Markets Arbitration Board has members from the industry,
                    but the arbiters are supposed to be independent of them.


                    Paragraph (c)
                    If the parties submit their dispute to the Indonesian Capital Markets Arbitration
                    Board for resolution, then the decision of the Board is binding. The facilitation by
                    OJK could end in an Agreement which is binding, Article 46 of FCP Regulation,
                    but if no agreement is reached, under Article 46(2) the complainant will need to
                    take the matter to BAPMI or the courts for a binding decision.
Recommendation      See the recommendations in Good Practice E.1 of the Banking Sector Good
                    Practice.



SECTION F           GUARANTEE SCHEMES AND INSOLVENCY

Good Practice F.1   Investor Protection
                        a. There should be clear provisions in the law to ensure that the
                           regulatory authority can take prompt corrective action on a timely
                           basis in the event of distress at a securities intermediary,
                           investment adviser or CIU.
                        b. The law on the investors’ guarantee fund, if there is one, should be
                           clear on the funds and financial instruments that are covered under
                           the law.
                        c. There should be an effective mechanism in place for the pay-out of
                           funds and transfer of financial instruments by the guarantee fund or
                           insolvency trustee in a timely manner.
                        d. The legal provisions on the insolvency of securities intermediaries,
                           investment advisers and CIUs should provide for expeditious, cost-
                           effective and equitable provisions to enable the timely payment of
                           funds and transfer of financial instruments to investors by the
                           insolvency trustee of a securities intermediary or CIU.
Description         The procedures for winding up a capital market participant by a statutory manager
                    appointed by OJK and for making payouts by the new Indonesia Securities
                    Investor Protection Fund (SIPF) are still in the process of being developed,
                    although it is understood that OJK plans to do this.

                    Paragraph (a)
                    The procedures for taking action in relation to a securities market participant are
                    not sufficiently deveoped. Under OJK Law, OJK can appoint a statutory manager
                            for a market participant if it deems it necessary. However, it is not clear how this
                            provision will interact with the provisions of the bankruptcy law for the unwinding
                            of an insolvent company. In addition, the procedures and powers of such a
                            statutory manager have not been developed.


                            Paragraph (b)
                                                                                                         161
                            A new SIPF has been created and is in the process of being established. The
                            SIPF is to be originally funded by the IDX, KPEI and KSEI. The funding will
                            increase in stages over the next several years, including membership fees and
                            fees from the custodian holding SIPF’s assets. The terms of the fund are clear
                            that initially only securities held in sub-accounts at the KSEI are covered by the
                            SIPF. In 2016, assets held in a client account opened by a Custodian at a bank
                            may also qualify for coverage. In the event of a default of a broker, SIPF will pay
                            the injured customers.


                            Paragraph (c)
                            The processes and basis for compensating investors by SIPF in the event of the
                            failure of a market participant are still being developed.


                            Paragraph (d)
                            The processes and basis for compensating investors by the statutory manager in
                            the event of the failure of an investment fund due to fraud, if one is appointed, are
                            still being developed. In the event of a voluntary wind-up of a fund or on order of
                            OJK, the provisions of Regulation IV.B.2 provide that investors shall be paid their
                            proportionate amount in the fund within 7 days from the order of OJK to liquidate
                            or the occurrence of the event triggering the liquidation. The practicality of such a
                            quick payout has yet to be tested.
Recommendation              The procedures and capacity of the Investor Protection Fund should be developed
                            to provide for an adequate means of customer protection.

                             In addition, there should be development of rules, procedures and capacity of the
                            statutory manager and the bankruptcy trustee for capital market participants to
                            eliminate conflicts between the two. Insolvency rules should also be developed
                            that are specifically tailored to meet the characteristics and business activity of a
                            market participant. Further, full and effective powers should be developed for the
                            entity overseeing the insolvency of a company in order to allow it to fully protect
                            investor assets, promptly return the assets to investors and resolve creditor
                            claims.




SECTION G                   CONSUMER EMPOWERMENT

Good Practice G.1           Broadly based Financial Capability Program
                                a. A broadly based program of financial education and information



161
      It is understood the Securities Investor Protection Fund commenced operations on 1 January 2014.
                           should be developed to increase the financial capability of the
                           population.
                        b. A range of organizations–including government, state agencies and
                           non-governmental organizations–should be involved in developing
                           and implementing the financial capability program.
                        c. The government should appoint an institution such as the central
                           bank or a financial regulator to lead and coordinate the development
                           and implementation of the national financial capability program.


Description         The Indonesian Stock Exchange has taken a lead role in developing and
                    distributing investor education programs across the country.


                    While it does not keep records on the reach or impact of its programs, IDX
                    regularly holds a number of educational programs at the stock exchange, at
                    regional locations and on college campuses. Additionally, IDX has developed
                    comic books and workbooks for youth which address basic financial issues like
                    saving and entrepreneurship as well as more advanced topics like investing.
                    Beyond these more traditional programs, IDX performs outreach in more creative
                    ways such as through the organization of an investor club, educational seminars
                    for journalists and by providing specialized programs for women through a
                    memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Women.


                    For additional discussion, see Banking Sector Good Practice G.1 and the
                    separate Financial Capability Report in Annex I.
Recommendation      The Indonesian Stock Exchange should keep records of its many outreach efforts
                    and conduct regular program evaluations. By doing this, IDX could better assess
                    which programs are the most impactful and focus its time, energy and other
                    resources on those programs. Information from program evaluations may suggest
                    that the IDX should narrow the breadth of its investor education offerings in favor
                    of programmatic depth and educational soundness.
                    For additional recommendations, see Banking Sector Good Practice G.1 and the
                    separate Financial Capability Report in Annex I.
Good Practice G.2   Using a Range of Initiatives and Channels, including the Mass Media
                    a. A range of initiatives should be undertaken to improve people's financial
                       capability.
                    b. This should include encouraging the mass media to provide financial
                       education, information and guidance.
Description         Paragraph (a)
                    See Good Practice G.1 above.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    IDX reports that it holds special programs to educate journalists on investing
                    topics. The hope is that journalists will use this knowledge to simplify complex
                    topics for readers and make investing more accessible to a broader base of
                    consumers.
                    For additional discussion, see Banking Sector Good Practice G.1 and the
                    separate Financial Capability Report in Annex I.
Recommendation      IDX should enhance its offerings for citizens and for journalists with more on-line
                    materials so that program participants can practice or refer back to what they
                    have learned in a live session.


                    For additional recommendations, see Banking Sector Good Practice G.1 and the
                    separate Financial Capability Report in Annex I.
Good Practice G.3   Unbiased Information for Investors
                        a. Financial regulators should provide, via the internet and printed
                           publications, independent information on the key features, benefits
                           and risks—and where practicable the costs— of the main types of
                           financial products and services.
                        b. Non-governmental organizations should be encouraged to provide
                           consumer awareness programs to the public regarding financial
                           products and services.
Description         Paragraph (a)
                    See Good Practice G.3 of the Banking Section.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    See Good Practice G.1 above.
Recommendation      Other organizations (government and non-government), in addition to IDX, should
                    develop quality investor education programs if Indonesia wishes to grow its base
                    of domestic investors and avoid consumers falling prey to investment fraud.


                    For additional recommendations, see Banking Sector Good Practice G.1 and the

                    capability on a regular basis and include questions about investing and capital
                    markets.

SECTION A           CONSUMER PROTECTION INSTITUTIONS


Good Practice A.1   Consumer Protection Regime
                    The law should provide for clear rules on consumer protection in all
                    matters of insurance and there should be adequate institutional
                    arrangements for implementation and enforcement of consumer protection
                    rules.
                        a. There should be specific provisions in the law, which create an
                           effective regime for the protection of retail consumers of insurance.
                        b. The rules should prioritize a role for the private sector, including
                           voluntary     consumer       organizations      and    self-regulatory
                           organizations.
Description         Although, as of 1 January 2013, OJK obtained regulatory and supervisory
                    responsibility for the insurance sector (including in relation to consumer
                    protection) and there is a clear role envisaged for consumer protection NGOs,
                    there are overlapping consumer protection regulators, laws and regulations and it
                    is not clear to what extent consumer organizations actually carry out their role.
                    Other regulators include the Ministry of Trade (MoT) and the National Consumer
                    Protection Agency (NCPA) and a related concern is the lack of coordination
                    between relevant regulatory bodies.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    OJK’s responsibility for the financial services sector is provided for by Articles 5
                    and 55 of the OJK Law. Importantly, Article 5 provides that “The Financial
                    Services Authority shall have the functions to implement the integrated regulatory
                    and supervisory system for the entire activities of the financial services sector” .
                    Article 55 then deals with timing issues by providing that: (emphasis added)
                    “(1) As of December 31, 2012, the regulatory and supervisory functions, duties,
                    and powers of financial services activities in the sectors of Capital Markets,
                    Insurance, Pension Funds, Finance Institutions, and Other Financial Services
                    Institutions shall pass from the Minister of Finance and the Capital Market and
                    Financial Institution Supervisory Agency to the Financial Services Authority.
                    (2) As of December 31, 2013, the regulatory and supervisory functions, duties,
                    and powers of financial services activities in the Banking sector shall pass from
                    Bank Indonesia to the Financial Services Authority.”


                    OJK’s objectives are expressly stated to include consumer protection:
                    “The Financial Services Authority is established with the objec tives that the entire
                    activities of the financial services sector:
                    c). can protect the interests of Consumers and the public “ (Article 4 (c)).


                    Pursuant to the abovementioned provisions, OJK took over responsibility for the
                    insurance sector from the Insurance Bureau in the Ministry of Finance as from 1
January 2013. Interviews conducted by the mission team suggest that this has
not been as smooth a transition as could be desired as only around 30 of the 100
supervisory staff in the Insurance Bureau at the Ministry of Finance transferred to
OJK (see Good Practice A.3).


The current consumer protection laws and regulations relating to insurance are
quite extensive and the intent seems to be that these laws will continue to apply
to the extent not inconsistent with the OJK Law or the FCP Regulation. Article 70
of the OJK Law provides that:
“On this Law coming into effect:
        1) Law Number 2 of 1992 concerning Insurance Business (State
            Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia Number 13 of 1992,
            Supplement to State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia Number
            3467) and its ancillary regulations;
        …
        7) other laws and regulations in the financial services sector,
are declared to remain valid to the extent not in contravention of and not yet
replaced by this Law.”


Article 55 of the FCP Regulation further provides that:
“The implementation of the provisions governing the protection of consumers in
the financial services sector shall remain valid as long as not contrary to
Financial Services Authority regulations.”


The term “not contrary” is not defined, and its meaning will not always be entirely
clear. In particular it is not clear to what extent the FCP Regulation will prevail
over the laws and regulations described below. At a minimum, however, it is
understood that the provisions of a regulation cannot override the provisions of a
law approved by Parliament, and there is doubt as to whether the general
consumer protection provisions of the FCP Regulation could override sector
specific regulations (such as the Good Corporate Governance Regulations).
However, it was confirmed to the mission team by meetings with OJK that the
intent is that the existing law and regulations should continue to apply except to
the extent the umbrella provisions in the FCP Regulation (and the OJK Law) are
clearly inconsistent and regardless of which regulatory agency was responsible
for existing regulations (such as the Minister of Finance). This overlap and
ambiguity in the consumer protection framework is nevertheless likely to be of
concern to relevant financial institutions who have to consider how they can
comply with all relevant laws and regulations and work out what differences in
language between the FCP Regulation other laws and regulations means in
practice.


The primary laws and regulations currently relevant to consumer protection in the
insurance industry are as follows (further details are in the relevant Good
Practices below):
                            Insurance-specific legislation
                                    The Insurance Law has requirements for licensing (see also the
                                     Licensing Decree); capital; conducting a brokerage business and
                                     submission of documents to the Minister and also sets out the Minister’s
                                                                                  162
                                     powers to deal with insurance companies. The mission team was told
                                     there is a new insurance law presently in Parliament which is expected
                                     to become law in the near future. However a copy was not able to be
                                     provided to the mission team.
                                    The Business Conduct Regulations provide for licensing requirements;
                                     ownership of insurance companies; capital and equity requirements;
                                     approval of new programs; adequacy of premiums; payment of
                                     premiums through brokers; the claims settlement process; the provision
                                     of information to the insured; insurance agents; branch offices; sanctions
                                     and require insurers to have a guarantee fund designed to protect policy
                                     holders (but there is not an overall industry guarantee fund) (see also the
                                                                                    163
                                     Business Conduct Decree discussed below) ;
                                    The Business Conduct Decree contains further requirements in relation
                                     to new insurance programs and important requirements for the content
                                     of insurance policies including limitations on provisions such as those
                                     which restrict a consumer’s right to bring legal action and clarity as to
                                     exclusionary provisions and limitations of liability;
                                    The Licensing Decree contains further provisions concerning licensing
                                     requirements; organizational structure; Board of Directors; specialist
                                     technical staff (fellows and associates); administrative systems including
                                     training of technical staff; education and training; membership of an
                                     industry association; branch offices; agents and agency agreements;
                                     and marketing in cooperation with a bank.
                                    The Fit and Proper Insurance Regulation provides for the “Fit and
                                     Proper” requirements for Directors and Commissioners of insurance
                                     companies. These requirements are based on competence and integrity.
                                    The Administrative Sanctions Regulation provides for fines and other
                                     sanctions which may be imposed on insurance companies.
                                    The Good Corporate Governance Regulation sets out Principles of Good
                                     Governance for, and provisions concerning the insurer’s relationship
                                     with, “Stakeholders” which are defined to include policy holders, insured
                                     and those entitled to a benefit. This Regulation also contains provisions
                                     relating to governance arrangements involving the Board of Directors,
                                     the Board of Commissioners, the Sharia Supervisory Board and the
                                     Audit Committee and concerning agents, ethical behavior, investment
                                     governance arrangements; internal control rules and required
                                     disclosures to the regulator. There is also a requirement for insurers to
                                     undertake a self-assessment as to their compliance with the Good
                                     Corporate Governance Regulation.


                            FCP Regulation
                            The FCP Regulation, which was made by OJK on 6 August 2013, will commence
                            on 7 August 2013 and provides umbrella principles for consumer protection in
                            most parts of the financial sector, including the insurance sector. See Banking
                            Sector Good Practice A.1 for details.



162
      No. 2 of 1992
163
      No. 73 of 1992 as amended by No. 63 of 1999 and No. 39 of 2008
                         The provisions of the FCP Regulation are generally expressed in very broad
                         terms and require clarification in terms of their application to insurance products
                         (and other financial services). For example:
                             It is not clear how the information disclosure requirements would apply to
                              insurance policies. Presumably there should be a requirement for disclosure
                              of the risk covered, key policy terms and any exclusions, the amount of any
                              excess on the policy, the premium payable and any fees and charges and
                              commissions which are payable. These disclosures should also be made
                              when an insurance policy (such as a credit life policy) is sold with a loan
                              contract. However none of this detail is provided for.
                             The interaction between existing insurance specific laws and the FCP
                              Regulation is not clear. For example, there are provisions on disclosure of
                              information in both the FCP Regulation and the Business Conduct
                              Regulation, provisions on forcing of products in the FCP Regulation and
                              provisions on marketing of bank products in the Licensing Decree and
                              provisions on internal controls in both the FCP Regulation and the Good
                              Corporate Governance Regulation.


                         Consumer Law
                         As mentioned above, it is considered that the breadth of the definitions of
                         “consumer”; “entrepreneur” and “services” in Article 1 of the Consumer Law
                         support the view that the Law applies to all financial services (including
                         insurance) and that the responsibilities of both MoT and the NCPA cover such
                         services. Although the mission team was told that the inclusion of a reference to
                         “services” in the Consumer Law was a last minute change that was made in
                                                                                                  164
                         Parliament and it is generally considered that the Law is poorly drafted, there
                         seems no doubt that any entity which provides financial services (including
                         insurance services) must comply with the Consumer Law.
                         In summary, the Consumer Law covers the subjects described in Banking Sector
                         Good Practice A.1 (many of which overlap with the provisions of the FCP
                         Regulation).
                             General rights and obligations of consumers and entrepreneurs (Articles 4-
                              8);
                             Misleading and deceptive conduct (Articles 9-4);
                              Annoying consumers in the way that services (or goods) are offered (Article
                              15);
                             Breaking an agreement with a consumer (Article 16);
                             Advertising (Articles 17 and 24);
                             Standard clauses (Article 18);
                             Compensation for consumers (Articles 19 and 23);
                             The government’s responsibility for consumer protection (Article 29) and the
                              responsibility of the government, the public and consumer protection NGOs
                              for supervision of consumer protection (Article 30);
                             The establishment of the NCPA (Articles 35-43 and see above);
                             Recognition of the role of consumer protection NGOs (Article 44 and see
                              below);
                             Dispute settlement (Articles 45-48 and Good Practice E.2 below); and


164
  The mission team was told that the Consumer Law was drafted and passed by Parliament in less than 6 months to
meet an IMF requirement for such legislation post the 1987 Asian crisis.
   Establishment of the BPSK (Articles 49-59 and see Good Practice E.2); and
   Administrative Sanctions (Articles 60-63).


Further, the Ministry of Trade (MoT) and the National Consumer Protection
Agency (NCPA) have functions which appear to overlap with those of OJK.
Details are in Banking Sector Good Practice A.1. The mission team was told that
a Bill has been drafted which will make it clear that the Consumer Law does not
apply to financial services. However, the Bill has not yet been tabled in
Parliament and it is understood this is not likely to occur for some time.


Paragraph (b)
Insurance industry associations
The role of the private insurance sector is provided for by requirements for
licensed insurers to be members of an industry association and by the
requirement for insurers to undertake annual self-assessments which must be
filed with OJK. In particular:
   The Licensing Decree requires that all insurers be a member of an industry
    association with specified functions (Article 30);
   The Licensing Decree also requires that fellows and associates of insurance
    companies be certified by the relevant industry association (see e.g. Article
    12 re the qualifications of a non-life fellow);
   Agents must be certified as being appropriately qualified by an insurance
    association (Article 67 (1));
   Article 66 of the Good Corporate Governance Regulation provides for
    insurance associations to have a role in relation to agents and their
    agreements with insurance companies (including in relation to the
    “procedure and customs and manner of terminating the agency agreement ”
    (Article 66(5));
   Agents must be trained on a Code of Ethics set by the industry insurance
    association (Article 67(b)); and
   The annual self- assessment as to compliance with the Good Corporate
    Governance Regulations must be undertaken in compliance with a checklist
    produced by the relevant industry association (Article 70 (b)).


There are currently 4 active insurance associations in Indonesia. They include
the Life Insurance Association of Indonesia (AAJI); the General Insurance
Association of Indonesia (AAUI); the Association of Sharia Insurance Companies
(AASI) and the Insurance Actuaries Association of Indonesia (PAI).


Consumer associations
Consumer associations are envisaged to have a quasi-supervisory role under the
Consumer Law. Article 30 of the 1999 Law provides that (emphasis added):
“1) Supervision for the implementation of the consumers protection and
application of the legal provisions shall be carried out by the government, public,
and non-government consumer protection foundations.
…
3) Supervision by the public and nongovernmental consumer protection
                 foundations shall be carried out against the goods and/or services circulating in
                 the market.”


                 Article 30(4) then requires that if supervision by the public and NGOs leads to a
                 finding that there has been a violation of the law then the relevant Minister must
                 “take measures pursuant to the prevailing law”.


                 Article 4(3) of the Consumer Law then goes on to provide the following role for
                 consumer protection associations:
                 “to spread information in order to improve public awareness of their rights and
                 obligations and cautions in consuming or using the goods and/or services;
                 b. to give suggestions to the consumers who need their services;
                 c. to cooperate with the related agencies to implement consumers protection;
                 d. to assist the consumers in fighting their rights, including accommodating their
                 complaints;
                 e. to conduct joint supervision with the government and the public for the
                 implementation of consumers’ protection”.


                 There is no equivalent to the abovementioned provisions in the FCP Regulation,
                 which would appear to mean that it is intended to continue to apply.
                 Unfortunately the mission team was not able to meet with any consumer
                 association which had a specific focus on insurance matters and so could not
                 provide an assessment as to how the above provision operates in practice.
Recommendation   There is a need to clarify the interaction between the FCP Regulation and the
                 Consumer Law as well as other existing consumer protection laws and
                 regulations applying to the insurance sector. Ideally, this would be achieved by
                 enacting a new Financial Consumer Protection Law which covers in one law the
                 principles of the FCP Regulation plus the more specific consumer protection
                 aspects of existing law which it is thought should continue. However, it is
                 appreciated that, at best, this is likely to be a long term objective. In the interim,
                 the OJK proposal to issue Circulars which clarify the application of the FCP
                 Regulation to the OJK regulated financial sector is helpful. It would also be
                 helpful if, as mentioned above, the Consumer Law were amended to say that it
                 no longer applies to financial services (including insurance services).


                 The overlap between OJK, the MoT and NCPA functions should be clarified. The
                 mission team was not able to meet with NCPA and so it is not entirely clear to
                 what extent there is an overlap in practice with OJK’s consumer protection
                 functions. Nevertheless, ideally the position would be clarified.


                 In the long term, the appropriateness of the joint supervisory role given to
                 consumer organizations could be re-considered. However, this should not be
                 undertaken until there has been a full analysis as to how this role has been used
                 in practice and an assessment made of the appropriateness of the continued
                 operation of the functions provided to consumer protection NGOs by the
                    Consumer Law. Of course, this issue will not be a concern if the Consumer Law
                    is amended to state that it no longer applies to financial services (including
                    insurance services).
Good Practice A.2   Contracts
                    There should be a specialized insurance contracts section in the general
                    insurance or contracts law, or ideally a separate Insurance Contracts Act.
                    This should specify the information exchange and disclosure requirements
                    specific to the insurance sector, the basic rights and obligations of the
                    insurer and the retail policyholder and allow for any asymmetries of
                    negotiating power or access to information.
Description         Although there is not a specialized insurance contracts section in the general
                    law, there are limited provisions dealing with the issues mentioned in this Good
                    Practice. In particular, under insurance specific legislation there are the following
                    requirements:
                    Under Article 4 of the Good Corporate Governance Regulations, insurers are
                    required to comply with “Good Corporate Governance”. This term is defined in
                    Article 1(8) as follows:
                    “Good Corporate Governance is the structures and processes which is used and
                    applied by [organ] Insurance Company to improve the achievement of business
                    results and optimize corporate value for all stakeholders, especially the
                    policyholder, the insured, participant, and / or the party entitled to benefit, in an
                    accountable and based on the legislation and ethical values .”
                    Article 2 then sets out the principles of Good Corporate Governance which, in
                    summary, are:
                           Transparency in decision making, disclosure and provision of
                            information;
                          Accountability so that performance can be transparent, fair, effective,
                            and efficient;
                          Responsibility to comply with the law and ethical standards to achieve a
                            healthy insurance business;
                          Independent and professional management of the insurer free from
                            conflicts of interest; and
                          Equality and fairness in meeting stakeholder rights.
                    Article 3 emphasizes that the aims of the Principles of Good Corporate
                    Governance include to:
                           Optimize the value of the insurance company for stakeholders (including
                            policy holders);
                         Manage the insurance company in an effective, efficient and transparent
                            manner;
                         Carry out their business with “high ethics” and awareness of their social
                            responsibility to stakeholders;
                         Realize “healthier, reliable, trustworthy and competitive” insurance
                            companies; and
                         Increase the contribution of the insurance company to the national
                            economy.
                    Under Article 64 (1) of the Good Corporate Governance Regulation, an insurer
                    also has an obligation, in summary, to protect the interests of policy holders, the
                    insured and any party entitled to benefits under the policy. There follow examples
                    of what this obligation means – they include (in summary):
                           Meeting obligations under the insurance policy;
                           Evaluating the needs of the policy holder, the insured and any
                            participant;
                           Disclosing material and relevant information;
                           Generally performing their obligations with “integrity, competence and
                            the utmost good faith”.


                    Article 65 of the Good Corporate Governance Regulation also contains a general
                    obligation to respect stakeholders (which include policy holders) and to perform
                    their obligations based on the law and any relevant agreement.


                    As mentioned in Good Practice A.1, the existing insurance specific legislation will
                    continue to apply as well as the FCP Regulation when it comes into force.
Recommendation      Although the current legislative framework relating to contracts of insurance does
                    not give rise to immediate concern, in the longer term consideration might be
                    given to enacting more comprehensive provisions relating to insurance contracts.
                    Such provisions might provide for:
                           Make clear that parties to an insurance contract have a duty of the
                            utmost good faith to each other;
                         Provisions relating to insurable interests in contracts;
                         The insured’s duty of disclosure;
                         The effect of non-disclosures and misrepresentations by the insured; and
                         Unusual terms in insurance contracts.
                    Given the long timelines for enacting legislation in Indonesia, consideration might
                    be given to including provisions dealing with the above subjects in a Code of
                    Conduct for the relevant sections of the insurance industry.
Good Practice A.3   Codes of Conduct for Insurers
                        a. There should be a principles-based code of conduct for insurers
                           that is devised in consultation with the insurance industry and with
                           relevant consumer associations, and that is monitored and
                           enforced by a statutory agency or an effective self-regulatory
                           agency.
                        b. If a principles-based code of conduct exists, insurers should
                           publicize and disseminate it to the general public through
                           appropriate means.
                        c. The principles-based code should be augmented by voluntary
                           codes for insurers on such matters specific to insurance products
                           or channels.
                        d. Every such voluntary code should likewise be publicized and
                           disseminated.
Description         This Good Practice is satisfied in respect of the conventional life insurance
                    industry in Indonesia and in respect of the Codes of Ethics applied to agents in
                    the life, general and Sharia insurance industries. There is not, however, a
                    General Insurance Code of Practice.


                    Paragraph (a)
                           Important consumer protection issues are addressed by the voluntary Code of
                           Conduct for the Indonesian Life Insurance Association (Life Insurance Code) and
                                                                                             165
                           the Islamic Life Insurance Agency Code of Ethics (Sharia Code). There is not
                           however a General Insurance Code of Conduct, although the mission team was
                           told one is under development.


                           By way of background, it is to be noted that all insurers in Indonesia are required
                           to be a member of an insurance association. Article 30 of the Licensing
                           Regulation provides in this regard:
                           “1. An Insurance or Reinsurance Company shall be a member of Association of
                           companies of the same kind.
                           2. The association as stated in paragraph 1 hereof has the functions such as:
                               a. setting up standard practices and code of ethics for marketing insurance
                               programs to create sound marketing competition;
                               b. coordinating the formulation of risk profile, mortality table and the like;
                               c. coordinating efforts to optimize the capacity of national insurance retention;
                               d. coordinating joint efforts towards the establishment of an insurance to deal
                               with special risks;
                               e. conducting education and training in agency; and
                               f. implementing and determining agency certification.
                           3. Activities of the Association as stated in paragraph 2 hereof shall be consulted
                           with the Minister periodically.”


                           The term “Association” is defined in Article 1(5) as “Association is an association
                           of Non-Life Insurance, Life Insurance or Reinsurance Companies.”


                           It is of interest that Article 30 does not expressly or impliedly mention the need
                           for an Association to encourage or require its members to take into account the
                           interests of policy holders in their business conduct. Even the function which
                           refers to standard practices and the code of ethics refers to them in the context
                           of creating sound marketing competition.


                           General insurers are covered by the General Insurance Association of Indonesia
                           (AAUI). Their objectives are almost identical to those in Article 30 of the
                           Licensing Regulation:


                           1. To apply standards of practice and ethics of conduct for insurance business
                           towards creation of sound market competition;
                           2. Coordinate the implementation of the establishment of risk profiles, policy
                           standards and similar products;



165
    There is also the Member Code of Ethics published by the Society of Actuaries of Indonesia, which is not strictly
relevant for the purposes of this Good Practice.
                                3. To optimize the national insurance retention capacity;
                                4. To coordinate joint actions to address special risks;
                                5. To organize education and training in insurance;
                                                                                      166
                                6. To issue general insurance agency certification.


                                The Life Insurance Code is stated to be mandatory of all members of, and is
                                monitored by, the Life Insurance Industry Association (AAJI). It is intended to
                                apply to all life insurance companies and their “ agents” (as defined in Chapter 2,
                                Paragraphs 2 and 8), and deals with the following subjects:
                                        The requirement for members to comply with the applicable legislation,
                                         including any KYC and AML/CFT provisions (Chapter 3, Paragraphs 1
                                         and 2; Chapter 4, Paragraph 1);
                                        The requirement for members to give correct, complete and accurate
                                         information to customers (Chapter 3, Paragraph 3), as well as to provide
                                         the “best service” (Chapter 3, Paragraph 4) and to educate them
                                         (Chapter 4, Paragraph 4);
                                        The prohibition to do any “Twisting” (Chapter 3, Paragraphs 8 and 9).
                                         Twisting is defined as the “act of a marketer that persuades and/or
                                         influences a policyholder to change the specifications of the existing
                                         policy or to change the existing policy with a new policy on another Life
                                         Insurance Company, and/or to buy a new policy by using the funds from
                                         the policy that is still active at other Life Insurance Company within six
                                         (6) months before and after the date of the new policy in the other Life
                                         Insurance Company is issued” (Chapter 2, Paragraph 11);
                                        The standards for staff and agent recruitment, training and certification
                                         (Chapter 3, Paragraphs 5, 6, and 7);
                                        The information sharing arrangements with AAJI and amongst members
                                         (Chapter 3, Paragraphs 10 and 11);
                                        The sanctions to be taken in the event of violation of the Code (Chapter
                                         5).


                                The Sharia Life Code is stated to be compulsory for all members of, and is
                                monitored by, the Association of Sharia Insurance Companies (AASI). It appears
                                to be intended to apply to all employees and agents (colle ctively “agents” – see
                                Chapter II, Article 1 (iii) and deals with the following subjects:
                                        The principles of Sharia insurance (Chapter 1, Articles 2 and 3);
                                        Monitoring tools including requirements that all employees and
                                         marketers sign an acknowledgement that they have read the Code and
                                         that violations are reported to the Board of Ethics and AASI who may
                                         revoke the AASI accreditation. Agents are not mentioned but this may be
                                         an issue with the translation (Chapter 1, Article 4);
                                        The principles of the Code which include avoidance of conflicts of
                                         interest and abuse of office; confidentiality of information; fairness and

                    The Life Insurance Code and the Sharia Code are disseminated to the public

                    Paragraph (c)
                    See paragraph (a).


                    Paragraph (d)
                    See paragraph (b).
Recommendation      AAUI should be encouraged by OJK to finalize their industry code of conduct for
                    the conventional general insurance industry, which would be supervised by
                    AAUI. Such a code could usefully cover matters such as the claims procedure,
                    the matters relating to insurance contracts referred to in Good Practice A.2 and
                    be overseen by a governance committee which includes consumer as well as
                    industry representatives and which regularly reports to OJK. Insurers should be
                    required to lodge annual reports with the governance committee as to the extent
                    of their compliance with the Code.
                    AAJI should also be encouraged to ensure that their Code is widely publicized
                    and disseminated.
Good Practice A.4   Other Institutional Arrangements
                        a. Prudential supervision and consumer protection can be placed in
                           separate agencies or lodged in a single institution, but allocation of
                           resources between prudential supervision and consumer
                           protection should be adequate to enable the effective
                           implementation of consumer protection rules.
                        b. The judicial system should provide credibility to the enforcement of
                           the rules on financial consumer protection.
                        c. The media and consumer associations should play an active role in
                           promoting consumer protection in the area of insurance.
Description         Prudential and consumer protection supervision for the insurance industry are
                    both conducted by OJK, with the same staff members performing the same
                 functions.


                 Paragraph (a)
                 Although OJK has a strong policy focus on consumer protection, at present it
                 does not separate its prudential and consumer protection (market conduct)
                 supervisory arrangements, and there are concerns as to the adequacy of OJK
                 resources to carry out the latter function. Individual staff members perform both
                 supervisory functions and do not appear to have a particular focus on consumer
                 protection issues. Such arrangements can in principle give rise to conflicts
                 between supervising financial institutions and protecting the interests of their
                 customers. Further, staff do not use, in any systematic way, many of the specific
                 tools relevant to this area (such as mystery shopping, customer focus groups
                 and surveys, review of advertising materials or a systematic analysis of customer
                 complaints made to the various mediation services on offer). There are also
                 concerns as to whether OJK is adequately resourced for the broad CPFL
                 functions it has to carry out. The mission team was advised that the insurance
                 supervision team has only 30 staff and are planning to hire another 20 -25 in the
                 near future. This is in comparison to the approximately 100 supervisory staff that
                 worked in the Ministry of Finance’s Insurance Bureau (Insurance Bureau) prior to
                 OJK assuming these functions on 1 January 2013.


                 Paragraph (b)
                 A broad range of parties may bring a consumer protection related case before a
                 court under the Consumer Law. Specifically, a charge against an entrepreneur
                 can be filed under Article 46 by a consumer, a group of consumers with a
                 common interest (a class action), a consumer protection NGO whose articles of
                 association provide for it to take such action or a government of related agency if
                 the relevant issue has caused “great material damages and/or many casualties”
                 (Article 46 (1) d).


                 The mission team was not able to meet with a member of the judiciary but was
                 advised in other meetings that it is very rare for consumer cases relevant to the
                 insurance sector to be bought before the courts. In general, it is understood that
                 neither consumers nor financial organizations trust the courts. The reasons
                 include that the court processes are slow, expensive, and unpredictable and
                 handled by low-paid judges. The mission team was also told there are cultural
                 considerations which make consumers uncomfortable about bringing their
                 disputes before a court.


                 Paragraph (c)
                 See Good Practice A.1 in relation to the role of consumer organizations.
Recommendation   Paragraph (a)
                 There is a need to consider possible revisions to supervisory structures and
                 reporting lines within OJK. Whilst appreciating that the structure of the Board of
                 Commissioners has been established by the OJK Law, consideration should be
                    given as to how the specialized supervisory arrangements for market conduct
                    (and consumer protection) supervision might be best managed within OJK. It is
                    worth noting that several countries have been evaluating their most appropriate
                    institutional arrangements for financial consumer protection in recent years.
                    According to the Global Survey on Financial Consumer Protection undertaken by
                    the World Bank, the number of economies that have agencies with dedicated
                    resources and staff in financial consumer protection increased from 46 in 2010 to
                    70 in 2013. Accordingly, 72% of agencies with responsibility for financial
                    consumer protection had a dedicated team or unit in place to perform this
                    function in 2013, as compared to 62% of economies in 2010. OJK does not have
                    such a dedicated team.


                    Special consideration should be given as to how market conduct supervision in
                    OJK could be separated from prudential supervision, and be resourced with
                    adequate tools, approaches and capacity. On the one hand, consumer protection
                    and prudential supervision require different types of supervisory profiles, skills
                    and approaches, with the latter focusing more on quantitative skills and analysis
                    of an institution’s financial soundness, and the former on qualitative skills and
                    assessment of how an institution deals with consumers. On the other hand,
                    having consumer protection and prudential responsibilities within the same unit
                    may make it harder to resolve situations when conflicting objectives arise. For
                    example, if the consequences of sanctioning a financial institution for
                    noncompliance of consumer protection provisions would have an impact on the
                    soundness (or perception of soundness) of a financial institution, or if a
                    requirement for a financial institution to compensate customers would have an
                    impact on prudential requirements, a supervisor may opt to avoid making a
                    decision or even considering consumer protection issues in order to minimize
                    prudential impact. Alternatively, when there is high political or public pressure to
                    identify problems with consumers, the attention of supervisors may focus too
                    much on consumer protection rather than prudential issues.

                    See the recommendations in Good Practice E.2 concerning the importance of
                    developing an effective alternative dispute resolution system in Indonesia.

Good Practice A.5   Bundling and Tying Clauses
                    Whenever an insurer contracts with a merchant or credit grantor (including
                    banks and leasing companies) as a distribution channel for its contracts,
                    no bundling (including enforcing adhesion to what is legally a single
                    contract), tying or other exclusionary dealings should take place without
                    the consumer being advised and able to opt out
Description         Although there are laws in place relating to the bundling of insurance and bank
                    products, and there will be further controls imposed by the FCP Regulation when
it takes effect, there remain some ambiguities.


Insurance bundling practices are common. For example, consumers who take
out loans from banks are required to take out life insurance (this is apparently a
BI requirement). Banks will also require that mortgaged property insurance be
taken out where relevant. Whilst many banks have tied arrangements with
insurers, they are required by BI to offer the consumer a choice of one of 3
insurers, one of which can be a bank related party. However it is understood that
it is common practice for there to be limited observance of this requirement and it
is not enforced. Further, there is no requirement to disclose commissions which
are paid.


The limited rules relating to bundling of products do not deal in detail with this
practice. Article 18 of the FCP Regulation will allow bundling of products in a
“single package” but forbids forcing consumers to buy products and/or services
in a single package and requires that consumers be given choice. However it is
not clear what is meant by a “package” in this context. For example, would the
prohibition apply if an insurance product was sold separately from a loan but
there was nevertheless a requirement to take out the insurance product? Further,
it would be helpful if it was clear that the prohibition also applies where an
insured is required to pay for an insurance policy as well as buy it in their own
name. A further requirement could be for a rebate of the premium where a loan is
paid out early and the insurance protects the mortgaged property. Finally, it is not
clear how many potential insurers must be on the list presented to the consumer
when there is a tying and bundling situation.


There are also ambiguities in the interaction between Article 18 of the FCP
Regulation and the provisions of the Licensing Decree relation to an insurer
marketing in cooperation with a bank. The Licensing Decree provisions clearly
allow an insurer to market in cooperation with a bank provided the approval of
the Minister of Finance is obtained and the relevant bank employees are
licensed and trained as agents (Articles 39 and 40).


Article 18 relevantly provides:
“(1) Financial Services Providers can sell their products and/or services in a
single package with the products and/or services (bundling).
(2) In terms of the Financial Services Providers bundling products and/or
services as referred to in paragraph (1):
   a. Financial Services Providers are forbidden to force consumers to buy
   products and/or services in a package, and
   b. Consumers can choose the providers of products and/or services in a
   package.
(3) In the case of bundles of product and/or services offered consumers by
choice, then the risks of choosing these options is the responsibility of the
customer.”
Recommendation      It is recommended that a clear prohibition on insuring forcing practices be
                    introduced, coupled with disclosure and rebate provisions. The ‘insurance
                    forcing’ prohibition would apply to a requirement to acquire insurance from a
                    particular supplier as a condition of providing a banking service (such as a loan)
                    and to a requirement to pay for such insurance. However there could be an
                    exception to such a prohibition in certain cases – for example, where the
                    requirement is for insurance over mortgaged property or where insurance is
                    required by law. Further, where there is a tied insurance contract, credit
                    providers should be required to give a proportionate refund of the applicable
                    premium if the consumer pays out a loan early. It is further recommended to
                    introduce a requirement for disclosure of insurance commissions and premiums.
                    Finally, it is recommended that there be a requirement for at least three insurers
                    on the list presented to the consumer when there is a tying and bundling
                    situation.



SECTION B           DISCLOSURE & SALES PRACTICES


Good Practice B.1   Sales Practices
                        a. Insurers should be held responsible for product-related information
                           provided to consumers by their agents (i.e. those intermediaries
                           acting for the insurer).
                        b. Consumers should be informed whether the intermediary selling
                           them an insurance contract (known as a policy) is acting for them
                           or for the insurer (i.e. in the latter case the intermediary has an
                           agency agreement with the insurer).
                        c. If the intermediary is a broker (i.e. acting on behalf of the
                           consumer) then the consumer should be advised at the time of
                           initial contact with the intermediary if a commission will be paid to
                           the intermediary by the underwriting insurer. The consumer should
                           have the right to require disclosure of the commission and other
                           costs paid to an intermediary for long-term savings contracts. The
                           consumer should always be advised of the amount of any
                           commission and other expenses paid on any single premium
                           investment contract.
                        d. An intermediary should be prohibited from identically filling
                           brokering and agency roles for a given general class of insurance
                           (i.e. life and disability, health, general insurance, credit insurance).
                        e. When a bank is the intermediary, the sales process should ensure
                           that the consumer understands at all times that he or she is not
                           purchasing a bank product or a product guaranteed by the bank.
                        f. Sanctions, including meaningful fines and, in the case of
                           intermediaries, loss of license, should apply for breach of any of
                           the above provisions.
Description         The requirements of this Good Practices are only met to a limited degree.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    This Good Practice is satisfied. Article 66(2) of the Good Corporate Governance
                    Regulation provides that an insurance company takes “full responsibility for the
                 consequences arising from insurance coverage by the related Insurance
                 Agents”. A similar provision is contained in Article 27(3) of Government
                 Regulation No. 73 of 1992.


                 Paragraph (b)
                 There is not a specific requirement requiring disclosure of the status of an
                 insurance agent. However the FCP Regulation, when it takes effect, will support
                 this Good Practice given the following provisions:
                        A general requirement to provide information that is “ accurate, fair, clear
                         and not misleading” (Article 4(1)); and
                        The Article 20 requirement to disclose the name and logo of a financial
                         services provider in any offer or sale and to state that they are registered
                         by OJK. This requirement would appear to apply to agents of insurers,
                         as well as the insurance companies themselves.


                 Paragraph (c)
                 There are not specific requirements relating to the disclosure of commissions.
                 However see Good Practice B.5 concerning the requirements relating to the
                 disclosure of information concerning the terms and conditions of a policy and
                 related information.


                 Paragraph (d)
                 There does not appear to be a specific requirement relating to the simultaneous
                 holding of positions as both an agent and broker. There is, however, a rule that
                 an agent can only be an agent for a single insurance company (Article 27(1) of
                 Government Regulation No. 73 of 1992). Further, under Article 38 92) of the
                 Licensing Decree it is provided (in effect) that an insurer cannot hire an agent
                 who was previously the agent of another insurer unless there has been a gap of
                 at least 6 months between the two positions.


                 Paragraph (e)
                 There is not a specific provision in insurance laws requiring disclosure of the fact
                 that an insurance product sold by a bank is not a product of the bank or
                 guaranteed by the bank.
                 See Paragraph (b).


                 Paragraph (f)
                 Whilst there are administrative sanctions provided for under the current law, it is
                 not clear that they are adequate or enforced. For example, under Article 75 of
                 the Good Corporate Governance Regulation there is provision for warnings,
                 revocation of license and restrictions on business activities. However, there is no
                 provision for fines and nothing which might allow OJK to require the provision of
                 information or to examine officers of the insurance companies concerned.
Recommendation   Brokers should be required to disclose commissions which may be paid to them
                 by insurers. This should include disclosure of either the amount of the
                    commission or, if the amount is not ascertainable at the relevant time, of the
                    method of calculation with clear examples of how the method of calculation might
                    be applied in particular cases.


                    The administrative sanctions and other penalties applying to a breach by an
                    insurer of the provisions relevant to this Good Practice (and others) should be
                    reviewed to assess their adequacy. OJK should, of course, also have the
                    resources and powers to investigate any breaches and to enforce compliance
                    whether through administrative sanctions or through referring cases for
                    prosecution.


                    In the long term a requirement should be introduced in relevant cases requiring
                    disclosure of the fact that an insurance product sold by a bank is not a product of
                    the bank or guaranteed by the bank.
Good Practice B.2   Advertising and Sales Materials
                        a. Insurers should ensure their advertising and sales materials and
                           procedures do not mislead customers. Regulatory limits should be
                           placed on investment returns used in life insurance value
                           projections.
                        b. Insurers should be legally responsible for all statements made in
                           marketing and sales materials they produce related to their
                           products.
                        c. All marketing and sales materials should be easily readable and
                           understandable by the general public.
Description         There are general provisions in place under law and the applicable Codes which
                    largely satisfy this Good Practice but there are no limitations on the advertising of
                    investment returns used in life insurance value projections.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    There are a number of provisions which in effect require insurers to ensure that
                    their advertising and sales materials do not mislead consumers. They include:
                       The Consumer Law contains wide ranging prohibitions applicable to
                        “advertising agencies” on offering, promoting or advertising services which
                        do not have the features advertised or where the relevant advertisement etc.
                        is misleading or incorrect in relation to the price or other features (Articles 9 -
                        11). The difficulty with these provisions is that it is not clear that financial
                        service providers such as insurers would be considered to be “ advertising
                        agencies”;
                       The FCP Regulation provides that a financial services provider shall “ provide
                        and/or convey information about products and/or services that is accurate,
                        fair, clear and not misleading” (Article 4) and shall not use marketing
                        strategies that “harm the consumers by taking advantage of consumers who
                        do not have other options in making decisions ” (Article 17). The meaning of
                        the words in quotes is somewhat ambiguous as it seems to imply that the
                        prohibition can only apply where the only source of information available to
                        the consumer is the advertising material in question. We think it unlikely that
                        such a restrictive interpretation was intended. The issue may, of course, be
                        one of translation;
                       Article 17 of Government Regulation No. 73 of 1992 concerning Insurance
                     Business Conduct is to the effect that all advertisements must contain
                     complete information and not be misleading;
                    The Competition Law contains provisions concerning misleading advertising,
                     advertising practices which are prohibited and responsibility for advertising
                     (Articles 10, 17 and 20); and
                    The underlying principle for sales and marketing under the Sharia Life
                     Agents Code is stated to be that the client should not be “misled” (Chapter II,
                     Article 6(1)); and
                    The Life Insurance Code requires life insurance companies and agents to
                     “correctly, completely, and accurately” provide information to customers,
                     without any “twisting” (Chapter 3, Paragraphs 3 and 8).


                 Paragraph (b)
                 Article 66(2) of the Good Corporate Governance Regulation is to the effect that
                 the insurer is fully responsible for the acts of agents who market their products.
                 However there is not a more general statement of responsibility for all sales and
                 marketing materials. This seems to be something that is implicit rather than
                 explicit.


                 Paragraph (c)
                 Article 7(1) of the FCP Regulation contains requirements for simple language for
                 some documents, but does not specifically include marketing and sales materials
                 in the list. The relevant parts of Article 7(1) requires financial services providers
                 to “use simple terms, phrases, and/or sentences in Indonesian language that are
                 easily understood by consumers, in each one of these documents:
                     a. Consumers’ rights and obligations;
                     b. Information to help consumers make decisions; and
                     c. Requirements that can be legally binding on consumers.”


                 It may be the case that paragraph (b) was intended to cover marketing and sales
                 materials, but the position is not clear. A further ambiguity is whether the above
                 requirements apply where a language other than Indonesian is used e.g.
                 marketing materials which are produced in English.
Recommendation   Regulatory limits should be placed on investment returns used in life insurance
                 value projections. This requirement should also apply to the projections used in
                 sales materials for unit – linked products which are widely sold in Indonesia.


                 The following provisions of the FCP Regulation could usefully be clarified:
                    Regulation 17 could be amended so as to provide a clear prohibition on
                     misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to any sales and advertising
                     materials.
                    Article 7(1) of the FCP Regulation would be amended so that it is clear that it
                     also applies to marketing and sales materials. It should also be clear that the
                     Article 7 requirements also apply where a language other than Indonesian is
                     used for materials or information given to a consumer e.g. English.


                 Pending any such changes, it is recommended that regulatory guidance be
                    provided in an OJK Circular issued for the purposes of the relevant Articles.
Good Practice B.3   Understanding Customers’ Needs
                    The sales intermediary or officer should be required to obtain sufficient
                    information about the consumer to ensure an appropriate product is
                    offered. Formal fact finds should be specified for long-term savings and
                    investment products and they should be retained and be available for
                    inspection for a reasonable number of years.
Description         The limited legal provisions relating to needs assessments in relation to
                    insurance contracts do not include a positive obligation to conduct such an
                    assessment, details of how the assessment should be conducted, any obligation
                    to provide the insured with a copy of the assessment or any provision for the
                    consequences of not complying with the requirements of the provision. There
                    are, however, Know Your Customer requirements in the Sharia Life Agents
                    Insurance Code.


                    Article 64(2)(b) of the Insurance Good Corporate Governance Regulation is a
                    general provision of specific relevance to the insurance industry. It requires an
                    insurance companies, brokers and agents to “evaluate the needs” of the
                    policyholder, the insured, or the participant in the policy. However, no guidance is
                    provided as to how this should be done.


                    Article 16 of the FCP Regulation also has limited provisions relating to carrying
                    out a needs assessment. It provides that:
                    “Financial Services Providers must pay attention to the fit between the needs and
                    the ability of consumers to use the products and/or services offered to them.”
                    Article 8 of the Sharia Life Insurance Code contains provisions relating to Know
                    Your Customer requirements which appear to apply to both employees and
                    agents. These requirements include specifying the information that should be
                    obtained from the client, an obligation to explain how the product works, a
                    recommendation for annual updates of relevant client information and an
                    obligation to ensure that the policy application form is completed by the client
                    (Chapter II, Article 8). In contrast, the Life Insurance Code only mentions KYC in
                    light of the requirement for life insurance companies and agents to “ uphold the
                    application of applicable laws” in this regard (Chapter 3, Paragraph 2).
Recommendation      The existing provisions relating to understanding a customer’s needs should be
                    considerably strengthened to deal with the abovementioned gaps. This might be
                    achieved by OJK providing regulatory guidance as to its expectations as to how
                    financial institutions might comply with Article 15.
Good Practice B.4   Cooling-off Period
                    There should be a reasonable cooling-off period associated with any
                    traditional investment or long-term life savings contract, after the policy
                    information is delivered, to deal with possible high pressure selling and
                    mis-selling.
Description         There is no requirement for a cooling-off period for insurance contracts under
                    Indonesian law. However the mission team was informed that if an acceptable
                    cooling off period is not provided for in policy wording for a new product, then
                    that product will not be approved by OJK (and by the Insurance Bureau at the
                    Ministry of Finance in the past). The practice appears to be to in any event
                    provide a cooling off period of at least 14 days for all types of products.
Recommendation      Although not an immediate priority, consideration might be given in the long term
                    to requiring a cooling-off period of at least [14 days] for a traditional investment or
                    long-term life policies. Consideration might also be given as to whether a cooling
                    off period is applicable to other types of insurance products and as to whether
                    any qualifications to the obligation are required (for example, to make it clear that
                    for any unit linked insurance product the insured is responsible for any losses
                    incurred in the cooling-off period).
Good Practice B.5   Key Facts Statement
                    A Key Facts Statement should be attached to all sales and contractual
                    documents, disclosing the key factors of the insurance product or service
                    in large print.
Description         Although there are disclosure requirements relating to insurance policies under
                    Indonesian law, there is no requirement for a Key Facts Statement of the type
                    contemplated by this Good Practice.


                    There are specific requirements relating to the disclosure of material information
                    material to the interests of policy holders. Article 64(2)(c) of the Good Corporate
                    Governance Regulation provides in this regard that insurance companies,
                    brokers and agents must disclose information which is” material and relevant to
                    the policyholder, the insured, participant, and / or those who are entitled to
                    benefits”. There is not, however, any description of what this information might
                    be.


                    Further, under the new FCP Regulation there are provisions which require:
                       Consumers to be given, before they sign an agreement, a document
                        containing the terms and conditions, including any costs, benefits and risks
                        and details of service and complaints resolution procedures (Article 11).
                        These requirements are not, however, product specific. For example, there is
                        no requirement to clearly disclose the excess on an insurance contract or
                        significant exclusions.
                       Financial services providers are also required to provide summaries of
                        products and services (including costs, benefits and risks as well as terms
                        and conditions) (Articles 8 and 10).
                       Financial services providers must also explain to consumers their rights and
                        obligations (Article 9).
Recommendation      Consideration be given to developing a Key Facts Statement for the more
                    common forms of insurance contracts (such as home building and contents
                    insurance and motor vehicle insurance).


                     The aim is to reduce consumer confusion regarding what is and is not included
                    in insurance contracts and provide consumers with a mechanism to easily
                    compare the key aspects of insurance contracts. Such a Key Facts Statement
                    might be required to be in a particular font size, be printed in clear contrasting
                    colors and contain information as to the monetary limit of coverage, the premium,
                    risks covered, any excess, the main exclusions, any applicable cooling off period.
                    Ideally it would be required to be provided whenever a consumer makes an
                    enquiry about a particular insurance policy as well as to a consumer in advance
                    of them taking up a particular policy. The Key Facts Statement could be provided
                    in paper and electronically and should also be available on an insurers’ website.
Good Practice B.6   Professional Competence
                        a. Sales personnel and intermediaries selling and advising on
                           insurance contracts should have sufficient qualifications,
                           depending on the complexities of the products they sell.
                        b. Educational requirements for intermediaries selling long-term
                           savings and investment insurance products should be specified, or
                           at least approved, by the regulator or supervisor.
Description         There is a strong emphasis on the training of insurance agents under Indonesian
                    law and the applicable Codes.


                    The primary provisions relevant to this Good Practice include the following:
                       Article 67 of the Good Corporate Governance Regulation requires insurance
                        agents to be trained “with competence and high integrity” and to comply with
                        the Code of Ethics established by the relevant insurance association;
                       Article 27 of the Licensing Decree is to the effect that management of an
                        insurer must be supported by education and training of its human resources;
                        and
                       Bank officers marketing insurance must be appointed as agents and undergo
                        training on the products to be marketed (Article 40 of the Licensing Decree).


                    Insurers are also required to spend a minimum amount of their budget on
                    training. Article 20 of the Licensing Regulation provides in this regard that :
                    “An Insurance or Reinsurance Company shall provide a budg et for education
                    and training program at least 5% (five per cent) of total manpower expenses,
                    Directors and Commissioners, to improve the skill, knowledge and expertise in
                    insurance of its employees” (Emphasis added).


                    The translation of the above provision is not clear, but the intent appears to be to
                    require insurers to spend 5% of their “ manpower expenses” in training
                    employees (and possibly Directors and Intermediaries). However this
                    requirement does not extend to intermediaries such as agents and bank
                    employees who sell insurance products.


                    It is understood from interviews conducted that the required training courses are
                    conducted by the insurance industry associations. The Life Insurance Code
                    requires life insurance companies to “ educate, edify, and develop [their] agents”,
                    “including, but not limited to, [providing] the necessary training ” (Chapter 3,
                    Paragraph 5).
Recommendation      Re-make Article 20 of the Licensing Regulation so that the requirement to apply
                    5% of the manpower budget in training clearly extends to intermediaries such as
                    agents and bank employees who sell insurance products.
Good Practice B.7   Regulatory Status Disclosure
                        a. In all of its advertising, whether by print, television, radio or
                           otherwise, an insurer should disclose: (i) that it is regulated, and (ii)
                           the name and address of the regulator.
                        b. All insurance intermediaries should be licensed and proof of
                           licensing should be readily available to the general public,
                           including through the internet.
Description         There are requirements for regulatory status to be disclosed under the new FCP
                    Regulation and for brokers to be registered, but the position is less clear with
                    agents although an insurer is required to have an agreement with an insurance
                    agent.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    Article 20 of the FCP Regulation relevantly requires that there be disclosure of
                    the name and logo of a financial services provider in any offer or sale and a
                    statement to the effect that the relevant provider is registered and supervised by
                    OJK. This requirement would appear to apply to agents of insurers, as well as
                    the insurance companies themselves.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    Insurance brokers are required to be licensed and their names are listed on the
                    OJK website. However it appears that insurance agents are not required to be
                    licensed. The licensing requirements for brokers are provided for by Article 48 of
                    the Licensing Decree. There is not however a specific requirement in relation to
                    the licensing of insurance agents although an insurer is required to have a
                    written agreement with an agent (Article 66 (1) of the Good Corporate
                    Governance Regulation).
Recommendation      The position in relation to the licensing of insurance agents needs to be clarified.
                    Both agents and brokers should in any event be required to be listed on the OJK
                    website.
Good Practice B.8   Disclosure of Financial Situation
                        a. The regulator or supervisor should publish annual public reports
                           on the development, health, strength and penetration of the
                           insurance sector either as a special report or as part of the
                           disclosure and accountability requirements under the law
                           governing it.
                        b. Insurers should be required to disclose their financial information
                           to enable the general public to form an opinion with regards to the
                           financial viability of the institution.
                        c. If credible claims paying ability ratings are not available, the
                           regulator or supervisor should periodically publish sufficient
                           information on each insurer for an informed commentator or
                           intermediary to form a view of the insurer’s relative financial
                            strength.
Description         The requirements of this Good Practice are met to the extent of the requirement
                    that insurers publish annual reports and the publication of statistics on the
                    insurance industry by OJK.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    OJK publishes detailed statistics on insurance companies on its website. This
                    includes information on their assets, gross and net claims, premiums and other
                    information. There is not, however, a separate report of the type described
                    though much of the relevant information may be ascertained from the information
                    that is published.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    Insurance companies are required to prepare an annual report and to provide a
                    copy to the Insurance Bureau (now OJK) under Article 62 of the Good Corporate
                    Governance Regulation. The mission team also understands that there is a
                    requirement that the annual reports must be published in a newspaper, but were
                    not able to identify the relevant regulatory requirement.


                    Paragraph (c)
                    The only information that is published is as described in paragraph (b).
Recommendation      There are no recommendations in relation to this Good Practice.



SECTION C           CUSTOMER ACCOUNT HANDLING AND MAINTENANCE


Good Practice C.1   Customer Account Handling
                        a. Customers should receive periodic statements of the value of their
                           policy in the case of insurance savings and investment contracts.
                           For traditional savings contracts, this should be provided at least
                           yearly, however more frequent statements should be produced for
                           investment-linked contracts.
                        b. Customers should have a means to dispute the accuracy of the
                           transactions recorded in the statement within a stipulated period.
                        c. Insurers should be required to disclose the cash value of a
                           traditional savings or investment contract upon demand and within
                           a reasonable time. In addition, a table showing projected cash
                           values should be provided at the time of delivery of the initial
                           contract and at the time of any subsequent adjustments.
                        d. Customers should be provided with renewal notices a reasonable
                           number of days before the renewal date for non-life policies. If an
                           insurer does not wish to renew a contract it should also provide a
                           reasonable notice period.
                        e. Claims should not be deniable or adjustable if non-disclosure is
                           discovered at the time of the claim but is immaterial to the
                           proximate cause of the claim. In such cases, the claim may be
                             adjusted for any premium shortfall or inability to recover
                             reinsurance.
                        f.   Insurers should have the right to cancel a policy at any time (other
                             than after a claim has occurred – see above) if material non-
                             disclosure can be established.
Description         Although the provisions for this Good Practice appear to be met to some extent
                    in practice, there are not enforceable rules to require compliance with any aspect
                    of this Good Practice apart from a few limited exceptions.


                    The exceptions include:
                       There are various dispute resolution schemes available to policy holders and
                        others with an interest in an insurance policy (see Good Practice E); and
                       The mission team was told that it is industry practice to provide at least
                        annual statements in relation to insurance savings and investment style
                        policies such as unit-linked policies.
Recommendation      Detailed consideration should be given to mandating the requirements of this
                    Good Practice. It is considered especially important that the Good Practices
                    relating to statements, dispute resolution, renewals and the effect of non-
                    disclosures be implemented.




SECTION D           PRIVACY & DATA PROTECTION


Good Practice D.1   Confidentiality and Security of Customers’ Information
                    Customers have a right to expect that their financial transactions are kept
                    confidential. Insurers should protect the confidentiality and security of
                    personal data, against any anticipated threats, or hazards to the security or
                    integrity of such information, and against unauthorized access.
Description         There are not specific legislative provisions currently in place to satisfy this Good
                    Practice, although the new FCP Regulation will to some extent meet its
                    requirements. It is also to be noted that there is not a general data protection law
                    in Indonesia.


                    Under the new FCP Regulation, financial services providers (which would include
                    insurers) are prohibited from providing data or information about consumers to
                    third parties in any way unless the customer has consented or there is an
                    applicable legislation (Article 31).


                    The Sharia Life Insurance Code also contains various provisions concerning the
                    confidentiality of customer information (see especially Article 4). However the
                    Life Insurance Code does not contain anything specific in relation to the
                    confidentiality of insureds’ personal information.
Recommendation      AAJI should be encouraged to amend the Life Insurance Code to deal with the
                    issue of confidentiality.
SECTON E            DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS


Good Practice E.1   Internal Dispute Settlement
                        a. Insurers should provide an internal avenue for claim and dispute
                           resolution to policyholders.
                        b. Insurers should designate employees to handle retail policyholder
                           complaints.
                        c. Insurers should inform their customers of the internal procedures
                           on dispute resolution.
                        d. The regulator or supervisor should investigate whether insurers
                           comply with their internal procedures regarding consumer
                           protection.
Description         There are not currently specific requirements for the establishment of internal
                    dispute settlement procedures for insurers. However the insurers met all said
                    that they had internal procedures for dealing with complaints, but they varied as
                    between insurers.


                    However, there are general provisions in the Consumer Law relating to
                    entrepreneurs obligations to deal with customer complaints. In this regard Article
                    19 requires entrepreneurs to compensate consumers for the damages or loss
                    that they suffer as a result of consuming services.


                    Further, once the new FCP Regulation comes into effect insurers will be required
                    to have such systems in place. This is because financial services providers
                    (which include insurers) will be required to have and implement mechanisms for
                    consumer complaint resolution. In summary, the requirements are for procedures
                    which:
                           Are notified to the consumer (Article 32 (1));
                           Are free (Article 33);
                           Include the financial service provider reporting to OJK on complaints and
                            the status of resolution approximately every 3 months (Article 34);
                           Require the complaint to be resolved within 20 days or, in specified
                            cases, within an additional 20 days (Article 35);
                           Require a work unit to be established to handle and resolve complaints,
                            with one person in each office to handle complaints. Further, if an
                            employee handling the complaint was involved in the relevant
                            transaction then the compliant has to be referred to another employee
                            (Articles 36 and 37).


                    Article 38 further requires a financial services provider to:
                           Conduct an internal examination of the complaint competently, correctly,
                            and objectively;
                           Ensure the correctness of the complaint; and
                           Submit a statement of apology and offer compensation (redress /
                            remedy) or repair the product and/or service, if the consumer complained
                            properly.
Recommendation      Insurers should be required to inform their customers of the internal procedures
                    on dispute resolution and OJK should ensure that it assesses compliance with
                    the abovementioned provisions of the FCP Regulation as part of their
                    supervision activities.
Good Practice E.2   Formal Dispute Settlement Mechanisms
                        a. A system should be in place that allows consumers to seek
                           affordable and efficient third-party recourse, which could be an
                           ombudsman or tribunal, in the event the complaint with the insurer
                           cannot be resolved to the consumer’s satisfaction in accordance
                           with internal procedures.
                        b. The role of an ombudsman or equivalent institution vis-à-vis
                           consumer disputes should be made known to the public.
                        c. The ombudsman or equivalent institution should be impartial and
                           act independently from the appointing authority and the industry.
                        d. The decisions of the ombudsman or equivalent institution should
                           be binding upon the insurers. The mechanisms to ensure the
                           enforcement of these decisions should be established and
                           publicized.
Description         There appears to be an effective insurance industry mediation service in place
                    but, once the FCP Regulation commences, there will be overlaps between that
                    system and the Consumer Dispute Resolution Board system which is provided
                    for by the general Consumer Law.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    The insurance industry is currently covered by an industry association dispute
                    resolution scheme and the below mentioned Consumer Dispute Resolution
                    Board system. Further as from 7 August 2014, OJK will provide a facilitation
                    service under Articles 40 to 46 of the FCP Regulation. OJK also has advocacy
                    powers to take measures against financial institutions to resolve complaints and
                    to institute proceedings to reclaim property or to recover damages on behalf of
                    consumers – and indeed financial institutions if it is the harmed party (Article 30
                    and “advocacy powers”).


                    For completeness it is also noted that there exists in Indonesia a system for the
                    mediation, consultation, negotiation, conciliation and expert opinion of disputes.
                    This system is provided for under the terms of Law No. 30/1999 on Arbitration
                    and Alternative Disputes Resolution and is administered by the Indonesian
                    National Board of Arbitration (BANI). However it is understood that the
                    procedures provided for by this Law are not used in relation to consumer
                    disputes.


                    Insurance industry mediation services
                    The Life and General Insurance Associations provide a comprehensive
                    mediation and adjudication service through BMAI (the Indonesian Insurance
                    Mediation Board). This body was established in 2006 and provides services free
                    of charge. However, the BMAI can only handle insurance disputes for claims of
                          less than IDR750 million in the general insurance sector and claims of less than
                          IDR500 million in the life insurance sector. Since its establishment in 2006, BMAI
                          handled a total of 376 claims (218 in general insurance, and 158 in life
                                                            167
                          insurance), including 32 in 2013.


                          Consumer Dispute Settlement Board
                          The Consumer Law makes provision for the establishment of the Consumer
                          Dispute Settlement Board (BPSK), with responsibilities for handling and settling
                          the disputes between entrepreneurs and consumers (Article 1(11)). Article 48
                          requires the Government to establish such agencies in each Level II
                          Administrative Region and to appoint between 3 and 5 representatives from
                          government, consumers and entrepreneurs. The BPSK dispute resolution
                          functions are extremely broad and they appear to have power to make binding
                          decisions, as well as to impose administrative penalties (emphasis added):
                          a. to handle and settle consumer disputes through mediation or arbitration or
                          conciliation,
                          b. to provide consultation for consumer protection;
                          c. to conduct supervision against the inclusion of standard clause;
                          d. to report to the public investigators if there are any violations to the provisions
                          of this law;
                          e. to receive written or oral complaints from the consumers regarding the
                          violations against the consumers’ protection.
                          f. to investigate and examine the consumers protection disputes;
                          g. to summon the entrepreneurs who are accused to have violated against The
                          consumers’ protection;
                          h. to summon and bring witnesses, witness experts and/or each and every one
                          considered to have known that there has been violation against this law;
                          i. to request assistance from the investigators to bring the entrepreneurs,
                          witnesses, witness experts or each and every one intended by points g and h
                          above who are not willing to fulfill the summon by the consumer dispute
                          settlement agency;
                          j. to obtain examine and/or evaluate the letters, documents or other evidence to
                          be used for investigation and/or examination;
                          k. to decide and determine if the consumer has suffered any damages or not;
                          l. to notify the decision to the entrepreneurs who have violated against
                          consumers’ protection,
                          m. to impose administrative sanctions against the entrepreneurs who have
                          violated this law. (Article 52).


                          Article 45 makes it clear that consumer disputes can be settled in court or
                          outside the courts through the “voluntary choice” of the parties. If attempts are

sejak-berdirinya-hingga-desember-2013
made to settle the dispute outside the courts then charges can only be filed in
court if those efforts are declared unsuccessful by one of the parties. The result
would appear to be that if a case is being heard by the CDSA then it cannot be
bought before a court.


Further details of the duties and authorities of the BPSK are provided in the
BPSK Regulation. In particular, there is provision for (in summary):
   Functions which are almost identical to those in the 1999 Consumer Law
    (Article 3);
   Settlement by the BPSK to be a matter of choice (Article 4);
   BPSK to act as a passive conciliator, an active mediator or an arbiter (Article
    5);
   BPSK to provide various forms of advisory consumer consultations (Article
    8);
   Monitoring of standard clauses by BPSK (Article 9);
   BPSK to undertake research to detect violations of the 1999 Consumer Law
    (Articles 10 and 11)
   BPSK to provide compensation for damage and / or loss of customers up to
    IDR 200 million as part of its power to issue administrative functions (Articles
    12 and 14);
   The application and procedures to be followed by consumers (Chapter III);
   The BPSK decision making process, which involves the “Assembly”,
    consisting of an odd number of members and at least three (3) persons
    representing the government, consumers and the businesses, with a
    requirement for a member to be educated and knowledgeable in the field of
    law (Article 18 and Chapter IV);
   Evidence (Chapter V);
   Witnesses (Chapter VI);
   Conciliation, mediation and arbitration proceedings (Chapter VII);
   The “verdict” by BPSK (Chapter VIII). The results of conciliation and
    mediation proceedings are set out in a written agreement signed by the
    parties as well as being reflected in a “decision” signed by the BPSK
    Assembly and the Chairman and the results of an arbitration are set out in a
    written decision which is also signed by the BPSK Assembly and signed by
    the Chairman (Article 37); and
   Importantly, a decision of the BPSK is a binding one which has legal force
    and can be enforced by a District Court (Article 42).


OJK functions in relation to complaint resolution
OJK clearly has complaint resolution functions. Article 29 of the OJK Law
provides in this regard that:


The Financial Services Authority shall handle Consumer complaints that include:
   prepare the appropriate instruments to handle complaints from Consumers
    harmed by providers in the Financial Services Institutions;
   create the mechanism of complaints from Consumers harmed by providers
    in the Financial Services Institutions; and
   facilitate to resolve complaints from Consumers harmed by providers in the
    Financial Services Institutions in accordance with the laws and regulations in
    the Financial services sector.
Further, the “consumer protection principles” set out in Article 2 of the FCP
Regulation include “complaint handling and resolution of consumer disputes in a
simple, fast, and affordable manner“. Article 30 also gives OJK power to take
action against financial institutions to resolve complaints from consumers.


Chapter III of the FCP Regulation has provisions for the settlement of consumer
disputes which are quite different from those in the 1999 Consumer Law and the
BPSK Regulation. In summary, the FCP Regulation contains provisions to the
effect that:
   If a consumer cannot agree with their financial institution as to how to settle a
    compliant, they can seek to settle the dispute through “ alternative dispute
    resolution institutions”, submit an application to OJK to facilitate the
    settlement of the complaint or take the issue to the courts (Article 29);
    Both consumers and the public can also submit complaints about violations
    of the law to OJK (Article 40);
    Consumers who suffer losses outside the field of insurance can submit
    complaints where the financial loss is up to IDR 500 million and, for general
    insurance claims, the cap is IDR 750 million (it is not clear however what the
    cap is for life insurance claims or for claims involving insurance support
    services such as those involving agents and brokers) (Article 40(a)) ;
   Another threshold requirement is that the financial services provider has
    made efforts to resolve the complaint but has been unable to do so within an
    OJK specified deadline (Article 40(c)). This should perhaps be rephrased so
    that the requirement is that the consumer must first have sought to have the
    complaint resolved by the financial services provider;
   The complaint must be filed no more than 60 days from the date of the
    proposed settlement offered by the financial services provider (Article 40(g)).
    However it is not clear what the position is if no such settlement is offered;
   The complaint resolution process to be followed by OJK appears to be a
    facilitation process rather than the BPSK conciliation, mediation or arbitration
    process (Articles 42-46);
   The facilitation process is required to be conducted within 30 days, although
    this period may be extended by another 30 days by agreement (Article 45).


The differences between the provisions dealing with resolution of consumer
complaints in the Consumer Law and those in the BPSK Regulation are of
concern because it is not entirely clear which prevails. Under Article 55 of the
FCP Regulation, there is a provision to the effect that existing consumer
protection shall remain valid as long as not contrary to Financial Services
Authority regulations (see Good Practice A.1 above). On one view the existing
BPSK regulations are contrary to the provisions in the FCP Regulation and
accordingly no longer apply. This view would also be consistent with the
complaint resolution functions of OJK. However, the position could be clearer.


Other concerns about the operation of OJK’s new complaint resolution process
include the following issues:


   OJK is unlikely to be seen as independent. This is because it will be acting
    as both the supervisor of the relevant institution and the facilitator in a
    consumer dispute;
   OJK does not have power to make binding decisions. This seems to be the
    case given the reference to any agreed outcome being documented in a
    Deed of Agreement and any disagreement being documented in OJK’s
    minutes of the proceedings (Article 46(1));
   The facilitation process cannot be initiated unless both parties agree (Articles
    44 and 46). It may be queried whether this is appropriate as it would mean
    that a consumer would not be able to have the matter heard by OJK unless
    the financial institution agreed;
   The facilitator selection process is not clear. There are no details of the
    process for selecting facilitators, or specified requirements for their skills,
    experience, qualifications and independence;
   The procedures to be followed by OJK or a facilitator in resolving complaints
    are not clear. For example, it is not clear what complaint investigative powers
    can be exercised by OJK or a facilitator, whether consumers can be
    represented by lawyers, whether witnesses can be called, what processes
    will be followed by a facilitator in hearing complaints or what are the required
    time lines for making a decision;
   It would be helpful to have clarity as to whether consumers will have to pay
    fees. Ideally they would not have to do so; and
   There is no provision for OJK to collect, analyze or report on compliant
    statistics.


ASEAN Committee on Consumer Protection
For completeness it is noted that Indonesia is a participant in the ASEAN
Committee on Consumer Protection. The Committee provides an avenue for
consumers of any services or products to complain and seek compensation for
loss (http://aseanconsumer.org/). Another option for consumers would also be to
file a claim in the local or District court (although it is understood this option is
little used).


New rules concerning industry association ADR schemes
The abovementioned patchwork of industry schemes and associations is a
concern given the current proposal to have industry associations providing ADR
services for consumers of financial services. This proposal is provided for in
OJK’s draft ADR Regulation. In summary, under the draft regulation, there are
requirements for ADR Bodies to be registered with OJK, to provide mediation,
adjudication and arbitration services, to apply specified principles of accessibility,
independence, fairness, efficiency and effectiveness and to report every 6
months to OJK. ADR Bodies for the banking, finance, underwriting, mortgage
sectors are required to be formed by 31 December 2015. Any breach of the
Regulation by ADR Bodies and/ or “parties” may be subject to administrative
sanctions including a warning, payment of money and revocation of a
registration.


Although OJK’s focus on the establishment of an external dispute resolution
process is to be welcomed, there are some aspects of the abovementioned
proposal are of concern. These include whether OJK has the required functions
                          and powers to implement and enforce the proposed new regulation; the fact that
                          OJK cannot order payment to a consumer if a financial institution breaches a
                          decision of an ADR Body and uncertainty, given industry feedback, as to whether
                          all relevant industry associations can be formed where they do not currently exist
                          and, in all cases, have an ADR system developed and registered by the deadline
                          of 31 December 2015. A further concern is the potential for lack of consistency in
                          procedures and decisions amongst the various ADR Bodies, as well as the lack
                          of any requirement for consumer representatives on ADR boards (which could
                          assist in ensuring independence). It is also not clear how the ADR Bodies will be
                                                                                                168
                          funded, especially as ideally consumers should not have to pay a fee.


                          Paragraph (b)
                          There is a need for a public awareness c ampaign as to OJK’s new complaint
                          resolution functions. This is especially important given the possibility for
                          confusion between the respective roles of BAMI, OJK and the BPSK.


                          Paragraph (c)
                          OJK’s and BPSK’s independence from industry seems clear and in that sense
                          either body would seem to have the required level of independence from
                          industry. However it is not clear whether a facilitator appointed by OJK will
                          themselves be independent.


                          Paragraph (d)
                          See paragraph (a) above.
Recommendation            See the recommendations in Banking Sector Good Practice E.1. These
                          recommendations are relevant to the insurance industry, whilst noting that the
                          need for reform is less urgent than in relation to other parts of the financial
                          sector, given the existence of BAMI.



SECTION F                 GUARANTEE SCHEMES AND INSOLVENCY


Good Practice F.1         Guarantee Schemes and Insolvency
                               a. With the exception of schemes covering mandatory insurance (and
                                  possibly long-term insurance), insolvency guarantee schemes are
                                  not to be encouraged for insurance because of the opaque nature
                                  of the industry and the scope for moral hazard. Strong governance
                                  and prudential supervision are better alternatives.
                               b. Nominal defendant arrangements should be in place for mandatory
                                  insurances such as motor third party liability insurance to cover
                                  situations where there is no insured guilty party.


168
   The making of OJK Regulation No.1/POJK.07/2014 concerning Alternative Dispute Resolution Institutions in the
Financial Services Sector provides more clarity around these issues, but Circular had not been made at the time of
the CPFL Review. .
                        c. Assets covering life insurance mathematical reserves and
                           investment contract policy liabilities should be segregated or at the
                           very least earmarked, and long-term policyholders should have
                           preferential access to such assets in the event of a winding-up.
Description         Although there is not at present an insolvency guarantee scheme, it is also
                    understood that a draft Insurance Law is being prepared which will provide for
                    one. There are no nominal defendant arrangements in place and no requirement
                    for the segregation of assets or priority on a winding up as contemplated by this
                    Good Practice.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    As noted above, it is understood that there is a proposal for an insolvency
                    guarantee scheme in a new Insurance Law which is being prepared. However
                    the mission team was not able to obtain a copy of the draft law and so cannot
                    comment on the provisions of the law or how it will interact with the existing
                    provisions of current law such as the Good Corporate Governance Regulations
                    or the Insurance Business Conduct Regulations and the related law.


                    For completeness it is noted that the Insurance Business Conduct Regulations
                    requires that an insurer have a guarantee fund of at least 20% of their minimum
                    paid up capital, which fund is stated to be constituted as an “ ultimate guarantee
                    in line with protecting the interest of the policyholders ”. The fund can only be
                    placed in a time deposit with a public bank or used to purchase bonds or
                    securities issued by the Government (Article 7).


                    Paragraph (b)
                    There is no provision for nominal defendant arrangements in Indonesia.


                    Paragraph (c)
                    There is no provision of the type contemplated although there are requirements
                    for insurers to have their own guarantee fund. See paragraph (a) for details.
Recommendation      Consideration should be given to introducing nominal defendant arrangements
                    as contemplated by this Good Practice.


                    Other aspects of this Good Practice should be reviewed in light of the new
                    Insurance Law when it becomes available.



SECTION G           CONSUMER EMPOWERMENT


Good Practice G.1   Broadly based Financial Capability Program
                        a. A broadly based program of financial education and information
                           should be developed to increase the financial capability of the
                           population.
                        b. A range of organizations–including government, state agencies and
                           non-governmental organizations–should be involved in developing
                           and implementing the financial capability program.
                        c. The government should appoint an institution such as the central
                           bank or a financial regulator to lead and coordinate the
                           development and implementation of the national financial capability
                           program.
Description         Paragraph (a)
                    For additional discussion, see Good Practice G.1 of the Banking Section.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    The insurance industry has contributed some important programs to the national
                    effort to educate Indonesian consumers about insurance.
                    Allianz has fielded programs for both youth and adults (particularly women) on
                    basic financial skills like saving, managing debt and insuring against risk.
                    Working with the NGO Prestasi Junior, Prudential employees volunteer to offer a
                    program to disadvantaged youth which teaches students about needs and
                    wants, work, money and how financial transactions happen. The insurer, AXA,
                    focuses on middle and high school students with its programs, using its
                    employees to teach young people lessons on budgeting, risk, insurance and
                    investments. The entire Indonesian insurance industry cooperates to support the
                    "Insurance Goes to Campus" program which sponsors lectures on university
                    campuses given by insurance industry executives. The lectures cover basic
                    insurance principles, financial planning, insurance sales, risk management, as
                    well as roles and functions within a life insurance company.

Good Practice G.2   Unbiased Information for Consumers
                        a. Consumers, especially the most vulnerable, should have access to
                           sufficient resources to enable them to understand financial
                           products and services available to them.
                        b. Financial regulators should provide, via the internet and printed
                           publications, independent information on the key features, benefits
                           and risks—and where practicable the costs–of the main types of
                           financial products and services.
                        c. Non-governmental organizations should be encouraged to provide
                           consumer awareness programs to the public regarding financial
                           products and services.

Good Practice G.3   Measuring the Impact of Financial Capability Initiatives
                        a. Policymakers, industry and advocates should understand the
                           financial capability of various market segments, particularly those
                           most vulnerable to abuse.
                        b. The financial capability of consumers should be measured through
                           a broad-based household survey that is repeated from time to time.
                        c. The effectiveness of key financial capability initiatives should be
                           evaluated.

                    For additional discussion, see Good Practice G.3 of the Banking Section.


                    Paragraph (c)
                    While a few insurer-sponsored programs are subject to light program evaluation,
                    this practice is still the exception rather than the rule. Instead insurance
                    companies typically rely on input measures (i.e. number of sessions given,
                    attendees, and books distributed) rather than output measures (i.e. changes in
                    participants' knowledge, attitude and behavior regarding insurance).

The non-bank credit sector is composed of multiple categories of non-bank credit
institutions (NBCIs) regulated by OJK or the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs. There
are 202 multi-finance companies whose assets amount to IDR 342 trillion (about 4% of GDP)
as of December 2012. They are authorized to offer 4 types of credit facilities: consumer finance,
leasing, credit cards and factoring. There is only one pawnshop (state-owned), with 4,631
branches as of June 2013 (including 634 sharia units) and assets representing about 0.4% of
GDP. It is authorized to offer pawning, consumer based finance and sharia financing, as well as
gold trading and payment/remittances services. Both are currently regulated and supervised by
OJK. Also, there are 108,066 savings and loan cooperatives and several savings and loans
units within multi-purpose cooperatives (which may also have productive, service and
consumer units). However, under the Cooperatives Law (approved in 2012), these units have to
spin-off as independent savings and loan cooperatives. These institutions are currently
regulated by the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs and supervised by this Ministry (in cases
where cooperatives operate nationally) or by the provincial and district authorities (cooperatives
that operate locally).

In addition, there are multiple types of non-bank credit providers that are either regulated
by provincial authorities or not regulated at all. They include several types of community-
based institutions or village credit providers in different provinces. According to the Banking
Law, these institutions are prohibited from collecting deposits; however some types of provincial
institutions either are authorized to take deposits within a traditional village (e.g. LPDs in Bali) or
have received authorization from the Ministry of Finance to receive savings (e.g. BKKs in
Central Java). The most important category of village credit provider is the LPD, established in
1985 as a system following traditional customary law in villages of Bali. As of December 2012,
there are 1,351 LPDs regulated by the provincial governor and subject to delegated supervision
of the Bali regional development bank. There are also savings and loan Sharia institutions
(BMTs), which offer different types of financing agreements, savings and term deposits, and
shares. The largest BMT industry association, Asbindo (Association of Indonesian BMTs), has
5,500 members, but the total number of BMTs currently operating in Indonesia is unknown
(BMT Center, the second most important BMT industry association has about 140 members).
Although many BMTs are registered as cooperatives (and thus subject to the cooperative
regulatory and supervisory framework described in the previous paragraph), most BMTs seem
to be operating outside of the scope of regulators. Additionally, there are non-regulated self-help
groups and non-government organizations providing local financial facilities, in many cases as
distribution channels for government programs (such as the about 15,425 UPKs or
management units operating in 2012, which implement the National Program for Community
Empowerment169). The number of these credit providers is also unknown.

The multi-finance segment has been constantly increasing in the past four years, driven
by consumer financing activities. The total credit of the multi-finance segment has increased
112% from 2009 to 2012. 62% of this increase corresponds to the consumer finance portfolio.
Leasing operations have also more than doubled in the same period, slightly increasing their

participation in the multi-finance credit portfolio from 33% to 35%. The multi-finance segment
shows signs of competition. In 2011, 56% of the industry assets were concentrated in 11
companies with assets above IDR 5 trillion, and 33% corresponded to 76 companies with assets

There are currently three different types of institutional arrangements, each one with
different approaches. OJK regulates and supervises the multi-finance companies and the
state-owned pawnshop; the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs regulates the cooperative
sector and delegates supervision of cooperatives with local outreach to the provincial and
district government authorities; the provincial government authorities regulate the small village
credit providers, with delegated supervision carried out by the regional development banks.
There are no formal coordination mechanisms between these three different types of
regulators/supervisors.

Institutional arrangements are expected to change once the Cooperatives Law and the
Microfinance Institutions Law are fully implemented, but there is still some uncertainty
about the responsibilities for supervision of microfinance institutions that operate as
cooperatives. In the context of the Cooperatives Law enacted in 2012, the Ministry of
Cooperatives and SMEs is setting up the Monitoring Institution for Savings and Loan
Cooperatives (the deadline for implementation of this law is October 2014). At the same time,
the Microfinance Institutions Law enacted in 2013 requires all institutions specialized in
providing financial services targeted to the poor and low-income communities to be licensed by
OJK as microfinance institutions (with exception of village credit institutions recognized by
customary law such as the LPDs). According to the Microfinance Institutions Law, the training,
supervision and regulation of microfinance institutions is the responsibility of OJK, which can
delegate its supervisory function to local government authorities or other appointed parties. The
deadline for implementation of this law is January 2015, i.e. three months after the deadline for


170
      LK-Bapepam, Annual Report Finance Companies, 2011
implementing the Cooperatives Law. It is not entirely clear at this moment how both laws will be
implemented in the case of cooperative microfinance institutions (for example, whether the
Monitoring Institution for Savings and Loan Cooperatives – and not the provincial authorities –
will supervise the new microfinance institutions constituted as cooperatives; or who will regulate
BMTs operating as cooperatives).

In any case, the provincial authorities are still expected to play a key role in the
supervision and regulation of non-bank credit institutions. Once the transitional period of
the new Microfinance Institutions Law is over, provincial authorities will still fulfill the role of
delegated supervisors for microfinance institutions, as well as supervising and regulating village
credit providers (which are excluded from the application of the Microfinance Institutions Law).

In addition, the Ministry of Trade plays a role as enforcer of the consumer protection law
and as authorizer of third-party dealers for the sale (or rent) of automobiles and
motorcycles. The Ministry of Trade is the supervisor and enforcer of the general consumer
protection law, which is particularly applicable to those segments not regulated by OJK (e.g.
cooperatives and village credit providers) where no specific financial consumer protection legal
or regulatory provisions are in place. In addition, in the multi-finance segment third party dealers
are the main providers of pre-sale information about financing facilities of multi-finance
companies to consumers.

There are active industry associations in two non-bank credit segments, with the oldest
being the multi-finance segment. The Indonesian Association of Multi-Finance
Companies (APPI) represents 150 multi-finance companies (out of 202 companies operating in
this segment). It was initially formed as a leasing association (ALI) in 1982 in Jakarta. Along with
the growth of the market and the expansion of financing activities for these types of companies,
in July 2000 the association changed its name to APPI, and soon after, in December 2000, the
association of factoring companies also joined APPI. APPI offers different services to its
members on a voluntary basis, including training, lobbying and dissemination of information
(including information on bad debtors).

There are two associations of Islamic microfinance institutions. Asbindo (Association of
Indonesian BMTs) was conceptualized in 2005 as an industry representative body, but it only
became fully operative in 2011 when it started running Apex BMT as its business implementing
body and as a self-regulatory organization. Apex BMT has several functions including these: i)
providing an integrated IT system that connects all member BMTs, along with IT support and
assistance; ii) providing liquidity facilities to members; iii) managing a guarantee scheme for
transactional deposits (up until IDR 25 million); iv) administering an industry clearing/settlement
and payment system; v) developing rating systems; vi) undertaking management training and
capacity building activities to support members in every step of their business, as well as
members’ clients; vi) monitoring and evaluating activities of members. Asbindo has about 500
members out of approximately 5,500 BMTs that operate in Indonesia. The BMT Center is
another association of BMTs, also formed in 2005, and currently with about 140 members. Its
functions include: i) self-regulatory activities and coordination with regulatory agencies regarding
development of standards for the industry; ii) capacity building for both BMTs and debtors; iii)
advocacy and consultation among members; iv) rating of BMTs; v) monitoring and supervision
of BMTs; vi) wholesaler for BMT members; vii) operations center to provide information required
by members including a debtors database.

Finally, some provinces and regencies have developed associations of village credit
providers. In some cases they have developed thanks to the encouragement of local
authorities. However, these associations seem to operate locally and with no major coordination
or cooperation with similar institutions in other locations.

There are about 200 consumer organizations active in Indonesia, and some cover
financial sector issues. Indonesian Consumer Protection Organization (YLPK) is a non-
profit, public, non-governmental organization created in 1973, which focuses on consumer
education and awareness, complaints handling, and consumer testing and research. YLPK has
a license issued by the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights to operate as a foundation, and a
license from the local government authority to operate as a consumer organization. YLPK has
been relatively active in the financial sector, for example advocating for increased protection of
personal data (including by surveying financial institutions to find out whether they have data
privacy policies), limits in telemarketing practices, and raising concerns on unfair contract
provisions (e.g. concerning towing fees being charged to consumers after repossessing the
goods, contract provisions indicating that the consumer agrees to any future changes in the
terms and conditions of a financial product). YLPK receives consumer complaints and usually
tries to help resolve them through mediation, but it can also advise the consumer to go to the
Consumer Dispute Settlement Board – and assist the consumer in that process or even
represent consumers in class actions.

SECTION A           CONSUMER PROTECTION INSTITUTIONS


Good Practice A.1   Consumer Protection Regime
                    The law should provide clear consumer protection rules in the area of non-
                    bank credit institutions, and there should be adequate institutional
                    arrangements to ensure the thorough, objective, timely and fair
                    implementation and enforcement of all such rules, as well as of sanctions
                    that effectively deter violations of these rules.
                    a. There should be specific statutory provisions, which create an
                       effective regime for the protection of consumers of non-bank credit
                       institutions.
                    b. There should be a government authority responsible for implementing,
                       overseeing and enforcing consumer protection in the area of non-bank
                       credit institutions.
                    c. The supervisory authority for non-bank credit institutions should have
                       a register which lists the names of non-bank credit institutions.
                    d. There should be coordination and cooperation among the various
                       institutions mandated to implement, oversee and enforce consumer
                       protection and financial sector regulation and supervision.
                    e. The law should provide for, or at least not prohibit, a role for the
                       private sector, including voluntary consumer associations and self-
                       regulatory organizations, in respect of consumer protection in the area
                       of non-bank credit institutions.
Description         There are multiple institutions with different roles in regulating or supervising
                    consumer protection in the NBCI sector, with overlapping and unclear
                    jurisdictions, and limited coordination mechanisms. Similarly, the legal and
                    regulatory framework is not consistent and lacks important provisions to
                    adequately protect NBCI consumers. Industry associations and consumer
                    organizations play a very limited role, especially due to capacity constraints.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    Despite the existence of some legal and regulatory provisions applicable to
                    segments of non-bank credit institutions, the overall legal framework does not
                    provide a clear and effective regime for the protection of consumers of non-bank
                    credit institutions. At a more general level, although the Law on Consumer
                    Protection (Consumer Law) does not include any explicit article dealing with
                    financial services, its overall scope refers to all types of goods and services
                    (which by default include financial services). Some important consumer
                    protection provisions included in this law relate to the prohibition of misleading
                    advertising (Chapter IV) and unfair standard contract clauses (Chapter V),
                    dispute resolution (Chapter X), and consumer protection supervision (Chapter
                    XII). However, these provisions seem more oriented to transactions related to
                    goods and services other than financial services. The Law on the Ban of
                    Monopolistic Practices and Unfair Business Competition (Competition Law) also
                          includes some provisions relevant for the protection of consumers of non-bank
                          credit institutions, especially those referring to price fixing (Chapter III, Part Two),
                          closed contracts (Chapter III, Part Nine) and market controlling (Chapter IV, Part
                          III).


                          In terms of specific financial sector laws and regulations, the multi-finance and
                          pawnshop segments will be governed by the comprehensive OJK Regulation on
                          Financial Consumer Protection (FCP Regulation) when it comes into force in
                          August 2014, as well as upcoming Circulars containing applicable guidelines.
                          This Regulation provides a solid consumer protection framework, covering key
                          elements such as consumer disclosure, business practices, complaints handling
                          and dispute resolution, confidentiality, supervision and sanctions. However, the
                          financial cooperatives and small village credit providers are outside the scope of
                          this regulation, and their sectoral legal and regulatory frameworks do not include
                          specific consumer protection provisions. It is also important to mention that,
                          although many BMTs are registered as cooperatives and therefore need to
                          comply with the Cooperatives Law, the vast majority of BMTs seem to be
                          operating outside of the scope of regulators, and with no specific legal
                                      171
                          framework.


                          OJK has also recently issued the Microfinance Institutions Law (MFI Law), which
                          would cover specialized financial institutions established to provide business and
                          community development services (with the exception of customary-law-based
                          village credit institutions). This law includes a brief consumer protection section
                          (Chapter VIII), which requires microfinance institutions to provide key information
                          to the public on terms and conditions of financial products, as well as information
                          about the MFI’s management and the potential risks of the MFI’s operations with
                          other parties. The MFI Law also gives OJK the authority: to provide information
                          and education to the community about the microfinance sector, to ask
                          microfinance institutions to cease their activities if they are harmful to
                          communities, to set up a complaints handling service, and to undertake other
                          actions as necessary in accordance with this law. This law comes into force in
                          January 2015.


                          Paragraph (b)
                          In the non-bank credit sector, there are currently multiple institutions that have a
                          role in implementing, overseeing and enforcing consumer protection, in many
                          cases with overlapping and unclear jurisdictions.


                          OJK regulates and supervises the multi-finance companies and the state-owned
                          pawnshop. Among its multiple functions, the OJK Law of 2011 explicitly



171
   At a more general level, BMTs should follow the Islamic Law under the Code of Commercial Law for the
establishment of membership rules, as well as the Law on Management of Zakat when carrying out treasury activities
(Ahmad Juwaini, Mursida Rambe, Nana Mintarti and Rury Febrianto, “BMT (Baitulmaal wa Tamwil) Islamic Micro
Financial Services for the Poor”, ISO/Copolco Workshop, Bali 2010).
recognizes OJK’s financial consumer protection role. Article 4, for example,
states that one of OJK’s objectives is to “ protect the interests of Consumers and
the public”, whereas Chapter VI deals with OJK’s powers to adopt measures that
ensure consumer and public protection. Despite OJK’s clear r esponsibility for
consumer protection in the multi-finance and pawnshop segments, its authority
over other non-bank credit institutions such as savings and loan cooperatives, is
not entirely clear yet, as will be explained in more detail below.


The Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs (MC) is currently responsible for
regulation and supervision of the cooperative sector (including some BMTs that
are registered as cooperatives). According to the Regulation on Activities of
Savings and Loans Cooperatives, MC is in charge of carrying out supervision
and providing guidance to such institutions, and to set principles for healthy and
prudential cooperative development. In more practical terms, the Regulation on
Guidance for Supervision of Savings and Loans Cooperatives indicates that the
responsibility for supervision of cooperatives at a central level is the MC, and that
at the province, regency and city level, such responsibility is delegated to staff in
the local government authorities (Article 25). However, the institutional
arrangements in the cooperative sector are expected to change soon. The 2012
Cooperatives Law requires that the existing savings and loans units of
multipurpose cooperatives be transformed into separate independent savings
and loans cooperatives, and prohibits any other type of cooperative from offering
savings or loans products. The Cooperatives Law also requires savings and
loans cooperatives to offer products and services only to members. Additionally,
the Law indicates that the MCs’ Monitoring Institution for Savings and Loans
Cooperatives will be in charge of supervising and regulating the cooperatives
that provide financial services. The scope of powers of the Monitoring Institution
is still being developed, but the authorities have indicated the importance of
including elements of consumer protection, in addition to the Ministry’s existing
responsibilities for financial supervision. The deadline for implementation of this
Law is October 2014.


In January 2013, OJK issued the MFI Law. This Law requires all institutions
specialized in providing financial services targeted to the poor and low-income
communities to be licensed by OJK as microfinance institutions by January 2014
(with the exception of village credit institutions recognized by customary law such
as the LPDs). The law explicitly mentions that this requirement applies to credit
cooperatives, local government-owned microfinance institutions and BMTs; and
that OJK shall work together with the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs and the
Ministry of Interior to conduct an inventory of MFIs that are not licensed as MFIs
by the set deadline. According to the Law, the training, supervision and
regulation of microfinance institutions are the responsibility of OJK, which can
delegate its supervisory function to local government authorities or other
appointed parties. The deadline for implementation of this law is January 2015,
i.e. three months after the deadline for implementing the Cooperatives Law. It is
not entirely clear at this moment how both laws will be implemented in the case
of cooperative microfinance institutions and who will be in charge of supervising
them (for example, whether the Monitoring Institution for Savings and Loan
Cooperatives – and not the provincial authorities – will supervise the new
microfinance institutions constituted as cooperatives; or who will regulate and
supervise BMTs operating as cooperatives; or whether supervision of savings
and loan cooperatives will be carried out by both OJK and by the MC, with each
one looking at different elements of the business).


In any case, the provincial authorities are still expected to play a key role in the
supervision and regulation of non-bank credit institutions. Once the transitional
period of the new Microfinance Institutions Law is over, provincial authorities will
still fulfill the role of delegated supervisors for microfinance institutions, as well as
supervising and regulating village credit providers (which are excluded from
application of the MFI Law).


The Ministry of Trade also plays a role in consumer protection for the non-bank
credit sector. On the one hand, it clearly plays a role in the authorization of third-
party dealers for the sale (or renting) of automobiles and motorcycles —and third
party dealers are the main providers of initial information about financing facilities
of multi-finance companies to consumers. On the other hand, the Ministry is the
enforcer of the Consumer Law (Article 30), which in the current context is
certainly applicable to the cooperative and village credit provider segments, as
well as the BMTs (where no consumer protection provisions are included in their
sector legal and regulatory framework).


In the case of other nonbank credit sectors, there is no legal provision that
indicates how the FCP Regulation and the Consumer Law interact or whether the
existence of a financial regulator with consumer protection functions has an
effect on the applicability of the Consumer Law. Therefore, the Ministry of Trade
theoretically still has a role in enforcing the Consumer Law in the OJK regulated
financial sector (at least enforcing those provisions that do not contradict the
FCP Regulation).


Additionally, the Consumer Dispute Settlement Board (BPSK) created by the
Consumer Law also plays an important enforcement role in the context of that
law. In addition to its disputes handing and resolution function, the law authorizes
the BPSK to conduct supervision regarding the inclusion of standard clauses, to
report to public investigators if there are violations to provisions of this law, to
impose administrative sanctions against entrepreneurs who have violated this
law (Article 52).


Additionally, the National Consumer Protection Agency was set up under the
Consumer Law as a separate entity charged with providing suggestions and
considerations to the government in the framework of developing consumer
protection in Indonesia (Article 33). In order to carry out such mandate, the
Agency is authorized:
   To provide suggestions and recommendations to the government regarding
    consumer protection policies;
   To conduct surveys and studies on the consumer protection legal framework
   To conduct surveys on consumer’s safety
   To encourage the development of consumer NGOs
   To disseminate information in the media on consumer protection and
    promote awareness of consumer rights
   To receive complaints regarding consumer protection from consumers,
    consumer NGOs or entrepreneurs
   To conduct surveys on consumer needs.


Paragraph (c)
There is no source to obtain a list of all the NBCIs operating in Indonesia. This is
true for the multi-finance segment regulated by OJK, as well as the cooperative
and village credit segments, where the authorities do not have available lists of
institutions under their supervision. In the BMT segment, it is even more difficult
to obtain information of the number of BMTs operating in the market due to the
absence of a supervisory body.


It is worth noting that in the cooperatives sector, the Cooperatives Law (Article
25) indicates that the MC should have a General Register of Cooperatives that is
open to the public. The Register should include at least the general information
of the cooperative (name, domicile, business activities, setup date, and name of
members of supervisory board), number and date of amendments to the Articles
of Association and of the deed of dissolution notified to the MC, name and
address of the Notary that prepared the deed to operate as a cooperative.
However, this Register is not easily accessible or available online.


Paragraph (d)
In general, there are no cooperation mechanisms (e.g., memorandum of
understanding) between the different authorities with a role in consumer
protection and financial regulation and supervision for the NBCI sector. One
good first step towards increased formal cooperation has been taken in the MFI
Law. The Law mentions the need for cooperation among OJK, the MC, and the
Ministry of Interior, both to carry out training of MFIs (Article 28) and to conduct
the inventory of MFIs that do not comply with the law in the first year (Article 40).


In theory, the Consumer Law also recognizes the importance of cooperation and
states that the Minister of Trade and the related technical ministers shall
coordinate the implementation of consumer protection (Article 29). However, no
coordination mechanisms have been developed in the financial sector, most
likely due to the lack of clarity of how this Law applies to the financial sector.


Paragraph (e) – Industry associations
The Cooperatives Law provides for a role for an industry association. The Law
recognizes the importance of creating an Indonesian Cooperative Board that will
represent the interests and aspirations of the cooperative segment and act as a
mechanism for empowering its members (Article 115). Among other roles, the
Board is expected to increase awareness of cooperatives; represent and act as
spokesperson of the cooperative movement; supervise and enforce the
application of cooperative values; establish communications, forums and
networks of cooperation in the cooperative segment; etc. (Article 117). Although
the Board’s operational costs are expected to be funded by member dues,
grants, non-binding donations and assistance, the government will also
contribute with state funding (Articles 118, 119).


There is limited mention of the role of an industry association in the current
legal/regulatory framework for other segments of non-bank credit institutions. In
the multi-finance segment there are discussions underway to issue a new multi-
finance law that would include provisions to strengthen the role of the industry
association, including in relation to consumer protection issues. The current
association, APPI, represents three quarters of the number of companies
operating in the segment, and has carried out training, lobbying and exchanging
information within the industry. Nonetheless, it is still weak in terms of resources
and capacity to represent effectively the industry and carry out activities that
promote better industry standards, especially in the area of responsible finance /
consumer protection.


In addition, in the segment of Islamic microfinance (or BMTs), although there is
no clear legal framework, there are at least two industry associations that aim to
strengthen the sector, promote industry standards, training and regulation.


In the village credit providers segment, there is no provision on this matter at a
provincial level, but at a regional level. Specifically, the Badung Regency LPDs
Regulation explicitly allows for LPDs to form a cooperation agency or industry
association (BKSLPD) that would have the duties of: coordinating the
development of the LPD market; facilitating and mediating in the LPD market;
coordinating resolution of problems between LPDs and technical trustees or
advisors; holding regular meetings of members; carrying out technical
supervision (Articles 20 and 25). The BKSLPD seems to be the only major village
credit association that has been set up although with limited capacity and
outreach.


Paragraph (e) – Consumer associations
The Consumer Protection Implementation Regulation recognizes the importance
of registered consumer NGOs in the implementation of consumer protection
legislation, and the role of the Minister of Trade in fostering their development.
Article 7 allows for consumer NGOs to undertake supervisory activities in the
area of consumer protection for goods and services (which could include
financial services). These supervisory activities are required to be conducted
through research, testing or surveys, and include aspects such as the disclosure
of information about risks, advertising, testing of services that do not meet the
elements of safety and comfort of consumers (all such elements could be
applicable to the non-bank credit sector).
                 Through Article 5 the Ministry of Trade is given the responsibility of coordinating
                 with other technical ministers the development of capacity building activities
                 (including training, education and coaching) for consumer NGOs, as well as the
                 development of consumer protection informational materials and sanctions
                 frameworks to support the activities of consumer NGOs.


                 Other activities that registered consumer NGOs may undertake (according to the
                 NGOs Regulation) include: disseminating information to increase awareness of
                 consumer rights and obligations; providing advice to consumers; working with
                 related agencies in an effort to improve consumer protection and education;
                 helping consumers fight for their rights individually or in groups, including by
                 receiving consumer complaints and helping government supervise consumer
                 protection.
                 It is worth noting that the Government registers and recognizes an NGO as a
                 “qualified consumer NGO” if it is enrolled in a district or city Government, and
                 engages in the field of consumer protection as specified in its charter (Article 2 of
                 the NGOs Regulation). The Government may also cancel the registration of a
                 consumer NGO if it no longer carries out consumer protection activities, or if it
                 violates provisions of the Consumer Law and its implementing regulations.
Recommendation   For the multi-finance and pawnshop segments, it is important that the interaction
                 between the FCP Regulation and the Consumer Law be clarified. This could be
                 done through the issuance of a new financial consumer protection law in the long
                 term, which incorporates in a single document the principles of the FCP
                 Regulation and the Law provisions that are considered relevant and applicable to
                 the financial sector.


                 In the meantime, it is important to make such clarification in the Circulars under
                 preparation for the multi-finance segment and for other non-bank financial
                 institutions (which include the pawnshop segment). Consideration could also be
                 given to amending the Consumer Law to recognize the role of OJK and other
                 financial regulators in regulating and supervising consumer protection regarding
                 their regulated institutions.


                 OJK should also develop a Circular on consumer protection for microfinance
                 institutions. This would provide further guidance to microfinance institutions on
                 the implementation of Chapter VIII of the MFI Law once it is effective, and on its
                 interaction with the Consumer Law.


                 In order to have a common legal consumer protection framework for all types of
                 financial products and providers, specific consumer protection regulations should
                 also be developed for financial cooperatives, village credit providers, BMTs, and
                 third-party auto or motor dealers. These regulations should take into account the
                 basic consumer protection provisions included in OJK regulations and circulars,
                 to avoid regulatory arbitrage and create a similar basic protection level for all
                 NBCI customers. At the same time, the regulators should adopt a proportionate
approach that considers the compliance costs for small financial providers.


To ensure adequate implementation, oversight and enforcement of consumer
protection in the multi-finance and pawnshop segments, OJK should develop
guidelines for consumer protection supervision and market monitoring. These
guidelines should help staff identify consumer protection risks through off-site
mechanisms, and develop a methodology that could be clearly transmitted to,
and understood by, staff working in OJK’s consumer protection unit and in other
units.


Given the multiplicity of institutional arrangements in the non-bank credit sector,
efforts should also be undertaken to develop similar approaches to consumer
protection supervision for similar credit providers. In particular, guidelines should
be developed for provincial authorities to carry out delegated market conduct
supervision of savings and loan cooperatives (currently) and microfinance
institutions (following on responsibilities under the MFI Law starting in 2015); and
for regional banks to undertake market conduct supervision of village credit
providers. Ideally the approach adopted would, to the extent practical, reflect that
which applies to banks so as to avoid regulatory arbitrage between the different
types of institutions. These recommendations could be considered as part of
OJK’s ongoing development of strategies and training programs for the non-bank
credit sector.



Regarding the cooperative segment, it is important that the regulation defining
the scope of powers of the Monitoring Institution for Savings and Loans
Cooperatives explicitly clarifies its role in consumer protection. It is especially
important that this is done vis-à-vis the cooperative microfinance institutions that
will be established under the MFI Law.


Each financial regulatory authority should publish a list with all the institutions it
regulates, in a section of its website that is clearly identifiable by the consumer.
All regulators could also usefully publish the list of regulated entities in their
annual reports or have the register available in their premises, for those
consumers who may not have access to the internet.


Inter-institutional coordination in the field of financial consumer protection should
be strengthened. Once the Monitoring Institution for Savings and Loan
Cooperatives is established, it will be important to develop a coordination
mechanism with OJK regarding the implementation of consumer protection and
financial supervision of savings and loan cooperatives. Similarly, coordination
should be strengthened between OJK and the Ministry of Trade. Consideration
should be given to the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding, which may
cover several topics such as: sharing information about the segments of auto
and motorcycle dealers and of multi-finance companies; developing guidelines
for the monitoring of dealers’ business practices regarding potential recipients of
                    consumer finance; sharing information on complaints or investigations related to
                    the financing of auto or motorcycle purchase. Given that the Ministry of Trade still
                    bears responsibility for monitoring compliance with the Consumer Law by entities
                    outside the remit of OJK or MC (such as third-party auto dealers, small village
                    providers, private moneylenders), it would be important to develop a multi-
                    stakeholder coordination mechanisms that allows for exchange of experiences
                    and coordination of approaches between all the different institutions that have a
                    role in financial consumer protection.


                    In the case of third-party dealers, coordination should be established with the
                    Ministry of Trade This could be done, for example, in order to improve disclosure
                    of comparative information provided by dealers to potential consumers,
                    standardize o calculation of interest rates and the real cost of credit and to
                    include provisions on the selling of bundled insurance products.
Good Practice A.2   Code of Conduct for Non-Bank Credit Institutions
                    a. There should be a principles-based code of conduct for non-bank
                       credit institutions that is devised in consultation with the non-bank
                       credit industry and with relevant consumer associations, and that is
                       monitored by a statutory agency or an effective self-regulatory agency.
                    b. If a principles-based code of conduct exists, it should be publicized
                       and disseminated to the general public.
                    c. The principles-based code should be augmented by voluntary codes
                       on matters specific to the industry (credit unions, credit cooperatives,
                       other non-bank credit institutions).
                    d. Every such voluntary code should likewise be publicized and
                       disseminated.

Description         There are no industry-based codes of conduct in place for the multi-finance,
                    savings and credit cooperatives, village credit or BMT segments.
                    In the non-bank credit sector, there are only two segments with active industry
                    associations—the Indonesian Association of Multi-finance Companies (APPI),
                    the Association of Indonesian BMTs (Asbindo) and the BMT Center. However,
                    the associations have not developed codes of conduct. The mission team was
                    advised that a draft multi-finance company law would require all multi-finance
                    companies to be a member of the relevant industry association, as a measure to
                    strengthen the association and encourage it to develop its own ADR scheme,
                    and Code of Conduct. However a copy of the draft law was not made available to
                    the mission team. Additionally, there is no active association of financial
                    cooperatives or association for small village credit providers.


                    The FCP Regulation requires financial providers to abide by their institutional
                    code of ethics when they deal with consumers (Article 30). In practice, generally
                    individual multi-finance companies and cooperatives have their internal codes of
                    conduct. However these codes are only for internal use. They are usually taught
                    during the induction and training processes, but after that they are not widely
                    disseminated. Thus, consumers are not aware of the code that the officers need
                    to comply with when interacting with them, and do not have an avenue to
                    complain against a financial institution’s officer for violation of the code of
                    conduct.


                    Pegadaian, the only pawnshop operating in Indonesia, has done a good job
                    developing a detailed code of conduct, approved by an internal regulation. The
                    Code is printed and distributed to its employees, who must also sign a
                    commitment of allegiance to the code and to report any violations against it. The
                    Code includes ten chapters on topics like fair working opportunities, safety at
                    workplace, giving and accepting prizes, intellectual property, etc. Chapters 7 and
                    8 are of particular relevance for consumer protection:
                       Chapter 8 concerns the principle of information sharing and maintenance of
                        confidentiality, and refers to the obligation of the company and its employees
                        to provide information that is correct, accurate and timely, according to the
                        law; and to maintain and protect any document, data and information that is
                        confidential from usage outside of the pawnshop’s needs;
                       Chapter 7.4 concerns relationships with debtors or customers, and refers to
                        the company’s and employees’ obligations to respect the rights of
                        customers, to provide them with high-quality services, to follow standards of
                        services and operations, to always work professionally, and to listen, accept
                        and seek solution to customer complaints; and
                       Chapter 7.6 concerns relationships with the community, and covers the
                        company’s commitment to join and participate in community empowerment
                        activities, and promote social responsibility.
Recommendation      In order to strengthen the role of non-bank credit industry associations in
                    financial consumer protection, OJK and the MC should develop guidance on the
                    principles and minimum content of industry Codes of Conduct, preferably in a
                    coordinated manner. They could also require or suggest industry associations to
                    share their draft Codes with the authorities for comments. Guidance should also
                    be provided on the mechanisms to publicize and disseminate the industry Code
                    among employees of financial institutions and consumers, and to monitor
                    compliance of the code by the association’s members.
                    OJK and MC should share such guidelines with the BMT self-regulatory
                    organizations, as well as with the provincial government authorities, so that
                    similar guidelines could be developed in the BMT and village credit segments.
                    Similarly, the Ministry of Trade should require the application of similar guidelines
                    for the development of codes of conduct in the auto /motor dealers industry.
Good Practice A.3   Other Institutional Arrangements
                    a. Whether non-bank credit institutions are supervised by a financial
                       supervisory agency, the allocation of resources between financial
                       supervision and consumer protection should be adequate to enable
                       their effective implementation.
                    b. The judicial system should ensure that the ultimate resolution of any
                       dispute regarding a consumer protection matter with a non-bank credit
                       institution is affordable, timely and professionally delivered.
                    c. The supervisory authority for non-bank credit institutions should
                       encourage media and consumer associations to play an active role in
                       promoting consumer protection regarding non-bank credit institutions.
Description         The financial regulators have limited capacity to carry out prudential and financial
                    supervision, let alone consumer protection. Similar constraints exist in consumer
NGOs, whereas courts are generally distrusted.


Paragraph (a)
OJK is the prudential/financial and market conduct supervisor for the multi-
finance and pawnshop segments (and for the microfinance institutions segment
starting in 2015). However, currently OJK’s resources and capacity to assume its
consumer protection role are quite limited. Even though there is a Consumer
Protection and Education Division within OJK’s Policy Department Directorate,
this division only has around 6 staff members and focuses on developing the
overall consumer protection policy, legal and regulatory framework, as well as
receiving consumer complaints. The consumer protection supervisory role is
currently the responsibility of the line or sector departments. In practical terms,
this means that the same department and staff that conduct regular prudential
supervision are also responsible for consumer protection supervision. These
arrangements may create situations where consumer protection is under-
supervised or relegated to second priority within the supervisory work, or where a
consumer protection recommendation is quickly overlooked or dismissed due to
its potential effects on prudential indicators of a company. Furthermore, the
number of staff currently working on prudential supervision is already low for the
number of institutions they need to cover. This situation will be aggravated when
OJK starts supervising microfinance institutions. These limitations in terms of
human resources make the implementation of consumer protection an even
more challenging task to assume.
In addition, currently there are no guidelines yet on how staff should conduct
consumer protection supervision. Such guidelines are particularly important
given that the profile and expertise of the current sector supervisors fit the
requirements for a prudential supervisor (for example, with more emphasis on
quantitative than qualitative skills) and not necessarily those for consumer
protection, and given that it is not uncommon for prudential supervisors to not
know about what consumer protection entails or to not consider the importance
of consumer protection for financial stability.
In the cooperative segment, the MC is planning to undertake a consumer
protection supervisory role through its Monitoring Institution for Savings and
Loans Cooperatives, and to staff such institution with appropriate resources for
all its responsibilities. The exact mechanisms for conducting monitoring in remote
areas are still being developed, but it is expected that the system of delegated
supervision will continue to be used. The MC has already issued detailed
Guidelines for Supervision of Savings and Loans Cooperatives and Guidelines
for Supervision of Islamic Financial Cooperatives, which are required to be
applied by the MC and local government authorities. Both focus on financial and
prudential supervision, and include just a few provisions related to consumer
protection issues (e.g. affordability assessments, confidentiality, consumer
training). These guidelines would have to be either amended or replaced by new
ones that reflect the role of the new Monitoring Institution. In either case, it would
be important to clearly define the legal responsibilities of the institutions involved
in consumer protection supervision (including clarification of the roles of the
Ministry of Trade and OJK), and to add a new section focused on consumer
protection.


Paragraph (b)
According to Article 45 of the Consumer Law, consumers who have suffered
damages may file charges against the entrepreneurs through a court under the
jurisdiction of the General Court or through an alternative dispute resolution
body. The settlement of the dispute may be conducted in a court of outside the
court based on the voluntary choice of the parties to the dispute. However, if
dispute resolution efforts have been carried out outside the court, charges can
only filed in the court if such efforts are declared unsuccessful by one or both
parties in dispute.
Additionally, according to Article 56, in cases where consumers have presented
complaints to the BPSK, the parties may submit an appeal to the District Court
(which is the lowest hierarchy in the General Court system) at the latest within 14
working days after receiving the notification of such decision.
In general, it is understood that neither consumers nor financial organizations
trust the courts. The reasons cited include that the court processes are slow,
expensive and unpredictable and are handled by low-paid judges.


Paragraph (c)
The Guidelines for Standards of Operational Management of Savings and Loans
Cooperatives recognizes the importance of developing promotional policies in
order to introduce, or improve awareness of, the activities of savings and loans
cooperatives. The Guidelines indicate that these cooperatives may use different
types of media for promotional purposes, including electronic media (TV, radio),
printed media (e.g. newspapers, magazines, brochures, leaflets) and community
services.


Some consumers have asked YLKI or other formal consumer associations for
help, and they have contacted financial institutions to correct wrongdoing. OJK
and the Ministry of Trade have been receptive to the actions of YLKI and similar
consumer associations, for example by participating in consumer awareness
campaigns or events (e.g. a campaign carried out last year encouraging
consumers to present complaints regarding credit cards). YLKI has also shared
with OJK information about the complaints they receive regarding business
practices and contract terms of multi-finance companies. Annually YLKI also
organizes a press conference to disseminate the main activities they undertook
during the year, and share information about the main types of complaints they
receive.


The financial supervisors and the financial industry recognize the important role
of consumer organizations. This role can include promoting consumer
awareness, informing clients about their rights and obligations, providing advice
to consumers, and even working as facilitators or mediators for the resolution of
complaints.
                 However, it is also worth noting that some recent abusive practices at the NGO
                 level raise concerns. The mission team was advised of a surge of informal
                 associations that claim they represent consumers, more specifically multi-finance
                 customers. These NGOs aim to take possession of the car or motorcycle that
                 was subject of the financial agreement and then exert pressure against a multi-
                 finance company to obtain money and settle the debt. Reportedly, some of these
                 associations have carried out vandalistic protests inside premises of multi-
                 finance companies and have been promoting an inadequate payment culture
                 even by contacting customers soon after they have their contracts approved by a
                 multi-finance company.
Recommendation   OJK should strengthen its resources and processes for supervision of consumer
                 protection issues in the NBCI sector. The relevant unit should be responsible for
                 proposing specific guidelines or regulations in areas such as disclosure of
                 information to consumers, business-to-consumer practices, complaints handling
                 and disputes resolution, customer account handling, debt collection, and data
                 protection. The unit should also prepare manuals for offsite and onsite
                 supervision of consumer protection; participate in offsite and onsite supervision
                 (eventually developing a risk-based conduct-of-business supervision
                 methodology); prepare consumer protection supervision reports; propose
                 corrective measures, sanctions or fines; require and analyze reports from
                 supervised institutions on consumer protection issues, including reports on
                 complaints. In order to prevent or minimize conflicts of interests, the consumer
                 protection unit would ideally be located outside the prudential supervision
                 department and report to a different Commission member. The consumer
                 protection unit should at a minimum prepare a report discussing and analyzing
                 key consumer protection issues, to be included in OJK’s Annual Report.


                 There should also be clarification of the consumer protection supervisory role of
                 MC’s Monitoring Institution for Savings and Loans Cooperatives


                 Financial regulators, in association with the industry associations, should develop
                 capacity building and training programs for judges of the District Courts in charge
                 of dealing with financial consumer complaints. Information on the financial sector
                 cases dealt with by the District Courts should be shared with the financial
                 regulators.


                 Financial regulators should develop a mechanism to receive inputs or comments
                 from consumer organizations before they issue policies, laws or regulations
                 dealing with consumer protection issues. Once these instruments are finalized,
                 financial regulators should inform consumer organizations about the changes in
                 the financial consumer protection framework, so that they can understand those
                 changes and transmit correct information to consumers, especially low-income
                 consumers. It will also be important for financial regulators to be informed of the
                 number and types of complaints against financial institutions that the consumer
                 associations receive.
                    Consideration could be given to developing a consumer awareness campaign on
                    the risks of dealing with non-regulated consumer organizations that may just take
                    advantage of consumers in need and undermine the consumers’ payments
                    culture.
Good Practice A.4   Registration of Non-Bank Credit Institutions
                    All financial institutions that extend any type of credit to households
                    should be registered with a financial supervisory authority.
Description         According to the Ministry of Finance Regulation on Finance Companies, all multi-
                    finance companies must secure a business license as financing company from
                    the Minister prior to commencing business (Article 8). Although this responsibility
                    has been transferred to OJK as per the OJK Law of 2011, the licensing
                    requirements are still the same. The licensing application must include (or
                    attach):
                         the deed of establishment of the company;
                         data about executive directors and board members, including identification
                          documents, statements that provide some assurance of their fitness and
                          properness (e.g. statements as to credit worthiness, the lack of a criminal
                          record and as to the lack of a bankruptcy history); and evidence of
                          operational experience in the banking or multi-finance sector for at least 2
                          years;
                         data about shareholders or members;
                         information about their operational system and procedures, organizational
                          structure and personnel;
                         a copy of evidence of the settlement of paid-up capital in the form of a time
                          deposit at a commercial bank;
                         their action plan for the first two years;
                         evidence of operational readiness;
                         a joint business agreement between foreigner and Indonesian parties in
                          the case of joint venture;
                         operational guidelines for application of KYC principles.


                    The licensing authority (now OJK) must approve or reject the application in not
                    more than 60 days after receiving all documents.


                    The Cooperatives Law indicates that a cooperative needs to submit in writing its
                    application for a cooperative deed to the MC (Article 10) and then obtain
                    authorization from the MC to operate as a legal entity (Article 13). The
                    application basically comprises the cooperative’s Articles of Association, and
                    basic information of: the founding individual (full name, place and date of birth,
                    residence and occupation) or founding cooperative in the case of secondary
                    cooperative (name, domicile, full address and number and date of authorization
                    of cooperatives); and the Board of Trustees (name, date and place of birth,
                    residence and occupation of trustees).


                    The Articles of Association must contain the name and domicile of the
                    cooperative; membership area; objectives, business activities, type of
                 cooperative; provisions on capital; procedures for appointment, dismissal and
                 replacement of supervisors and administrators; rights and obligations of
                 Members, Trustees and Board; provisions on membership requirements and
                 member meetings, use of surplus in operational results, dissolution, sanctions
                 and member dependents. It is worth noting that the word “cooperative” cannot be
                 used by an entity that is not established in accordance with this Law (Article 17).
                 In addition, savings and loans cooperatives are required to include in their
                 application: i) work plan for at least the first three years, ii) administration and
                 bookkeeping arrangements, iii) names and bios of key staff, and iv) list of
                 working facilities (Article 3 of Regulation on Cooperatives’ Activities).


                 Village credit providers are currently outside the remit of financial regulators. A
                 group of them correspond to traditional institutions based on customary law and
                 recognized by local authorities. A second group consists mostly of local
                 government-based microfinance institutions. With the entry into force of the MFI
                 Law, village credit providers that are not based on customary law will have to
                 obtain a microfinance institution license from OJK. To obtain such a license, the
                 microfinance institution must at least comply with requirements on organizational
                 structure and management, capital, ownership and feasibility of their work plan.


                 A BMT only needs to receive authorization from the Ministry of Home Affairs to
                 start operations, according to the Letter of the Minister of Home Affairs No.
                 538/PKK/IV/1997 issued on 14 April 1997 regarding the Legal Status of Sharia
                 Financial Institutions. It is estimated that only about 10% of the existing BMTs
                 are also registered with the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs. The MFI Law
                 seems to imply that BMTs will have to be licensed by OJK as microfinance
                 institution to operate as such.
Recommendation   Consideration should be given to providing the soon-to-be-established MC’s
                 Monitoring Institution for Savings and Loans Cooperatives a specific role in the
                 review of applications to operate as savings and loans cooperative and to
                 including some minimum fit and proper requirements for cooperative founders
                 (e.g. not being involved in fraudulent activities or criminal offences, or
                 participation in any previously bankrupt institutions).


                 OJK and MC should clarify who will be responsible for registering BMTs in the
                 context of the entry into force of the Cooperatives Law and the MFI Law. In any
                 case, either law should explicitly state that BMTs must be registered in order to
                 offer financial products and services. Alternatively (but less ideally), this
                 clarification could be included in a specialized BMT law, along with provisions on
                 periodic reports on the situation of the BMTs that should be submitted to the
                 relevant authority.


                 Regarding village credit providers, it is also important that financial regulators
                 have a clear idea of the size of the segment in terms of assets, members,
                 outreach, of the different types of village providers. Consequently, even though
                 the MFI Law explicitly excludes traditional village credit providers from its
                    application, consideration could be given to require OJK to maintain a register of
                    such providers, with the support of provincial authorities.



SECTION B           DISCLOSURE AND SALES PRACTICES

Good Practice B.1   Information on Customers
                    a. When making a recommendation to a consumer, a non-bank credit
                       institution should request sufficient information from the consumer to
                       enable the institution to render an appropriate product or service to
                       that consumer. If the consumer takes up a product or service, such
                       information should be recorded and filed.
                    b. The extent of information the non-bank credit institution gathers
                       regarding a consumer should:
                       (i) be commensurate with the nature and complexity of the product or
                            service either being proposed to or sought by the consumer; and
                       (ii) enable the institution to provide a professional service to the
                            consumer in accordance with that consumer’s capacity.
Description         The detailed regulations on customer information gathering focus only on
                    aspects of financial integrity, and are applicable to multi-finance companies.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    Regarding the multi-finance and pawnshop segments, the FCP Regulation
                    mentions that financial providers have the right to obtain, in good faith, accurate,
                    honest, clear and not misleading information and/or documents about customers.


                    For multi-finance companies, the Minister of Finance Regulation on Know Your
                    Customer Principles for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (Regulation on KYC for
                    NBFIs) and its complementary Bapepam-LK Regulation on Guidelines for the
                    Implementation of KYC Principles for Finance Companies (Regulation on KYC
                    for Finance Companies) addresses part of this Good Practice, from the
                    perspective of financial integrity. Article 7 of Regulation on KYC for NBFIs
                    requires multi-finance companies, before they issue a consumer contract
                    agreement, to request information on: the prospective customer’s background
                    and identity, the intent and purpose of the required financing facility, the financial
                    profile of the prospective customer, as well as other information that would help
                    with the identification of the profile of prospective customers, including previous
                    obligations with the multi-finance company.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    The Regulations on KYC for NBFIs and on KYC for Finance Companies allow for
                    the application of simplified customer due diligence procedures for low-risk
                    transactions. In the case of multi-finance companies, the relevant low-risk
                             transactions comprise financing of motor vehicles, electronic equipment and
                                                                                                    172
                             household appliances whose value does not exceed IDR 50 million . In such
                             cases, the only information that a multi-finance company is required to ask a
                             prospective individual customer from the perspective of AML/CFT risks would be:
                             full name, number of identity document (with evidence), residential address listed
                             in the identity document, current residential address including telephone number,
                             place and date of birth.


                             For other customers that do not represent high financial integrity risk, the
                             required information also includes evidence of employment, income and source
                             of funds, intended use of funds, name and bank account number of prospective
                             customers, if any, and other documents that allow the multi-finance company to
                             be able to know the profile of prospective customers.
Recommendation               NBCI regulators should include specific provisions in the regulatory framework
                             for NBCIs that incorporate the requirement for financial officers to obtain
                             sufficient information from consumers that allow them to offer an appropriate
                             product or service.


                             Although the AML/CFT requirements cover some of the basic information
                             needed, this Good Practice goes beyond this KYC requirements and deals with
                             the requirement to understand the needs of a customer before offering him/her a
                             product. This specific issue should be included in the regulations for all types of
                             NBCIs. Consideration should also be given to including this requirement in
                             guidelines for third-party auto dealers.
Good Practice B.2            Affordability
                              a. When a non-bank credit institution makes a recommendation regarding
                                 a product or service to a consumer, the product or service it offers to
                                 that consumer should be in line with the need of the consumer.
                              b. Sufficient information on the product or service should be provided to
                                 the consumer to enable him or her to select the most suitable and
                                 affordable product or service.
                              c. When a non-bank credit institution offers a new credit product or
                                 service that significantly increases the amount of debt assumed by the
                                 consumer, the consumer’s credit worthiness should be properly
                                 assessed.

Description                  The multi-finance companies and pawnshops are the only NBCIs required to
                             consider the customer’s needs and affordability when recommending a product
                             or service. There are difficulties across the NBCI sector in undertaking a
                             creditworthiness assessment, given the absence of a comprehensive credit
                             reporting system.


                             Paragraph (a)
                             Regarding the multi-finance and pawnshop segments, Article 16 of the FCP


172
      Also considered as low-risk transactions are those where the customer is a public sector company.
Regulation requires financial providers to pay attention to the suitability of the
products and/or services offered to consumers vis-à-vis their needs and
capabilities.


Paragraph (b)
In relation to this Good Practice, Article 10 of the FCP Regulation requires multi-
finance companies and pawnshops (and the other OJK-regulated institutions) to
inform customers on the cost of any product and/or service that is offered by the
provider. This information is relevant and useful, but not enough for consumers
to make a fully informed choice on the most suitable product for them.


Paragraph (c)
Article 10 of the FCP Regulation addresses part of this Good Practice, by
prohibiting financial providers (e.g. multi-finance and pawnshops) from providing
automatic facilities that result in additional costs to the consumer without having
the explicit consent of the consumer. Indirectly related to this Good Practice are
two regulations on down-payment requirements for automotive and motorcycle
financing issued in June 2012. The Ministry of Finance regulation set higher
minimum down payments for multi-finance loans: 20% for financing of
motorcycles and productive cars, and 25% for non-productive cars; whereas the
Bank Indonesia (BI) Regulation set the limits of down payments for bank loans at
25% for motorcycles, 20% for productive cars and 30% for non-productive cars.
These measures were a reaction to some initial signs that consumer credits for
the purchase of cars and motorcycles were granted with little attention to the real
payment capacity of borrowers, who started to show signs of over-indebtedness.
Still, the regulatory framework for multi-finance companies does not explicitly
require that financial providers carry out a creditworthiness assessment of the
client.


In the cooperative segment, Article 93 of the Cooperatives Law requires savings
and loans cooperatives to apply prudence when engaging with a client; more
specifically, these cooperatives are required to assess the consumer’s financial
capacity and ability to repay the loan in accordance with the contract’s
conditions, and not to grant loans that may harm the interests of the cooperatives
and its members. Similarly, the Regulation on Savings and Loans Cooperative
Activities requires savings and loan cooperatives and savings and loans units to
adhere to principles of sound lending and assess the consumer’s financial
capacity and repayment ability.


Both of the above legislative instruments recognize the authority of the
cooperative’s members meeting to set a maximum loan limit for individual
members. In addition, the Guidelines for Standards of Operational Management
of Savings and Loans Cooperatives have some provisions regarding affordability.
For example, Article 19 indicates that one of the requirements for prospective
borrowers is not to have outstanding debts with the cooperative or with other
parties; Article 21 indicates that the amount of consumer loans may be up to 3
times the value of savings and not more than 30% of the prospective borrower’s
income; whereas Article 23 states that the provision of collateral is not an
absolute requirement for the granting of a loan, but that attention must be paid to
the ability of the prospective borrower to pay back the loan. Similar provisions
are included in the Guidelines for Supervision of Islamic Financial Cooperatives.


The aforementioned Guidelines for Standards of Operational Management of
Savings and Loans Cooperatives also include guidelines on Standards for
Analysis of Loans, and emphasize the need to undertake two types of analysis to
have confidence that the loan given will be paid back by the borrower:
   Qualitative analysis or analysis of willingness to pay, which includes
    evaluation of the borrower’s character and commitment to the cooperative’s
    obligations;
   Quantitative analysis or analysis of the ability to pay, which includes
    evaluation of sources of funds to meet obligations, as well as living
    expenses.


Regarding this Good Practice, the existence of a comprehensive credit reporting
system would help financial institutions to carry out an adequate creditworthiness
assessment. Currently there is only one credit registry operating in Indonesia, the
Biro Informasi Kredit (BIK) at BI (also known as the Debtor Information System).
According to the BI Regulation on the Debtor Information System, a multi-finance
company or pawnshop may become a reporting entity within the BIK (Article 4) –
whereas commercial banks, nonbank credit card providers and large rural banks
must become reporting entities. Still, even if a multi-finance company or
pawnshop decides to report to the BIK, it may or may not request debtor
information before it grants credit to a customer.


Currently, however only a handful of NBCIs participate in the BIK. Incidental
information indicates that the requirements set by BI, especially IT requirements
and some customer data field requirements, have been hard to meet by NBCIs.
As an alternative to the BIK, some industry associations have developed informal
mechanisms to share information about debtors.


APPI has promoted the exchange of information about borrowers’ exposure
amongst multi-finance companies. Some of these companies, concerned with
multiple borrowings by their existing or potential clients, routinely exchange
information about borrowers on a voluntary basis. Currently, Asbindo is collecting
data from its BMT members and working on a beta version of a debtor database.
Although it is good that the industry has tried to come up with solutions to
overcome the limited credit history information available in Indonesia, these
initiatives have several weaknesses. For example, the lack of information of the
total exposure of a borrower in the financial sector, a lack of clarity as to the
procedures on how to correct wrong data, and the absence of confidentiality and
privacy rules. Also, the voluntary nature of this data exchange greatly limits its
effectiveness. This situation highlights the need to have an operative and
comprehensive credit reporting system in Indonesia.
Recommendation      Savings and loans cooperatives, and village providers, should be required by
                    regulation to provide a consumer with an offer of a financial product or service
                    that is in line with the needs of the consumer.
                    Also, all NBCIs should be required by their respective regulators to offer the
                    consumer sufficient information for him/her to select the most suitable and
                    affordable product or service; and to adequately assess the consumer’s
                    creditworthiness when offering a new credit product.
                    OJK should also encourage all its regulated entities to participate in the BIK.
                    Also, OJK should coordinate with BI about ways to mitigate the technical issues
                    and complexities that seem to currently exist in the BIK and that are discouraging
                    NBCIs to participate in the system.
Good Practice B.3   Cooling-off Period
                    a. Unless explicitly waived by the consumer in writing, a non-bank credit
                       institution should provide the consumer a cooling-off period of a
                       reasonable number of days immediately following the signing of an
                       agreement between the institution and the consumer.
                    b. On his or her written notice to the non-bank credit institution during
                       the cooling- off period, the consumer should be permitted to cancel or
                       treat the agreement as null and void without penalty to the consumer
                       of any kind.
Description         There is no explicit cooling-off period provision in the legal or regulatory
                    framework for NBCIs in Indonesia. Article 7 of the Consumer Law states that
                    entrepreneurs are obliged “to provide the opportunity to the consumers to test
                    and or/try on certain goods and/or services, and to provide warranty and/or
                    guarantee on the produced and/or traded goods”. This provision could be
                    interpreted as a cooling-off period that would allow consumers to “test or try”
                    financial products, but this interpretation is not self-evident.
                    In terms of business practices, some NBCIs do allow some type of cooling-off
                    period, but the extent of period varies from institution to institution. Other NBCIs
                    do not offer such a period, and some indicate that this would not be a useful
                    provision due to the rush that consumers show in terms of needing quick
                    disbursement of funds rather than asking for time to reflect on the contract.
Recommendation      The financial regulators should require NBCIs to provide consumers with a
                    cooling-off period that is reasonable, taking into account the term of the product
                    (e.g. a cooling-off period of 5 days for 1-month credits). Additionally, NBCI
                    debtors should ideally always have the right to prepay any credit provided,
                    subject to the payment of reasonable administrative fees and reasonable finance
                    costs in the case of fixed rate loans.
Good Practice B.4   Bundling and Tying Clauses
                    a. As much as possible, non-bank credit institutions should avoid the use
                       of tying clauses in contracts that restrict the choice of consumers.
                    b. In particular, whenever a borrower is required by a non-bank credit
                       institution to purchase any product, including an insurance policy, as a
                       pre-condition for receiving a loan, the borrower should be free to
                       choose the provider of the product and this information should be
                       made known to the borrower.
              c. Also, whenever a non-bank credit institution contracts with a merchant
                 as a distribution channel for its credit contracts, no exclusionary
                 dealings should be permitted.

Description   Paragraphs (a) and (b)
              Multi-finance and Pawnshop Segments
              Tying refers to the sale of two or more products or services together as a single
              product and refusal of the seller to separate the products and sell each of them
              separately (or allow the buyer to buy one of them from another seller). This
              practice is addressed by Article 18(2) of the FCP Regulation, which prohibits a
              financial provider from compelling a consumer to purchase other product(s) or
              service(s) being offered as part of a package bundled to the original product or
              service requested by the consumer. As mentioned above, the FCP Regulation
              will come into force in August 2014.
              Bundling refers to the sale of two or more products or services together as a
              package when the products can also be purchased separately. This practice is
              allowed by the FCP Regulation (Article 18), which states that if a financial
              provider sells a product or service together with another product or service in a
              single package, the consumer is free to choose other provider of the bundled
              product or service.
              Despite what appears to be a proposed prohibition of tying practices, they are
              not uncommon in the auto and motor finance market. Generally consumers who
              take out loans from multi-finance companies are required to purchase life
              insurance—and consumers often do not receive full information of the
              commissions that they will have to pay for that matter. Furthermore, in some
              cases the consumer is not given the option to choose the insurer (which in some
              cases belongs to the same group as the multi-finance company), while the
              insurance product is a requisite to obtain credit.


              Non-bank Credit Institutions
              The Competition Law includes a general provision on closed contracts that
              addresses elements of this Good Practice. Article 15 prohibits entrepreneurs
              from “making any contract with other parties that imposes terms by which the
              parties receiving certain goods and/or services must be willing to purchase
              goods and/or other services from the supplier company .” This provision would in
              theory prohibit tying clauses which “ impose” on the consumer the obligation to
              purchase another financial product offered by a financial institution in addition to
              the product initially requested by the consumer.


              Paragraph (c)
              This Good Practice is not explicitly covered in the legal/regulatory framework of
              Indonesia, and this may explain the presence of tying practices in the auto and
              motor finance market. In this market, third-party auto dealers play the role of
              providing the first level of information about financing arrangements to
              consumers. The multi-finance companies would offer bundled or tied products for
              consumers, but the dealer would theoretically give the consumer the option to
              choose the best financing option among different companies’ offers. Given that
                    the multi-finance companies eventually will disburse the funds directly to the
                    dealer, they may consider that the responsibility of giving consumers the right to
                    choose relies on the dealers, not on them. It is worth noting, however, that there
                    are multi-finance companies that offer multiple insurance options to consumers
                    or may even accept a policy that the consumer requests. On the other hand,
                    there seem to be multiple practices of exclusionary dealings especially in the
                    cases where the multi-finance company and/or the insurer and/or the dealer
                    have some type of close business relationship, including belonging to the same
                    group.
Recommendation      Given the current tying practices in the multi-finance sector, especially in terms of
                    the forced requirement to buy an insurance product for auto or motor loans, even
                    from a single provider, it is recommended that a specific provision on this topic
                    be included in the financial consumer protection guidelines for the sector or in
                    the FCP Regulation.
                    Tying practices regarding credit insurance requirements seem to also be
                    occurring in the financial cooperatives sector, although to a lesser extent.
                    Concurrently, MC should also include an explicit provision on tying practices
                    especially regarding insurance requirements in an MC regulation or guideline.
                    The aforementioned provisions on tying practices should prohibit the financial
                    institution to require the purchase of non-related or non-essential products or
                    services as a condition of providing a financial product or service. In those cases
                    where the Indonesian market conditions make it inevitable to require insurance
                    as a mechanism to guarantee certain types of credit, this exception needs to be
                    clearly mentioned in the tying provisions. At the same time, the tying provision
                    should always require that the NBCIs give consumers the right to choose the
                    provider of any additional product, and to provide consumers with a list of at least
                    three providers if the NBCI wants to recommend a specific provider (e.g. an
                    insurer). Additionally, the tying provisions should indicate that the NBCIs need to
                    give a proportionate refund of the applicable premium if the consumer pays out a
                    loan early.
                    Consideration should also be given to issuing rules for third-party auto dealers
                    regarding disclosure of information of full financing arrangements, including
                    multiple options for credit providers and insurance policies that may be available
                    for the consumer. For this purpose, the Ministry of Trade would coordinate with
                    OJK.
Good Practice B.5   Key Facts Statement
                    a. Non-bank credit institutions should have a Key Facts Statement for
                       each type of account, loan or other products or services.
                    b. The Key Facts Statement should be written in plain language,
                       summarizing in a page or two the key terms and conditions of the
                       specific financial product or service, and allowing consumers the
                       possibility of easily comparing products offered by different
                       institutions.
Description         The current legal and regulatory framework for financial consumer protection
                    does not include any specific requirement about the minimum information that
                    should be disclosed to consumers about the different types of financial products,
                    or any specific requirement to provide a short form Key Facts Statement that
                 highlights the most important information and features of a product.


                 However there are important legal principles on disclosure reflected in the
                 Indonesian law. At a general level, the Consumer Law recognizes the
                 consumer’s right “to obtain correct, clear end honest information on the condition
                 and warranty of the goods and/or services”. Article 4 of the FCP Regulation also
                 has a general requirement for financial providers to “provide and/or convey
                 information about products and/or services that is accurate, fair, clear and not
                 misleading”. More specifically, Article 7 indicates that financial providers shall
                 use simple terms, phrases and/or sentences in Indonesian language that are
                 easily understood by consumers, when providing information to help consumers
                 make decisions. Moreover, Article 8 could be interpreted as laying the grounds
                 for the development of Key Facts Statements since it requires financial service
                 providers to provide a written summary of information on products and/or
                 services, including their benefits, risks and costs as well as their terms and
                 conditions. Additionally, the MFI Law includes a general provision on disclosure
                 that indicates that microfinance institutions should provide information on the
                 “terms and conditions that need to be known by depositors and borrowers ”
                 (Article 24).
                 However, It is worth noting that some NBCIs already offer some type of Key
                 Facts Statement that summarizes the key terms and conditions of the contract in
                 one or two pages and in simple terms.
Recommendation   NBCIs should be required to provide consumers with standardized “Key Facts
                 Statements” that summarize in plain language the key terms and conditions of
                 specific contract agreements and that allow comparison of offers by different
                 providers. To ensure comparability, the standardized 1-2 page Key Facts
                 Statements should be consistent for all types of institutions that provide the same
                 financial product (e.g. general purpose consumer loans by banks, multi-finance
                 companies, and savings and loans cooperatives). The Key Facts Statement
                 could thus be progressively developed for different types of basic financial
                 products. For example, Key Facts Statement for auto or motor loans could be
                 developed first by OJK, in close collaboration with the multi-finance association
                 (and any other NBCI representative which may have already developed a key
                 fact statement) and the banking association, and with inputs from consumer
                 associations. Other Key Facts Statement could be developed later or in parallel
                 (for example, for basic saving accounts or general purpose consumer loans).
                 The Key Facts Statement for a consumer loan could include this information: i)
                 the total amount of the credit; ii) the amounts of monthly payments; iii) the term of
                 the credit; iv) the total amount of payments to be made; v) the first payment due
                 date; vi) all fees, including prepayment and overdue penalty fees, taxes, and any
                 other charges that could be incurred; vii) the real cost of credit in monetary
                 terms; viii) an indicator of the effective annual rate of charges (see Good Practice
                 B.6 below); ix) if the loan is indexed in foreign currency, a clear indication of the
                 exchange rate to be used to calculate disbursements and repayments; x) any
                 collateral that is required to maintain the credit; xi) if the credit is used to finance
                 a product, the cash price of the product without financing charges; xii) warnings
                 on key risks assumed by the consumer, such as foreign currency risk, risk of
                    having negative information in the credit bureau, risk of losing a home or other
                    collateral; xiii) mechanisms for recourse available to the consumer in the event of
                    a complaint.
                    It would also be helpful to undertake consumer testing of Key Facts Statements.
                    This would be in order to make sure that their content is easily understood by
                    consumers and that the format covers all key information needed by them.
                    The format of a Key Facts Statement should be available on the website and in
                    the premises of the financial institutions, preferably filled in with information of a
                    typical consumer loan. This would allow consumers to become familiar with the
                    terms and start comparing information early in the decision process. It is also
                    important that key facts statements be available in the language most spoken in
                    the location where the financial product or service is offered.
                    Key Facts Statements for different products have been developed in numerous
                    countries. This includes Australia, Philippines, New Zealand, South Africa, the
                    EU, USA, Ghana, Mexico, among other countries.
                    In addition to the Key Facts Statement, OJK, MC, provincial authorities and
                    industry associations should consider collaborating in the development of a
                    standardized format for the payment schedule of basic credit products.
                    It is, however, important that any disclosure format requirement be proportionate
                    in the sense of reflecting the risks of the relevant activity, the literacy level of the
                    relevant consumers and do not impose costs which outweigh the benefits. For
                    example, the requirements imposed on small financial institutions such as village
                    credit providers should be a simplified version of those applicable to customers
                    of commercial banks. If the financial product is very simple, a standardized,
                    simple and clear payment schedule may be the only disclosure format that is
                    needed.
Good Practice B.6   Advertising and Sales Materials
                    a. Non-bank credit institutions should ensure that their advertising and
                       sales materials and procedures do not mislead customers.
                    b. All advertising and sales materials should be easily readable and
                       understandable by the general public.
                    c. Non-bank credit institutions should be legally responsible for all
                       statements made in advertising and sales materials (i.e. be subject to
                       the penalties under the law for making any false or misleading
                       statements).
Description         Paragraph (a)
                    There are a number of provisions which in effect require insurers to ensure that
                    their advertising and sales materials do not mislead consumers.
                    The Consumer Law contains wide ranging prohibitions applicable to “ advertising
                    agencies” on offering, promoting or advertising services which do not have the
                    features advertised or where the relevant advertisement etc. is misleading or
                    incorrect in relation to the price or other features (Articles 9-11). The difficulty
                    with these provisions is that it is not clear that financial service providers such as
                    insurers would be considered to be “advertising agencies”.


                    The Competition Law includes several provisions on advertising practices. For
example, Article 10 prohibits entrepreneurs from offering, promoting, advertising,
or providing incorrect or misleading statements regarding:
        the price or rate of certain goods and/or services (e.g. the interest rate of
         a consumer loan);
      the use of goods and/or services (e.g. misleading information on what a
         consumer loan can actually finance);
      the condition, warranty, guarantee, rights or compensation on certain
         goods and/or services (e.g. right to choose the provider of a credit
         insurance product);
      the discount or attractive prizes offered (e.g. the use of teaser interest
         rates to catch the attention of potential borrowers);
      the danger of using the goods and/ or services (e.g. the risk of
         purchasing a car through an auto loan and then having the car
         repossessed by the credit provider if loan installments are not paid on
         time).
Article 17 also mentions specific advertising practices that are prohibited, some
of which could be clearly applicable to the financial sector:
      deceiving consumers on the quality, quantity, use and prices of goods
         and/or rates of the services and the punctuality of receiving the goods
         and/or services;
      deceiving the guarantee on certain goods and/or services
      providing incorrect, wrong or inaccurate information on goods and/or
         services;
      not providing information on the risks of using goods and/or services,
      exploiting an incident and/or someone without the permission from the
         authorized officials or the approval of the person concerned;
      violating the ethics and/or legal provisions on advertising.


The FCP Regulation also provides that a financial services provider shall
“provide and/or convey information about products and/or services that is
accurate, fair, clear and not misleading” (Article 4) and shall not use marketing
strategies that “harm the consumers by taking advantage of consumers who do
not have other options in making decisions ” (Article 17). The meaning of the
words in quotes is somewhat ambiguous as it seems to imply that the prohibition
can only apply where the only source of information available to the consumer is
the advertising material in question. We think it unlikely that such a restrictive
interpretation was intended. The issue may, of course, be one of translation;
Apart from these important general provisions on advertising practices, there are
no specific provisions related to advertising sales or materials in the current legal
and regulatory framework for consumer protection in the NBCI sector. For
example, there is no requirement for NBCIs to properly disclose information on
interest rates and cost of credit in their advertising and marketing materials.


Paragraph (b)
There are no specific provisions dealing with this Good Practice.


Paragraph (c)
Article 20 of the Competition Law indicates that “entrepreneurs in the advertising
business are responsible for the advertisement they produce and all the
                    consequences caused by the advertisement.” At the same time, however, the
                    multi-finance companies and pawnshop are deemed responsible to the
                    consumer for actions taken by third parties who act for the benefit of the
                    business of these providers (Article 30 of the FCP Regulation).
                    In terms of business practices, there are indications that advertising information
                    is not clear and in many cases is misleading, disclosing very low interest rates
                    that do not include commissions and fees which, once factored in, make the cost
                    of credit rate much higher in actual terms.
Recommendation      OJK and the MC should issue regulations dealing with advertising and marketing
                    materials in the NBCI sector, following this specific Good Practice. These
                    regulations could start by applying key concepts included in the Competition Law
                    (e.g., unfair, misleading and false advertising) to the particularities of the NBCI
                    sector.
                    The regulations should also provide that every time NBCIs include any
                    information on interest rates in their advertisements and marketing materials,
                    they must also prominently disclose the effective interest rate (if this is not the
                    advertised interest rate). The financial regulators should define the method of
                    calculation of interest rates (including whether the declining balance or flat
                    method is used) to secure basic comparability of product offers.
                    Consideration should also be given to including a requirement for disclosure of a
                    total cost of credit interest rate which shows as a single rate the applicable
                    interest rate and mandatory fees (such as a loan application fee) and charges
                    (such as for a credit- life insurance premium). This information should also be
                    included in the terms and conditions disclosed to a customer.
                    It would also be useful for the financial regulators to strengthen coordination with
                    the Competition Commission, in order to analyze the status of advertising
                    practices in the financial sector, including in the segment of auto and motor
                    financing.
Good Practice B.7   General Practices
                    Specific rules on disclosure and sales practices should be included in the
                    non-bank credit institutions’ code of conduct and monitored by the
                    relevant supervisory authority.
Description         As mentioned above, no industry codes of conduct have been developed.
                    However, as mentioned in Good Practice A.2, the existing Code of Conduct for
                    the state-owned pawnshop obliges employees to provide information that is
                    correct, accurate and timely, according to the law. The Code also includes a
                    chapter on conflicts of interest that obliges employees to refuse any prizes,
                    payments, benefits or discounts from customers, vendors or partners; and to not
                    give any present, bribe or prize to others with the objective of influence another
                    party to do something.
                    An important disclosure requirement included in the FCP Regulation is that
                    financial providers must include in any offer or sale of products and/or service a
                    statement saying that it is registered and supervised by OJK (Article 20).
                    In terms of current potentially harmful disclosure and sales practices, it is worth
                    noting the existence of aggressive distant sales practices. Consumer
                    representatives have indicated their concern on the surge of telemarketing
                    practices, which offer financial products over the phone. Apparently it is
                    becoming easier to obtain the telephone information of individuals and some
                    financial institutions are aggressively trying to sell quickly approved, short-term
                    loans and credit cards over the telephone. Although these practices are not yet
                    that common in the NBCI sector due to the nature of products that are being
                    currently offered, these practices could be quite harmful for low-income and
                    poorly informed consumers. The FCP Regulation does include a provision on this
                    topic, which prohibits multi-finance companies, pawnshops and other providers
                    from offering products and/or services to consumers and/or the community
                    through means of private communication without consumer consent (Article 19).
                    However, in practical terms consumers would be just requested to sign their
                    consent as part of the contract without being completely aware of what the
                    consent is about.
                    On a more basic level, it is also worth to note that several multi-finance
                    companies and other NBCIs do not automatically give a consumer a copy of the
                    contract they have signed with the NBCI. In many cases they will provide a copy
                    of the contract for free if the consumer asks for it, but would not offer it
                    automatically.
Recommendation      As guidelines are developed under the FCP Regulation, it will be important to
                    include key principles on disclosure and sales practices.
                    These principles should cover fair treatment, free choice, transparency and
                    disclosure of information (including disclosure of requirements to obtain a
                    financial product or to become a cooperative member), as well as on the
                    responsible use of telemarketing and limits on the sharing and use of customer
                    personal data. The guidelines should also stress the importance of disclosing the
                    authority that regulates the NBCI, as well as the industry association the NBCI
                    belongs to. These provisions should also be reflected in any code of conduct
                    which is developed.
                    All NBCIs should be required to give one free copy of the signed contract to the
                    customer. This should be a basic requirement enshrined in either a law or a
                    regulation, in addition to the code of conduct.
                    Once deposit insurance schemes for savings and loans cooperatives, BMTs,
                    microfinance institutions, village credit providers are constituted, NBCIs should
                    be required to provide clear information to consumers about their scheme. For
                    example, consumers should understand the amount and type of deposit that is
                    covered, the procedures that would have to be followed to use the insurance and
                    the contact information for the scheme’s administrator. The industry associations
                    and regulators should also indicate the list of the NBCIs that are covered by
                    deposit insurance.
Good Practice B.8   Disclosure of Financial Situation
                    a. The relevant supervisory authority should publish annual public
                       reports on the development, health, strength and penetration of the
                       non-bank credit institutions, either as a special report or as part of the
                       disclosure and accountability requirements under the law that governs
                       these.
                    b. Non-bank credit institutions should be required to disclose their
                       financial information to enable the general public to form an opinion
                     regarding the financial viability of the institution.

Description      Paragraph (a)
                 There is very scarce public information available on the state of the different
                 NBCI segments. OJK’s annual report includes a brief section on recent treds and
                 developments of the multi-finance segment, summarized in a couple of pages.
                 However, the last comprehensive document with information of the multi-finance
                 segment was published in 2011 by the previous supervisory authority. There is
                 no information at all on the number of multi-finance companies, how many offer
                 what type of products, their level of penetration, the types of clients, or statistical
                 series on key financial indicators to show the strength of the sector.
                 In the case of cooperatives, the MC publishes biannual statistical information of
                 the number of cooperatives, number of members, number of managers and of
                 employees, per province. Additional information such as the amount of capital
                 and size of business is included at the end of the year. However, there is no
                 specific information on the activities undertaken by savings and loan
                 cooperatives (the information of all types of cooperatives is presented in a
                 consolidated manner). There is also no information on financial indicators for the
                 segment


                 Paragraph (b)
                 Multi-finance companies are required to publish a summarized version of their
                 audited annual balance sheet and statement of profit and lossess in one daily
                 newspaper with wide circulation, no later than four months after the end of the
                 accounting year (Article 33 of Minister of Finance Regulation on Finance
                 Companies).


                 The pawnshop is required to publish its balance sheet and profit and loss
                 statement in a daily newspaper (Article 53 of Pawnshop Regulation), but there is
                 no specific requirement in terms of how many days after the end of the year.


                 Microfinance institutions are required by their sector law (Article 30) to publish
                 financial statements, but there is no specific details on how, and when this
                 information will have to be published.
Recommendation   OJK and MC should prepare detailed reports on the development, health,
                 strength and penetration of the multi-finance and financial cooperatives
                 segments respectively, including a time series of relevant financial indicators.
                 Once microfinance institutions and BMTs are fully regulated, similar reports
                 should be published about them. It would also be important for provincial
                 authorities to publish at least basic information on the state of the village credit
                 providers.
                 Requirements for the publication of financial statements of multi-finance
                 companies, pawnshop and microfinance institutions should be improved. In
                 particular, there should be clear deadlines for publication, and online publication
                 should also be required for multi-finance companies and large NBCIs which have
                 an operating institutional website.
SECTION C           CUSTOMER ACCOUNT HANDLING AND MAINTENANCE


Good Practice C.1   Statements
                    a. Unless a non-bank credit institution receives a customer’s prior signed
                       authorization to the contrary, the non-bank credit institution should
                       issue, and provide the customer with, a monthly statement regarding
                       every account the non-bank credit institution operates for the
                       customer.
                    b. Each such statement should: (i) set out all transactions concerning the
                       account during the period covered by the statement; and (ii) provide
                       details of the interest rate(s) applied to the account during the period
                       covered by the statement.
                    c. Each credit card statement should set out the minimum payment
                       required and the total interest cost that will accrue, if the cardholder
                       makes only the required minimum payment.
                    d. Each mortgage or other loan account statement should clearly indicate
                       the amount paid during the period covered by the statement, the total
                       outstanding amount still owing, the allocation of payment to the
                       principal and interest and, if applicable, the up-to-date accrual of taxes
                       paid.
                    e. A non-bank credit institution should notify a customer of long periods
                       of inactivity of any account of the customer and provide reasonable
                       final notice in writing to the customer if the funds are to be transferred
                       to the government.
                    f. When a customer signs up for paperless statements, such statements
                       should be in an easy-to-read and readily understandable format.
Description         The requirements of this Good Practice are met to a limited extent through the
                    FCP Regulation and relevant Guidelines. However there are gaps in the
                    requirements.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    For the multi-finance and pawnshop segments, the FCP Regulation requires
                    financial providers to provide a consumer with a statement on the balance and
                    transactions concerning the deposits, funds, assets, or obligations of a
                    consumer, accurately, timely and in a manner and means in accordance with the
                    agreement with the consumer (Article 27). However, there is no specific
                    reference to the periodicity of this statement.
                    For savings and loans cooperatives, the Guidelines for Standards of Operational
                    Management indicate that these cooperatives must notify the borrower about the
                    status of a loan, in terms of the balance of the principal and the interests paid;
                    and that a warning letter shall be sent immediately after a borrower is late in the
                    payment of an installment. However, the regulation is not specific in terms of the
                    periodicity or form of the notification of the status of a loan.


                    Paragraph (e)
                    The Guidelines for Supervision of Islamic Financial Cooperatives indicate that
                    deposits that are inactive for at least one year or another period determined by
                    the board must be closed automatically (Chapter III B).
                    Other paragraphs
                    There is no provision in the FCP Regulation or elsewhere related to the other
                    elements of this Good Practice.


                    NBCIs usually do not provide customers with regular statements of accounts.
                    Industry practice is to provide customers with a payments schedule or a
                    passbook that would be used to keep track of their payments. However,
                    borrowers may pay their monthly installment without presenting their payments
                    schedule and are not given any sort of document that informs the customer on
                    how the balance or interest of the credit was reduced. NBCIs would provide a
                    free copy of the schedule to the consumer if he/she requests it.
Recommendation      NBCI regulators should require NBCIs to provide simple periodic statements of
                    account to their customers. These statements might not need to be submitted to
                    the client’s mailing address if there is not an available address, but at a minimum
                    they should be available to the client on the payment due date in the premises of
                    the NBCI – and shown to the client when he/she pays the monthly-owed amount.


                    NBCI regulators should establish the period of inactivity of a customer account,
                    after which the customer should be given a final written notice indicating that the
                    funds are to be transferred to the government, in accordance with applicable law.
                    MC should amend the provision in the Guidelines for Supervision of Islamic
                    Financial Cooperatives accordingly, in order to add the requirement to notify the
                    customer instead of closing the inactive account automatically.


                    Further, statements should also be able to be provided electronically with the
                    consent of the customer. NBCI regulators should also require that, when a
                    customer signs up for paperless statements, such statements should be in an
                    easy-to-read and readily understandable format.
Good Practice C.2   Notification of Changes in Interest Rates and Non-Interest Charges
                    a. A customer of a non-bank credit institution should be notified in
                       writing by the non-bank credit institution of any change in:
                       (i) the interest rate to be paid or charged on any account of the
                            customer as soon as possible; and
                       (ii) a non-interest charge on any account of the customer a reasonable
                            period in advance of the effective date of the change.
                    b. If the revised terms are not acceptable to the customer, he or she
                       should have the right to exit the contract without penalty, provided
                       such right is exercised within a reasonable period.
                    c. The non-bank credit institution should inform the customer of the
                       foregoing right whenever a notice of change under paragraph a. is
                       made by the institution.
Description         This Good Practice is not satisfied in respect of cooperatives regulated by MC
                    and there is no requirement to inform customers of their right to exit a contract as
                    contemplated by paragraph (b).
                    Paragraph (a)
                    According to Article 12 of the FCP Regulation, the multi-finance and pawnshop
                    segments must notify the consumer no later than 30 business days before any
                    change in benefits, costs, risks, or terms and conditions set forth in the financial
                    product/service contract agreement is effective.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    Article 12 of the FCP Regulation also indicates that if the multi-finance or
                    pawnshop consumer does not agree with the changes to the financial products
                    and/or services (within 30 business days), he/she has the right to terminate the
                    products and/or services contract at no cost. This Article also specifies that
                    where a consumer has been given reasonable time to accept or reject changes
                    and fails to do so, a financial provider may consider that the consumer gave
                    his/her consent.


                    Paragraph (c)
                    Although the FCP Regulation recognizes the multi-finance or pawnshop
                    consumer’s right to not accept the changes made by the multi-finance company
                    and pawnshop, the Regulation does not require a financial provider to explicitly
                    inform the consumer of their right to exit the contract.


                    There is no consumer protection provision applicable to savings and loans
                    cooperatives regarding notification of changes in interest rates and non-interest
                    charges.
Recommendation      OJK should modify Article 12 of the FCP Regulation to include a requirement for
                    financial providers to explicitly inform the consumer of their right to exit the
                    contract. In any event, as a general rule borrowers should always have the right
                    to prepay their credit contract (see Good Practice B.3).


                    MC should also incorporate this Good Practice in its regulations for savings and
                    loan cooperatives and Islamic financial cooperatives.
Good Practice C.3   Customer Records
                    a. A non-bank credit institution should maintain up-to-date records in
                       respect of each customer of the non-bank credit institution that
                       contain the following:
                       (i) a copy of all documents required to identify the customer and
                             provide the customer’s profile;
                       (ii) the customer’s address, telephone number and all other customer
                             contact details;
                       (iii) any information or document in connection with the customer that
                             has been prepared in compliance with any statute, regulation or
                             code of conduct;
                       (iv) details of all products and services provided by the non-bank
                             credit institution to the customer;
                     (v)   a copy of all correspondence from the customer to the non-bank
                           credit institution and vice-versa and details of any other
                           information provided to the customer in relation to any product or
                           service offered or provided to the customer;
                    (vi) all documents and applications of the non-bank credit institution
                           completed, signed and submitted to the non-bank credit
                           institution by the customer;
                    (vii) a copy of all original documents submitted by the customer in
                           support of an application by the customer for the provision of a
                           product or service by the non-bank credit institution; and
                    (viii) any other relevant information concerning the customer.
                 b. A law or regulation should provide the minimum permissible period for
                    retaining all such records and, throughout this period, the customer
                    should be provided ready free access to all such records.
Description      The requirements of this Good Practice are met to a limited extent by the anti-
                 money laundering KYC requirements.


                 The Regulations on KYC for NBFIs and on KYC for Finance Companies indicate
                 that multi-finance companies are required to administer and store customer
                 records from the perspective of financial integrity, for at least 5 years after the
                 contract agreement expires. Such records include documentation and data
                 related to the customer’s identity in the case of low-risk transaction customers
                 (e.g. proofs of full name, identity number, addresses and telephone number) and
                 related to the customer’s financial profile in case of normal risk customers (e.g.
                 employment, income, sources of funds, bank account).


                 The Guidelines for Supervision of Islamic Financial Cooperatives include a
                 detailed chapter on Documentation and Administration, which indicates that
                 every credit facility provided must be properly documented. Required
                 documentation includes collateral documents, contract agreement and annexes,
                 applicant’s documents, credit application form, documents from cooperatives
                 officer containing the analysis of the credit proposal and the proposed financing.
                 The Guidelines also indicate that certain documents must be checked and their
                 validity confirmed, such as certificates of ownership, deeds of sale, certificates of
                 deposits, guarantor’s letter, etc. The Guidelines do not indicate the minimum
                 permissible retention period for all such documents.
Recommendation   OJK should require multi-finance companies, pawnshop and microfinance
                 institutions to maintain customer records with all the documents indicated in this
                 Good Practice. These requirements should not be restricted to the documents
                 related to customer’s identity and customer’s financial profile currently required
                 under the KYC regulations.


                 MC should require savings and loans cooperatives to have similar customer
                 record requirements to those set up for Islamic financial cooperatives. For both
                 types of cooperatives, MC should indicate the minimum period for retaining all
                 customer records (which could be 5 years to make them consistent with existing
                 financial integrity requirements), and allow customers to have free access to
                    such records.


                    Provincial authorities should also require village credit providers to maintain
                    specific customer records for a specific period time (preferably 5 years).
Good Practice C.5   Debt Recovery
                    a. All non-bank credit institutions, agents of non-bank credit institutions
                       and third parties should be prohibited from employing any abusive
                       debt collection practice against any customer of the non-bank credit
                       institution, including the use of any false statement, any unfair practice
                       or the giving of false credit information to others.
                    b. The type of debt that can be collected on behalf of a non-bank credit
                       institution, the person who can collect any such debt and the manner
                       in which that debt can be collected should be indicated to the
                       customer of the non-bank credit institution when the credit agreement
                       giving rise to the debt is entered into between the non-bank credit
                       institution and the customer.
                    c. A debt collector should not contact any third party about a non-bank
                       credit institution customer’s debt without informing that party of the
                       debt collector’s right to do so and the type of information that the debt
                       collector is seeking.
                    d. Where sale or transfer of debt without borrower consent is allowed by
                       law, the borrower should be:
                       (i) notified of the sale or transfer within a reasonable number of days;
                       (ii) informed that the borrower remains obligated on the debt; and
                       (iii) provided with information as to where to make payment, as well as
                             the purchaser’s or transferee’s contact information.
Description         There is no specific legal or regulatory provision regarding debt collection
                    practices by NBCIs. Currently debt recovery is undertaken mostly by special
                    departments within NBCIs, although some NBCIs also subcontract these
                    services to third parties. In either case, there are no codes of conduct that deal
                    with the ethical behavior of staff when dealing with clients, including regarding
                    debt collection.
                    Further, in general, no disclosure appears to be made by NBCIs in the contract
                    agreement regarding the type of debt that can be collected on behalf of an NBCI,
                    the person who can collect any such debt and the manner in which that debt can
                    be collected.
                    It is worth noting that the Guidelines for the Supervision of Islamic Financial
                    Cooperatives allows for these institutions to use third-party services to collect
                    debt, under the condition that the personnel in the debt collector be capable,
                    credible and trustworthy and understand the principles of sharia financing.
Recommendation      The financial regulators should issue regulations covering this Good Practice,
                    applicable to NBCIs.



SECTION D           PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION


Good Practice D.1   Confidentiality and Security of Customers’ Information
                 a. The financial transactions of any customer of a non-bank credit
                    institution should be kept confidential by the institution.
                 b. The law should require non-bank credit institutions to ensure that they
                    protect the confidentiality and security of personal data of their
                    customers against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or
                    integrity of such information, and against unauthorized access.
Description      Confidentiality and security requirements for NBCIs are fragmented and
                 incomplete.
                 According to Article 31 of the FCP Regulation, multi-finance companies and
                 pawnshops are prohibited from disclosing customer data or information to third
                 parties in any manner, except in cases where the consumer gives written
                 consent and when disclosure is required by laws or regulations.
                 According to Article 21 of the MFI Law, Board members, directors, managers,
                 employees and affiliates of microfinance institutions shall store client information
                 and keep it confidential. At the same time, the law indicates specific exemptions
                 to this confidentiality provision: taxation, judiciary interest in criminal cases,
                 judiciary interest in civil cases and other cases specified in an OJK regulation.
                 OJK is tasked with issuing specific provisions on the procedure for sharing that
                 information.
                 There are no provisions on confidentiality and security for cooperatives or village
                 credit providers.
                 At a more general level, the Law on Information and Electronic Transactions
                 indicates that “unless provided otherwise by Rules, use of any information
                 through electronic media that involved personal data of a Person must be made
                 with the consent of the Person concerned” (Article 26). Further, its implementing
                 Regulation on the Operation of Electronic Systems and Transactions established
                 that an electronic system operator is obliged to ensure:
                     the “secrecy, integrity and availability” of personal data;
                     that the “acquisition, use, and utilization” of personal data is based on the
                      consent of the personal data owner, unless otherwise indicated by law or
                      regulation;
                  that the use or sharing of personal data is based on the consent of the data
                      subject and in accordance with the purpose of acquisition, which was
                      disclosed to personal data owner at the time of data acquisition.
                 As mentioned earlier, industry practices seem to show that personal contact
                 information is easily being shared with and by financial institutions, and is being
                 used for telemarketing purposes among others.
Recommendation   MC and provincial authorities should enact provisions for the protection of
                 confidentiality, security and privacy of personal data, as indicated in this Good
                 Practice.


                 OJK should also expand the current confidentiality provisions of the FCP
                 Regulation and the MFI Law. The aim should be to ensure that the relevant
                 NBCIs keep all client transactions confidential, and develop adequate
                 mechanisms to protect customer personal data against unauthorized access and
                 security threats or hazards.
Good Practice D.2   Credit Reporting
                      i.      Credit reporting should be subject to appropriate oversight, with
                              sufficient enforcement authority.
                     ii.      The credit reporting system should have accurate, timely and
                              sufficient data. The system should also maintain rigorous standards
                              of security and reliability.
                    iii.      The overall legal and regulatory framework for the credit reporting
                              system should be: (i) clear, predictable, non-discriminatory,
                              proportionate and supportive of consumer rights; and (ii) supported
                              by effective judicial or extrajudicial dispute resolution mechanisms.
                    iv.       Proportionate and supportive consumer rights should include the
                              right of the consumer
                           (i) to consent to information-sharing based upon the knowledge of
                                 the institution’s information-sharing practices;
                           (ii) to access his or her credit report free of charge (at least once a
                                 year), subject to proper identification;
                           (iii) to know about adverse action in credit decisions or less-than-
                                 optimal conditions/prices due to credit report information;
                           (iv) to be informed about all inquiries within a period of time, such as
                                 six months;
                           (v) to correct factually incorrect information or to have it deleted and
                                 to mark (flag) information that is in dispute;
                           (vi) to reasonable retention periods of credit history; and
                           (vii) to have information kept confidential and with sufficient security
                                 measures in place to prevent unauthorized access, misuse of
                                 data, or loss or destruction of data.
                     v.       The credit registers, regulator and associations of non-bank credit
                              institutions should undertake campaigns to inform and educate the
                              public on the rights of consumers in the above respects, as well as
                              the consequences of a negative personal credit history.
Description         See separate report on Credit Reporting. The comments below relate specifically
                    to NBCIs.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    See separate report on Credit Reporting.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    Although participation in BIK is voluntary for NBCIs, only a handful of NBCIs
                    actually participate in BIK, as indicated in Good Practice B.2. Incidental
                    information indicates that the requirements set by BI, especially IT requirements
                    and some customer data field requirements, have been hard to meet by NBCIs.
                    Additionally, NBCIs are concerned about potential penalties they may face for
                    not being able to submit all needed information on time, and there also seems to
                    be some lack of understanding about the scope and coverage of BIK and that
                    NBCIs are authorized to join BIK.


                    As an alternative to BIK, the multi-finance industry association has developed an
                 informal mechanism to share information of debtors, or black lists of debtors. In
                 addition, it has developed a list of debtors whose debt has been written off by
                 multi-finance companies, as a way to comply with a tax code requirement to
                 publish this specific information. These arrangements have been an industry
                 reaction to the lack of an official credit database. However, they seem to be
                 contributing to the general perception that customer confidentiality and security
                 of information is not well protected. Additionally, consumers are not informed that
                 their information would be shared with other financial institutions in the context of
                 such informal credit bureaus. Asbindo is also starting to develop a credit
                 database of all its members, which is expected to work in parallel to other credit
                 reporting databases. Thus, the current situation does not allow financial
                 providers to have a full picture of the total direct and indirect credit exposure of a
                 potential borrower.


                 Paragraphs (c) and (d)
                 See separate report on Credit Reporting.


                 Paragraph (e)
                 BI consumer awareness campaigns on credit reporting have not been
                 programmatic and have mostly targeted banking rather than NBCI consumers.
                 They are aimed at explaining the benefits of a credit reporting system, or the
                 rights of consumers regarding the existing credit registry, or the consequences of
                 a negative personal credit history.
Recommendation   There is urgent need to have at least one credit register with information from
                 NBCIs, so that there is a formal mechanism to exchange credit information of
                 borrowers, which would follow appropriate confidentiality, privacy and security
                 requirements. This could be done through the fine-tuning of the requirements to
                 participate in BIK, so that NBCIs are encouraged to do so; or through the
                 development of a comprehensive legal framework for private credit bureaus,
                 which includes protection of confidentiality and privacy of information, and
                 ensures that basic rights of consumers are well protected (and not only those
                 already covered by the Credit Bureau Regulation).


                 BI and OJK should organize workshops for BMTs and other NBCIs that are
                 currently interested in setting up their own sector credit history databases for low-
                 income consumers. These institutions would benefit from learning more about
                 the existing legal framework for credit reporting and data protection, and from
                 international experiences in the setup of private (including microfinance) credit
                 bureaus.

SECTION E        DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS
Good Practice E.1            Internal Complaints Procedure
                             Complaint resolution procedures should be included in the non-bank credit
                             institutions’ code of conduct and monitored by the supervisory authority.
Description                  There are not currently specific requirements for the internal dispute resolution
                             procedures to be followed by any NBCI, other than the general provisions that
                             exist in the Consumer Law. Further, the FCP Regulation, which will come into
                             effect in August 2014, contains requirements in this regard.


                             See Banking Sector Good Practice E.1 for details of the Consumer Law and FCP
                             Regulation requirements.


                             Some multi-finance companies already include in contract agreements and
                             summary sheets the toll-free phone number a consumer may call to raise a
                             complaint, and have developed internal procedures for complaints handling and
                             in few cases also complaints data analysis. However, many others do not have
                             clear procedures, let alone provide contact information regarding a complaints
                             handling contact person or unit.
Recommendation               See the recommendations in Banking Sector Good Practice E.1.


                             Consideration should also be given to establishing complaints handling
                             procedures for village credit providers and cooperatives. Such procedures
                             should take into account community practices of complaints handling and clearly
                             identify the hierarchical levels which exist for dispute resolution in such
                             communities, whilst also promoting the development of ADR mechanisms at the
                             secondary cooperative level.
Good Practice E.2            Formal Dispute Settlement Mechanisms
                              a. A system should be in place that allows consumers to seek affordable
                                 and efficient third-party recourse, such as an ombudsman, in the event
                                 the complaint with the non-bank credit institution is not resolved to the
                                 consumer’s satisfaction in accordance with internal procedures.
                              b. The role of an ombudsman or equivalent institution in dealing with
                                 consumer disputes should be made known to the public.
                              c. The ombudsman or equivalent institution should be impartial and act
                                 independently from the appointing authority, the industry and the
                                 parties to the dispute.
                              d. The decisions of the ombudsman or equivalent institution should be
                                 binding upon non-bank credit institutions. The mechanisms to ensure
                                 the enforcement of these decisions should be established and
                                 publicized.
Description                  The current statutory systems for the formal resolution of disputes with NBCIs
                             are fragmented and overlapping. Apart from recourse to his or her local or
                             District court, a consumer with an unresolved complaint concerning an NBCI
                                                                                                         173
                             product or service can only access the Consumer Dispute Resolution Board.


173
      Operating under Regulation No. 350 of 2001 issued by the Ministry of Trade and Industry
                           And, as of August 7, 2014, OJK will also be providing a service to facilitate the
                                                                                                          174
                           resolution of outstanding consumer complaints under the FCP Regulation.
                           OJK also has advocacy powers to take measures against financial institutions to
                           resolve complaints and to institute proceedings to reclaim property or to recover
                           damages on behalf of a consumer, as well as a financial institution if it is the
                                          175
                           harmed party. In addition, Indonesia is a participant in the ASEAN Committee
                           on Consumer Protection that provides an avenue for consumers of any service
                                                                                   176
                           or product to complain and seek compensation for loss.


                           See Insurance Sector Good Practice E.2 for a full description of the
                           abovementioned provisions.


                           Non-bank credit consumers currently seek recourse through different
                           mechanisms, but seem to prefer traditional customary mediation. In the
                           cooperative and village credit segments, the most common way to solve disputes
                           seem to be through musyawarah mufakat, which means ‘dialogue to reach
                           consensus’, and is based on an amicable private negotiation process that aims
                           to maintain a good relation among two disputing parties. Parties may refer the
                           dispute to a third party, such as a religious or village leader or a senior
                           community person, who would solve problem through mediation or conciliation.


                           Regarding Islamic financial cooperatives, it is also important to notice that the
                           supervisory guidelines recognize the role of the Sharia Arbitration Board in the
                           resolution of disputes where no agreement has been reached by consensus
                           between the two parties.
Recommendation             See the recommendations in Banking Sector Good Practice E.1.
                           Consumers of financial cooperatives and village credit providers who are not
                           regulated by OJK should also have a clear ADR scheme available to them. MC
                           could either encourage the formation of a cooperative-based ADR scheme within
                           secondary cooperatives, or set up a unit to deal with consumer complaints.
                           Customers of village credit providers should be able to go to the BPSK to seek
                           appropriate recourse. In any case, MC and BPSK should coordinate with OJK so
                           that all these institutions set up similar dispute resolution procedures. At the
                           same, all these ADR schemes should follow key ADR principles (as explained in
                           more detail in Volume I of this Diagnostic Review). Furthermore, financial
                           regulators should clearly define key principles as well as specific procedures and
                           standards that industry associations must follow when setting up industry-based
                           ADR schemes. These would ensure not only the standardization of procedures
                           for financial consumers, but also that a minimum quality standard and level of
                           protection is provided to all types of consumers, independently of what type of
                           financial provider they have had problems with.

SECTION F           CONSUMER EMPOWERMENT


Good Practice F.1   Broadly based Financial Capability Program
                       a. A broadly based program of financial education and information
                          should be developed to increase the financial capability of the
                          population.
                       b. A range of organizations–including government, state agencies and
                          non-governmental organizations–should be involved in developing
                          and implementing the financial capability program.
                       c. The government should appoint an institution such as the central
                          bank or a financial regulator to lead and coordinate the
                          development and implementation of the national financial capability
                          program.
Description         See discussion in Good Practice G.1 of the Banking Section and the Financial
                    Capability Report in Annex I.
Recommendation      See recommendations in Good Practice G1 of the Banking Section and the
                    Financial Capability Report in Annex I.
Good Practice F.2   Using a Range of Initiatives and Channels, including the Mass Media
                       a. A range of initiatives should be undertaken by the relevant
                          authority to improve the financial capability of the population, and
                          especially from low-income communities.
                       b. The mass media should be encouraged by the relevant authority to
                          provide financial education, information and guidance to the public,
                          including on non-bank credit institutions and the products and
                          services they offer.
                       c. The government should provide appropriate incentives and
                          encourage collaboration between governmental agencies, the
                          supervisory authority for non-bank credit institutions, the
                          associations of non-bank credit institutions and consumer
                          associations in the provision of financial education, information
                          and guidance to consumers.

Good Practice F.3   Unbiased Information for Consumers
                       a. Consumers, especially the most vulnerable, should have access to
                          sufficient resources to enable them to understand financial
                          products and services available to them.
                       b. Supervisory authorities and consumer associations should
                          provide, via the internet and printed publications, independent
                          information on the key features, benefits and risks – and, where
                          practicable, the costs – of the main types of financial products and
                          services, including those offered by non-bank credit institutions.
                       c. The relevant authority should adopt policies that encourage non-
                          government organizations to provide consumer awareness
                          programs to the public regarding financial products and services,
                           including those offered by non-bank credit institutions.

Good Practice F.4   Consulting Consumers and the Financial Services Industry
                    The relevant authority should consult consumer associations and
                    associations of non-bank credit institutions to help the authority develop
                    financial capability programs that meet the needs and expectations of
                    financial consumers, especially those served by non-bank credit
                    institutions.

Good Practice F.5   Using a Range of Initiatives and Channels, including the Mass Media
                       a. Policymakers, industry and consumer advocates should
                          understand the financial capability of various market segments,
                          particularly those most vulnerable to abuse.
                       b. The financial capability of consumers should be measured,
                          amongst other things, by broadly based household surveys that are
                          repeated from time to time.
                       c. The effectiveness of key financial capability initiatives should be
                          evaluated by the relevant authority from time to time.

The pension system consists mainly of social security schemes. Three main funds are run –
Jamsostek covering private sector workers, Taspen for public servants and ASBRI for the military and
police. A relatively generous severance pay system also exists.

Problems with the social security schemes relate to coverage, with only 12% of the population
having any formal pension provision (due to the large informal sector and high non-compliance
rates). The fragmented schemes are also expensive and inefficiently run, delivering only limited (mostly
lump sum) pensions benefits.

In order to address these issues, the government announced a major reform of the social security
system with the passing of the SJSN Law in 2004 . This law requires universal social security coverage
for all Indonesians (the government will provide contributions for low-income workers). The subsequent
passing of the BPJS Law in 2011 decrees that Jamsostek will be transformed into a trust fund which will
deliver a life-long and lump sum pension. The pension related reforms are scheduled for introduction from
mid-2015.

Pensions provided by these social security funds are not consumer products in the strictest
sense. Membership of the schemes is mandatory and individuals do not have any choice of provider or
investment product. Hence these schemes will not be the focus of this review. That said, consumer
protection issues are still important in that individuals’ contribute to the schemes and the assets need to
be managed in a secure and efficient fashion.

Though the details of the new scheme have yet to be decided, in theory the reformed BPJS should
provide greater protection to members. This will be via various means:
 There will be greater surveillance of the scheme as it will be supervised by the financial sector
    supervisor, OJK, and a tripartite (government, employers, employees) oversight trustee board (the
    DJSN);
 The investment of the fund will be more transparent, with returns based on market rates and all
    investment income going to members (rather than paying a dividend to the government);
 Individuals members will join the BPJS (via individual ID records), rather than via their employers, and
    the governement will have greater powers to force compliance from employers who do not pay their
    contributions.
Protection issues will also be important as social security is rolled out to the population as a
whole, including the informal sector. Secure, low cost, efficient systems for collecting their
contributions and making pension payments will be key to making the reforms a success.

The subject of the diagnostic review in this report is the voluntary, private pension funds which
are also on offer in Indonesia. These take two main forms. Employer pension funds (DPPK) are run by
sponsoring companies, on either a defined benefit (DB) or, increasingly, on a defined contribution (DC)
basis. As of 2012, there were 244 DPPK funds operating in the country, covering 1.4 million workers. In
addition, 25 financial institutions offer DC pension plans (DPLK) either on a group basis to companies
which do not wish to run their own in-house occupation fund (almost 1 million members), or in some
cases directly to individuals (700,000 members).
Though the voluntary private pension funds currently represent only around 3.3 million people, or
1% of the population (5% of the workforce) and assets under management constitute only 2% of
GDP (IDR 141 trillion), these schemes should become more important in future. The reformed social
security system will only be able to provide limited, subsistence benefits (at least if it is to be fiscally
sustainable) and severance pay is likely to be reformed. There is accordingly a need to ensure that the
private pension fund schemes are run in the interests of their members and that the consumers of these
pension products are well protected.

Specific consumer protection issues need to be raised for employer-sponsored schemes. These
issues center on whether employees have proper representation on governing boards, how information
on the scheme is disclosed to them and whether the scheme is properly funded.

More classic consumer protection issues apply to DPLK funds (the growing segment of the
market). This is particularly the case where members have a choice of investment product and, for retail
DPLK schemes, where issues concerning the selling of products come into play. Currently the distribution
of these products is via insurance and banking channels (and their consumer protection measures
therefore apply). However, if direct retail selling of pensions increases in future, specific pension-related
provisions may need to be applied.
SECTION A                   CONSUMER PROTECTION INSTITUTIONS


Good Practice A.1           Consumer Protection Regime
                            The law should recognize and provide for clear rules on consumer
                            protection in the area of private pensions and there should be adequate
                            supporting institutional arrangements:
                                 a. There should be specific provisions in the law, which create an
                                    effective regime for the protection of consumers who deal directly
                                    with pension management companies and members/ affiliates of
                                    occupational plans.
                                 b. There should be a general consumer protection agency or a
                                    specialized agency, responsible for the implementation, oversight
                                    and enforcement of pension consumer protection, as well as data
                                    collection and analysis (including inquiries, complaints and
                                    disputes).
                                 c. The law should provide, or at least not prohibit, a role for the private
                                    sector, including voluntary consumer organizations and self-
                                    regulatory organizations, in respect of consumer protection
                                    regarding private pensions.
Description                 Consumer protection is provided in general financial sector legislation rather than
                            in pension specific regulations. Governance requirements for pension funds are
                            extensive but could be strengthened.


                            Paragraph (a)
                            The Consumer Law offers protection to pension sector participants. As
                                                                                    177
                            discussed in relation to other sections of this report,     it is considered that the
                            breadth of the definitions of “consumer”; “entrepreneur” and “services” in Article 1
                            of the Consumer Law support the view that the Law applies to all financial
                            services (including pensions) and that the responsibilities of both MoT and the
                            NCPA cover such services.


                            The new Financial Services Consumer Protection Regulation No. 1 2013 (FCP
                            Regulation), which will come into force in August 2014, will explicitly covers
                            pension funds. OJK has held seminars to explain the new regulation to industry
                            participants, though it is not clear if the implication of the requirements outlined
                            have been fully understood. OJK is currently drafting circulars for all sectors,
                            including pensions, to provide further guidance on implementation issues.


                            Though broadly following the spirit of these new regulations, the management of
                            the occupational plans and the financial institutions providing pensions will have
                            to improve in several respects to comply fully. For example, Article 7 (1) b.


177
      See Insurance Sector Diagnostic
                             requires such organizations to help consumers “ make an informed decision” –
                             yet where DPLK funds do offer choice of investment funds; it appears that this
                             may only extend to providing a selected list of investment products. Likewise
                             Article 14 requires them to “provide Consumers and/or the public with education
                             to promote financial literacy.” Certainly on the part of financial institutions, new
                             campaigns on pensions would have to be launched. Many would also not comply
                             with the stipulation in Article 49 to “maintain and apply written policies and
                             procedures for the Consumer protection.”


                             In addition to such consumer protection legislation, the main mechanism for
                             ensuring the protection of members of pension funds is via the fiduciary duty of
                             sponsors and providers to manage the funds in their interest. This is clearly
                             stated in Article 51 of the Pension Law: “The Pension Fund must be managed
                             with keeping in mind the interests of the participants and other parties that are
                             entitled to a pension benefit as stipulated in the Regulations of the Pension
                             Fund.” This is reiterated in Article 17 of the DPPK Regulation:“The Board shall
                             manage the pension funds by giving priority to the interests of participants and
                             others who are entitled to pension benefits.”


                             The key institution for ensuring that a pension fund is run in the interest of
                             members is the governing body (supervisory board), which includes
                             representation of employees or the pension fund members. The regulatory
                             authorities in Indonesia have clearly given pension fund governance a great deal
                             of thought and attention, including the publishing of the Guidelines for Pension
                                                         178
                             Fund Governance in 2006.        As the pension supervisory authority, OJK also
                             focuses on the role played by supervisory boards as part of their risk-based
                             approach to supervision.


                             Article 12 (1) of the Pension Law requires that a supervisory board be
                             established for employer sponsored DPPK pension funds, with a balanced
                             number of representatives from the plan sponsor and the members (actives and
                             retirees).


                             MoF regulation No. 513 of 2002 (Article 3) requires the supervisory board
                             members to pass a fit and proper test (“ good character and morals”, never
                             convicted of a financial-related criminal offense, etc.) and have “knowledge in the
                             field of pension funds” (Article 3 (1) e.), with Article 6 explaining that this should
                             be “the decision of the Director General of Financial Institutions.” OJK is
                             currently developing regulation on ‘fit and proper’ requirements.




178
      These are based on the principles of independence, transparency, accountability and fairness.
                          However, there are no specific qualifications or training requirements for
                          supervisory boards. It is therefore unclear how effective they are. By way of
                                                                                                    179
                          contrast, there are requirements for the management of the pension funds.


                          For DPLK funds, the board of the sponsoring financial institution acts as the
                          board of the pension fund (Pension Law Article 43). The members are the same
                                                                                           180
                          as the members of the bank or insurance company’s own board. This means
                          that, in effect, there is no independent oversight of the pension fund so as to
                          ensure that it is run in the interests of members rather than the commercial
                          interests of the plan sponsor.


                          It is understood that stricter qualifications for supervisory board members and
                          independent boards for DPLK funds are part of the proposed amendments to the
                                                                               181
                          Pension Law which are currently before parliament. The mission team was not
                          provided with a copy of the draft law.


                          Paragraph (b)
                          OKJ and the Consumer Protection Agency (NCPA) and the Ministry of Trade
                          (MoT) cover the whole financial sector, including pensions. The roles of these
                          institutions, and potentially overlapping functions, are discussed elsewhere in the
                          report (see especially the Banking Sector Report).


                          Paragraph (c)
                          The two pension fund associations (ADPI and ADKL) play a role in educating
                          pension fund members and sponsoring companies on pension issues in general.
                          The ADPI also offers a mediation mechanism. See Good Practice E for details.
Recommendation            If and when the retail pension market develops, the general financial sector
                          consumer protection legislation and regulation will need to be reviewed to see if
                          more detailed guidance is required specifically for pension products. Practices
                          around information disclosure and sales appear to be adequate at present, but
                          more detailed regulatory guidance (e.g. around disclosure of information,
                          contracts, marketing and sales material, training of agents and data protection
                          etc.) will likely be required if and when the retail market develops.


                          OJK should disseminate further information on the new financial consumer
                          protection legislation (especially the FCP Regulation) to the pension sector. The
                          regulator should continue to conduct an outreach campaign (via the two main
                          pension associations – ADPI and ADPLK) to make pension providers aware of

    The management DPPK and DPKL pension funds are required by regulation to pass fit and proper tests and pass
knowledge tests (Regulations 36 and 37/PMK.010/2010).

    Corporate governance requirements in Indonesia do necessitate independent directors on these boards.

    The process to amend the Pension Law was launched in 2001, with draft amendments submitted to Parliament in
2003. In 2009 the amended Pension Law was listed as one of the national legislation priorities for 2010-2014. As of
end 2011, the Law was still in the process of harmonization at the Ministry of Law.

                          Minimum training and qualification standards should be introduced for the

                          fund supervisory boards are becoming good practice in many countries.          In
                          Indonesia, this could be based on (a slimmed down version of) the training
                          required for pension fund managers by the Institution of Professional Standard of
                          Pension Fund (LSPDP), which was founded by the two pension industry
                          associations (ADPI and ADPLK). International good practice would also imply
                          the introduction of minimum suitability and collective knowledge requirements for
                          governing boards. For instance, the OECD Guidelines for Pension Fund
                                       183
                          Governance stipulate:
                          “Membership in the governing body should be subject to minimum suitability (or
                          non-suitability) standards in order to ensure a high level of integrity, competence,
                          experience and professionalism in the governance of the pension fund. The
                          governing body should collectively have the necessary skills and knowledge to
                          oversee all the functions performed by a pension fund, and to monitor those
                          delegates and advisors to who such functions have been delegated. It should
                          also seek to enhance its knowledge, where relevant, via appropriate training.
                          Any criteria that may disqualify an individual from appointment to the governing
                          body should be clearly laid out in the regulation.”


                          OKJ should require independent supervisory boards to oversee DPLK pension
                          funds provided by financial institutions. The ‘governance vacuum’ is a challenge
                          for DC pension funds in all countries, and ensuring that commercial pension
                          providers put their fiduciary duties ahead of their commercial interests is not
                          easy. However, mechanisms such as independent governance committees have
                          been tried in other countries, and Indonesia may be able to learn lessons from
                                                                      184
                          international experience and good practice.


                          The existence and role of the National Consumer Protection Agency (NCPA) and
                          pension industry dispute mechanisms could be made clearer to pension fund
                          members. For example, reference to the agency could be included in documents
                          provided on joining the fund and in annual statements, including how to contact
                          them in cases of disputes.

                              a. The judicial system should provide credibility to the enforcement of

                                   promoting pension consumer protection.
Description               No specific issues arise in relation to pensions.


                          Paragraph (a)
                          No specific judicial issues have arisen in relation pensions as no major cases
                          have been reported. Comments on judicial enforcement of consumer protection
                          rules are made elsewhere in this report (see especially Good Practice A.4 in the
                          Banking Report).


                          Paragraph (b).
                          Unlike some other financial sector issues (such as the aggressive cross - selling
                          of credit cards), pensions do not seem to have been a major topic of debate
                          within the media. This may be due to the low coverage of private, voluntary
                          pensions and general disillusion with the current social security provisions. This
                          may change as the details of the BPJS social security reforms become clearer
                          and as the market for voluntary pension savings develops.
Recommendation            A national pension awareness campaign should be launched to support the
                          social security reform program and to increase understanding on pensions more
                          generally. Lessons from other countries have shown that in order to be
                          successful, pension reforms requires the government to build strong political
                                                                            185
                          consensus and public support for the changes.         OJK is in a good position to
                          lead such a campaign as the BJPS and related reforms are rolled out. The level
                          of benefit which can be expected from the social security system will have to be
                          explained, and the subsequent need for additional, voluntary private pension
                          savings highlighted. Draft results of the government’s financial literacy surv ey
                          show pensions as being the worst understood financial product. If voluntary,
                          private pensions are to play a larger role in the provision in the pension system
                          after the BPJS social security reforms, the media and consumer associations
                          may have to increase their attention on the pension sector.



SECTION B                 DISCLOSURE AND SALES PRACTICES


Good Practice B.1         General Practices
                               a. The information available and provided to the consumer should
                                  clearly inform the consumer of the choice of accounts, products
                                  and services, as well as the risks associated with each of the
                                  options or choices.

                               b. Employers should be responsible for ensuring that new plan
                                  members are made fully aware of their rights and obligations under
                                  any occupational pension arrangements.
                               c. Employers should be required to vest benefits with employees
                                  relatively quickly so as to avoid undesirable personnel practices
                                  (such as terminating employment just as employer contributions
                                  are about to vest).
                               d. Employers should be obliged to ensure that contributions are
                                  properly collected, accounted for and passed on to the pension
                                  fund’s managers.
Description                Disclosure practices, though not always covered by detailed regulatory guidance,
                           appear to be generally adequate.


                           Paragraph (a)
                           DPPL employer sponsored pension funds do not involve any choice on the part
                           of individual employees. They are required to be members upon starting
                           employment and the fund is run in a pooled manner.


                           Rather than run their own in-house DPPL pension fund, many employers choose
                           to use a DPLK pension fund run by a financial institution. In this case
                                                                                                  186
                           membership of employees is also automatically based on employment.         They
                           may have some choice of the level of their contribution into the fund.


                           Some employers make the choice of DPLK provider and investment fund on
                           behalf of the members. HR departments and other staff responsible for pension
                           provisions would generally see a range of DPLK providers and then work with
                           representative of their chosen provider to devise a suitable investment portfolio
                           in which to place their members.


                           Some funds do involve choices on the part of members. Employers may allow
                           their staff to choose a DPLK provider (usually from a recommended list) and / or
                           their own investments from the range of funds which the DPLK provider offers
                           (usually a selection of equity, fixed income, money market, USD, sharia
                                   187
                           funds).      Switching between investments could also be allowed. Employers
                           offering such choice to their employees are often financial sector firms
                           themselves whose staff have more knowledge of investment issues. Retail DPLK
                           funds, where individuals themselves sign up for the pension product, offer a



186
    Technically membership of voluntary pension funds cannot be compulsory, particularly for scheme were
individuals make contributions. In practice, as the employer matches or betters employee contributions members will
always take part, though good practice is to require them to sign a form when they join agreeing to make
contributions into the pension fund from their salary. If the fund is non-contributory for employees (i.e. only the
employer makes contributions), membership can be automatic, but workers do still have the right not to take part.
187
    It should be noted that this investment choice is generally only for the employees own contributions. Employers
decide on the investment of their own contributions. This is because employers can use these DPLK funds to cover
their severance pay obligations. In the event of a member not choosing an investment fund, the employer’s choice is
usually the default. The majority of members who do exercise investment choice place their funds in fixed income
securities.
similar range of investment choices.


Regulations require information on the risk of investments to be provided. The
DPLK Regulation states that, “for the benefit of participants, the Board is obliged
to provide information on the possibility of the risk of losses on the investment
choices made by participants through pension funds” (Article 12 (1)).


In addition, Regulation PER-01/BL/2010 on Annual Investment Reports to be
prepared by supervisory boards (including guidelines on the content of these
reports) states that DPLK funds have a duty to ensure that the investment
portfolio is suitable for the members of the fund.


Paragraph (b)
Disclosure appears to be generally adequate In terms of industry practice
relating to the information provided to members on what choices are available to
them and the nature and risks of these different investment options, adequate
information is generally provided, at least by the larger funds. Assistance is
usually provided by the employer to help them exercise their choice (e.g. the HR
department will provide a list of recommended providers if required and a
selected list of investment funds).


The Pension Law places requirements on the pension fund boards to provide
information on the pension plan to members. Article 54 sets forth that:
“(2) The Board has an obligation to submit information to every participant
concerning matters that arise in the framework of his/her participation in the form
and time determined by the Minister.
(3) The Board has an obligation to submit information to the participants
concerning every amendment done on the Pension Fund’s regulation.”


The DPPK and DPLK Regulations also have requirements on providing on-going
information, including annual statements of the position of funds (collective or
individual as appropriate).


The regulation on Investment of Pension Funds No. 199 of 2008 includes
requirements on the information which the pension fund board must supply to
members, particularly:
“a. a summary of annual investment reports and results examination of the public
accounting report's annual investment […]; and
b. a summary of the results of the evaluation of the Board of Trustees” (Article 30
(1))
In addition, “the Board should submit annual investment reports and results
examination of the public accounting report's annual investment” (Article 31).


Although no further details or guidance is given in regulations as to the content of
these statements, adequate information on the nature of the fund appears to be
                             generally provided.


                             Paragraph (c)
                             DPLK funds are DC and vest immediately. For DPPK funds, a maximum 3 year
                             vesting period is allowed by the Pensions Law (Pension Law, Article 24).
                             Member contributions and interest are returned below this threshold. After 3
                             years, vested benefits can be transferred to another fund or are retained at the
                             existing fund for payout upon reaching retirement.


                             Paragraph (d)
                             Contribution collections procedures are regulated. Articles 16 and 17 of the
                             Pension Law sets out requirements for contribution collection. For example,
                             Article 17 (2) requires an employer “to turn over the entire participants’
                             contribution he collected and his own contribution as well to the Pension Fund at
                                                 th
                             the latest on the 15 of the following month”, with overdue contributions declared
                             “as a debt of the employer”, with interest due to compensate for the delay, and
                             these constitute a priority claim of the pension fund in case of sponsor
                             bankruptcy (Article 17 (3)).


                             In practice, contribution collection does not appear to be an issue. One large
                             employer sponsored DPPK (a group covering many employers) noted that they
                             have never experienced a late payment not being made within deadline of
                             following month. Equally, OJK have not encountered any major problems in this
                             regard.
Recommendation               OKJ should conduct a survey on investment choice in DPLK funds. The number
                             of pension funds offering choices to their members should be ascertained and
                             the nature of these choices analyzed (how many funds are offered, the range
                             and type of fund, whether a default fund is selected and if so what these default
                             funds are). The nature and level of information, education and assistance
                             available to individuals making these choices could also be examined.
                             Recommendations, good practices and guidelines would be generated from this
                             report, ensuring that good practices such as the below are followed:
                                 “The investment policy for pension pro grams in which members make
                                  investment choices should ensure that an appropriate array of investment
                                  options, including a default option, are provided for members and that
                                  members have access to the information necessary to make investment
                                  decisions. In particular, the investment policy should classify the investment
                                  options according to the investment risk that members bear.” (OECD
                                                                                    188

                                          investment choices sufficient to permit them to construct an

                                          as portfolio composition and historical investment performance data.

Good Practice B.2            Advertising and Sales Materials
                                  a. Pension management companies should ensure their advertising
                                     and sales materials and procedures do not mislead the customers.
                                  b. All marketing and sales materials of pension management
                                     companies should be easily readable and understandable by the
                                     average public.
                                  c. The pension management company should be legally responsible
                                     for all statements made in marketing and sales materials related to
                                     its products, and for all statements made by any person acting as
                                     an agent for the company.
Description                  As there is little in the way of a retail market for pensions, there are no specific
                             regulations for the sector on advertising and sales practices. General financial
                             sector provisions would apply.


                             Paragraph (a)
                             General financial sector regulations regarding the advertising and selling of
                             financial products would also apply to pensions. This would include the
                             regulation of the sales agents from the banking or insurance sectors if they are
                             handling the products.


                             For example, the regulations on the advertisement of mutual funds (Regulation
                             KEP-19/PM/2004) contains the usual requirements around not providing
                             misleading information or misleading impressions around the risk, return,
                             guarantees of the product, the investment manager being responsible for the
                             information provided, warnings around past performance not predicting future
                             returns etc. See also the discussion of the relevant Consumer Law provisions in
                             Good Practice B.9 of the Banking Good Practice.


                             There is no evidence of mis-selling practices within the pensions sector. There is

                          limited direct selling of pension products, with most sales of retail financial
                          institution pensions (DPLK) coming via referrals of clients from the insurance or
                          banking sectors and the cross selling of products.


                          Paragraph (b)
                          General financial sector provisions would apply to pensions. See also the
                          discussion of the relevant Consumer Law provisions in Good Practice B.9 of
                          banking sector report.


                          Paragraph (c)
                          General financial sector provisions would apply to pensions. See also the
                          discussion of the relevant Consumer Law provisions in Good Practice B.9 of the
                          banking sector report.
Recommendation            OJK could undertake an assessment to check with the general financial sector
                          provisions are sufficient or whether specific regulations around the selling of
                          pension products are required. If retail pension products increase in importance
                          as part of the pension system, clarification that appropriate general rules on
                          selling and marketing financial products also applies to pensions should be
                                                                                               190
                          given, and specific guidance on pension advertising may be required.
Good Practice B.3         Key Facts Statement
                          A Key Facts Statement disclosing the key factors of the pension scheme
                          and its services should be presented by the pension management
                          company before the consumer signs a contract.
Description               Key Fact Statements, are not currently required for pensions, but are to some
                          extent covered under Articles 5 and 8 of the new Financial Consumer Protection
                          Regulations No. 1. See the discussion on these provisions in Good Practice B.8
                          of the banking sector report.


                          Standardizing the requirements for Key Facts Statements in relation to pension
                          products would be helpful. The larger employer sponsored pension funds
                          (DPPK) and main financial institution pension funds (DPLK) already provide such
                          summaries for their members. They can help enhance comparison for individuals
                          making a choice of provider and /or investment fund, improve knowledge of
                          members of occupational schemes and make clearer the basis upon which
                          sponsor chooses the provider and /or investment fund clearer.
                          Key Fact Statements should be devised for pension products. The content of the
Recommendation            statement should follow international good practice – including the work done on
                                                                         191
                          this and related topics by the European Union.

    Key Information Documents form part of various Directives which the European Union is currently and has been
working on (including the IORP, UCITS and MiFID Directives). For details on the background to these developments

statements, see EIOPA Occupational Pension Stakeholders Group statement on the topic (EIOPA-OPSG-12-10 6

Good Practice B.4          Special Disclosures
                               a. Pension management companies should disclose information
                                  relating to the products they offer, including investment options,
                                  risk and benefits, fees and charges, any restrictions or penalties on
                                  transfer, fraud protection over accounts, and fee on closure of
                                  account.
                               b. Customers should be notified of any planned change in fees or
                                  charges a reasonable period in advance of the effective date of the
                                  change.
                               c. Pension management companies should inform consumers upfront
                                  of the nature of any guarantee arrangements covering their pension
                                  products.
                               d. Customers should be informed upfront regarding the time, manner
                                  and process of disputing information on statements and in respect
                                  of transactions.
                               e. Customers should be informed in writing, at the time of sale or
                                  when joining an occupational plan, of the options available to them
                                  if they decide to change employer, move or retire.
Description                Though pension regulation in the country is at a reasonably high level and little
                           detailed guidance is provided, information disclosure generally appears to be
                           adequate.


                           Paragraph (a)
                           There is no standardized reporting of fees – or indeed of investment returns – for
                           pension funds in Indonesia. Fees may be charged in different ways (on
                           contributions or on assets under management, on entry or exit etc.). Likewise,
                           investment returns can be based on daily or weekly unit prices or other
                                      192
                           measures.


                           Fees should be part of the annual statement provided to members, but how they
                           are disclosed is not clear. DPLK providers notify (indeed negotiate) fee levels to
                           corporate clients on joining the fund (these are stated in their employer
                           application forms and agreed by both parties - customer and provider), but
                           practices around notifying members of these levels are not standardized.


                           Another area where there is a lack of transparency regarding fees charged for
                           DPLK pensions is around the compulsory annuity purchase. According to the
                           Pension Law (Article 21), members must choose an annuity on retirement, with
                                                                                            193
                           small balances (currently IDR 150,000,000 or around USD 15,000), and 20%

     Regulation PER-02/BL/2010 on Annual Investment Reports to be prepared by supervisory boards include
guidelines on contents of these reports, including valuations, reporting periods etc. – but these reports are for the
regulator not the public.
193
    The ceiling for the lump sum payment has been increased several times since the passing of the Pension Law in
1992. The level as of 2012 is IDR 1,500,000. A proposal to increase this to IDR 625,000,000 is part of the
amendments to the law which are currently before parliament.
                                                                                              194
                           of the total allowed to be taken as a lump sum (Article 25). In practice upon
                           retirement, the DPLK balance is transferred to one of the limited number
                                                                            195
                           insurance companies which provide ‘annuities.’       These companies provide a
                           payout for less than a year and then allow the member to cash out the balance
                           minus around 5%. This legal requirement to take an annuity when no such
                           products exist in the country is clearly having a negative impact on consumers
                           who do not understand the nature of the product or the charges which are being
                           imposed.


                           Paragraph (b)
                           Article 54 (2) of the Pension Law requires that members of the fund are notified
                           of any changes in the fund legislation. This would include fee levels. This is done
                           as industry good practice, at least by the larger funds.


                           Paragraph (c)
                           All DPLK retail pensions are DC and by their nature do not involve guarantees.



                           Paragraph (d)
                           Employers provide details of customer service contacts or call centers where
                           members can seek assistance. DPLK providers run similar service. See later
                           section on dispute resolution.


                           Paragraph (e)
                           Information disclosure generally follows international good practice. Information
                           on the rights of members in terms of vesting, changing job and upon retirement
                           is generally provided by HR companies for employer sponsored DPPK funds.
                           DPLK providers also disclose such information
Recommendation             OJK should introduce standardized reporting of performance and fees.
                           Standards for calculating and imposing fees and charges should be set by the
                           regulator along with requirements for disclosing these clearly. Fees relating to
                           the purchase of annuities need particularly close attention and clarification and
                           any ‘hidden’ charges should be prohibited.


                           OJK should provide a centralized comparison site for comparing DPLK
                           investment performance (and some measure of risk) and costs by types of fund.




194
    The amendments to the Pension Law propose increasing this to IDR 625,000,000 – which is likely to cover the
majority of DC fund balances in total.
195
    These are all domestic insurance companies. International insurance companies with a market presence in
Indonesia are reluctant to provide annuities (even when they have experience of doing so in their home markets) not
due to demographic risk (as is the case in more mature markets) but due to investment risks – there being a lack of
long-dated, index linked bonds with which they can match their exposure.
                          Such centralized sources are increasingly being adopted by pension regulators
                                                                                             196
                          in other countries (such as Hong Kong, Chile, Mexico)                  to increase
                          transparency and increase competition in otherwise price inelastic pension
                          markets. As fee comparison is difficult, a synthetic cost indicator may be devised
                          and retail fees (before corporate discounts) could be used. Industry comparisons
                          can be found in media publications, but it is not always clear that these are
                          measured on a comparable basis, and research in other countries finds that
                          individuals place more trust in an official comparison site. As the IOPS Working
                          Paper on Effective Pension Supervision No. 15 states, “the fact that information
                          comes directly from the supervisor may contribute to maintaining public
                          confidence in the functioning of the pension system - a goal which has risen in
                          prominence following the global financial and economic crisis of recent years.”


                          The Pension Law should be revised to allow for program withdrawals whilst
                          measures to encourage and assist the development of the annuity market are
                          taken. It is understood that the amendments to the Pension Law currently before
                          parliament include such a possibility. Program withdrawals (where a certain
                          amount of the DC balance is withdrawn each year due to on a formula based on
                          longevity estimates) can act as a compromise product between lump sums and
                          annuities which offer full longevity protection. More flexibility around the type of
                          annuity product which can be purchased could also be allowed in order to
                          encourage more providers to enter the market. In parallel, steps to help develop
                          the annuity market should be taken – including the issuance of appropriate
                          instruments to hedge product related risks. A deep and liquid market in medium-
                          term (10-15 year) government and corporate bonds is needed to back liabilities.
                          Otherwise, the margins needed to cover reinvestment risk will be high and the
                          product will not be price-competitive. An alternative is to develop participating
                          annuity products. OJK could also consider the experience of countries in which a
                          central annuity provider operates, to see if such a solution could be appropriate
                          for Indonesia.


Good Practice B.5         Professional Competence
                               a. Marketing personnel, officers selling and approving transactions,
                                  and agents, should have sufficient qualifications and competence,
                                  depending on the complexities of the products they sell.
                               b. The law should require agents to be licensed, or at least be
                                  authorized to operate, by the regulator or supervisor.
                               c. Personnel departments with responsibility for occupational
                                  arrangements should have at least one suitably qualified individual
                                  who can explain the plan to members and deal with third-party
                                  providers such as asset management companies.
Description               Specific regulations for the pensions sector are lacking in this area.

                           Paragraph (a)
                           Most private pension contracts in Indonesia are not ‘sold’ like other financial
                           products. The banks and insurance companies which provide DPLK pension
                           schemes mostly interact with the employer firms which are plan sponsors and do
                                                                                             197
                           not offer their products on a retail basis direct to individuals.


                           Interaction with sponsoring companies is via ‘employee benefit consultants’ w ho
                                                                              198
                           discuss potential pension solutions with clients.      Most of the salary of these
                           consultants comes from commissions, based on the size of the scheme they
                           manage to sign up. DPLK providers employ only a handful of these staff, with the
                           25 DPLK providers across the industry employing around 200 such consultants
                           in total. Generally the staff must pass the provider’s own internal certification, but
                           the pension industry association (unlike the insurance body) has decided not to
                           set industry wide qualification standards or impose a licensing process due to the
                           small numbers involved.


                           Where DPLK products are sold on a retail basis, agents mostly come from the
                           insurance and banking sectors and are cross selling pension products. They
                           have to pass their own industry qualifications and knowledge tests. However,
                           they do not have specific training on pensions. This may result in the agents not
                           fully understanding the characteristics and risks of the products which they are
                           selling (e.g. that with DC pensions the investment risk passes to the individual).
                           There does not currently appear to be any major problems around mis-selling of
                           pension products in this environment (though the commission for selling these
                           products is said to be higher than others), but if the market is to grow, more
                           specifically qualified sales agents will be required and some checks or controls
                           on cross selling may be needed. For example, at a minimum, disclosure of
                           commissions should be required.


                           Paragraph (b)
                           There are no sales agents dealing spec ifically with pensions. DPLK staff ‘selling’
                           pensions are not currently licensed by the industry association as they interact
                           with sponsoring employers rather than directly with the public. Retail agents
                           come from the banking and insurance sectors and are cross selling pension
                           products. They are licensed under their industry regulations and requirements
                           rather than specifically on pensions.


                           Paragraph (c)
                           There is no formal requirement for training or qualifications for HR staff, but
                           those from at least the larger sponsors appear to have sufficient expertise.
                           Regulation 4263 of 2004 requires the managers of DPPK and DPLK funds to



197
  This is due to the fact that they are ‘marketing’ their DPKL as a product to offset/ fund severance pay obligations.
198
  These solutions can range from the company using the provider’s DPLK, to the company running an occupational
DPPK, with either the administration or the fund management outsourced to one of the provider’s sister companies.
                    pass a certification of basic knowledge in the field of pension funds, organized by
                    the Institution of Professional Standard of Pension Fund (LSPDP), which was
                    founded by the two pension industry associations (ADPI and ADPLK). In addition
                    to this basic test, the managers also have to fulfill on-going training requirements
                    (participation in seminars, training etc.), building up a certain number of credits
                    (40) through the year. Many of the larger funds also encourage their employees
                    to undertaken this certification and training as well. Both industry associations
                    (the ADPI for occupational funds and ADKLP for financial industry funds) provide
                    training and support for HR departments – the latter often being the main point of
                    contact between the associations and their members.
Recommendation      Some element of training on pensions should be included in the insurance and
                    banking qualification for those selling investment products. If retail pension
                    products increase in prominence, stricter licensing and qualifications for sales
                    agents will be required.


                    LSPDP certification could be made compulsory for HR personnel responsible for
                    pensions, as well as pension fund board members.
Good Practice B.6   Know Your Customer
                    The sales officer should examine important characteristics of any potential
                    customer, such as age, employment prospects and financial position, and
                    be aware of the customer’s risk appetite and his or her long-term
                    objectives for retirement, and recommend relevant financial products
                    accordingly.
Description         Anti-money laundering KYC regulations apply to the pension sector, but it is not
                    clear that they would cover all aspects of this Good Practice (especially in
                    relation to risk appetite) and would not be applicable to the members of pooled
                    funds.
                    Regulation No. 30 of 2010 introduced Know Your Customer requirements for
                    non-bank financial institutions, including pensions, and described them as
                    follows: “KYC is a principle which is applied by NBFIs to know the background
                    and identity of the customer, to monitor the customer’s account and transactions,
                    and to report suspicious transactions and financial transactions that are made in
                    cash, including financial transactions related to the Financing of Terrorism”
                    (Article 1 (5)).
                    The majority of pension fund members join a fund due to their employment
                    status, therefore their background is already known and their personal details
                    have already been provided. For example, DPLK pension providers must fill out
                    an employee registration form for all individuals. For retail clients, most are also
                    banking and/ or insurance clients and therefore the appropriate checks from
                    these sectors would also apply. In the vast majority of cases the simplified
                    procedures outlined in the regulation would apply: “ NBFIs can apply customer
                    due diligence procedures that are simpler than the customer due diligence
                    procedures referred to in Article 8” as long as the following criteria are met:
                    “Pension Fund participants were enrolled by the employer or independent
                    participants who contributed to the pension fund an amount less than or equal to
                    20% (twenty percent) of income per month or more than 20% (twenty percent) of
                    the income but not exceeding Rp 5.000.000,00 (five million rupiah) per month”
                            (Article 12 (1)).


                            The Know Your Customer or ‘suitability’ concept in the sense of preventing the
                            mis-selling of inappropriate products would not be applicable to most pension
                            fund members as providers are generally dealing with them on a collective basis,
                            via a pooled fund where they do not exercise any individual choice. The onus
                            would be on the HR department of the sponsoring employer and/ or the
                            governing body of the pension fund to select an investment structure which is
                            appropriate for the fund membership (e.g. a less risky investment profile would
                            be appropriate for a closed DB fund with an older membership profile). However,
                            such suitability tests will become more relevant if the retail pension market
                            continues to grow. A suitability test is part of the new FCP Regulation, as
                            providers “must consider the suitability of needs and capability of Consumers for
                            the products and/or services being offered to Consumers” (Article 16).
Recommendation              If the direct retail market for pension products grows, mechanisms for ensuring
                            that KYC checks take place (both in terms of anti-money laundering and
                            suitability tests) will need to be strengthened.
Good Practice B.7          Disclosure of Financial Situation
                                a. The regulator or supervisor should publish annual public reports
                                   on the development, health and strength of the pensions industry
                                   either as a special report or as part of its disclosure and
                                   accountability requirements under the law that governs these.
                                b. All pension management companies should disclose information
                                   regarding their financial position and profit performance.
                                c. Actuarial reports on funding levels should be required annually for
                                   defined benefit plans and members and affiliates should be advised
                                   of the condition of the plan in a short and clear written report.
                                d. Investment reports for defined contribution plans should at least
                                   match best practice mutual fund reporting.
Description                Disclosure in this area is fairly comprehensive for pensions.


                           Paragraph (a)
                           Industry statistics are provided annually. The previous pension regulator,
                           Bapepam LK, produced a Pension Fund Annual Report, providing statistical
                           updates (members, investments, returns, funding levels, risk ratings etc.) on the
                                                        199
                           pension industry as a whole.     The current regulator, OJK, will also produce
                           such information regularly.


                           The 2010 Pension Fund Annual Report describes the regulator’s information
                           service as follows: “The information service include assisting data request on
                           Pension Funds, conducting promotion and education activities, and providing
                           information help desk about D3P application. In general, data requests come
                           from various parties, such as Statistics Indonesia, National Planning and

                        During 2010, the Bureau had responded 257 inquiries and 52 complaints that
                        came by post, email, telephone, and in person. The most frequent inquiries were
                        delivered to the Bureau by telephone (62%) and the rest by postal mails and
                        emails (38%). Meanwhile most complaints were delivered directly in person
                                                            200
                        (60%) and the rest by mails (40%).”


                        The Industry Associations also provide annual data and regular updates on their
                        members.


                        Paragraph (b)
                        According to the Pension Law, financial institution pension funds (DPLK) are
                        required to produce annual audited accounts. Article 14 sets forth that “ the
                        financial accounts of the Pension Fund must be audited every year by a public
                        accountant appointed by the supervisory board” and “every Pension Fund must
                        submit periodical reports concerning its activities to the Minister, consisting of
                        […] Financial reports already audited by a public accountant” (Article 52 (1) a.).


                        In addition, Ministry of Finance Regulation on Pension Fund Financial Reports
                        No. 509 of 2002 requires pension funds to submit semiannual and annual
                        financial statements. This regulation also requires that pension funds’ annual
                        accounts must be published in “nationally published newspapers” (Article 13).


                        Paragraph (c)
                        The Pension Law (Article 53 (1)) requires that DB funds produce an actuarial
                        report at least every 3 years or if there are any changes in the pension fund
                        regulation. This must cover the necessary contribution level to finance the
                        pension plan, the solvency level and the additional contributions needed to make
                        up funding gap as laid out in recovery plan. In practice the large funds provide
                        these reports annually (and indeed may have an interim audit every 6 months).
                        In addition, Article 54 (1) requires that all funds must annually inform participants
                        of their balance and balance sheet.
                        Disclosure good practice is followed by the larger DPPK funds. For example, the
                        largest fund provides a newsletter to all members every 3 months, with
                        information on funding levels, the current investment portfolio and returns, new
                        regulations etc. Information is also available on the website and an AGM is held
                        every year in all major cities.
                        Actuarial reports may be over optimistic in practice. One issue which was raised
                        by some stakeholders during the mission is that, although the letter of the law is
                        complied with and actuarial reports are produced regularly, the quality of these
                        reports may not be up to standard, which could provide a false sense of security

                          be accurate, up to date or realistic, in practice (e.g. using out dated annuity
                          tables), which could be artificially boosting the funding levels. The realization of
                          the real level of contributions needed to fund these schemes is one of the drivers
                          behind the switch to DC funds.



                          Paragraph (d)
                          Investment reports for DC funds appear to be generally adequate. Industry good
                          practice has DC funds matching, if not surpassing, mutual fund reporting
                          standards.
Recommendation            Disclosure practices could form part of the review of DPLK funds. This review
                          should check that the requirements of this Good Practice are being followed, as
                          well as other applicable international standards such as the OECD Guidelines on
                          the Protection of Rights of Members and Beneficiaries in Occupational Pension
                                 202
                          Plans:
                          “International good practice around disclosure of information to members of DC
                          pension funds: Timely, individualized benefit statement should be provided to
                          each plan member (and to beneficiaries where relevant). The information
                          included on the benefit statement and the frequency of its delivery will depend on
                          the type of pension plan. The information included should enable the plan
                          member to identify current benefit accruals or account balances and the extent to
                          which the accruals or account balances are vested. For pension plans with
                          individual accounts, the information should include the date and value of
                          contributions made to the account, investment performance and earnings and/or
                          losses. For member-directed accounts, a record of all transactions (purchases
                          and sales) occurring in the member’s account during the relevant reporting
                          period should be provided. This information and other similarly personal data
                          should be maintained and delivered in a manner that takes full account of its
                          confidential nature.”
Good Practice B.8         Contracts
                          There should be consistent contracts or membership forms for pension
                          products and the contents of a contract should be read by the customer or
                          explained to the customer before it is signed.
Description               Though there are no regulations specifically for the pension sector, contract
                          requirements for the financial sector in general, including pensions, are included
                          in the new FCP Regulation.
                          DPLK pension providers must fill out an employee registration form for all
                          individuals. This practice is followed even when the arrangement is made via the



201
    For example Regulation 510/KMK.02/2002 on funding and solvency requires recovery plans within 3 years (Article
11).

    http://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/private-pensions/34018295.pdf
                    sponsoring employer and when no investment choice is offered to the members.
                    Standards from the insurance and banking industry apply as it is agents from
                    these sectors who are selling the products and interacting with clients.
                    Occupational funds employees also fill in an application form. There is no
                    contract as such as the employer is the provider of the fund. Some require
                    employees to sign a ‘no objection’ form in order to agree to contributions to be
                    made from their salary, but given the employer is providing at least matching
                    contributions this is a formality.
Recommendation      If the direct retail market for pension products grows, specific pension contract
                    related regulations may be required to meet the requirements of this Good
                    Practice.
Good Practice B.9   Cooling-off Period
                    There should be a reasonable cooling-off period associated with any
                    individual pension product.
Description         Good practice applied in other sectors also applies to pension funds where
                    appropriate.
                    In most cases pension fund membership is part of the employment contract and
                    therefore a ‘cooling off’ period does not apply.
                    For DPLK pensions sold to individuals, practices which are applied to the selling
                    of other financial products, such as insurance (see Insurance Sector Good
                    Practice B.4), will also apply to pensions. Insurance and banking industry sales
                    agents would apply the standards from their industry (i.e. standard 14 day
                    period) – though it should be noted that there is no legally mandated cooling off
                    period in either industry.
Recommendation      See the recommendation in Insurance Sector Good Practice B.4. If the direct
                    retail market for pension products grows, specific pension contract related
                    regulations may be required to meet the requirements of this Good Practice.



SECTION C           CUSTOMER ACCOUNT HANDLING AND MAINTENANCE


Good Practice C.1   Statements
                        a. Members and affiliates of a defined contribution pension plan
                           should not be locked into a specified investment profile (and shares
                           in their employer in particular) for more than a short period (e.g.
                           one week) after providing notification of a desire to switch
                           investment profiles.
                        b. Customers or occupational plan members should receive a regular
                           streamlined statement of their account that provides the complete
                           details of account activity (including investment performance on a
                           standardized basis) in an easy-to-read format, making reconciliation
                           easy.
                        c. Customers should have a means to dispute the accuracy of any
                           transaction recorded in the statement within a reasonable,
                           stipulated period.
                        d. When customers sign up for paperless statements, such
                           statements should be in an easy-to-read and readily understandable
                         format.
Description      Disclosure practices, though not regulated in detail, are generally adequate.


                 Paragraph (a)
                 Where members of DPLK funds have a choice of investments, fund rules will
                 decide how often they can switch and at what cost (there are no specificities in
                 regulation). For example, one of the major providers allows members to switch
                 investment up to 4 times a year, with the first 2 changes being made free of
                 charge and fees of IDR 20,000 then applying to additional switches. Their
                 service standard is for funds to be moved within 2 business days of the
                 necessary document having been received.


                 Paragraph (b)
                 Statements are provided to members once a year, with the usual information
                 provided (balance, returns, contributions during the year etc.). The major
                 providers also allow members to check their balance on-line and some via ATM
                 machines.
                 The Pension Law (Article 54 (2)) is vague regarding the timing and content of
                 these statements: “The Board has an obligation to submit information to every
                 participant concerning matters that arise in the framework of his/her participation
                 in the form and time determined by the Minister.”


                 The Guidelines for the Implementation of Pension Fund Governance outline what
                 OJK generally expect from pension funds by way of information disclosure:
                 “Pension funds must disclose information in a timely, adequate, clear, accurate
                 and comparable basis, and easily accessible by all relevant parties in
                 accordance with their rights” (Chapter II, A. 1. a.). In addition, “information that
                 must be disclosed shall include the vision, mission, financial condition, the
                 composition of the Management and Supervisory Board, risk management,
                 internal control and monitoring systems, the system of governance and its
                 implementation, and important events that may affect the condition of the
                 pension fund and other related information” (Chapter II, A. 1. b.).


                 Paragraph (c)
                 See Dispute Resolution Good Practice.


                 Paragraph (d)
                 On-line balances are available from the main providers. Information is generally
                 made available via website of the pension fund, and for more innovative
                 sponsors and providers, via SMS, social media and DC fund balances via ATM.
Recommendation   OJK should consider surveying current practices in relation to the provision of
                 pension statements and introducing a requirement for them to be provided. The
                 survey should check whether the requirements of this Good Practice are being
                          met, and if any innovative improvements should be required (such as how to
                                                                                                      203
                          communicate risk, how to encourage additional voluntary contributions etc.). A
                          statutory pension statements scheme (including specified information in a
                          prescribed form) could then be introduced.



SECTION D                 PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION


Good Practice D.1         Confidentiality and Security of Customers’ Information
                              a. The financial activities of any customer of a pension management
                                 company should be kept confidential and protected from
                                 unwarranted private and governmental scrutiny.
                              b. The law should require pension management companies to ensure
                                 that they protect the confidentiality and security of personal
                                 information of their customers against any anticipated threats or
                                 hazards to the security or integrity of such information, and against
                                 unauthorized access to, or use of, customer information that could
                                 result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.
Description               Strict regulations exist for the pension sector in this area and there are relevant
                          provisions in the FCP Regulation. These Good Practices also appear to be
                          generally applied by industry.


                          Paragraph (a)
                          Article 54 (4) of the Pension Law states that the Board of a pension fund has an
                          obligation to keep secret a participant’s personal information. This principle is
                          reiterated in the supporting DPPK regulation (Article 17(4)): “the Board is obliged
                          to keep secret the personal information pertaining to each participant. ”


                          The Guidelines for the Implementation of Pension Fund Governance also outline
                          what is expected by OJK by way of good practice: ”The Management, the
                          Supervisory Board and the Employees of the Pension Fund shall be required to
                          maintain the confidentiality of information and confidential information of the
                          Pension Fund in accordance with the prevailing laws and regulations” (Chapter
                          II, B. 2. b.).


                          In practice, members are asked to give approval on their application form for
                          information to be shared. The main DPLK pension providers follow internal
                          codes of conduct which apply to all staff globally regarding the handling of
                          confidential client information. As far as can be ascertained, industry practice is
                          not to sell / share pension member information with third parties, but cross selling
                          with the same financial group may take place.

                            Although there is not a data protection law of general application in Indonesia,
                            the new FCP Regulation will impose relevant confidentiality obligations.
                            Importantly, the FCP Regulation states that an essential principle of financial
                            consumer protection is the “confidentiality and security of consumers ’ data and
                                         204
                            information”. Further, Article 31(1) provides that a financial services provider is
                            “prohibited from disclosing data and/or information on its consumers to third
                                                               205
                            parties in any manner whatsoever”.


                            Furthermore, “any Person who is privy to any confidential information due to
                            his/her position, profession, as supervisee, or any relationship whatsoever with
                            the Financial Services Authority, is prohibited   from using or disclosing such
                            information to any other parties, unless within the performance of the functions,
                            duties, and powers under the decision of the Financial Services Authority or as is
                                                   206
                            required by the Law”. And, any violation of these requirements “may be may
                            be subject to administrative sanctions and/or other sanctions under the
                                                                 207
                            provisions of laws and regulations”.


                            Further, there is a wide variety of different laws dealing with specific data
                            protection issues. These are as described in Banking Sector Good Practice D.1.


                            Paragraph (b)
                            There are no regulatory requirements specific to the pensions industry. However
                            the providers and sponsors are mostly large, often listed, often multinational
                            firms, and may therefore apply data integrity practices which they are required to
                            follow in other jurisdictions in which they operate. For example, one of the main
                            insurance companies providing DPLK pensions applies the same standards as
                            are mandatory in the company’s home jurisdiction, Canada.
Recommendation              If the direct retail market for pension products grows, specific data protection
                            regulation related to pensions (around retirement dates, biometric requirements
                            for claiming pension payouts etc.) may be required. The issue of cross selling
                            and passing on information within financial groups may need to be addressed.
Good Practice D.2           Sharing Customer’s Information
                                 a.       Pension management companies should inform the consumer of
                                          third-party dealings for which the pension management company
                                          intends to share information regarding the consumer’s account.
                                 b.       Pension management companies should explain to customers
                                          how they use and share customers’ personal information.
                                 c.       Pension management companies should be prohibited from
                                          selling (or sharing) account or personal information to (or with)
                                          any outside company not affiliated with the pension management

                        customers by third parties.
Description   The requirements of this Good Practice are only met to a very limited extent.


              Paragraph (a)
              There are no provisions requiring investors to be informed of the information
              provided for by this Good Practice.
              Article 31 of the FCP Regulation is to the effect that financial services providers
              are prohibited from disclosing customer data or information to third parties in any
              manner, except in cases where the consumer gives written consent and when
              disclosure is required by laws or regulations. There is no requirement that the
              investor be informed of the various laws and regulations that can require
              disclosure.
              Consumer consent for information sharing is not clearly required under the credit
              reporting related laws and regulations. Article 26 of the Electronic Transactions
              Law, which is of general application to the processing of electronic information,
              provides that “Unless provided otherwise by Laws and Regulations, use of any
              information through electronic media that involves personal data of a Person
              must be made with the consent of the Person concerned.”
              Further, Article 31 of the FCP Regulation is to the effect that financial services
              providers are prohibited from disclosing customer data or information to third
              parties in any manner, except in cases where the consumer gives written
              consent and when disclosure is required by laws or regulations.
              There is no provision regarding sharing of information within a financial group.


              Paragraph (b)
              There is no requirement of the type contemplated by this Good Practice.


              Paragraph (c)
              Disclosure of pension information is not allowed by the Pension Law (Article 54
              (4)): “The Board has the obligation to keep secret private information that is
              related to each party.”


              Paragraph (d)
              There is no requirement of the type contemplated by this Good Practice,
              presumably because of the Article 54 (4) requirement.


              Paragraph (e)
                    See paragraph (c). In practice, it is in any event understood that pension data
                    collected by DPPK pension funds is held by the HR department of the plan
                    sponsor and is not released to third parties.
Recommendation      If the direct retail market for pension products grows, specific data protection
                    regulation related to pensions may be required. The issue of cross selling and
                    passing on information within financial groups may need to be addressed.
Good Practice D.3   Permitted Disclosures
                        a. The law should state specific procedures and exceptions
                           concerning the release of customer financial records to government
                           authorities.
                        b. The law should provide for penalties for breach of confidentiality
                           laws.
Description         Paragraph (a)
                    General financial sector regulations on data protection apply, around disclosing
                    information to the courts etc. (see, for example the discussion of Good Practice
                    D.3 for the Banking Sector). There is no specific pension regulation on this topic.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    General financial sector regulations on data protection apply. There is not
                    specific pension regulation on this topic.
Recommendation      Consideration should be given to having either a law or a regulation to provide
                    for this Good Practice, especially if the direct retail market for pension products
                    grows.



SECTON E            DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS

Good Practice E.1   Internal Dispute Settlement
                        a. An internal avenue for claim and dispute resolution practices within
                           the pension management company should be required by the
                           supervisory agency.
                        b. Pension management companies should provide designated
                           employees available to consumers for inquiries and complaints.
                        c. The pension management company should inform its customers of
                           the internal procedures on dispute resolution.
                        d. The regulator or supervisor should investigate whether pension
                           management companies comply with their internal procedures
                           regarding dispute resolution.
Description         There are not currently specific requirements for the internal dispute resolution
                    procedures to be followed by a pension management company, other than the
                    general provisions that exist in the Consumer Law. Further, the FCP Regulation,
                    which will come into effect in August 2014, contains requirements in this regard.


                    In practice, internal dispute mechanisms appear to follow this Good Practice.
                    Consumers have raised limited problems with disputes in the pension sector –
                    largely as these have not been sold as consumer products.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    Internal dispute mechanisms for the financial sector in general, including
                    pensions, are provided for by the Consumer Law and the new FCP Regulation.
                    See Banking Sector Good Practice E.1 for details of the Consumer Law and FCP
                    Regulation requirements.


                    Internal dispute mechanisms also appear to be provided, as a matter or practice,
                    by the main pension funds and providers. Disputes tend to occur around
                    administrative issues and virtually all are solved by these internal mechanisms
                    via HR departments or customer service centers. For example, one of the main
                    DPLK providers runs a Customer Member Service Committee that handles the
                    main complaints from individuals, from the media etc. They work with the legal
                    team and report to regional HQ in Hong Kong. Likewise, one of the leading
                    DPPK funds has a call center to handle complaints (most on why balances are
                    lower than expected – which is an education rather than a dispute issue). Neither
                    of these funds has ever had a problem which could not be solved internally. The
                    procedures follow international good practice, where by these dedicated service
                    lines would attempt to solve the problem themselves, and then escalate more
                    difficult / serious cases on to the management body. If these could not be solved
                    internally, the regulator would be notified.


                    Paragraph (b)
                    Major funds or providers have dedicated customer service teams or relevant
                    contacts within HR departments.


                    Paragraph (c)
                    Internal mechanisms are disclosed to members in all main communications. This
                    includes application forms, statements, on website etc., also when the join the
                    fund. The member’s HR department is often the first point of contact and they will
                    pass on any issue to these dedicated departments.


                    Paragraph (d)
                    OJK should make the checks contemplated by this Good Practice as part of their
                    supervisory process.
Recommendation      See the recommendations in Banking Sector Good Practice E.1.


                    A more detailed analysis of pension funds internal dispute mechanisms could
                    also usefully form part of the proposed review of the DPLK market.
Good Practice E.2   Formal Dispute Settlement Mechanisms
                    A system should be in place that allows consumers to seek third-party
                    recourse in the event they cannot resolve a pensions-related issue with
                    their employer or a pension management company.
Description                  The current statutory systems for the formal resolution of disputes concerning
                             pensions are fragmented and overlapping. Apart from recourse to his or her local
                             or District court, a consumer with an unresolved complaint concerning a pension
                             can only access the pension industry dispute resolution service in place for
                             DPPK funds (which has never been used) or the Consumer Dispute Resolution
                                     208
                             Board       . And, as of August 7, 2014, OJK will also be providing a service to
                             facilitate the resolution of outstanding consumer complaints under the FCP
                                           209
                             Regulation. OJK also has advocacy powers to take measures against financial
                             institutions to resolve complaints and to institute proceedings to reclaim property
                             or to recover damages on behalf of a consumer, as well as a financial institution
                                                       210
                             if it is the harmed party. In addition, Indonesia is a participant in the ASEAN
                             Committee on Consumer Protection that provides an avenue for consumers of
                                                                                                   211
                             any service or product to complain and seek compensation for loss.
                             Insurance Sector Good Practice E.2 has details of the BPSK and the FCP
                             Regulation dispute resolution schemes, as well as the proposed industry ADR
                             schemes, and including the concerns about the scope and application of these
                             schemes.


                             The previous pension regulator, Bapepam-LK, undertook dispute handling for the
                             sector. For example, their 2010 Pension Fund Report notes that: “ During 2010,
                             the Bureau had responded 52 complaints. […] Most complaints were delivered
                             directly in person (60%) and the rest by mails (40%).”


                             An external dispute mechanism has now been established for DPPK
                             occupational funds. The industry association (ADPI) set up a pension plan
                             mediation portal from 2012 (the association informally assisted the previous
                             regulator Bapepam-LK with any issues previous to this date). However, all
                             disputes have been settled internally and a case has never reported to them to
                             date.


                             For DPLK pension schemes, no industry mediation exists.


                             It is understood that little in the way of formal complaints or disputes have
                             occurred in the area of pensions. This sector has therefore not been a focus of
                                                               212
                             the consumer protection agency.
Recommendation               The financial sector wide dispute mechanisms could be made better known to
                             pension fund members. This should be made clear to pension fund members
                             both on the documents provided when they join the plan and on their annual
                             statements (information the organization and how to make contact if they have a

                    Establishing industry based mediation for DPLK pensions will be required under
                    the new FCP Regulation. A joint body serving all pension funds would seem the
                    most efficient mechanism and would meet OJK’s planned requirements for all
                    industries.

SECTION F           GUARANTEE SCHEMES AND SAFETY PROVISIONS


Good Practice F.1   Guarantee Schemes and Safety Provisions
                    Guarantee and compensation schemes are less common in the pensions
                    sector than in banking and insurance. There are more likely to be fiduciary
                    duties and custodian arrangements to ensure the safety of assets.
                       a. There needs to be a basic requirement in the law to the effect that
                          pension management companies should seek to safeguard pension
                          fund assets.
                       b. There should also be adequate depository or custodian
                          arrangements in place to ensure that assets are safeguarded.
Description         Pension fund assets are explicitly protected by fiduciary duties.


                    Paragraph (a)
                    The concept of fiduciary duty is stated clearly in the Pension Law (Article 51):
                    “The pension fund must be managed keeping in mind the interests of the
                    participants and other parties that are entitled to a pension benefit as stipulated
                    in the regulations of the pension fund.”


                    The Pension Law (Articles 11 and 45) also requires the pension fund to be a
                    separate legal entity from its founders or financial institution provider (including
                    separation of assets).


                    Paragraph (b)
                    A separate custodian is required for all pension assets.


                    There is no guarantee scheme providing back up for pension fund members in
                    situations where their plan sponsor goes bankrupt leaving an underfunded plan
                    with insufficient assets to pay out promise benefits. However, this situation has
                    not arisen in the country and is unlikely to as the funds appear to be run by large,
                    stable employers and many are closed to new members.
Recommendation      OJK could consider clarifying its position on guaranteeing an underfunded
                    pension fund in the event of a sponsor bankruptcy and should, in any event,
                    rigorously enforce solvency regulations to avoid such a situation.
SECTION G           CONSUMER EMPOWERMENT


Good Practice G.1   Using a Range of Initiatives and Channels, including the Mass Media
                       a. A range of initiatives should be undertaken to improve people's
                          financial capability.
                       b. The mass media should be encouraged by the relevant authority to
                          provide financial education, information and guidance to the public,
                          including on the private pensions sector.
                       c. The government should provide appropriate incentives and
                          encourage collaboration between governmental agencies, the
                          supervisory authority for private pensions, the private pension
                          industry and consumer associations in the provision of financial
                          education, information and guidance to consumers, particularly on
                          the private pensions sector.
Description         See recommendations in Banking Sector Good Practice G.1 and the Financial
                    Capability Report.
Recommendation      See recommendations in Banking Sector Good Practice G.1 and the Financial
                    Capability Report.
Good Practice G.2   Unbiased Information for Consumers
                       a. Financial regulators and consumer associations should provide, via
                          the internet and printed publications, independent information on
                          the key features, benefits and risks –and where practicable the
                          costs- of the main types of financial products and services,
                          including private pensions.
                       b. The relevant authority should adopt policies that encourage non-
                          government organizations to provide consumer awareness
                          programs to the public in the area of pensions.
Description         See recommendations in Banking Sector Good Practice G.1 and the Financial
                    Capability Report.
Recommendation      See recommendations in Banking Sector Good Practice G.1 and the Financial
                    Capability Report.
Good Practice G.3   Consulting Consumers and the Financial Services Industry
                       a. The relevant authority should consult consumer associations and
                          the private pension industry to help the authority develop financial
                          capability programs that meet the needs and expectations of
                          financial consumers, especially pension fund members and
                          affiliates.
Description         See discussion in Banking Sector Good Practice G.4.
Recommendation      OJK should use its convening power to bring together consumer groups
                    and the pension industry to develop financial capability programs that help
                    Indonesians deepen their understanding of private pensions.


                    For additional recommendations see Banking Sector Good Practice G.4.
Credit reporting in Indonesia is currently limited to the Credit Bureau operated by BI but is likely to be
opened up in the future to the private sector. The Biro Informasi Kredit (BIK) at BI started in 1968 collecting
information from regulated entities but went into a major enhancement in in 2005 and officially opened in
June 2006 by gathering positive and negative information on both individual and business provided by
banks and other creditors. Membership in the BIK is mandatory for commercial banks, large rural banks
(assets above 10B IDR), and voluntary for smaller rural banks, non-bank financial institutions, and
cooperatives. In total there are 120 banks, 1291 rural banks and 25 NBCIs participating in the system

reporting loans from around 77 million individuals. Currently there are no cooperatives participating in the
system and only around 5 multi-finance companies (who participate voluntarily). The only product that the
BIK offers is basic reports with a 24 month history known as Individual Debtor Information History (IDI).

In addition to the BIK, there is a private, unlicensed credit bureau operated by CRIF in partnership with
the Association of Credit Cards ( AKKI). The market will be opened to private credit bureaus once the
licensing regulation process is completed by the BI under the Credit Bureau Regulation No. 15 of 2013
(Credit Bureau Regulation). It is understood that BI intends to continue to operate BIK for at least five
years after this occurs, on the basis that it needs comprehensive and reliable credit information for the
purposes of its financial stability and macro prudential role in supervising the financial sector. However BI
recognizes the need for OJK to have access to this information as well.

Incidental information gathered by the mission team indicates that the requirements set by BI, especially
IT requirements and some customer data field requirements, have been hard to meet by NBCIs.
Additionally, NBCIs are concerned about potential penalties they may face for not being able to submit all
needed information on time, and there also seems to be some lack of understanding about the scope and
coverage of BIK and that NBCIs are authorized to join BIK.


As an alternative to BIK, AAPI (the multi-finance industry association) has also developed an informal
mechanism to share information of debtors, or black lists of debtors. In addition, it has developed a list of
debtors whose debt has been written off by multi-finance companies, as a way to comply with a tax code
requirement to publish this specific information. These arrangements have been an industry reaction to
the lack of an official credit database.


Asbindo is also starting to develop a credit database of all its members, which is expected to work in
parallel to other credit reporting databases. Thus, the current situation does not allow financial providers
to have a full picture of the total direct and indirect credit exposure of a potential borrower. Although it is
good that the industry has tried to come up with solutions to overcome the limited credit history
information available in Indonesia, these initiatives have several weaknesses. Examples include the lack
of information of the total exposure of a borrower in the financial sector, a lack of clarity as to the
procedures on how to correct wrong data, and the absence of confidentiality and privacy rules. Also, the
voluntary nature of this data exchange greatly limits its effectiveness. This situation highlights the need to
have an operative and comprehensive credit reporting system in Indonesia.

SECTION A           PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION


Good Practice A.1   Consumer Rights in Credit Reporting
                    Laws and regulations should specify basic consumer rights in these
                    respects. These rights should include:
                        a. The right of the consumer to consent to information-sharing based
                           upon the knowledge of the institution’s information -sharing
                           practices.
                        b. The right to access the credit report of the individual, subject to
                           proper identification of that individual and free of charge (at least
                           once a year).
                        c. The right to know about adverse action in credit decisions or less-
                           than-optimal conditions/prices due to credit report information. In
                           this process, consumers should be provided with the name and
                           address of the credit bureau.
                        d. The right to be informed about all inquiries within a period of time,
                           such as six months.
                        e. The right to correct factually incorrect information or to have it
                           deleted.
                        f. The right to mark (flag) information that is in dispute.
                        g. The right to decide if the consumer's credit information (for
                           purposes not related to the granting of credit) can be shared with
                           third parties.
                        h. The right to have sensitive information especially protected (not
                           included in the credit report), such as race, political and
                           philosophical views, religion, medical information, sexual
                           orientation or trade union membership.
                        i. The right to reasonable retention periods such as those for positive
                           information (for example, at least two years) and negative
                           information (for example, 5-7 years.)
                        j. The right to have information kept confidential and with sufficient
                           security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access, misuse
                           of data, or loss or destruction of data.
Description         There is only limited compliance with this Good Practice, and the relevant laws do
                    not apply in a consistent way to all credit providers holding a consumer’s credit
                    information.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    Consumer consent for information sharing for any purpose is not clearly required
                    under the credit reporting related laws and regulations. Importantly, the consent of
                    the relevant debtor is not a pre-requisite for access to personal data held by the
                    BIK (although, as a matter of practice, it may be obtained by the creditor), or by an
                    LPIP or for the transfer of data between BI and an LPIP.


                     Article 26 of the Electronic Transactions Law, which is of general application to
                    the processing of electronic information, provides that “ Unless provided otherwise
by Laws and Regulations, use of any information through electronic media that
involves personal data of a Person must be made with the consent of the Person
concerned.”


Further, Article 31 of the FCP Regulation is to the effect that financial services
providers are prohibited from disclosing customer data or information to third
parties in any manner, except in cases where the consumer gives written consent
and when disclosure is required by laws or regulations.


Users other than debtors are also given broad rights of access. In particular:


       Article 36 of the Credit Bureau Regulation provides for an LPIP to obtain
        credit information data from BI but does not require debtor consent; and

       Article 50 of the Credit Bureau Regulation allows the following users to
        access data: (a) financial institutions which become members of the
        LPIP; (b) non-Financial Institutions as referred to in Article 37 (1) (b)
        which serve as the source of data of the relevant LPIP; (c) other LPIPs;
        (d) Debtors or Consumers; and e) other parties. Articles 51 then provides
        that access to data by users in categories (a), (b), (c) and (d) may be in
        accordance with the LPIP’s procedures and / or as determined by
        agreement between the parties. Access by “other persons” must be in
        accordance with the need of the relevant party to perform their functions
        according to laws and regulations (Article 52). This provision would
        presumably, for example, cover BI and OJK to the extent they needed to
        obtain LPIP information for the purposes of their functions.


Although it may be common practice to allow the collection of credit information
without consent by public credit registries for banking supervision purposes, it is
good practice to require such consent for the collection of information by a private
credit bureau, whether that information is collected directly from the cons umer’s
financial institution or from a public credit registry (such as BIK). In addition it is
good practice to require consent, subject only to specific exemptions (such as a
requirement of law), before credit information data is accessed for any purpose.
However current regulations do not provide for such consent to be required
(although it might be obtained as a matter of practice by some credit providers).


Of particular importance in the present context is the provision in the Credit
Information Bureau Regulation for data to be provided by BI to LPIPs (Article 36).
Apart from the need to deal with the consent issues, there is a need to clarify the
type of data that can be transferred to an LPIP. Credit Registries such as BKI
collect some data items that are very relevant for banking supervision but not
relevant at all for market discipline. On the contrary, the transfer of such data
could create competition concerns in banks and other financial institutions (e.g.
information about interest rates, the amount provisioned for a loan and the
classification of the debt). In addition, it is not clear if this information will be
                         provided to LPIPs for free on one occasion only or if LPIPs will be systematically
                         provided with information by BKI.


                         Article 20 of the Debtor Information System Regulation 2007 also provides that
                                                                                    214
                         information held by BIK may be accessed by a “ Rapporteur ”, a Debtor or “other
                         parties”. However, as under the Credit Bureau Regulation, there is no requirement
                         for debtor consent as contemplated by this Good Practice.


                         Further, customer consent is not required for the informal information sharing
                         practices developed by the multi-finance industry association, AAPI (see
                         Overview above).


                         Paragraph (b)
                         Article 58(3) of the Credit Bureau Regulation provides that “Debtors or Customers
                         may obtain Credit Information free of charge from LPIP once in 12 (twelve)
                         months”. Article 1 in turn broadly defines “Credit Information” as “… products
                         and/or services provided by LPIP in writing, verbally or by other methods,
                         originating from credit data and other data owned by LPIP”.


                         Article 42 of the Debtor Information System Regulation 2007 also provides for
                         debtors to submit written requests for Debtor information.


                         Paragraph (c)
                         Article 23(1) of the Debtor Information System Regulation 2007 is to effect that if a
                         Rapporteur refuses to grant credit as a direct result of “ Debtor information”, the
                         Rapporteur must provide a “written explanation” to the concerned Debtor or
                         prospective Debtor on receipt of a written request. However, there is no
                         requirement to automatically tell Debtors about why a credit application has been
                         refused or to provide details of the BIK.


                         There is no requirement of the type contemplated by this Good Practice in the
                         Credit Bureau Regulation.


                         Paragraph (d)
                         There is no requirement of the type contemplated by this Good Practice.


                         Paragraph (e)
                         Chapter X of the Credit Bureau Regulation (Articles 59 – 62) contains detailed
                         provisions relating to the correction of Credit Information, including at the request
                         of the Debtor. If data is shown to be inaccurate, it must be corrected in 20

   Rapporteurs include Commercial Banks, BPRs, Non-Bank Financial Institutions, Credit Card Issuers, Banks, and
Credit Unions (Article 1 of Debtor Information System Regulation 2007).
business days by the LPIP (Article 61).


Although the Debtor Information System Regulation contains extensive provisions
relating to the correction of Debtor Reports (see especially Articles 11-16) and
makes provision for Debtors to access their personal information (Article 20), it
does not contain specific provisions allowing for correction of factually incorrect
information at the request of the Debtor.


Paragraph (f)
LPIPs are required to mark data in Credit Information which is the subject of a
complaint until all processes of complaints are completed (Article 62).


There is no requirement of the type contemplated by this Good Practice in the
Debtor Information System Regulation for BI.


Paragraph (g)
See paragraph (a) re the issue of consent.


Paragraph (h)
Article 46(d) of the Credit Bureau Regulation prohibits the inclusion in Credit Data
information which “contains ethnicity, religion, race and intergroup elements”.
However there does not appear to be an equivalent provision in the Debtor
Information System Regulation for BKI.


Paragraph (i)
Data retention periods are not sufficiently clear. Article 47 (1) of the Credit Bureau
Regulation appears to allow data which is provided by BI to an LPIP under Article
36 to be used for credit information purposes if it is no more than 2 years old.
However, there is no differentiation between active and closed accounts. Further,
information about arrears can be used under Article 47(2) until the debt is written
off or settled. However it is not clear if the information can be used afterwards for
any period. Further information on the number of data requests must be retained
for a year and information the subject of complaints must be flagged for a year
(Article 47(3)). Other matters relating to the currency of credit information are left
to the discretion of the LPIP, although there is a requirement to follow laws and
regulations relating to retention periods for corporate documents (Article 48). This
approach has the potential to lead to inconsistencies in approaches between
LPIPs and with the approach adopted by BI for the purposes of the BIK. It would
be preferable if retention periods were specifically mandated by regulation as
provided for by this Good Practice.


Paragraph (j)
The Credit Bureau Regulation requires an LPIP to “ maintain the accuracy,
currency, security and confidentiality of data.” (Article 34 (a)). Article 35 then
specifies in some detail the issues that must be dealt with in the LPIP’s policies
                             and operational procedures. Members of the Board and Commissioners of an
                             LPIP are also required to have a “strong commitment to preserve the
                             confidentiality and security of data and information” (Article 10(1)(a)(5) of the
                             Credit Bureau Regulation). There do not appear to be equivalent provisions in the
                             Debtor Information System Regulation.
Recommendation               BI and OJK should give early consideration to the issues highlighted above and
                             also in Banking Good Practice D.4. In particular:


                                     The overall supervision arrangements for credit reporting systems in
                                      Indonesia need be addressed;
                                     The role of OJK in managing the Indonesian credit registry (currently
                                      managed by BKI) needs to be clarified;
                                     Issues of debtor consent, access and correction rights and data retention
                                      requirements are important consumer protection issues which need to be
                                      addressed;
                                     There should be clear regulations dealing with on the type of data to be
                                      provided by BI to LPIPs, the limited purposes for which such data can be
                                      used, the frequency of data transfers and liability for data quality and
                                      security; and
                                     Importantly, debtors should have the same consumer protection rights,
                                      regardless of whether their information is held by BI, OJK, an LPIP or an
                                      informal credit information sharing arrangement such as that maintained
                                      by multi-finance companies through AAPI.



SECTION B                    CONSUMER EMPOWERMENT


Good Practice B.1            Unbiased Information for Consumers
                             Financial regulators should provide, via the internet and printed
                             publications, independent information for consumers that seek to improve
                             their knowledge for actively managing the credit report.
Description                  Bank Indonesia presents credit reporting information for consumers on its
                                    215
                             website . The website explains how the credit reporting system works, what the
                             records contain and how to dispute inaccuracies. The site also explains how
                             consumers can request a copy of their form.
Recommendation               Regulators should build on their efforts to educate the public on credit reporting by
                             creating engaging printed publications and multimedia education tool, and by
                             incorporating credit reporting lessons into existing materials and programs.
Good Practice B.2            Awareness of Credit Reporting
                             In order to ensure that financial consumer protection and educational
                             initiatives are appropriate, it is necessary to measure financial capability
                             with large-scale surveys that are repeated periodically. These surveys
                             should include questions on credit reporting and scoring.

Description      Both Bank Indonesia and OJK have recently conducted broadly-based consumer
                 surveys. Specifically, Bank Indonesia conducted a financial literacy survey in 2012
                 and found, among many other things, that Indonesians' level of financial literacy
                 correlated with gender, age, level of income, geography and level of general
                 education. For its part, OJK conducted a survey in 2013 of over 8,000 consumers
                 spread across 20 provinces and determined both the level of consumer
                 knowledge and utilization of six different types of financial products: banking,
                 insurance, finance (credit), pensions, capital markets and pawnshops. The results
                 from both of these consumer surveys, if shared with program developers, can
                 greatly assist financial capability efforts. Neither of the surveys extensively
                 covered the credit reporting and scoring issue. Further details of the OJK survey
                 are contained in Annex 1 to this report: Financial Literacy Stocktaking and
                 Analysis for Indonesia.
Recommendation   Government regulators, in their next consumer surveys should include questions
                 on credit reporting and scoring. In particular, it would be useful to know if
                 consumers knew what credit reports and credit scores are, how they can see a
                 copy of their report and how they can dispute errors. Additionally, consumers
                 should be queried as to whether they understand how they may affect their credit
                 scores and how their credit scores may affect them.
I. Executive Summary

While the financial literacy movement in Indonesia is still quite young, important foundations have already
been laid that can be built upon as the movement gains momentum in the years ahead. Financial literacy
in Indonesia first came to national attention in 2007 through the efforts of Bank of Indonesia which, years
later, was joined by OJK which launched a National Blue Print for Financial Literacy in 2013. The
presence of parallel program offerings across government agencies suggests that government providers
of programs will need to collaborate going forward to avoid creating redundancies, gaps and general
inefficiencies. Private sector development in this field has been modest and consists mostly (but not
entirely) of partnerships between large, multinational financial institutions and local or international NGOs.
Indonesian NGOs are beginning to see the value of financial capability training as an add-on service
which complements their general missions to reduce poverty. However, to date there is only one NGO in
Indonesia dedicated to financial capability as part of its core mission, and that organization is part of a
multinational NGO.

While the potential benefits of financial literacy to an emerging economy like Indonesia are great, there
are two significant issues that stand in the way of rapid and steady progress of the financial literacy
movement. The first is that many of the financial services executives interviewed for this analysis appear
to hold a narrow view of the purpose of financial literacy programs; namely that they exist primarily to
educate consumers on why, how and where to buy their products. Ultimately this approach will result is
less learning and less sales as consumers eventually abandon confusing, costly products with
unexplained risks and costs. The second issue is that the financial literacy movement lacks an
organizational structure.

The stock-taking exercise conducted for the purpose of this diagnostic revealed that the federal
government is the major provider of smaller financial capability programs and campaigns that span the
entire nation, while a number of partnerships such large financial institutions and multinational NGOs
provide more in-depth financial education in select areas. These programs vary in their approach but
frequently utilize an in-person lesson or seminar augmented with educational materials. There were also
a number of small, infrequent programs run by NGOs that were offered only when there was enough
interest and funding. Inclusion efforts can include promoting entry-level products, increasing access
through mobile interfaces and generally bringing consumers into the formal financial services system.

For next steps, OJK should leverage financial service providers' regulatory obligation to provide financial
literacy to help structure the nation's financial capability programmatic ecosystem. Article 14 of the FCP
Regulation affords OJK a rare opportunity to infuse Indonesia's financial capability movement with levels
of efficiency, quality and sustainability not seen in most countries. OJK could usefully merge its
compliance role in financial literacy with a coordination role to identify fundable projects and broker
partnerships between NGOs and financial institutions. By taking on such a role, OJK's Office of
Information and Education can help companies partner with NGOs and prevent firms from having to
choose between selling products and educating consumers. Moreover, by making itself a hub of the
financial capability community, OJK's Office of Information and Education can give the movement the
structure and support necessary to adequately meet the nation's financial literacy needs in the years
ahead.
II. Background

For the purposes of this analysis it is appropriate to start the history of financial literacy in Indonesia when
the Bank of Indonesia (BI) created an education task force on the subject in 2007. BI followed that up with
a series of programs and campaigns (described below), many of which are in place today. OJK's statutory
responsibility to provide financial education comes from the OJK Law which established the agency in
2011. Specifically the law states: “for the protection of consumers and the public, OJK is authorized to
take necessary actions to prevent consumers and the public from harms, which include: a. providing
information and educating the public on the characteristics of financial services sector, services, and
               216
products..."       With that law, OJK joined the government financial literacy effort, launched its own
programs and eventually put forth a national blue print for financial literacy in 2013. In 2013, OJK
promulgated the FCP Regulation which sets forth the consumer protection rules that OJK enforces on
financial service providers. Part of that regulation, Article 14, establishes an affirmative duty on the part of
financial service providers to provide the public with financial literacy education. It is understood that OJK
will clarify the requirements of the regulation under a circular to be released in 2014.

The Indonesian private sector's view of financial literacy appears to have experienced a slow evolution
the last few years. Based on conversations with industry executives, financial service providers have
moved from having a lack of awareness about financial literacy, to now seeing its importance, albeit with
an emphasis on using financial literacy programs for the marketing of financial products and services
(please see discussion below about the merits of separating financial education from marketing of
products and services). Despite this, a few important private sector financial literacy programs have
sprung up in Indonesia the last few years. The significant programs are detailed in the stock-taking below.

NGOs in Indonesia have also begun to recognize the value of financial literacy to their longstanding goals
of reducing poverty and empowering poor families. This is a typical and useful progression for the
financial literacy movement in many countries. Financial literacy training as an add-on service assures a
distribution network for any programs that are developed. NGOs typically encounter two hurdles once
they recognize that financial capability interventions can advance their broader mission. Both can be
overcome, but it will take special effort.

 First, NGOs must be prepared to make the case for financial literacy to their funders, in the context of
competing development priorities and agendas. The second hurdle is within the NGOs themselves.
Implementing a financial literacy program is relatively easy but designing and implementing a quality
program which achieves the desired impact is not. The difference is important because, eventually, NGOs
and funders will hope to see an impact from this experiment in financial capability. NGOs in Indonesia will
need the organizational perseverance, and develop or acquire the required program design skills, to
develop financial literacy programs which bring about the required expertise. When it comes to financial
literacy proficiency, NGOs in Indonesia appear to have arrived at this interim step – somewhere just
beyond introduction, but still far from mastery.

III. The Present: Promise and Challenge of Financial Literacy in Indonesia

Indonesia is very much in the early stages of its development of a national financial literacy movement.
Given Indonesia's status as an emerging economy, financial literacy has potential to assist economic


216
      Law No. 21 of 2011 on the Financial Services Authority, Article 28(a)
growth and raise the standard of living of its households. At the same time, the next few years are critical
to the movement's progress and present a few significant challenges that need to be addressed.

A. The Promise of an Effective National Financial Literacy (Capability) Effort

As a preliminary point, it is noted that the terms “ financial literacy” and “financial capability” are often used
interchangeably. The term “financial literacy” is a narrower term that represents the level of aptitude in
understanding personal finance matters, and often refers to awareness and knowledge of key financial
concepts. In contrast, the term “financial capability” has been defined as “the internal capacity to act in
one’s own best financial interest, given socio-economic environmental conditions. It encompasses the
knowledge (literacy), attitudes, skills and behaviors of consumers with regard to managing their
                                                                                                                217
resources, and understanding, selecting, and making use of financial services that fit their needs ”.
Although the term “financial literacy” is mostly used in this report (as that is the term mostly used in
Indonesia) where recommendations are made, is is intended that the term should be interpreted to
include relevant aspects of the financial capability concept.

Increasing the financial literacy (and the broader financial capability) of the Indonesian people holds
tremendous promise for the nation. Consumers with the knowledge, skills and confidence to engage with
Indonesia's growing financial services sector can not only help themselves and their households, but can
provide significant benefits to the broader economy as well.

Making financial literacy (and capability) a national priority can promote economic growth and financial
stability. As developing countries transition from export-driven economies to economies also fueled by
domestic consumption, the conduct of individual households becomes more important to plans for
national economic growth. In particular emerging economies like Indonesia can give rise to new markets
for financial products and services that many of its citizens have never seen before. This presents two
dangers for a nation which can jeopardize economic stability and growth.

First, Indonesians' potential overuse and abuse of these new financial products can be detrimental to the
nation’s economy if, for instance, greater access to credit leads to widespread over -indebtedness. In the
aggregate such a development on the household level can have negative repercussions on national
economic stability on the macro level as most recently demonstrated by the mortgage crisis in the US.

Second, and conversely, widespread fear of and consumer disengagement from the formal financial
system can slow the formation of a vibrant middle class and the growth of a domestic market for
Indonesia's goods and services. Through financial literacy initiatives, Indonesia can help its consumers
find the right balance and become participants in the financial services marketplace without becoming
victims, while enhancing prospects for continued stable economic growth.

Through financial literacy efforts, Indonesia can empower its people with the tools to better advance their
own financial interests and economic self-sufficiency. As shown in the 2013 OJK Financial Literacy
Survey, there are very low rates of usage of formal financial services. For example (the following
percentages are rounded figures):



217
    Source: “Financial Capability Programs Around the World. Why Financial Capability is important and how
surveys can help”. The World Bank August 2013. See also Xu, Lisa and Zia, Bilal, Financial Literacy in the
Developing World (January 1, 2013). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2248863 or
http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2248863
        While 97% of Indonesian adults know about banking products and services, only 57% use them;
        Around 59% of Indonesian adults know about insurance products and services, but only 12% are
         using them; and
      94% of Indonesian adults don’t know about capital markets products and services, and only .11%
                   218
         use them.
To help Indonesian consumers migrate to a regulated environment, they must first be taught the benefits
of mainstream financial products and services and they must also achieve the self-efficacy to actually
make such a move. Well-designed financial capability interventions can achieve both objectives. The
ultimate result of such efforts can be a consumer who has the knowledge and confidence to make
informed decisions and the ability to detect and avoid disadvantageous financial arrangements. Along
with the support of regulators, consumers can become empowered to play a role in securing their own fair
treatment. Unless Indonesians are provided financial education about responsible product usage, fraud
and avenues for redress, they remain vulnerable to both honest mistakes and bad actors.


B. Challenges to the Development of an Effective Financial Literacy Movement in Indonesia

Notwithstanding the best intentions of policy makers, two challenges stand in the way of creating a robust
financial literacy movement and making the case for its long-term effectiveness. First, as indicated in
several discussions with industry participants, there is a risk that many in the industry consider the
purpose of a financial literacy program is to sell financial products and services to consumers, regardless
of whether they meet their financial capacity, requirements objectives. Second, the financial literacy
movement, admittedly embryonic, has very little organizational structure and this will impair its ability to
achieve its objectives.

          1) Educate or Sell?
.
          If a consumer opens his or her first financial services (such as a bank account) without being able
          to assess whether the product is suitable for them and / or without being able to understand the
          terms and conditions, fees and charges, he or she may lose both money and confidence. That
          negative experience will taint any future relationship with that bank and, perhaps, banks in
          general. Likewise, if a consumer opens a credit line without understanding how interest
          compounds or how to manage a budget to afford the payments, that consumer may have a bad
          experience with the credit card company and be less likely to borrow through the formal sector
          again. Similar examples can be offered for insurance, securities and many other financial
          products. The end result may be a lack of trust in the financial sector, and a failure to achieve
          financial inclusion targets.

          Of course the alternative to this scenario is to build the consumer’s ov erall financial capability
          first. As noted above, financial capability is the internal capacity to act in one’s best financial
          interest given socio-economic environmental conditions. It encompasses knowledge (literacy),
          attitudes, skills and behaviors of consumers with regard to managing their resources, and

        understanding, selecting and making use of financial services that best meets their needs.
        Building the financial capability of consumers is a prerequisite to growing a market of people who
        are not just willing to buy a product, but ready and able to use it as well. Viewed this way,
        educating a group of people can transform them into potential long term customers of financial
        industry products, instead of informal financial products and services. This can unlock potential
        markets for the industry and this can be of great benefit. However experience gained in interviews
        and meetings during the preparation of this document suggests that financial industry have not
        yet been persuaded that they should risk a valuable touch-point they have with a consumer by
        teaching him or her instead of selling. However it is not necessarily the case that there is only one
        touch point with the consumer. Section V - Next Steps, describes how other purely educational
        channels can be opened to the consumer, so that a company's active support of financial
        capability can complement that company's sales mission instead of competing with it.

        2) Channeling Growth for Greater Efficiency and Quality
        The second challenge to the development of Indonesia's financial literacy movement is limited
        and uncoordinated growth. In most countries where financial literacy is new, a few organizations
        will experiment with financial literacy programs for youth or adults. The motivations for starting
        such programs vary by country and economy-type, but they can include preparing older workers
        for retirement, preparing youth for the future, empowering underserved consumers and many
        other reasons. Over the course of a few years, the organic growth of these programs inspires an
        NGO or government agency to play a coordination role which can help in the efficient allocation of
        resources by a number of funders and, in some cases, even help with the quality of the programs
        funded and produced. Unfortunately, by the time this will likely happen in Indonesia, it may be too
        late.

        In 2014, all financial service providers regulated by OJK will have a clear regulatory obligation to
        educate consumers under Article 14 of the FCP Regulation which provides that “Financial
        Services Providers shall carry out education in order to improve the financial literacy of
        consumers and/or the community” (Article 14(1)). As indicated below in the stock-taking only a
        small fraction of those firms presently have any kind of a financial literacy program and there
        does not appear to be any coordination amongst the huge number and significant range of
        providers. The risk is that financial services providers will make rushed investments to create their
        required programs and there will not be any consultation or coordination amongst program
        providers, resulting in significant fragmentation of efforts, inefficient use of resources and little
        impact on financial literacy levels (or the broader financial capability levels.

        Section V - Next Steps discussed how OJK might use its authority under Article 14 of the FCP
        Regulation to avoid this outcome.

IV. Stock-taking

A. Methodology
Over the time period from September 17 through October 31 of 2013, financial literacy funders and
practitioners were interviewed in Jakarta to gain information for this stock-taking (see Annex IV). In
November, follow up surveys were also sent to many of those who were interviewed in Indonesia to gain

can help”. The World Bank August 2013.
additional information. Online research was also performed to learn of or learn more about particular
programs or entities.

This introductory diagram serves as a quick at-a-glance visual representation of this stocktaking exercise,
described in more detail in the accompanying narrative. To the extent possible, initiatives are categorized
as government-led, private sector-led, or NGO-led.




        B. Government

        Bank of Indonesia (BI)

        1) Social Marketing Campaign - 3Ps Campaign: In 2009 BI launched the "3Ps" education
        campaign to encourage consumers to carefully consider the terms and conditions of any financial
        products and services they may wish to obtain, including banking products and services. "3Ps"
stand for "ensure benefits, understand the risk and consider the costs." The campaign seeks to
influence consumers to think through matters like fees, rights and obligations before deciding to
use a financial product or service. The campaign is supported by the distribution of 39 different
brochures, two comic books and two brief consumer handouts, as well as live events and
promotion through the media.

2) Social Marketing Campaign - Ayo ke Bank: In 2008 BI initiated the Ayo ke Bank ("Let's Go
to the Bank") campaign. The campaign used a range of communication channels including mass
media such as radio, television commercials, newspaper and websites as well as other
communication methods like education cars, posters, brochures, and visits to bank branches. The
message to citizens is to consider the benefits of using the banking system over the informal
system and to not be intimidated by financial institutions. As an extension of this campaign in
2010, BI launched the TabunganKu program which required banks to provide low cost accounts,
with a modest minimum balance and no administration fee. The pairing of a targeted message
with broad access to a product allowed consumers to receive new information that they could
immediately act upon.

3) School-based curriculum: BI has developed a youth financial literacy program for Indonesian
schools. The program covers basic financial education topics. The personal finance module is
being distributed nationally though high schools and is presently being piloted in elementary and
junior high schools in seven areas. BI also provides teacher training to increase effective usage of
the program in schools. The program is the result of a memorandum of understanding between BI
and the Ministry of Education.

4) In-Person Adult Education: BI has created materials and holds seminars for particular
segments of the population such as housewives, migrant workers and workers in the fishing and
agricultural industries. The subject of these interventions is basic savings, financial management
and entrepreneurship.

5) Financial Literacy Survey: BI conducted a financial literacy survey in 2012 and found, among
many other things, that Indonesians' level of financial literacy correlated with gender, age, level of
income, geography and level of general education. Information regarding methodology and
additional findings were not made available.

Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK)
1) Grassroots Outreach - Mobile Education Units: OJK operates a fleet of cars that visits
communities to distribute educational materials. This channel is particularly useful in reaching
rural locations. While this program has been operating since 2008, the present intention is to re-
launch it with the goal of increasing the size of the fleet from seven cars to 20 before 2014.

2) In-Person Adult Education: OJK also provides seminars targeted to housewives. The
seminars are hosted by OJK staff and representatives from the financial services industry and
seek to increase attendees' knowledge and use of financial products.

3) National Blue Print for Financial Education: OJK launched Indonesia's first national blue
print for financial literacy on November 19, 2013 at a high profile event which will was led by
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. The blue print development process had been ongoing
since April of 2013 and received technical advice from the World Bank from mid-September
through October, 2013. The blue print sets out an aggressive agenda of establishing the essential
elements of the nation's financial literacy infrastructure, which will, in time, empower Indonesian
consumers with the product knowledge, planning ability and decision-making skills to enter the
financial mainstream and thrive within it. The blue print focuses primarily on what OJK will do in
the years ahead, however, industry involvement will be detailed in a supplement to the blue print
which will be released in the near future.

Specifically, the national blue print contains three pillars to improve financial literacy in Indonesia.
The first pillar is to provide financial education through a national campaign which consists of
community-based seminars, university workshops, cultural programs and media outreach. The
second pillar calls for OJK to strengthen the financial literacy infrastructure which includes
enhancing its customer care call center, increasing its web presence, sending more financial
literacy cars to less accessible communities and periodically conducting its national financial
literacy survey. The third pillar is for OJK to work with the financial services industry to develop
low cost financial products and services.

OJK has chosen to focus on specific segments of the population for educational interventions in
each of the next five years according to the following schedule:

   2014: Housewives and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)
   2015: Students and Professionals
   2016: Pensioners
   2017: Housewives and MSMEs
   2018: Students and Professionals

4) National Survey on Financial Literacy: OJK conducted a survey in 2013 of over 8,000
consumers spread across 20 provinces and determined both the level of consumer knowledge
and utilization of six different types of financial products: banking, insurance, finance (credit),
pensions, capital markets and pawnshops. The survey was released in November of 2013 and
found that for most types of financial products Indonesian adults had a low levels of knowledge
and utilization of formal financial services. Specifically:

   Banking: 21.8% of respondents believed they were literate on banking products and services
    while 42.7% reported using banking products and services.
   Insurance: 17.8% of respondents believed they were literate on insurance products and
    services while 11.8% reported using insurance products and services.
   Multi-finance: 9.8% of respondents believed they were literate on multi-finance products and
    services while 6.3% reported using multi-finance products and services.
   Pension: 7.13% of respondents believed they were literate on pension products and services
    while 1.5% reported using pension products and services.
   Securities: 3.8% of respondents believed they were literate on securities products and
    services while 0.1% reported using securities products and services.
   Pawnshop: 14.9% of respondents believed they were literate on pawnshop products and
    services while 5.0% reported using pawnshop products and services/

National Board for the Placement and Protection of Indonesian Overseas Migrant Workers
("Board") Targeted, Intense Training Program: The Board partnered with the World Bank in
this program to field a financial literacy pilot program which was designed to educate overseas
migrant workers and their families on basic financial literacy matters. This was done in
cooperation with other national and district level authorities. The program involved 400 migrant
worker households and offered intense in-person training sessions to workers (18 hours) and/or
their families (eight hours). The training focused on financial management, banking, savings, loan
management, insurance and remittances. The course used comic books, pamphlets, games,
exercises, case studies and experiential learning techniques to reinforce lessons taught during
the class. The pilot program found that training of both migrant workers and their family members
can positively influence both knowledge and behavior on matters such as savings, overuse of
credit, budgeting and financial planning.

Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs
Policies/Directives to Encourage Financial Capability: The Ministry used its authority to
establish guidelines to require cooperatives to educate members and prospective members of
cooperatives on financial capability matters through the issuance of guidelines for Saving and
Loan Cooperatives (2004) and Islamic Financial Cooperatives (2007). Additionally the Ministry of
Cooperatives entered into a series of memoranda of understanding from 2000 through, at least,
2010 with the Ministry of Education in support of financial capability. Specifically the agreements
called for the ministries to work together to enhance the financial skills and knowledge of students
who might pursue careers in micro, small and medium enterprises. These efforts are examples of
how government agencies can attempt to effectuate change in a nation's level of financial
capability without directly developing and implementing a program.

C. Private Sector
1) Contest - Citi's Microentrepreneurship Awards Program: Citi Foundation partners with the
economics faculty of the University of Indonesia to recognize and encourage microentrepreneurs
in all provinces in Indonesia. Citi performs outreach to microentrepreneurs and conducts
seminars to instruct them on financial capability matters. As part of this outreach, Citi conducts
surveys in local communities to determine those individual entrepreneurs who have shown great
creativity and social concern on their path to financial self-empowerment. Those who are found to
best promote financial inclusion in their entrepreneurial efforts are recognized at ceremonies
hosted by Citi volunteers. In the last seven years Citi has recognized 82 individuals though this
program.

2) Distribution of Printed Materials and Media Outreach - Citi's Use Credit Wisely booklet:
Citi produced 10,000 copies of a financial capability booklet which explains to readers how to
create a monthly budget, initiate a savings plan, manage debt and invest wisely to meet near-
term obligations and to maximize long-term financial interests. The books were distributed two
ways. First, books were made available to customers through Citi's network of branches. Second,
books were distributed to personal finance journalists as part of a Citi-sponsored "Use Credit
Wisely" road show. Road show events permitted Citi subject matter experts to teach journalists
important lessons and answer insightful questions about consumer credit and financial literacy
more broadly. The theory behind the road show was that many consumers ultimately get much of
their important information on financial matters from the news media; so to educate the media is
to effectively educate the public. The show took place in the cities of Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya
and Medan and reached about 50 journalists.

3) Television Program - Citi's "Your Money" program: Through a partnership with Visi Anak
Bangsa ("Vision of the Children of the Nation Foundation"), in 2008 Citi Foundation produced a
series of 26 five-minute mini-programs which ran every Saturday morning on Metro TV, one of
Indonesia's leading television stations. The programs covered various money matters such as
credit cards, consumer loans and investing in an approachable way that was designed to
introduce a mass audience to financial topics that might otherwise bore or intimidate them. In time
the show became interactive as viewers would send emails with comments and questions which
would stimulate ideas for future programs. Positive feedback was received from a broad range of
consumers including students, housewives, mircro and small business entrepreneurs and office
workers.

4) Youth, School-based Edu-tainment - Citi's The Adventures of Agent Penny program: Citi
Foundation contributed USD 117,000 and bank volunteers to a partnership with Yayasan Mitra
Mandiri Indonesia (United Way Indonesia) to reach elementary school students in Jakarta
schools. The program consisted of live theatrical performances that teach children the importance
and the power of saving money. Each performance is followed by distribution of a comic book
series that teachers can use to reinforce the message of the event. Program content is also
available via a website and social media. Over the last five years 390 performances have been
held from 36,322 students. Over 5,000 students follow Agent Penny on social media and the
program has generated 74,600 website subscribers.

5) Youth, Sports-Themed Program - Permata Bank: Working with the Asian Sports Academy,
Permata Bank sponsors a small pilot program which seeks to infuse youth financial education
with instruction on sports, particularly soccer and basketball. Money management is treated as a
values-based life skill and these values are introduced and practiced in an outdoor learning
environment. The nine-month program takes a mixed-gender group of 60 students and combines
financial education with instruction and practice in the two sports. The program sponsors state
that students are regularly tested to measure the program's impact, but such data has not yet
been made public.

6) In-school Bank Branch - Mandiri's Mini-branch Program: Bank Mandiri has partnered with
the Ministry of Education along with BI to introduce mini bank branches to 80 schools nationwide.
The program serves students in elementary, junior and high school and uses a mix of traditional
classroom teaching and experiential learning to convey lessons about banking, credit and other
personal finance topics. In the mini-branch students engage in guided role-play as customers,
tellers and customer service representatives. Students also use the mini-branch to start and
access savings accounts. Additionally, monthly lessons presented in classrooms cover in depth
topics introduced in the mini-branch, such as bank account management and using debit and
credit cards. Teachers also use an on line "mini-banking lab" to present a module to students that
reinforces financial literacy lessons. To date the program has impacted over 30,000 students
nationwide.

7) Migrant Worker Seminars and Distance Learning - Mandiri's Mandiri Sahabatku
program: Bank Mandiri works with Ciputra University to provide financial capability lessons to
Indonesian migrant workers both while they are in Indonesia and while they are abroad. The
program consists of lessons on financial planning, entrepreneurship and other financial topics.
The lessons are presented in a classroom environment in Hong Kong and Malaysia which make
use of both lecture and role play. Mandiri also offers web-based lessons targeted to migrant
workers in Singapore, Taiwan and Middle Eastern countries as well as locations within Indonesia.
In both the live and on-line versions of the program, financial simulations and mentoring are
important components of the program. To date the program has over 5,000 participants and has
generated 10,950 Facebook friends and 5,700 Mandiri Sahabatku Facebook Group discussion
members.
8) Classroom-Based Lesson with Volunteer Assistance: Citi's Participation in Prestasi
Junior's Personal Finance program. Citi has partnered with the financial capability NGO Prestasi
Junior to teach 29 lessons each to 4,500 high school students in 18 schools in East Java,
primarily in Surabaya and Sidoarjo. The principal skill taught in this course is personal budgeting.
This involves understanding revenue and expenditures, which permits lessons on responsible
debt, credit card use, banking and non-banking financial institutions and an introduction to
investment opportunities. The program makes use of hands-on learning which can involve
classroom games and exercises as well as on-line simulations. Most instruction is done by
classroom teachers, but Citi volunteers present some of the lessons. All 15 of the Citi volunteer
facilitators were trained by Prestasi Junior in this particular lesson. Extensive program metrics
were recorded to measure student results. At the conclusion of the program the vast majority of
the students had begun to live under a monthly budget, established savings accounts and
increased their overall savings.

9) In-Person Adult Education - ANZ's Money Minded program: In 2012 ANZ's Money Minded
program was delivered to 150 women in underdeveloped areas with the assistance of the NGO
Yayasan Cinta Anak Bangsa (YCAB). YCAB provides microloans to women primarily in the
densely populated Tanah Abang district. Many of these women are unbanked and in need of
financial capability. The program covers a number of financial issues including budgeting, basic
banking, dealing with debt and consumer protection matters. According to ANZ the program
prepares participants to emerge ready to engage productively with the financial services system
and aware of their rights and avenues for redress.

10) School-Based Lessons and Academic Competition - HSBC's Participation in Prestasi
Junior's More Than Money program: With the support from HSBC of both a grant and 67 bank
volunteers, Prestasi Junior offers its More Than Money program in 18 Jakarta Middle Schools
reaching over 2,500 students. The program consists of two parts. First, volunteers and teachers
guide students through six structured lessons on understanding money and banking, work ethic
and earning a living, budgeting and goal setting, building a business, financial decision making
and being able to spot deceptive advertising and bad deals. The second part is a student
competition where students compete with other schools on their knowledge of the above topics.
The competitions are held in public and inspire a great deal of excitement and school spirit. The
program showed knowledge gains of 32% among the students exposed to it.

11) School-based Financial Education Curriculum - Allianz's Sponsorship of My Money
Coach: The Allianz Peduli Foundation sponsors the My Money Coach program for junior high
and high school students in Yogyakarta. The program consists of curriculum, lectures, games and
role plays which focused on a variety of financial topics and has reached over 5,000 students
over the last three years.

12) Community-Based Adult Financial Capability Education - Allianz Peduli Foundation:
Allianz educates low income adults, including micro-entrepreneurs as part of its adult financial
capability program. Working with local government agencies and NGOs, Allianz has educated
over 1,000 adults across 20 Indonesian cities in the last 3 years. Allianz associates teach some of
the lessons while other parts of the program use a train-the-trainer model staffed by local NGOs.
The subjects covered include acquisition and utilization of a bank account, managing credit
obligations, risk and insurance and managing money for a family and a small business.
13) School-Based Financial Capability Education - AXA's sponsorship of Prestasi Junior's
Insure Your Success Program: AXA, through a grant and 20 company volunteers, helps 490 of
Jakarta's middle and high school students from lower socio-economic backgrounds learn about
insurance and other money issues through the Insure Your Success program. The program uses
student workbooks, curricula and posters as part of a three-lesson unit which teaches students to
make wise financial choices. Specifically, students learn how to create a family budget and the
importance of saving. During the program students learn that no matter how carefully people plan
their finances unforeseen events can occur, such as natural disasters, accidents, or illness.
Students are introduced to the concept of insurance and how it can provide greater financial
stability and protection against life’s unexpected events. The advantages of protecting one’s
assets are illustrated and students become familiar with the most common types of insurance
such as property, motor and health insurance.

14) Extra-curricular Financial Capability Module for Youth - Prudential's sponsorship of
Prestasi Junior's Ourselves, Our Families, Our Community program: Through a grant and
employee volunteers, Prudential supported this elementary educational program that took place
at rented facilities at a Jakarta university over the course of five Saturdays in the fall of 2013. The
program uses workbooks, volunteers from business, field trips and other applied learning tools to
teach three major lessons to students involving themselves, their families and their communities.
Specifically, students are taught lessons about cooperating with others, taking responsibility and
setting personal goals in the Ourselves lesson. In the Our Families lesson, students are taught
about the roles adults like their parents play in the local economy, what types of jobs they hold
and how they balance their needs and their wants to maintain a financially stable household.
Finally, in the Our Community lesson, students learn about organizations like businesses and
government that help make up a community and the type of occupations one might hold as part
of these entities.

15) Adult Financial Capability Seminar Targeted to Women - Prudential's financial
management program for street vendors: Working with the Women's Empowerment and Child
Protection Ministry and the Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry, Prudential has fielded a
program to help women street vendors to become more financially capable. For five years
Prudential has convened these trainings in six cities across Indonesia, with each session drawing
about 250 women. The focus of the education is to instruct program participants in the value and
use of bank accounts and other bank products. Many program participants report keeping their
business profits at home because they fear doing business with a bank. Other participants say
that before the seminar they regularly received credit from local loan sharks who imposed high
interest rates, instead of seeking loans from banks or finance companies. The program seeks to
provide both knowledge and encouragement for participants to join the mainstream of financial
services.

16) Collective Industry Effort to Reach University Students - the Insurance Goes to
Campus program: Member companies of the Indonesian Insurance Council cooperate to
support the "Insurance Goes to Campus" program which sponsors lectures on university
campuses given by insurance industry executives. The lectures cover basic insurance principles,
financial planning, insurance sales, risk management, as well as roles and functions within a life
insurance company. The program has been running for a number of years and has standing
invitations to return to university campuses it has visited before.
17) Low Income Adult Education using a Train-the-Trainer model - Western Union's
sponsorship of the Our World, Our Family program: Partnering with the international NGO
Mercy Corp, Western Union has established and supported a program to educate the urban poor
in several neighborhoods of Jakarta. The program's emphasis is financial capability skills for
microentrepreneurs, and seeks to educate participants in banking alternatives to microfinance
companies as those companies might not offer a full range of products at competitive prices to
consumers. Through a USD 100,000 grant, Western Union funds Mercy Corp to train community
leaders and members of local NGOs on the delivery of financial education. Once trained, these
individuals are given teaching materials and begin to engage their respective communities with
the financial capability program.

18) International Comparative Survey of Financial Capability - MasterCard's 2013 Index of
Financial Literacy: Mastercard measured financial literacy across the Asia Pacific region and
focused on three components of national financial literacy in coming up with its rankings. First,
Mastercard looked at basic money management which includes a population's ability to used
credit wisely and budget money. On this measure the survey ranked Indonesia 14th out of 16
Asia Pacific countries. Second, Mastercard surveyed on financial planning which includes
knowledge of financial products and services and the ability to engage in long term financial
planning. On this issue Indonesia ranked 13th out of 16. Finally, the survey examined a country's
ability to understand and manage investment products and services. Indonesia was found to be
14th out of 16 countries. This is the second time in two years Mastercard has conducted this
survey. Details regarding the survey's methodology were not available.

19) Web-based Financial Capability Game - Visa's Financial Football/Soccer: Visa has
offered a quiz game to countries all over the world including Indonesia. Visa uses a
football/soccer interface for the game and customizes it for the language and sports team of each
country. The game is accessed via the web and is targeted to a high school age audience.

20) International Comparative Study on Financial Capability - Visa's 2012 International
Survey: Visa conducted a survey which examined 28 countries on financial capability issues and
issued rankings. In the overall ranking Indonesia was 27th out of 28 ranking only above Pakistan.
There were a few notable findings relative to Indonesia. First, Indonesia ranked lowest of all 28
countries surveyed on the frequency with which adults discussed money issues with children.
Second, ironically, Indonesians ranked second of 28 countries in adults' confidence in their young
people's ability to manage money. Third, only 14% of Indonesian adults report having enough
savings to withstand a three month personal financial emergency. Details regarding the survey's
methodology were not available.

21) Youth Materials linked to Adult Financial Advice - Rumah Cerdas program: Through a
website an organization that appears to be a private sector firm, Rumah Cerdas, sells financial
literacy materials for youth. The program seems designed to intertwine youth financial education
with financial advice for the adults in the family as the website appears to market these services
as well.

22) Seminars for Adults with some Materials for Children - the Indonesian Stock
Exchange's Investor Education Program: While it does not keep records on the reach or
impact of its programs, the Exchange regularly holds a number of educational programs at the
stock exchange, at regional locations and on college campuses. Additionally, the Exchange has
developed comic books and workbooks for youth which address basic financial issues like saving
and entrepreneurship as well as more advanced topics like investing. Beyond these more
traditional programs, the Exchange performs outreach in more creative ways such as through the
organization of an investor club, educational seminars for journalists and by providing specialized
programs for women through a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Women.

D. Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)
1) Peer-to-Peer Lending to Women Combined with Financial Literacy - Good Returns
Education Program: Good Returns is conducting financial capability training for women in West
Kalimantan. This training is funded by micro-loans individual donors make to individual borrowers
through the Good Returns organization. With the returns from the loans, lenders can reinvest in
another borrower or apply the funds to financial literacy programs like the one taking place in
West Kalimantan. Good Returns also receives a matching grant for funds raised this way through
AusAid. The result has been a 2013 program in which the Good Returns staff trained and
equipped 16 staff members of Credit Union Keling Kumang and 18 present borrowers, to deliver
financial education to credit union members and other consumers in the community.

2) Pilot Financial Literacy Index - USAID's Pilot Index: In 2013 USAID funded a pilot study to
construct a financial literacy index in Indonesia. The effort received the cooperation of OJK. The
purpose of the study was to classify groups of surveyed Indonesians based on their level of
financial literacy and then attempt to correlate their financial conduct to their respective levels of
knowledge. The study found that, while other studies have stated that wealth level is predictive of
a high level of financial literacy, it is actually the case that having a high level of education is the
real driver of a higher level of financial literacy in Indonesia. The study also found that only 36%
of Indonesia respondents prefer to save extra money at a bank while 22% prefer to keep the
money at home and 15% prefer to spend extra money. Additionally, the study determined that
only 48% of Indonesians knew that bank deposits are guaranteed by the government.

While there are numerous NGOs that engage in programs that directly or indirectly assist with
financial inclusion or economic well-being in Indonesia, this stock-taking focused on organizations
that operated dedicated programs for financial capability. The most significant NGOs have been
referenced above for their roles with government or private sector partners in fielding financial
literacy programs previously described. For completeness, those NGOs are listed again in this
section without repeating the programs they operate.

Prestasi Junior: Known as Junior Achievement in many other countries this organization has
been providing financial literacy and entrepreneurship education for over 100 year and has over
50 global programs. Funded mostly by corporate donations, Junior Achievement creates
materials for students and teachers and trains executives to enter schools and help in the
teaching of the materials and the coordination of business simulations.

Yayasan Mitra Mandiri Indonesia (United Way Indonesia): This 18 year old NGO brings
together contributions from major corporate donors to improve the education, health and incomes
of the Indonesian people.

Asian Sports Academy: Begun by professional soccer clubs 11 years ago, the Academy and its
foundation offers programs to empower and motivate disadvantaged people throughout Asia.
Most of its programs combine education and sports training.
        NGO Yayasan Cinta Anak Bangsa (YCAB - "Loving the Nation's Children Foundation"):
        YCAB has been focused on development of underprivileged youth in Indonesia for 14 years
        through programs that promote healthy lifestyles, education and economic empowerment.

        Mercy Corp: Mercy Corp is a global humanitarian agency which was founded 34 years ago and
        does a broad range of work to fight poverty in over 40 countries.

V. Next Steps
As described above the next few years will be critical to the development of a functioning, effective
financial literacy movement in Indonesia. In particular the two dangers of a sales-oriented approach to
financial capability and the lack of structure imperil this field's success and the support it can offer to a
growing Indonesian economy. Both issues are addressed below in the three recommended next steps.

A. Establishing an Efficient, Sustainable Programmatic Ecosystem for Financial Literacy in
Indonesia

There are four important stakeholder groups in establishing a thriving financial capability movement in
Indonesia, as in all countries: the private sector, government, NGOs, and consumers. As demonstrated
by a few of the programs in the stock taking, some financial institutions partnered with NGOs to deliver
and execute their programs. This happens frequently in most countries and has a number of benefits. Of
course consumers, divided into different segments by age, income, gender, profession, etc. are the ones
served by these programs.

The final actor is government. In a few countries, such as the UK and South Africa, specific levies on the
financial service industry are channeled to a government, or government related organization which
permits those agencies to create a number of elaborate programs themselves. In many other countries
budgets for financial capability efforts are much more limited, which means government agencies can
field a few select programs while serving as a public advocate for the issue of financial literacy.
Additionally, in most countries the office of financial education or its equivalent tries to find a way to
coordinate and co-opt efforts by the private sector and NGOs with varying success.

By contrast to many of these government agencies, OJK has an opportunity to use Article 14 of the FCP
Regulation to play a more activist and helpful role in the development of its nation's financial literacy
movement. In addition to creating some of its own programs and materials, OJK can identify particular
target groups (as has been done in the 2013 Financial Literacy Blueprint), coordinate, and share
learnings from, programs provided by financial services providers, broker relationships between financial
service providers and with NGOs and generally raise the quality and effectiveness of programs
nationwide so that the resources dedicated to financial capability, government or private, are invested in
an optimal way.

As the mission team understands is intended, OJK should issue an explanatory circular on Article 14 to
provide guidance for financial services providers. The Circular could, for example, set out OJK’s
expectations in relation to: consistency with the National Financial Literacy Blueprint; the expected size,
scale and priority areas for the relevant programs; the role and responsibilities of senior management;
rules relating to impact measurement and evaluation; coordination between financial institutions and the
requirements for reporting to OJK.

The Financial Inclusion Support Framework proposes technical assistance to OJK on the development of
this circular. Such support may consist of:
       Assistance in the development of the process for the implementation of the regulation;
       Providing guidelines for financial institutions required to develop programs;
       Design of a reporting framework for financial services providers which covers both reporting on
        plans for the reporting period and reporting on achievements in the previous reporting period;
       Developing metrics and examination procedures for OJK to use in assessing financial literacy
        plans and programs which could possibly include some kind of rating system for mid and large
        sized financial services firms;
       Training OJK examiners who will review such plans and programs; and
       Helping plan and deliver training to financial services associations to assist them with compliance
        efforts by their members.

B. OJK as a Center of Expertise in Financial Capability

As OJK continues to define its role and adds staff, it should consider making itself a center of financial
literacy (and capability) programmatic expertise in addition to its other roles. While high level coordination
should be carried on across all agencies with a stake in financial capability, such as BI, Ministry of
Finance, the Ministry of Education and several others, OJK's Office of Information and Education should
make itself a resource in designing, developing, delivering and evaluating financial capability
programming. This includes staying abreast of the latest financial literacy research worldwide and giving
technical assistance to financial services providers and NGOs that seek to launch programs. Just as
other parts of OJK are substantive experts in their areas of regulation, the Office of Information and
Education should become and remain experts in financial capability programming.

Other useful activities for which Technical Assistance is proposed under the Financial Inclusion Support
Program include the provision of financial literacy resources through the OJK Financial Literacy website
and the further development of the financial literacy focus of the Halo OJK Call Center.

C. OJK as a Hub of the Indonesian Financial Capability Community

OJK's Office of Information and Education could also cultivate a community around financial capability.
The people who regularly work on financial capability issues within financial services providers, NGOs,
government, universities and community groups will benefit from networking with each other and sharing
experiences. The Office of Information and Education is uniquely positioned to convene these individuals
through themed events and programs, conferences, panel discussions and seminars as well as through
the OJK Financial Literacy website. The events can serve to share best practices and, if open to the
public, can help OJK increase the size of the community and learn about new members and their financial
literacy programs.

Finally, by giving some structure to Indonesia's financial capability movement, OJK's role as a hub
addresses the second danger identified in Section III. With OJK's Office of Information and Education in a
coordination role, gaps and redundancy in programming will be avoided. Also as a repository of best
practices and research, OJK will increase the level of quality of programs offered by financial services
providers, NGOs and government agencies.
