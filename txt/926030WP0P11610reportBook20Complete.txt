                                                        1. Introduction
         Through the livelihoods support component of the South Sudan DDR Pilot Reintegration Project all
         290 ex-combatants participating had the opportunity to benefit from reintegration support. In
         addition, community members joining the ex-combatants in cooperative work were also eligible to
         receive training. The training sessions included (i) follow-up training in business skills/financial
         literacy/business motivation and (ii) training in agricultural business/agronomy practices. In sum, all
         ex-combatants at the Mapel Transitional Facility attended entrepreneurship, cooperatives and
         financial literacy trainings held for 10
         days on site. This was followed by in-
         state follow-up trainings where in
         Phase 1 a total of 537 people
         benefited       including     253     ex-
         combatants and 284 community
         members and in Phase 2 a total of
         399     people       benefited    directly
         including 270 ex-combatants and
         129 community members. All ex-
         combatants were offered a livelihood
         start-up kit which was collected by
         288 of the 290 participants. The
         following report details the process,
         achievements and lessons learned
         from this component.

                1.1           Country profile

         Being the world’s youngest nation, South Sudan currently faces a long list of development
         challenges typical for many countries of the developing world. These are occasionally redoubled by
         outbreaks of violence and political instability. However, the country possesses vast natural
         resources, which are mostly untouched until today. With about 70% of the population being
         younger than 30 years old, South Sudan has sufficient human potential to make the best use of
         those resources.

         In fact, human potential is the very resource that is in need of immediate attention, as it will be
         needed by the country when investing into the developing sectors of the rising economy. The
         underdevelopment of South Sudanese human potential becomes obvious when analyzing South
         Sudan’s macroeconomic indicators:

                •      98% of GDP originates from oil;
                •      Up to 30% of GDP is from international development aid ;
                •      85% of the population engaged in non-wage work;
                •      Domination of imported goods on the local market.

It is of highest importance for South Sudan to continue developing its production industry and to
move away from almost complete dependence on imported goods and oil revenues as these are
two factors that severely damage the country’s economic security.

     1.2      South Sudan DDR Program

Following decades of conflict and finally a peaceful referendum in 2011, South Sudan found itself in
great need of demobilizing a major part of the army in an attempt to make the army smaller in
numbers, while also significantly more professional.

To achieve that goal, the government estimated that some 190,000 members of the national
organized forces need to be demobilized and “reintegrated” into communities. The government of
South Sudan treats every soldier as a liberator and a national hero, but realizes that a peaceful
independent country, which South Sudan is gradually transforming into, cannot have an army this
size. At the same time, the country needs to jump-start all the major industries and that is where
the former soldiers have a great chance of succeeding.

Demobilization and reintegration of the former soldiers (ex-combatants) has been made a priority
task of the National DDR Commission of South Sudan.

     1.3      Project Background

UNICON Limited was contracted to conduct Livelihood Support activities (component three) of the
South Sudan National Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Commission (NDDRC) Pilot
Reintegration Project. The Livelihood Support activities, for this Pilot project, are targeting a group
of 290 ex-combatants in the Greater Bahr el Ghazal region (including the states of Lakes, Warrap,
Western Bahr el-Ghazal and Northern Bahr el-Ghazal).

The Pilot Reintegration Project livelihood component has been divided into 2 phases in order to
facilitate gradual return of the ex-combatants into the community, and to allow for programmatic
learnings in the process of ensuring their successful reintegration.

Phase I was designed to provide the ex-combatants with the initial training as well as the start-up
kit and includes the following sub-components:

     •    Mapel-based Entrepreneurship, Cooperatives & Financial Literacy intensive training;
     •    Livelihood start-up kits;
     •    State-based Entrepreneurship, Financial Literacy & Association and Cooperatives initial
          follow-up trainings:
               o Through cooperatives/associations;
               o Through partnerships/individual training;
               o Monitoring and evaluation;
               o Reporting.




                                                                                                                       Final Report
                                                                                    DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    5

         Phase II builds on the achievements of Phase I to further train the ex-combatants in the chosen
         area of interest. In addition, supplementary training is being provided in cooperative business
         operation and financial management. Following are the sub-components of Phase II:

                •      Entrepreneurship, Financial Literacy & Association and Cooperatives Training:
                                 o Training and mentoring of NDDRC outreach staff in entrepreneurship,
                                     financial literacy and association/cooperatives;
                                 o State-Based Follow-Up Training;
                •      Technical Skills Extension
                                 o Coordination of Agricultural Extension in cooperation with the Ministry of
                                     Agriculture extension workers;
                                 o Training of Ministry of Agriculture extension workers in best practices and
                                     appropriate farming techniques for the ex-combatants of Greater Bahr el-
                                     Ghazal choosing agriculture;
                                 o Facilitation of Targeted Vocational Trainings being provided to XCs via
                                     vocational training centers;
                                 o Implementation of an Expert visit program for interested XCs in vocational
                                     skills not covered through the targeted vocational trainings or agriculture;
                •      Assistance in accessing available government services
                •      Monitoring and evaluation;
                •      Reporting.

         The above sub-components will be performed in accordance with the Work Plan, proposed as part
         of the Project Implementation Plan, in close cooperation with TDRP, NDDRC HQ PMU, Ministry of
         Agriculture and NDDRC state offices. Work Plan is available as Appendix 1 to this report. While
         participation of the ex-combatants in the training is voluntary, it is anticipated that the major part of
         the pilot group of 290 ex-combatants will express interest in receiving additional business,
         vocational and/or agricultural training.

                                           2. Phase I Overview
Implementation of Phase I of the Pilot Reintegration Project took place August-November 2013 and
is widely considered to be successful as all the major goals have been achieved and numerous
lessons learned have been noted for making further improvements of the program in the future.
Among other things, the program has received positive publicity with the population of the country,
which is a significant part of the reintegration process. Additionally, the other ex-combatants
became aware of the existence of the Program and success with which it was implemented.

Given the fact that the Project is a pilot, it was expected that all sides would benefit from learning
during the implementation. NDDRC as an organization showed great potential for improvement and
willingness to develop its potential through accumulating project-related experience and knowledge
both in the headquarters in Juba and in the state offices.

     2.1      Pre-training of ex-combatants

Initial training of the 290 ex-combatants was performed in Mapel DDR Training Facility – a
specialized training camp built by UNMISS and the local government, which is located in the state
of Western Bahr el-Ghazal.

The 290 ex-combatants were trained by UNESCO-hired and trained local specialists in one of the
pre-set 8 vocational areas of their choice: agriculture, auto-mechanics, carpentry, plumbing,
electrical services, masonry, welding or animal husbandry. Based on the type of vocational training
received by the ex-combatant, a corresponding start-up kit was placed in the procurement plan to
be delivered to the ex-combatant’s state of return for collection by the ex-combatant

     2.2      Training of Trainers

UNICON hired and trained ten trainers to conduct entrepreneurship, financial literacy and
cooperative/associations trainings in Mapel and then sent eight state trainers and four state
managers to run the Phase 1 follow-up training sessions for the ex-combatants in their
communities of returns. An international training expert developed the Training of Trainers (TOT)
curriculum as well as the field training manual and training materials to be used by the trainers
during the business/cooperative training for the ex-combatants.

The training of trainers took place in Mapel training facility over 2 weeks in August 2013 during the
time when the ex-combatants were receiving their initial vocational training. This allowed the
trainers to get introduced to many of their future students and receive basic information on them,
including literacy level, approximate location, possible grouping preferences, etc. and incorporate
these ground realities into the training material.

The field training method involves a comprehensive development approach, which covers aspects
involving motivational and behavioral qualities in entrepreneurship and cooperatives as well as key
steps critical to the start-up and management of an enterprise. The training ensures that the

         participants take key decisions during training pertaining to the areas such as selecting a business
         idea, identify key resources required to be in business, locations of the business and other
         partners.

         The Mapel-based Entrepreneurship, Financial Literacy & Association and Cooperatives Training
         was then offered to all ex-combatants in the last 2 weeks of their time at the Mapel Transitional
         Facility as an intensive training to be supplemented by additional state based follow-up trainings
         over the course of the reintegration period. This design forms a natural continuity between the
         trainings received in the camp and that received in their communities.

                2.3           Mapel Intensive and State-Based Follow-up Training

         Field training was performed by UNICON trainers and state managers in close cooperation with
         NDDRC state teams including ICRS caseworkers. In some cases, NDDRC state offices were used
         as training venues, provided by the Commission as a courtesy.

         The training manual included 15 modules that were used as needed based on the needs evaluation
         done by the training team. The modules are:

         Module 1: Introduction and Micro lab: Expectation and Commitment
         Module 2: Financial Literacy
         Module 3: Business and Market
         Module 4: Key activities of a Business, Cooperatives Financial aspects of Business
         Module 5: Selecting a Business and Cooperatives Format
         Module 6: Steps in Starting a Business
         Module 7: Business Skills Development in Cooperatives
         Module 8: Behavioral Skills in entrepreneurship and Cooperatives
         Module 9: Team Building and Management of Cooperatives
         Module 10: Business Plan for setting up Cooperatives
         Module 11: Enterprise Management: Sales and Marketing
         Module 12: Enterprise Management: Purchasing
         Module 13: Enterprise Management: Work Place Management
         Module 14: Enterprise Management: Book-keeping
         Module 15: Concluding and action Plan for setting up Cooperatives

The field training, in order to increase its effectiveness, used several well-known learning methods
that proved to be successful in the region, such as (i) simulations and role-play, (ii) learning by
doing, (iii) visuals and illustration, (iv)
hands-on experience via interaction with
existing businessmen, (v) individual
counseling and (vi) practice sessions.

In addition to the ex-combatants, the
above training also targeted the interested
community members, thus creating extra
publicity and additionally developing the
country’s potential in the fields of small
business and private entrepreneurship.
During phase 1 a total of 284 community
members              received           the
business/cooperative training in addition
to 253 ex-combatants.

     2.4      Livelihood Start-up Kits

                                                                            Livelihood      Start-Up      Kits

          The start-up kit composition for all the eight vocational tracks was agreed upon by UNICON, TDRP
          and NDDRC. In addition to that, advice was obtained from the Ministry of Labor’s MTC (Multi-
          service Training Center) Juba headquarters to make sure that the tools included in the kits are the
          best fit for the local conditions and the UNESCO trainers were consulted to ensure the tools are in
          line with that used in the trainings conducted.

          NZOU Group – a South Sudanese company – procured the start-up kits from Kenya and Uganda to
          the distribution warehouse in Juba. The start-up kits were then divided into separate shipments for
          the 4 states and dispatched, using services of Trojan Enterprises – a local transportation company.

          Despite uncertainty of the road conditions, NDDRC, TDRP and UNICON were able to coordinate
          effectively and ensure that most ex-combatants at each state were able to collect their start-up kits

immediately upon the arrival of the truck. The distribution process was monitored by
representatives of NDDRC HQ, TDRP and UNICON in all states, making sure that the process
goes smoothly and in accordance with the plan that was previously drafted based on collective
vision.

199 ex-combatants received their kits during the 2 day distribution event in each state, with 239 out
of 290 ex-combatants collecting their start-up kits by the end of phase 1. The remaining ex-
combatants were informed that they could collect their start-up kits at any time in the NDDRC state
office and by the close of Phase 2 the NDDRC reported that 288 of 290 ex-combatants have
collected their start-up kits.

This work was substantial and detailed and as such has been separated from this
report into a standalone report: Livelihoods Start-Up Kits Summary & Reflection.

                                                          3. Phase II Objectives
          In summary, the Livelihoods Support sub-components of the full program were agreed to include:

                 •      Entrepreneurship, cooperatives and financial literacy trainings (Phase I & II)
                 •      Livelihood start-up kits (Phase I)
                 •      Technical skills extension: (Phase II)
                               o       Agricultural extension visits
                               o       Vocational expert visits
                               o       Targeted supplementary vocational training
                 •      Leveraging available government services through ICRS referral and follow up (Phase II)


          In Phase II of the NDDRC Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan every one of the pilot group of
          290 ex-combatants were to have a chance to receive additional training both in
          business/cooperative operation and in the area of their Mapel vocational training.

          The interested ex-combatants were to receive a follow-up visit by the business/cooperative training
          teams that would consist of a state manager and ICRS caseworkers who would,, after a proper
          Training of Trainers by an international specialist, provide business/cooperative trainings.

          Given that the largest group (129 people) of ex-combatants chose agriculture as their main field of
          interest, the decision was made that they would have a chance to receive additional agricultural
          business training. For that purpose, an international agricultural expert and a local agricultural
          expert were contracted to conduct a Training of Trainers for the Ministry of Agriculture extension
          workers who would then perform the training sessions for the 129 ex-combatants.

          Through the end of the Project, the non-agricultural ex-combatants would, via NDDRC local offices,
          have an opportunity to receive additional training in their field either through targeted vocational
          trainings for those under served in Mapel or by means of a personal visit by a local practicing
          expert who has a business/operation in the area of the ex-combatant’s reintegration. The
          Commission was to make efforts to locate government-financed institutes that would provide such
          training free of charge.

          As a result of the Phase II activities, the ex-combatants were to have gained additional confidence
          and a clearer vision of their future as valued community members. They would have acquired
          necessary skills in how to (i) choose a business/cooperative area to start, (ii) operate the chosen
          business or work with others to operate the cooperative and (iii) make sure not to lose their
          business or cooperative. In addition, this DDR program was designed to give the ex-combatants an
          opportunity for a faster reintegration as it encourages the community member participation both in
          the field trainings and in the business cooperatives registered by the ex-combatants.

                                  Activities

             The initial design of the project included a mid-term review at the close of Phase I and allowed
             flexibility for programming adjustments responding to the learnings. At the close of Phase I this
             assessment was conducted and the NDDRC Pilot Reintegration Project Steering Committee &
             PMU provided leadership guidance on Phase II activities. Having analyzed the outcomes of Phase
             I of the Pilot Reintegration Project, the Consultant, together with NDDRC and TDRP, agreed that
             the Phase II activities would allow for:

                     •      Opportunity given to all the 290 ex-combatants to receive additional (follow-up) training in
                            entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial literacy;

                     •      Government employees used as state-level trainers for the purpose of further capacity
                            building;

                     •      Further involvement of other ministries in the ex-combatant reintegration process,
                            particularly including the ministry of agriculture.

                     •      Opportunity given to the ex-combatants that did not complete vocational training in Mapel
                            to attend targeted vocational trainings.

             The start of the Phase II of the South Sudan Pilot Reintegration Project was originally planned for
             the middle of January 2014, but was postponed due to instability in the country at that time. The
             consultant’s ability to launch Phase II was dependent on both the international institutions and
             international consultants being able to return to South Sudan and resume normal operations.
             Regular contact was maintained among all parties (NDDRC, TDRP and UNICON) in order to
             ensure that the Phase II launched at the first opportunity.

             It was determined in April 2014 that in early May 2014 the international institutions and consultants
             would be allowed to resume their work in South Sudan.

             The consultant completed a Phase II Project Implementation Plan which reflected the adjusted
             activities and schedule. Due to the uncertainty, extra efforts had to be made by the Consultant in
             order meet the updated deadlines. This included expedited hiring of international experts, rushed
             visa support procedures by NDDRC and, ultimately, launch of the Phase II as soon as 5 May 2014,
             when the first international expert arrived in the country and started the preparatory work.

     4.2      TOT Preparation and Logistics

Considering the above criteria as well as the fact that 129 out of 290 ex-combatants (44.5%) chose
to continue their professional development in the field of agriculture, the following two types of
training were planned for implementation within Phase II of the Project that would require Training
of Trainers to be conducted before launching the state-level training:

     •    Follow-up entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial literacy training;

     •    Agricultural training for the ex-combatants who chose the agricultural track in PhaseI.

Similar to Phase I, a Training of Trainers (TOT) was the first step in Phase II. The TOT was
designed not only to serve the purposes of the ongoing Project, but also to build the capacity within
the National DDR Commission of South Sudan as well as the Ministry of Agriculture of South
Sudan. Along with the knowledge transferred to the locally hired UNICON state managers, the TOT
has become a capacity-building tool that will ultimately influence South Sudan in a number of ways
outside of the Project’s direct needs.

The preparation for the TOT started well before the May mobilization, as the international experts
needed to prepare the training plan, training materials as well as training curriculum to be used
during the TOT. Despite the severe time constraint, all the preparation by the international experts
was completed by the pre-agreed schedule, which allowed the TOTs to start on the dates that
would ensure sufficient time for the state level training to be conducted in full.

     4.2.1 Mobilization

Mobilizing the resources as soon as possible was critical for all parties and the Project deadlines
were shifted as little as possible in light of the crisis with the new deadline for the Pilot
Reintegration Project Phase II implementation stage to be completed by July 31, 2014.

All the international experts involved in Phase II activities were notified that their services were
needed urgently, necessary travel arrangements were made and the first international expert
(entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial literacy trainer) arrived in the country as soon as 5 May
2014.

Significant amount of work had to be completed before the international experts’ arrival to Juba.
The international trainers were requested to provide their vision of their respective TOTs and
submit draft versions of the curriculum in order for the Project Manager to use in his preparation of
the Project timeline as well as finalization of the field arrangements.

NDDRC was actively involved in the ex-combatant training needs collection as well as finalizing the
lists of TOT participants for both the business & cooperative and agricultural Training of Trainers.
Additionally, NDDRC provided the Consultant with a great amount of support in arranging (i)
training venue, (ii) catering for the training participants and (iii) participants’ transportation both from
their home towns to Juba and within Juba.

          The four state managers hired by UNICON for guiding the state-level activities provided support to
          the NDDRC, Project Manager and the entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial literacy
          international trainer during the TOT preparation days by assisting in purchasing necessary
          materials, coordinating with guest speakers, advising on TOT structure improvement etc.

          Strong working relationships built during Phase I helped the NDDRC and the Consultant effectively
          cooperate both before and upon field mobilization of the international experts. The team was able
          to join forces and ensure the timely start of the Phase II of the Pilot Reintegration Project.

                 4.2.2 Venue and Catering

          For the training venue, the Consultant had to address several challenges faced during the TOT and
          ex-combatants’ training in Mapel Training Facility, which were described in the Phase I Final
          Report. A few highlights include:

          Mapel Transition Facility had several limitations in terms of classrooms, learning aids, and
          accommodation was not suitable for preparatory work at nights for each day’s session. Further,
          trainers, on a few occasions, were deprived of water and food and living conditions were not
          hygienic. As a result, a few trainers fell sick during the TOT as well as during the training session to
          ex-combatants. Numerous challenges were faced by the Consultant during the Phase I TOT.
          Additionally, many unexpected events took place during training session as some contracts for
          goods and services (water and cooking) were about to be completed within a few day time. Finally,
          training classrooms had limited facilities in terms of teaching aids like LCD projectors, computers,
          white or black boards, and table and chairs

          Considering the above, the following conditions had to be met by the Phase II venue in order to
          host the TOT:

                        o      Accommodation of 20 participants max. in
                               single self-contained rooms;
                        o      Air conditioned training room for 20
                               participants with desks, chairs, projector,
                               flipchart holders and separate latrines for
                               men and women;
                        o      Preparedness to cater the following for
                               the training group on a daily basis,
                               including Sundays:
                                       o 2 tea/coffee breaks with
                                           snacks;
                                       o 1 lunch buffet.

                                                                 done by the NDDRC, the Consultant, upon

                                                                 “YES Juba” Hotel, located in Juba’s Tongpin
                                                                 area, for conducting the entrepreneurship,
                                                                 cooperatives & financial literacy Training of
                                                                 Trainers. In addition to meeting all the
                                                                 prerequisites listed above, part of “YES Juba”
                                                                 Hotel’s proposal was USD 0.00 charge for the
                                                                 rent of the training venue, equipment and
                                                                 airport transfer, given that participants’
                                                                 accommodation was made through the hotel.

With a few comments, which will be covered as part of the lessons learned, the training venue and
catering was handled in professional manner and in accordance with all the agreements. The
management and staff of the “YES Juba” Hotel was at all times ready to react to the changes and
additions of the TOT programs, guest stay times and catering needs.

     4.2.3 Transportation of participants

Transportation is usually the second major concern of the people participating in training events in
South Sudan. The expectation is that their transportation need will be either arranged for or
reimbursed (latter preferred for money saving purpose). This is true even if one needs to travel
within his or her hometown.

With great help of NDDRC, the Consultant arranged for the participants transportation both locally
and between the states.

Interstate transportation

The participants based outside of Juba took UN flights to join the training. The state DDR
commissions assisted the participants is processing the flight requests with the UN’s appropriate
department. Unfortunately, due to the existing system of reservation and prioritization, several
participants were not able to get on the airplanes even though all the necessary processing was
done on time and in accordance with the rules. The Consultant was able to bring several
participants using commercial flights, but some people who were supposed to attend the training
had to stay in their states. Recommendations on addressing this matter are provided further in this
report.

In-Juba transportation

In-Juba transportation was handled by different parties depending on the nature of the
transportation needs:

Airport pick-ups and drop-offs were handled by the “YES Juba” hotel at no additional charge;




                                                                                                                                Final Report

          State manager, being on direct contracts with the Consultant, were to arrange their own
          transportation;

          NDDRC allocated 2 vehicles to bring the HQ-based ICRS caseworkers to the training location and
          take them back home;

          Market visits during the TOTs were supported by NDDRC vehicles and the Consultant reimbursing
          the costs of hired transport.

                 4.2.4 Challenges and Lessons Learned

          While the preparation and organization of the TOTs was successful and despite having addressed
          some of the Phase I challenges outlined in the Phase I Final Report, the Consultant faced
          numerous challenges, which can be avoided in the future DDR activities.

          In addition, the lessons learned for the entire Phase II have been combined in a separate Appendix
          2 to the report: Training of Trainers: Entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial literacy

          This Appendix provides greater detail on the challenges, as well as possible solutions, but the
          following can be considered the major lessons learned for the TOT preparation stage:

                 •      Insufficient preparation time. Given the time constraint, the international training experts
                        only had 10 days (entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial literacy) and 3 days
                        (agriculture) to prepare the Training of Trainers, which included material modification,
                        print/training material production, stationery purchase, instructing assistants etc.;

                 •      Differences in accommodation. While out-of-Juba participants all stayed at the same
                        hotel, which provided the training facility, many people had to travel on a daily basis, which
                        can be a challenge in South Sudan, especially during the rainy season;

                 •      Venue location. While the hotel used for accommodation and training provided excellent
                        service, it’s location was difficult to reach on the days it rained;

                 •      Accommodation type. Despite catered lunch, tea breaks and allowances, the participants’
                        expectation is to have breakfast included in their accommodation;

                 •      The list of TOT materials should be discussed before going to the field in order to avoid
                        confusion that results from purchasing them in a rush;

                 •      Catering. The number of participants kept fluctuating. This interconnects with the need to
                        better plan the number and nature of participants;

                 •      Number of participants. Careful planning required for the out-of-Juba participants as the
                        venue charges for the no-shows’ pre0booked accommodation and catering;

     •    UNMISS flights. Relying on UNMISS flights to bring the participants from their base states
          to Juba is questionable, as the seats are not guaranteed until the plane takes off.
          Alternative methods of transportation might need to be considered.

     •    International experts’ accommodation should be in the same hotel and preferable close
          to NDDRC and the training venue.

     4.3      Training of Trainers: Entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial
              literacy

Entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial literacy Training of Trainers was the first of the two TOT
programs arranged in Phase II of the DDR Pilot Reintegration Project. This sub-component was
somewhat redesigned compared to that of the Phase I in order to provide direct capacity building to
the National DDR Commission. The majority of the TOT participants were ICRS caseworkers
(NDDRC staff), who during this pilot learned new skills to additionally serve as trainers during the
state-level training sessions. For the purpose of experience transfer, the Consultant hired four state
training managers from among the 12 UNICON hired staff and trainers who delivered state-level
training in Phase I.

Entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial literacy training of the ex-combatants, along with the
livelihood start-up kits, are the Project’s major deliverable and in fact the one that is expected to
have the strongest effect on both the DDR Program participants’ capacity in their reintegration into
the community and the country’s capacity in the gradual development as the world’s youngest
nation.

The purpose of the Training of Trainers is to prepare local specialists capable of delivering
knowledge to the ex-combatants both in this Pilot and in the further stages of the South Sudan
DDR Program. As identified during Phase I, when it comes to starting their own small business, the
ex-combatants’ major training needs, among others, are the following:

         •    Financial literacy;
         •    Market knowledge;
         •    Business type and format selection;
         •    Organizational matters of starting a business/bureaucracy;
         •    Sales and marketing;
         •    Business plan;
         •    Bookkeeping;
         •    Resource management.

The structure of this TOT changed somewhat compared to Phase I, specifically in terms of
participants, which is discussed in sections below. This however, did not change the core rationale
of the training, which includes (i) supporting the ex-combatants in their reintegration by encouraging
them to evolve as entrepreneurs/businesspeople and (ii) providing necessary training to assist
them in achieving their goals.




                                                                                                                       Final Report
                                                                                    DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    19

          The entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial literacy Training of Trainers took place in Juba on
          16-26 May 2014 and was conducted by Dr. Gautam Raj Jain, an international expert with extensive
          experience in business training in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Dr. Jain is also the trainer
          who conducted the TOT during the Phase I of this Pilot DDR Project.

          The 10-day Training of Trainers succeeded in delivering the proper knowledge and training attitude
          to the group of participants. The combination of various training methods, market visits and guest
          speakers, along with favorable training conditions, resulted in the TOT becoming a major success
          both in terms of knowledge transfer and participant satisfaction.

          The state-level training activities, described in detail further in this report proved that the approach
          of training the NDDRC staff to then become the trainers for the ex-combatants was a good one,
          because it contributed to (i) building additional trust between the ex-combatants and the National
          DDR Commission, (ii) developing the training capacity within the NDDRC, which can be used is the
          Commission-initiated and lead activities whenever necessary, and (iii) the training team members,
          being from different entities (NDDRC, UNICON and Ministry of Agriculture), stimulating each other
          to provide better services, ensuring his/her entity’s best possible image within the Project.

          While seeing TOT results as a success, the Consultant did face challenges of different natures,
          which are described in the corresponding sections of this report and which can be properly
          addressed in the future DDR activities in South Sudan.

                 4.3.1 Participants

          In order to ensure that the knowledge delivered during the business/cooperatives TOT benefits the
          South Sudan DDR Program to the maximum possible extent, the participants of the TOT (and,
          therefore, the state trainers) were picked from among ICRS caseworkers who are NDDRC staff.
          Unlike separately recruited trainers who performed the state-level training in Phase I, ICRS
          caseworkers have an opportunity to
          keep the knowledge within NDDRC for
          future training of the ex-combatants.
          Additionally, the ICRS caseworkers’ job
          includes knowing the ex-combatants’
          problems and achievements, as well as
          assisting them in their reintegration,
          which was a valuable addition to both
          the TOT and the trainings themselves.

          The National DDR Commission recommended that the ICRS caseworkers who would participate in
          the TOT and then conduct the state-level training be appointed not only from the four pilot states of
          the Greater Bahr el-Ghazal area, but also from other NDDRC offices within the country. This would
          facilitate a wide spread of knowledge inside the Commission structure. As a result, the following
          ICRS caseworkers were delegated by the NDDRC to take part in the entrepreneurship,
          cooperatives & financial literacy Training of Trainers:

The training of trainers was also joined by the four state managers who were hired by the
Consultant from among the Phase I training team based on their performance. The list of the state
managers was to be proposed by the Consultant and approved by the NDDRC and TDRP. As
agreed by all sides, the following people were offered state manager positions for the Phase II of
the South Sudan Pilot DDR Project:

                  No.                  Name                                  Email

The state managers’ role during the TOT was not only to obtain additional knowledge, but also to
share their Phase I experience with the group of ICRS caseworkers who were new to this Project.
The combination of the state managers’ project specific experience and the ICRS caseworkers’
knowledge of the ex-combatants’ day-to-day needs, interests and challenges became an effective
method of preparing the state-level training teams that would be formed at the end of the TOT.

          4.3.2 Training Process

     The Phase I follow-up indicated that the ex-combatants were at different levels of progress toward
     starting up a business. The TOT was expected to help not only in startup process, but also in
     improving the business performances with better management systems for those who had already
     started their enterprises. The following were the key training inputs for this Training of Trainers:

          •      Curriculum and training modules design. Learning inputs;
          •      Conceptual and technical learning in entrepreneurship, enterprise                               management,
                 cooperatives and financial literacy;
          •      Demonstration of key experiential and participatory learning methods;
          •      Planning and managing state-level training and follow-up support services.


     Structure and methodology

     A 10-day training for 16 ICRS caseworkers and 4 State Managers was conducted on May 16-26
     2014 in Juba. The trainers were provided with a detailed training manual covering the above inputs
     by the use of 13 training modules. The training manual covered the technical and conceptual inputs
     relevant to entrepreneurship, financial literacy and cooperatives with exercises applicable to
     learning among illiterate people. A number of posters were also presented during the TOT. In
     addition future trainers were also provided with the training manual for use for training ex-
     combatants and manual for organizing state level follow up and training. The table below presents
     the training modules and their distribution across the different thrust areas of the training.

     The training engaged participants from Monday to Saturday from 9.00 AM to 5.00 PM and on
     Sunday from 1.00 PM to 5.00 PM. A total of 60 sessions were conducted which also included
     fieldwork. The training began with the opening remarks by the Chairman of NDDRC. A graduation
     ceremony was conducted on May 26 for the participants to receive their certificates.

     4.3.3 Conclusion/Post training stage

The Training achieved its original
learning objectives outlined in the
Curriculum Design. All the sessions
and modules were conducted as per
schedule of the training provided in
the manual. The followings are the
achievements of the training:

16 ICRS caseworkers and 4 state
managers attended the training and
expressed their confidence in conducting training modules as per needs of the ex-combatants who
were at the different stages of development and offer requisite support for a positive progress
toward the establishment and management of enterprises in their respective locations. Trainers
were fully prepared with their plans to go to their respective locations for field level work;

The Trainers felt empowered to influence the ex-combatants and instil in them a positive attitude
toward their resettlement with their communities through setting up cooperatives based business

            enterprises. They recognize the fact that the training is not just about teaching the basic skills but
            also to bring about the behavioral changes to the trainees and instil in them enthusiasm and self-
            confidence toward their plans;

            The trainers are equipped with the skill in curriculum design starting from the training needs
            assessment, training goals and inputs, to selection of appropriate training methods. This provides
            the flexibility to adapt the training modules to the needs of ex-combatants;

            Trainers can articulate the concepts of entrepreneurship and cooperatives and apply the training
            process to reinforce trainees through engaging in the process of selecting business opportunities
            relevant to their vocational skills, help identify the required resources and in the preparation of a
            business plan. The trainers can also assist ex-combatants in taking key decisions about what
            business to start, select the name of the business, location and mobilize capital for investment
            through their partners or members of their cooperatives;

            The training also helped trainees conduct simulations and games for developing business skills for
            conducting all the key activities of a business, develop behavioral skills to work effectively in
            cooperatives, motivate their employees for better work results.

            The modules on enterprise management helped trainers assist and train the ex-combatants in
            managing purchases, sales and marketing, production and work place and keeping records of
            business transaction. They are also equipped with these process and tool useful for illiterate people
            in managing their enterprises;

                                                               The trainers are now capable of training ex-combatants
                                                               in reinforcing the usefulness of the cooperatives for their
                                                               business and help them apply the process of setting up
                                                               cooperatives and its management process. The trainers
                                                               are now equipped to conduct a simulated cooperative
                                                               business exercise for illustrating the process and
                                                               challenges in creating and managing a cooperatives;

                                                   The trainers have been equipped to assist the ex-
                                                   combatants who have established their enterprises.
            Trainers can help develop capacity of ex-combatants in developing systems for day-to-day
            decision-making and improve their business performance. They would be able add additional
            values to them in book- keeping and employees
            management;

            Trainers have been informed of the challenges in the
            field with the ex-combatants and about the expected
            outcome of the two months state level follow up
            training. They have been assisted to prepare state
            level training and interventions plans with the
            perspective to execute it in a timely manner. They
            have been also equipped to documents various

aspects of the progress in the field and report periodically and systematically;

As rightfully emphasized by The Chairperson William Deng Deng during the graduation ceremony,
that the caseworkers now possess something that no one will ever be able to take away from them,
which is knowledge.

     4.3.4 Participant feedback

Upon completion of the entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial literacy Training of Trainers,
every participant filled out a satisfaction survey (Appendix 3). The analysis of the results is
presented below:

     •    The organizational side has shown significant improvement in comparison with Phase I
          entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial literacy Training of Trainers as this time it was
          outsourced to professionals;
     •    The training facilitators are again found to be of good quality and high educational value;
     •    The level of participants’ understanding of the materials is very high by all standards, even
          though somewhat lower than that of Phase I.
     •    In general, the participants’ feedback was positive with a few comments that addressed

     4.3.5 Lessons Learned

The trainers and trainees both faced a few critical constraints in this business & cooperative
Training of Trainers. Given the assessment rating these constraints were managed well. However,
some of the constraints could still affect the training outcome and a summary of them is presented
below for the future DDR activities organizers:

Training preparation had a very little time, which was less than 10 days after the Consultant arrived
in Juba. It was almost impossible to prepare a well-designed and well-formatted training manual.
There was hardly any time to revise the training modules and edit them before sending it for
printing;

Given the number of modules and learners’ experience, the training duration was insufficient. 10
days was hardly enough for building the capacity of trainers in delivering the 11 modules;

The trainees consisted of a very heterogeneous group:

     •    Some were very slow learners;
     •    Some had stage fear and could not present the training assignment well in front of the
          class;
     •    A few were very poor at numbers and took a lot of time to understand what was being
          explained;

The trainees were requested to attend the TOT as group and there was no selection process, no
competition. Many of them treated the TOT as if it was their usual “going to work” routine. Some did
not have the mind-set to prove themselves further for the newer challenges as compared with the
first set of trainers in Phase I;

State Manager selection was done without the TOT trainer’s involvement. There were two state
managers who did not have any prior training experience. The participation of these two state
mangers during the training was also very limited.

     4.4      Training of Trainers: Agriculture
Agricultural training of the ex-combatants introduced in
Phase II of the Project dictated the need of the
corresponding Training of Trainers, with 44.5% of the
ex-combatants choosing agriculture. This is most likely
an accurate reflection of what the South Sudan DDR
Program will be facing in the future when dealing with
significantly larger numbers of ex-combatants and, in
order to be able to face the challenge in the future, the
country needs capacity built within the government to be
able to support the inflow of demobilized citizens willing
to become farmers.

The agriculture development potential of South Sudan is enormous. According to the African
Development Bank reports, the absolute majority of the households in South Sudan are primarily
dependent of agriculture and livestock and 75% of the country’s land area is suitable for agriculture.

                                                                                     DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    27

          At the same time, only 4% of the arable land is cultivated and farming is predominantly of
          subsistence nature. This creates almost unlimited opportunities for anyone willing and able to
          develop himself within the field of agriculture.

          The constraining factors limiting the agriculture development are mainly (i) lack of knowledge and
          (ii) lack of resources. South Sudan’s agricultural indicators are far below the regional standard,
          while the natural conditions are in many cases a lot better than those of their neighbors are.

          The agricultural sub-component was designed to be introduced in Phase II as a result of the
          aforementioned large percentage of overall ex-combatants that chose the agricultural livelihood
          path (44%) and a desired alignment of phase 2 with the growing season. Unlike entrepreneurship,
          cooperatives & financial literacy TOT, Agricultural TOT and state-level training did not have Phase I
          experience to build on, therefore it required additional attention in order to maximize both the (i)
          teaching (capacity building) and (ii) learning (lessons learned, further recommendations) aspects.

          Among the 290 ex-combatants who are participating in this Pilot DDR Project, 129 people chose to
          pursue their peaceful life business career in agriculture. Keeping in mind that (i) most ex-
          combatants have families, which will increase the program effect, (ii) natural resources are
          favorable and (iii) lack of knowledge in agricultural business is a known problem, TDRP made
          agricultural Training of Trainers a part of the Phase II of the Pilot DDR Project in South Sudan.

          Receiving additional targeted training in agriculture will significantly increase the ex-combatants’
          capacity of supporting themselves and their families. After receiving the training in agricultural
          practices, the ex-combatants will be able to make better use of the start-up kits they received
          during Phase I as well as consider not only to develop themselves as subsistence farmers, but also
          look into commercial operations, which is a very important step both for each ex-combatant and the
          country as a whole.

          The 7-day Agricultural TOT was conducted immediately after the entrepreneurship, cooperatives &
          financial literacy TOT at the same training venue. The main participants of the Agricultural TOT
          were seven South Sudan Ministry of Agriculture extension workers, who were seconded to the
          project by the Ministry’s state offices for training the ex-combatants whose vocational field of choice
          was agriculture.

          Agricultural Training of Trainers took place on 28 May – 3 June 2014 and was conducted by Mrs.
          Beth Oliver, an international agricultural expert with previous experience both in South Sudan and
          in other countries of the region. She was assisted by Mr. Angelous Odego, a local agricultural
          trainer who was previously involved in providing the initial agricultural training (operated by
          UNESCO) to the ex-combatants in August 2013 in Mapel Transitional Facility.

          According to the collective opinion of the Consultant and NDDRC, the Agricultural TOT can be
          considered successful and the Ministry of Agriculture extension workers were well prepared to
          deliver the knowledge to the ex-combatants. As expected, numerous challenges and constraints
          were faced by the Consultant before and during the TOT, which resulted in certain modifications
          made to the original plan of the agricultural training activities. Both the challenges and the changes
          are reflected in the corresponding sections of this report.

     4.4.1 Participants

To maximize the capacity building and in keeping with the National DDR Policy to utilize line
ministries in reintegration service delivery, NDDRC suggested that the agricultural trainers for the
ex-combatants be provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. This idea was received very
well by all parties and the Commission proceeded to contact the Ministry.

It is the mission of the Ministry of Agriculture “To transform agriculture from traditional subsistence
system to achieve food security through scientific, market oriented, competitive and profitable
agricultural system without compromising the sustainability of natural resources for future
generations”, which aligns perfectly with the goals of the Pilot DDR Project Phase II agricultural
TOT and state-level training.

The ministry committed to allocate 11 extension workers to participate in the agricultural Training of
Trainers and then provide the training to the 129 ex-combatants. This was to include 3 trainers from
each Warrap, WBeG and Lakes and 2 trainers from NBeG.

Unfortunately, not all the extension workers were able to get on the UNMISS flights from their base
towns to Juba. The agricultural Training of Trainers ended up including seven extension workers:

                             7                Daniel Kong Halbeng             Lakes

As the agricultural extension workers would be working together with the state managers and the
ICRS caseworkers at the state level, the trainees from the entrepreneurship, cooperatives &
financial literacy Training of Trainers were invited to join the Day 1 of the agricultural TOT.

     4.4.2 Training Process

Among the day-to-day responsibilities of the Ministry of Agriculture extension workers are to (i) train
the population in the field of agriculture, (ii) promote the development and adaptation of appropriate
agricultural technology and (iii) promote the efficient production and marketing of the agricultural
products. Therefore the goals of the extension workers coincide perfectly with the goals of the
South Sudan DDR program.

Having reviewed the background of the extension workers both using the profile forms filled out by
them and by personal communication, the Consultant determined that the extension workers have
substantial experience in training people of various level of agricultural knowledge, including




                                                                                                                         Final Report

          experience training farmers from scratch, which is vital for this project. This allowed the Consultant,
          within the agricultural Training of Trainers, to allocate most of the time to build the capacity of the
          extension workers in the field of agriculture rather than teach the participants how to teach the ex-
          combatants.

          Structure and Methodology

          The initial plan was to train 11 Ministry of Agriculture extension workers and 16 ICRS caseworkers
          for 10 days. Due to time and budget constraints, the training was downsized to 7 days, 11 Ministry
          of Agriculture extension workers with ICRS caseworkers attending the first 1-2 days. The TOT
          started on 28 May instead of 27 May because most of the participants could not make it to Juba on
          time due to UNMISS flight unpredictability. Out of 11 participants originally planned, 6 people were
          able to start the training on 28 May and 1 more person – on 30 May, which means that the training
          program had to be revised several times.

          The TOT included daily break for lunch and two tea breaks, provided by the training facility. This
          ensured that all the participants stayed within the hotel boundaries and minimized the possibility of
          participants not returning from the breaks.

          The agricultural Training of Trainers used participatory training method, which is widely used in the
          counties of the region for many years and in various programs, including other DDR programs.
          Participatory learning is a creative, problem solving method in which every participant participates
          actively. The learning process is just as important as the subject being learned is. The participatory

The following was identified as the agricultural TOT main goals:

     •    To design and develop training curricula based on the needs of ex-combatants and
          community members – usage of more picture examples to illustrate most everything, plus
          forming small groups that teach its members farming literacy and numeracy by using the
          “Hands On” material given to all trainees;
     •    To produce a handbook that is a guide for trainers who are supporting small scale
          agricultural development for ex-combatants and community members;
     •    To conduct training sessions that will address the needs and problems of the participants;
     •    Use      participants’    knowledge,
          experience and skills;

Modifications

Both the curriculum and the handbook needed to be modified to address the following findings of
the TOT:

     •    The participants’ literacy and numeracy level turned out to be below the Consultant’s
          expectation and the training process had to become more visual;

     •    Some of the entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial literacy practices training will need
          to be replaced by teaching the general agronomy practices;

     •    Both literacy/numeracy and agronomy lessons need to be held at the beginning of the
          Training of Trainers as they are important for understanding the business development side
          of the agricultural business.

     4.4.3 Conclusions/Post-training stage

 With some slight adjustments, the agricultural Training of Trainers program has a very promising
future. Considering South Sudan’s abundant agricultural resources, the development path of this
economy is not only in oil & gas, but also in the agricultural business.

The extension workers’ level of knowledge has room for improvement, but, using the knowledge
they possess and the knowledge newly acquired during the Training of Trainers, the extension
workers were able to deliver quality training to the ex-combatants, whose knowledge in agricultural
practices is limited to the “genetic” knowledge within the family as they have spent a lot of time
away from home in difficult conditions and without an opportunity to exercise the agricultural
knowledge they might have.

The materials provided to the Ministry of Agriculture extension workers cover a wide range of
topics. While the initial plan was to concentrate of the agriculture as a business, based on the
observations made during the Training of Trainers, the Consultant decided to provide the extension
workers with the following materials that can be used not only in training the ex-combatants, but
also in the extension workers’ regular job, as they face similar challenges there:

     •    An extract from “Hands On” English literacy and numeracy handbook;
     •    Agronomy Basics training manual;
     •    Manual on agricultural business as a cooperative;
     •    Manual on agricultural (seed) business for an individual farmer.



The Consultant spent additional time after the end of the Training of Trainers to make modifications
to the materials in order to make them better fit to the current situation in South Sudan’s agricultural
sector.

The final versions of the curriculum and the handbook are provided with this report.

                 4.4.4 Participant Feedback

          The table below provides the analysis of the feedback forms filled out by the 7 participants of the
          agricultural Training of Trainers. While the sample size does not allow the Consultant to make
          definitive conclusions, some information can be gathered from the results:

                 •      Training length was considered insufficient by the participants. This outcome could be
                        foreseen as the training duration had to be reduced from 10 days to 7 days. In addition, the
                        training had several disruptions from the core training part, such as (i) multiple introductions,
                        and (ii) postponing modules while waiting for the remaining participants;

                 •      Understanding of the exact work plan was not completely reached. This is in part because
                        the extension workers were briefed on their work plan, while the full instructions were to be
                        given by the state managers upon arrival to their assigned state;

                 •      Understanding of the core material was adequate, but can be significantly improved with
                        more preparation time and using the information gathered by the Consultant during the
                        Training of Trainers.

                 4.4.6 Lessons Learned

          As partially covered above, the agricultural Training of Trainers faced several challenges:

          4 Participants did not arrive because they did not make it on the UNMISS flights. The prioritization
          system of the UNMISS flight make it possible for a person not to get on a flight even though all the
          paperwork has been submitted properly and on time;

          Juba Arabic and Dinka are not the only languages spoken in some regions. This was not a
          challenge in terms of TOT success, but needs to be taken into account when the DDR program is
          extended to other parts of the country;

          The extension workers’ literacy and numeracy level is fairly low. This is especially true for
          numeracy, as adding and multiplication become a real challenge when it comes to agricultural
          terms like area, resources, etc.;

          The agronomy knowledge among the participant group is inconsistent. While some people showed
          adequate knowledge of agronomy, others needed explanations for issues that are considered very
          basic in agriculture;

          Inadequate training length was a challenge. Additionally needs assessment time should be
          incorporated in future iterations of this work. A 10-day TOT following about a week of preparation
          time would be sufficient for this type of training. Unfortunately, it was difficult to reach all the goals
          within the time allocated for this TOT;

          No follow-up opportunity for the international trainer. It would be beneficial for all the interested
          parties (NDDRC, Ministry of Agriculture, TDRP and UNICON) to involve the international trainer in
          the oversight of a sample of the actual field training sessions.

      5. State-based follow-up trainings
The entire Phase II training program, had the goals of (i) following-up with the ex-combatants on
the training they received in Phase I as well as on their current reintegration status, (ii) delivering
additional knowledge to the ex-combatants who feel that they have such need, (iii) making sure that
the start-up kits are used in the right manner, and (iv) collecting any information that may be useful
in designing the potential large-scale South Sudan DDR Program that will cover a much larger
group of ex-combatants.

While some of the training components were newly introduced in the Phase II of the Pilot DDR
Project, the component of financial literacy/entrepreneurship training is still the core part of the
DDR program. It is designed to not only train the ex-combatants in financial literacy and
entrepreneurship, but also to motivate them to reintegrate into the community by participating in
social life and cooperating with their fellow community members in building the business capable of
supporting their families.

The business/cooperative training was delivered to 270 ex-combatants in the four states, which
represents 93% of the 290 ex-combatants participating in this Pilot DDR Project in South Sudan.
The breakdown of the above number by the state is as follows:

*NOTE: 5 of the ex-combatants passed away over the course of the pilot, thus of the end-of-project
caseload of 285 ex-combatants, 269 were trained (94%).

For the ex-combatants who chose agriculture as their field of reintegration, the training team was
joined by a Ministry of Agriculture extension worker. All the extension workers have previous
experience in training agriculture, supplemented by additional training provided to them as a part of
this Phase II of South Sudan Pilot DDR Program.

Agricultural training was designed to be provided to the ex-combatants who chose agriculture as
their reintegration field. In addition, the agricultural training sessions were open to be attended by
the ex-combatants from other reintegration fields as well as community members.

          In addition to the ex-combatants, community members had the opportunity to participate in the
          training activities and hence to also benefit from this Project. The number of community members
          has somewhat decreased compared to Phase I due to reasons like (i) rainy/seeding season, (ii)
          unwillingness to receive training with no cash or tools provided for participation, (iii) transportation
          challenges etc.

          Having reached and trained a high percentage of the ex-combatants, the training team was proud
          to note the fact that none of the ex-combatants who participated in the training activities, chose to
          rejoin the military during the recent unrest, because they have realized the advantages of the
          peaceful life, of various income opportunities, and of the ability to be with their families at all times.

          Throughout both Training of Trainers sessions, the Consultant worked closely with NDDRC to
          establish the guidelines for the Phase II state-level training of the ex-combatants. While the training
          teams were given the ability to adjust their workplan, they were provided with guidelines of state-
          level training implementation. It was, however, emphasized that the ultimate goal is to deliver
          quality training to the maximum number of ex-combatants regardless of the field conditions as all
          the training teams were composed of the people who showed ability to make decisions while
          working under pressure.

All the training sessions were delivered by the training teams in accordance with the training
guidelines, curriculums and materials they received during the Training of Trainers conducted in
Juba in May-June 2014. In all cases, a training needs assessment was conducted, which facilitated
the training team’s decision of which training modules would become most useful for the particular
ex-combatant.

While it was difficult to plan the exact logistics of
the state-level training activities (transportation,
exact     dates,      trainers’    accommodation,
refreshments for the ex-combatants etc.), the
work plan was outlined during the Training of
Trainers in Juba. This work plan was then
adjusted to the field conditions by the state
managers in close cooperation with ICRS
caseworkers, which led to the training teams
moving effectively within their state and
reaching out to the ex-combatants in each of the
counties, which, consequently, lead to the high
training coverage of 93%.

In addition to the effective movement scheme, the four state-level training teams were in regular
communication among themselves, because some of the ex-combatants have moved from one
state to another since Phase I. Whenever a migrated ex-combatants was located and contacted,
the state manager of his/her original state would transfer his/her contact information to the state
manager of the ex-combatant’s current state so that the training team of that state could contact
and train the ex-combatant.

The challenges of the state-level training are covered in the corresponding sections of this report.
Although numerous, they can mostly be addressed easily when designing the potential large-scale
DDR Program.

     5.1      Training overview

A total of 399 people benefited directly from training as a part of the Phase II of the South Sudan
Pilot DDR Project. This includes 270 ex-combatants and 129 community members. The training
sessions included (i) follow-up training in business skills/financial literacy/business motivation and
(ii) training in agricultural business/agronomy practices.

Additionally, a large number of community members may have benefited indirectly as they may
have received the knowledge once the trained person (ex-combatant or community member)
returns to the community and applies the knowledge obtained. The number of indirect beneficiaries
is emphasized, because many of them would have liked to attend the training, but were too busy
planting the seed at the beginning of the rainy season to make sure they receive harvest by the
time it is over. The ex-combatants, in these case, attended the training not only as the pilot group
members, but also as representatives of their community/family agricultural groups.

          The training was mainly targeted at the ex-combatants as the primary beneficiaries of the Project,
          while the interested community members were free to join the trainings to receive the knowledge as
          deemed valuable. The number of community members who participated in the trainings has
          decreased in comparison with their turn-out in Phase I. The main reasons for that are believed to
          be the following:

                 •       The state-level training was offered right after the start of the rainy season, when basically
                         the whole population of South Sudan is busy planting seeds in their farms and backyards to
                         make sure they have at least 1 successful harvest this year. In many cases the ex-
                         combatant would attend the training while his partners from the community were planting
                         the seeds;

                     •     The cooperative business formation, although proven effective and highly encouraged by
                           the government, is complicated to introduce formally, with all the paperwork done and the
                           finances flowing officially. This led some of the cooperatives formed in Phase I to
                           disintegrate by the time Phase II activities commenced;

                     •     Rainy season also meant that the quality of the roads is significantly sub-standard and it
                           was very difficult for a person who lives outside of town to travel even a few kilometers to
                           the training location. Cars are either expensive or not available, and motorcycles in many
                           cases cannot make it through the expansive flooded areas that surround the cities during
                           the rainy season.

          In comparison with Phase I, locating and gathering the ex-combatants became a lot easier. This is
          largely due to the fact that the training teams included the Phase I trainers and state-based ICRS
          caseworkers, all of which have personal contacts with the ex-combatant supplemented by
          experience in previous DDR activities in South Sudan. Additional awareness was created by the
          training teams speaking directly with local authorities and announcing the upcoming trainings on
          the local radio stations, which proved to be an effective way of spreading the information.

          The training format included inviting the ex-combatants for a 2-day training, which addresses their
          most important training needs and established the level of progress they have made since Phase I
          of the Pilot DDR Project.

          This was then supplemented by the training teams collecting valuable information on each ex-
          combatant’s current location, achievements, complaints, and status of the start-up kit that was
          given to him or her about 6 months before. This information was collected by having the State
          Manager fill out an XC personal form for each trained ex-combatant. The form is provided with this
          report as Appendix 4, while the results are presented in tabular form as a separate document
          accompanying this Final Report.

          As the training progressed, the training teams identified several components of the training that are
          generally most needed by the ex-combatants in their reintegration to the society:

          Mindset. It became very important for the training teams to make sure that the ex-combatants
          realized the new, updated reality that they are facing. Now they have to produce something (goods,

services, any other added value) in order to make a living. This implies that a decision has to be
made on how exactly each one of them is going to get income when they are taken off the army
payroll, where they could count on a fixed guaranteed salary every month by just following orders.
Also, previously they did not need to think about purchasing food or clothes as those were provided
for them. Leaving this army way of life is a significant stress for the ex-combatants and it was the
job of the training teams to explain to the ex-combatants that their new way of life brings them
opportunities, including financial, which go far beyond the ones they used to have while in army;

Financial literacy and cash flow. As briefly explained above, the ex-combatants do not generally
have a habit of planning their expenses, because, being on army payroll, they are used to receiving
a salary and not worrying about food or clothes. In fact, it became obvious to the training teams that
a very thorough explanation is needed to the ex-combatants of the difference between cost,
revenue and profit. The goal of the reintegration process is to encourage the ex-combatants to
engage in a livelihoods, be it in small business, agricultural production, the service industry, etc.,
and in this they will need to deal with financial flows on a daily basis. However, the ex-combatants
need to realize that not all the money they receive can be used to cover their immediate needs, be
it basic or luxury needs. Delivering the concepts of price structure, working capital and
reinvestment to the ex-combatants became a major part of the training activities.

     5.2      Team composition

The training teams consisted of UNICON-hired state managers, ICRS caseworkers and Ministry of
Agriculture extension workers. These teams reached out to the ex-combatants in their locations of
return in the states of Northern Bahr el-Ghazal, Western Bahr el-Ghazal, Lakes and Warrap. This
allowed for training to be performed by a combination of (i) the state managers hired from among
the Phase I training team and (ii) the ICRS caseworkers, who are NDDRC staff. Both state
managers and ICRS caseworkers know the ex-combatants personally, which allowed them to
realize their personal conditions/challenges and relate to those.

The most important factor behind such training team composition is that all the training team
members are within the ex-combatants’ comfort zone and are able to work with the ex-combatants
as well as collect accurate information on their progress that can be used by NDDRC for planning
the future DDR activities in South Sudan. Despite various, mostly logistical and motivational,
challenges faced during the state-level trainings, the training teams were able to deliver high-quality
trainings to the Project beneficiaries (the ex-combatants). The team composition strategy proved to
be a successful one, as it helped overcome potential language and other barriers between the
training teams and the trainees (the ex-combatants).

The business/cooperative training was conducted by the ICRS caseworkers and UNICON state
managers in accordance with the training manual received during the Training of Trainers, while
the agricultural training was provided by the Ministry of Agriculture extension workers using their
experience and guidance received during the agricultural Training of Trainers in May 2014.

          Based on the above numbers and collective vision, the following guidelines have been adopted:

                 •      1 ICRS caseworker (trainer) in each state’s team was teamed up with the agricultural
                        extension worker(s) and this team was responsible for delivering both the business and
                        agricultural training to those ex-combatants who received agricultural start-up kits in Phase
                        I;
                 •      The state manager and 2 ICRS caseworkers (trainers) teamed up to train the non-
                        agricultural ex-combatants in entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial literacy;
                 •      The state manager assists the “agricultural” team on as-needed basis. Specifically so in the
                        state of Warrap;
                 •      1 ICRS caseworker (trainer) in each state’s team allocated for dealing with the ex-
                        combatants’ non-agricultural vocational extension training.

          Based on the above, the team compositions for the three states were accepted as follows:

                                                                                                                            2

     5.2.2 Team in State of NBeG

The total number of ex-combatants in Northern Bahr el-Ghazal is 30, of which 5 ex-combatants
chose agriculture and 25 – auto mechanics/driving. The group of ex-combatants who chose auto
mechanics/driving as their reintegration activity attended specialized courses in Aweil, at which
time they were also offered the business follow-up training.

The following approach was adopted for the state of Northern Bahr el-Ghazal:

     •    1 ICRS caseworker (trainer) was allocated for dealing with the ex-combatants’ non-
          agricultural vocational extension training;
     •    1 ICRS caseworker (trainer) was teamed up with the agricultural extension worker(s) and
          this team was made responsible for delivering both the business and agricultural training to
          those ex-combatants who received agricultural start-up kits in Phase I;
     •    The state manager and 1 ICRS caseworker (trainer) teamed up to train the non-agricultural
          ex-combatants in entrepreneurship, cooperatives & financial literacy;
     •    As soon as the “agriculture” team finished training the 5 ex-combatants, the 1 ICRS
          caseworkers joined the second team in their training sessions in Aweil.

The NBeG team, therefore, looked as follows:

     5.3      State Specific Reporting: Northern Bahr el-Ghazal

The state of Northern Bahr el-Ghazal is located in South Sudan’s northwestern part and farthest
away from Juba, the capital of the country. It is one South Sudan’s least populated states and
hence the number of the ex-combatants originating from Northern Bahr el-Ghazal is lower
compared to that of the other states that participate in this Pilot DDR Project. A total of 30 ex-
combatants were eligible for the follow-up activities designed within this Phase II.

          Additionally, Northern Bahr-el Ghazal ex-combatant pilot group does not reflect the general
          tendency of agriculture being the most popular field of reintegration. Instead, the majority of the ex-
          combatants, while receiving training in Mapel in August 2013, made a choice to receive vocational
          training and a start-up kit as auto-mechanics/drivers.

          The ex-combatant breakdown by the reintegration field in the state of Northern Bahr el-Ghazal is
          presented below4:

          All the thirty ex-combatants were reached by the training team and receive the training in
          business/cooperatives and agriculture. In parallel to the training team’s efforts, the National DDR
          Commission arranged for the ex-combatants who had chosen auto-mechanics reintegration field, to
          attend driving and auto-mechanics courses in Aweil, which made it easier for the training team to
          located them as they all arrived from their respective payams to the state capital.

          Although all 30 participating ex-combatants trained, unfortunately, one of them passed away two
          weeks after meeting the training team – Mr. Garang Gel Akok (DDR ID 10000254) of the state’s
          Yargot payam.

                 5.3.1 Week of 9-14 June 2014

          Training was conducted in Aweil for the 25 ex-combatants
          who has chosen auto-mechanics as their field of
          reintegration. The ex-combatants arrived to Aweil to attend
          driving/auto-mechanics school and they received 2 days of
          training in financial literacy and entrepreneurship before
          the lessons started in the school.

          The training was performed in the city of Aweil as all the


          4
              According to the latest available data – September 2013 database

25 ex-combatants had arrived for the driving school arranged for by the NDDRC, which is why they
were the only ones in attendance. The ex-combatants of the other reintegration fields are to be
visited by the training teams in their payams.

While 2 cooperatives were formed, many of the ex-combatants are pursuing private
entrepreneurship as a goal. Some of the ex-combatants, given a long time between receipt of the
auto-mechanics start-up kit and the start of the driving school, have invested their time into
agriculture. However, their main field of interest was financial literacy and entrepreneurship.
Agricultural practices seemed secondary.

Achievements

The following achievements were noted by the training teams:

     •    Dot Baai Malual Baai Farming cooperative was formed in Aweil East County. The total
          starting contribution was SSP 6,800 from both the ex-combatants and community members.
          They managed to make a profit of SSP 10,200 within the first 6 months of operation;
     •    The ex-combatants have stopped relying on the government salary and are concentrating
          on their own progress;
     •    The dividends that they will distribute at the end of the year has become a major motivator.
          They are all trying to maximize their effort in order to receive more at the end;
     •    The ex-combatants and the community members engaged in agricultural activities do not
          have to think about feeding their families. Instead, because they can get food very cheap as
          members of the cooperative, they are focusing on the business side of agriculture and
          making profits;
     •    According to the state manager’s opinion, there is high level of trust among the ex-
          combatants and community members who joined the cooperatives. This originates in the
          transparent structure of the profit distribution, where everyone knows exactly how much is
          being spend on the cooperative needs and how much profit is every member is entitled to;
     •    General price reduction for the crops as they do not need to be delivered from other
          locations;
     •    The participants of the 2 cooperatives (Dot Baai in Malual Baai & Akuem kou farming in
          Wanyjok Center) show a very high level of reintegration.


Challenges

The following challenges were noted by the training teams:

     •    Until the recent start of driving school lessons, lack of adequate training was the main
          challenge for the ex-combatants who chose auto-mechanics as their field of reintegration.
          Some of them had to temporarily shift to find themselves in agriculture;
     •    Even though the situation was clearly explained in Phase I, some of the ex-combatants still
          state that they need a generator with their welding start-up kit;
     •    The ploughs that were part of the agricultural start-up kit did not come with a chain, which
          made it very difficult to connect them to an ox;




                                                                                                                       Final Report
                                                                                    DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    45

                 •       The amount of seeds provided with the start-up kit was not enough to run a farm, so they
                         were asking for more seeds;
                 •       The timing for the trainings needs to be improved, because (again, like Mapel training) the
                         training had to take the ex-combatants away from their cultivation work;
                 •       2 months of driving school does not sound sufficient to the ex-combatants and they are
                         asking that the school is extended to 3 months (4 months for engineering / auto-
                         mechanics);
                 •       Most of the ex-combatants need land for their business as they can’t afford to rent. They are
                         asking that some land is provided to them by the government.


          Start-up kit use

          The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:

                 •       The best use of the start-up kits (agricultural) is seen in places where the ex-combatants
                         have formed cooperatives;
                 •       A few ex-combatants sold their start-up kits (auto-mechanics). This goes especially for the
                         hydraulic jacks and spanners;
                 •       Many of the auto-mechanics ex-combatants did not use the start-up kits until today,
                         because they had not received the necessary training, but they are still in possession of
                         their start-up kits.

                 5.3.2 Week of 16-21 June 2014

          Training was conducted for 2 ex-combatants in Panthou payam, Malek Alel County east of Aweil
          center. They have formed a fishing cooperative together with some community members, but it
          proved to be not the best choice of activity for their region and they are now concentrated on
          subsistence farming.

          While facing many challenges, the ex-combatants consider themselves to be fully reintegrated into
          the community and not willing to go back to the army. They are able to learn something new every

day and the newly acquired skills help them develop as personalities and improve their living
conditions.

Achievements

The following achievements were noted by the training teams:

       •   Although formally members of
           cooperatives, the two ex-
           combatants are committed to
           their      domestic        farming
           activities. They are improving
           their     personal     skills    in
           agricultural     activities     at
           household level;
       •   The ex-combatants show their
           reintegration    progress       by
           joining community life where
           people work every day in order
           to make their living. They
           realized that they have to care
           about themselves and their
           families now as opposed to
           following commands;
       •   They believe that their first step has to be reaching the level of farming to support their
           household and then proceed to develop as a business.


Challenges

The following challenges were noted by the training teams:

       •   The ex-combatants need water pumps for irrigation in order to have effective farming
           system throughout a year;
       •   They need variety of different seeds so that they have variety outputs of crops for their
           own consumption & consequent business purposes;
       •   The ex-combatants need insecticides for spraying their crops in order to reach adequate
           harvest size and quantity;
       •   For their future as business farmers, they would like to receive additional training in
           agriculture, especially in the areas of seedbed preparation, management and fertilizer use;
       •   They are in need of a wire fence around their farming land in order to protect it from both
           wild and domestic animals and cattle;
       •   There is need for ox and chain to complete the ox-plough package as it is now difficult to
           use it.

          Start-up kit use

          The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:

                     •     Mostly, the agricultural start-up kits are in possession and being used in the right way by
                           the ex-combatants.;
                     •     Ox-ploughs are difficult to use because the ox and the chains were not provided. In
                           addition, skills are required to assemble, operate and maintain the plough. Some were
                           obtained in Mapel, but additional might be needed;
                     •     Seeds were used during cultivations but the seedlings were destroyed by pests/ insects
                           due to lack of insecticides.
                     •     Until this training, the land preparation part of the start-up kit was not used to the best
                           extent, but now they have better understanding.

                 5.3.3 Week of 23-28 June 2014

          The training team visited Wanyjok County
          (Aweil East) and provided training to the
          ex-combatants and community members
          for the payams of Baac, Akuem Kou and
          Yar Goot. All the participants of the
          training are members of 1 cooperative,
          which was formed by the ex-combatant
          who resides in this area.

          Mabior Guot Aguer was able to gather 28
          community members around him and
          start a farming cooperative, which
          currently produces vegetables, beans and
          other     crops   for    the    members’
          consumption, but they are planning to
          expand their operations and start generating profits.

Achievements

The following achievements were noted by the training teams:

         •   The ex-combatant and the community members formed a farming cooperative in which
             they produce green vegetables & legumes such as tomato, beans, maize, okra,
             groundnuts and many others for their consumption & business purposes;
         •   The cooperative is showing signs of becoming something bigger than an agricultural
             cooperative, as many of its members have additional skills in different areas and have the
             possibility of creating value added products/services;
         •   The total initial contribution was SSP 2,200, which can be considered significant and is a
             sign of trust that the members have in this enterprise.


Challenges

The following challenges were noted by the training teams:

         •   As in case of other ex-combatants, water pumps are needed very much for anyone who is
             involved in any kind of agricultural activities. The pumps are needed even during the rainy
             season, when the break between the rains can be as long as 1 week;
         •   Supply of insecticides is needed as even subsistence farming is heavily affected by
             insects. They will need more of them as their businesses grow;
         •   Training is needed on how to use different types of chemicals, whether it is a fertilizer or
             an insecticide;
         •   The ox and plough chain problem seems to have become universal.


Start-up kit use

The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:

         •   The ex-combatant’s start-up kit is being used effectively for the most part. The plough
             can’t be used because no chain was provided with it and no ox was provided as well.
         •   For some of the tools additional minor training may be useful as they are not used in the
             best possible way (e.g. hoes and fork hoes).

                 5.3.4 Week of 30 June – 5 July 2014

          The payam of Malual Bai was visited during this week. The training was attended by 1 ex-
          combatant and 31 community members. The participants formed 3 different cooperatives in 3
          different areas: farming, pharmacy business and general trade. Some of the ex-combatants were
          away and received their training in Aweil in addition to their ongoing driving school.

          The cooperative co-exist in the same area and exchange experience and knowledge. They also
          assist each other in addressing the issues and challenges that come up along the way.

          Achievements

          The following achievements were noted by the training teams:

                    •      The ex-combatants and the community members
                           have adequate knowledge of the general
                           operation procedures of cooperatives;
                    •      The locations picked for the cooperatives can be
                           considered successful, as they are close to the
                           community’s center of interests;
                    •      They were able to fence off their agricultural
                           business in order to protect it from wild and
                           domestic animals wandering inside. They also
                           hired a watchman;
                    •      The pharmacy is located in the central Malual Bai Market area;
                    •      Most of the members have a good understanding of how to use the farming tools;
                    •      75% of the members are women from various backgrounds;
                    •      The cooperatives have a fixed hierarchy of management which includes 9 people starting
                           with the Chairman and going down to Purchasing Officer.


          Challenges

          The following challenges were noted by the training teams:

                    •      Most of the cooperative members complain a lot for lack of insecticides/pesticides to
                           protect their farm produces from the insects;
                    •      The cooperative members also said that they have in adequate tools for farming. More
                           tools are needed;
                    •      More seeds provided to the cooperatives would make it easier for them to grow as
                           business;
                    •      Additional agricultural training opportunity is requested so that the cooperative members
                           have a chance to learn modern farming techniques;
                    •      Irrigation support is needed (pumps etc.) as the dry season is nearing;

Start-up kit use

The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:

        •   The XCs and community members hire moldboard from the individuals who owned them
            for farming through their contributions;
        •   Traditional farming tools are being used effectively;
        •   The plough is not being used because there is no chain;
        •   They have more land than they received seed for, so more seeds would allow them to use
            more of their land in Malual Bai.

     5.4       State Specific Reporting: Western Bahr el-Ghazal

Western Bahr el-Ghazal state is one of South Sudan’s larger states and is home to 92 ex-
combatants who were chosen to participate in this Pilot DDR Project. The state has areas adjacent
to the Central African Republic border, which are considered both remote and relatively unsafe.
Although some of the ex-combatants are residents of those parts of the state, the training team was
able to locate, contact and train most of the ex-combatants by setting up training centers in
locations that could be easily travelled to by the ex-combatants.

The state of Western Bahr el-Ghazal is also the location of the first formal cooperative of this
Project. Seven ex-combatants who chose welding as their reintegration field, during Phase I of the
Project, were given a generator to share among them provided that they registered their
cooperative with NDDRC’s assistance, which they successfully did and are now working together,
although do face certain challenges, just like the rest of the pilot group.

The distribution of the ex-combatants by the reintegration field in the state of Western Bahr el-
Ghazal is provided below:

          In addition to making attempts to locate, reach and train the 92 ex-combatant originally residing in
          Western Bahr el-Ghazal, the training team trained 8 ex-combatants, who migrated from other
          states – 1 from Northern Bahr el-Ghazal and 7 from Warrap. Their training records were passed on
          to those states’ training teams for further submission of that data with their reports5

                 5.4.1 Week of 9-14 June 2014

          The ex-combatants from Wau County were invited for training during this week. The training team
          noticed that the in-state migration can be significant and the some ex-combatants have decided to
          move closer to the capital city. While the original number of Wau county residents is 29, a total of
          34 ex-combatants and 3 community members were trained in financial literacy, entrepreneurship,
          agricultural skills etc.

          The reintegration process is progressing adequately and most of the ex-combatants are on their
          way to becoming completely reintegrated and full-scale community members in addition to the fact
          that they are developing their entrepreneurship skills and becoming more financially independent
          by the day.

          The following achievements were noted by the training teams:

                    •      The carpentry ex-combatants that we visited have formed a cooperative and were given
                           land plots from the State Ministry of Land and Physical Infrastructure of Western Bahr el-
                           Ghazal state at no cost;

Challenges

The following challenges were noted by the training teams:

       •   Start-up kits and splinting machines which the ex-combatants received were often not
           enough. Additional provision is requested by the ex-combatants, e.g. 1 generator is not
           enough for 7 people;
       •   Some ex-combatants who live in remote areas requested accommodation during the
           training days as it was difficult for them to travel 2 days in a row;
       •   Additional equipment (e.g. carpentry) is needed by the ex-combatants to support their
           business;
       •   Some of the ex-combatants expected that they would receive some form of payments for
           attending the training;
       •   Agriculture ex-combatants are in needs of insecticides, pest and water sources for
           irrigation of their crops;
       •   The ex-combatants can’t afford to rent workspace, land or additional tools;
       •   Need for more seeds.


Start-up kit use

The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:

       •   The start-up kits are mostly in possession and in good condition, but the ex-combatants
           need some spare parts;
       •   The carpentry cooperative that we visited was formed by 7 of our ex-combatants and they
           were later joined by 2 community members with additional start-up kits that they received
           from Save the Children Foundation. They mentioned that those start-up kits were better
           than the ones provided by this program.
       •   Power and splinting machine is challenging both carpentry and auto-mechanic.

                5.4.2 Week of 16-21 June 2014

         During this week the Western Bahr el-Ghazal training team trained 17 ex-combatants and 1
         community member in the Mapel and Kuajina payams of Jur River County. The participants were
         members of 8 different cooperatives and came to the training as their representatives as most of
         the other members were either busy with their household work or their farming/cooperative work.

         The state of Western Bahr el-Ghazal NDDRC office seems to be the most active in terms of
         working with the local government on the issues of providing land to the ex-combatants. Several
         cooperatives received land plots for their businesses.

         The local government also participated in the reintegration process by hiring some of the ex-
         combatants, who are now staff of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.

          the Western Bahr el-Ghazal state. The training was attended by 16 people, including 9 ex-
          combatants and 7 community members.

          Most of the ex-combatants have started small businesses that can feed them and their families.
          Most of the ex-combatants, regardless of the chosen reintegration field, have an small agricultural
          operation, which, depending of the resources and abilities, either provides enough food for the
          household, or provides a surplus that can be sold for cash.

          Achievements

          The following achievements were noted by the training teams:

                    •      The ex-combatants do not have to think about how to fulfil their basic needs and their
                           small businesses/farming operations are able to provide them with enough food or enough
                           income to buy food;
                    •      The ex-combatants are mostly involved in growing traditional crops like maize, jirjir, onion,
                           okra etc.;
                    •      Despite facing numerous challenges, most of the ex-combatants are thankful to the
                           NDDRC for this Program and understand the importance of reintegration;
                    •      Animal husbandry ex-combatants’ businesses are growing steadily. They are not to the
                           level of profit-oriented business, but the ex-combatants are able to support their
                           households.


          Challenges

          The following challenges were noted by the training teams:

                    •      In this third week of training, the ex-combatant’s main complaints and challenges have
                           started to repeat themselves and are often related to the start-up kits;
                    •      Some of the tools’ quality could be better, according to the ex-combatants. This comment
                           is mainly related to the traditional farming tools and might have to do with improper use or
                           misuse of the tools;
                    •      Insecticides and seeds are needed for the farmers;
                    •      Medicines are needed for the animal husbandry ex-combatants.


          Start-up kit use

          The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:

                    •      Most of the ex-combatants make good use of their start-up kits by applying the knowledge
                           acquired during this program;

         •   The ox-ploughs came with no ox and with no chain, so even if the ex-combatants rent an
             ox – they still do not have a chain;
         •   Some of the basic farming tools are believed to be of poor condition, but this might be due
             to improper use;

     5.5      State Specific Reporting: Warrap

The state of Warrap is one of the largest
state of South Sudan in terms of its area
and population. It also has numerous
territories, which become unpassable
during most of the rainy season, which
usually starts in May of every year. This
Project’s state-level training came to be
conducted      during     the    climatically
unfavorable time and the training team,
among other things, had to face
transportation challenges when travelling
between training locations.

Warrap has 75 ex-combatants originally registered for this pilot Project as residents, but the state-
level training activities period showed that some of the ex-combatants migrated to other
neighboring states – Western Bahr-el Ghazal (8 people) and Lakes (1 person). With 8 people
trained in other states and 1 person, who migrated to the state of Western Bahr el-Ghazal,
unreached, the Warrap training team managed to train 74 out of 75 ex-combatants, delivering
business/cooperative and agricultural training in 5 different training locations around the state in
accordance with the ex-combatants’ reintegration field preference indicated during the training in
Mapel in August 2013.

          Following the informational support organized by the training team and NDDRC, the attendance
          was impressive for the first week of training.

          Achievements

          The following achievements were noted by
          the training teams:

                    •      Support training sessions conducted
                           on various topics for the ex-
                           combatants in Tonj South with great
                           success;
                    •      We helped in formation of 5 new
                           cooperatives since the original ones
                           had died immediately after they
                           were formed;
                    •      Counseled and resolved the issue
                           of allegations that this DDR program
                           was part of Riek Machar’s
                           campaign. The ex-combatants did not want to become associated with that kind of activity;
                    •      Local leaders were met in Tonj South and they gave us support during the mobilization
                           and sensitizations of the ex-combatants;
                    •      The team visited one of the upcoming mechanic Garage and supported the initiative. He
                           was trained on production and workplace management (see pic).


          Challenges

          The following challenges were noted by the training teams:

                    •      The commission staff need more motivation since the cost of living is high;
                    •      Some ex-combatants mistrust the Institution a lot because initially they had high
                           expectations. They claim that a lot of money was given to DDR and disappeared;
                    •      Inability (both financial and in terms of capacity) of the ex-combatants to sustain the
                           cooperatives after their formation;
                    •      The lack of resources and clear plan on the side of the ex-combatants;
                    •      Continuous in-state migration of the ex-combatants affects their business capacity;
                    •      Some of the ex-combatants have no desire to develop themselves and try to practice the
                           obtained skills;
                    •      Some of the ex-combatants lack out-of-the-box thinking and do not consider other
                           business avenues except the fields that they got trained in in Mapel;
                    •      Animal Husbandry beneficiaries all claim that the animals died;
                    •      Long drought season is a set back to the agriculturalists;
                    •      Most of the ex-combatants do not have access to the information on where to get services
                           like Veterinary services. Agricultural services etc.;

        •   There are difficulties in reaching certain areas since the roads are very bad in this rain
            season;
        •   No land to start their businesses in town;
        •   Most of the ex-combatants claim that the tool kits were not sufficient for business.
Start-up kit use

The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:

        •   On average the tool kits are being used well, but some are incomplete, according to the
            ex-combatants;
        •   The start-up kit least used is the plough as the say most of the parts like chains and some
            bolts are missing;
        •   Almost all the goats and chicken died according to the XCS of Animal Husbandry;
        •   Tool kits of Auto-mechanics are not being used as the XCS don’t have the skills to operate
            it;
        •   The carpentry say that they were not given Jackplane and almost all the tools are of poor
            quality.

       5.5.2 Week of 16-21 June 2014

The training team visited the Pagol Agricultural
Cooperative Society – a cooperative founded by
an ex-combatant in Tonj North County’s Pagol
payam. The ex-combatant (Lual Nhial Mangok)
was able to gather 20 community members
around him and they are now successfully
operating and the reintegration start-up kit is
being used extensively and productively.

          develop as a business and ultimately utilize the whole area they have been given by the
          Government with NDDRC’s support.

          Achievements

          The following achievements were noted by the training teams:

                    •      The members of the cooperative managed to start the vegetable growing process and are
                           now expecting results;
                    •      The ex-combatant showed great level of leadership by organizing 20 community members
                           around his business idea;
                    •      A sizeable land plot was allocated for this cooperative; and
                    •      They have started fencing off their land so that unwanted people/animals can’t get inside.


          Challenges

          The following challenges were noted by the training teams:

                    •      Their fencing is still poor and in need of further improvements;
                    •      Pests and diseases are significantly affecting their farming;
                    •      Although highly motivated, the member of the cooperative lack clear and detailed plans of
                           further development, especially so in terms of management;
                    •      Some other ex-combatants were in this cooperative before, but disappeared, leaving just
                           one person. Mostly due to the fact that they did not want to work every day;
                    •      The farming practices they use are obsolete and they need further agricultural training,
                           because the cooperative’s productivity depends on it;
                    •      This year’s long drought season became a setback;
                    •      Until we came with the training, the people did not know that they could get additional
                           agricultural services from the Ministry directly;
                    •      Difficulties in reaching certain areas since the roads are very bad in this rain season;
                    •      Tool maintenance is sometimes a problem, because the people do not realize the
                           importance of tool maintenance/cleaning/etc.


          Start-up kit use

          The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:

                    •      Some of the provided tools have proved to be a lot more effective than the ones
                           traditionally used in this area, e.g. they are now using hoes and rakes instead of small
                           hoes;
                    •      The ox-plough without an ox and a chain is not very efficient and rarely used, when the
                           cooperative has a chance to rent an ox;
                    •      Tool maintenance is very poor.

     5.5.3 Week of 23-28 June 2014

The Warrap state training team delivered the follow-up training to 20 people, including 7 ex-
combatants and 13 community members. Some of the ex-combatants who were originally based in
Warrap state, were discovered in the states of Lakes and Western Bahr el-Ghazal. Their names
and contact information were provided to the corresponding state managers for the proper training
to be delivered.

Some of the ex-combatants, although received a particular training and start-up kit in Phase I, are
now interested in a different reintegration field. This is often true for the ex-combatants of originally
non-agricultural reintegration field, who then realized that it is too complicated and they can feed
themselves easier by being a subsistence farmer.

Achievements

The following achievements were noted by the training teams:

         •   The ex-combatants are mostly engaged in subsistence farming with a few of them having
             surplus production that they can potentially sell;
         •   Some ex-combatants, despite being
             unsuccessful     in    their    private
             business, were able to find a stable
             job, which is very important, because
             some people do not naturally have
             the “business” mindset;
         •   Several cooperatives were formed:
             Ngic Rot Loi Group, Kong-Tiing
             agricultural cooperative, Cyie manyiel
             cooperative, and Bumat NDDRC
             cooperative.

             Challenges

             The following challenges were noted by the training teams:

                       •     Inability of the XCS to sustain the cooperatives after their formation;
                       •     The lack of resources and clear plan;
                       •     Obsolete farming methods are used by the population, which in most cases means low
                             productivity;
                       •     The drought season is expected to become a big challenge for the ex-combatants;
                       •     Lack of information of existing government support programs for farmers, entrepreneurs
                             etc.;
                       •     It is almost impossible to acquire land plot in town. If the land offered to the ex-combatants
                             is usually outside of town in a very inconvenient location;
                       •     Most of the ex-combatants claim that more tools should have been in the start-up kits.


             Start-up kit use

             The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:

                       •     Some of the ex-combatants still do not make use of the start-up kit, although they keep it;
                       •     The usual problem with the agriculture start-up kit is the lack of ox and the lack of a chain;
                       •     Auto-mechanics start-up kits are the least used ones, because the ex-combatants have no
                             knowledge of how to use them.

                    5.5.4 Week of 30 June-5 July 2014

             Two counties were covered during this week – Abyei County and Twic County – with 28 people
             having benefited from the follow-up training, including 10 ex-combatants and 18 community
             member involved in the cooperative businesses with the ex-combatants.

The ex-combatants were happy to receive these visits by the training teams as they had already
lost their hope of receiving this training. Many ex-combatants do not own a mobile phone and it is
difficult to locate them. Additionally, the rainy season made it challenging for the training team to
get to some of the locations. But all the challenges pay off when the team sees the ex-combatants
thankful for the training.

Achievements

The following achievements were noted by the training teams:
     • The ex-combatants are mostly able to support themselves in terms of food and basic
         needs;
     • A daily income of SSP 25-30 is considered adequate for 1 person – this is the amount of
         money that a person can earn by working for someone or by selling or re-selling
         agricultural produce;
     • The ex-combatants who were able to set up a slightly larger scale farming operations are
         able to make up to SSP 300 per days during the harvesting season;
     • The start-up kit usage level is high among the ex-combatants with agricultural field of
         reintegration, while the other ex-combatants sometimes require additional tools and/or
         training.

Challenges

The following challenges were noted by the training teams:
     • Unfortunately, some of the ex-combatants have alcohol abuse problems and are not
         willing to address them, which complicates the process of their reintegration;
     • Pesticides are needed by all the ex-combatants that have any kind of farming operation;
     • Some ex-combatants are asking for seeds of pumpkins and water melons, saying that
         those would grow very well in the area;
     • The usual problems of ox, chain, nuts and bolts are also present in these 2 counties;
     • Boreholes and water pumps are in big demand, keeping in mind the dry season.


Start-up kit use

The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:
     • Some of the agricultural start-up kits are still stored at the NDDRC office
         uncollected/undelivered. They are too bulky for the ex-combatants to collect them and they
         are waiting for assistance in delivering the start-up kits to their place of residence;
     • The auto-mechanics start-up kits are not being used as the ex-combatants are still waiting
         to receive additional training in that area, after which they will be able to start their small
         businesses;
     • The ploughs are rarely being used as they are difficult to assemble ad to maintain.

                        5.5.5 Week of 7-12 July 2014

                 Seven ex-combatants were reached and trained in this last week of the state-level training. These
                 persons could not be reached in their states as they did not show much desire to receive the
                 training, but the training team was able to approach them in Kwajok town, when they came there to
                 collect their army salaries.

                 After the training, however, the ex-combatants were happy that they had a chance to receive it,
                 because they obtained additional knowledge on how to potentially gain stable income by working in
                 agricultural production, service industry (e.g. fixing furniture, equipment etc.) or by creating or
                 joining a cooperative.

                 Achievements

                 The following achievements were noted by the training teams:

                            •     The ex-combatants’ trust in the NDDRC was reinstated by the training team;
                            •     Agricultural training was provided to all the seven ex-combatants regardless of their initial
                                  reintegration field;
                            •     The ex-combatants realized that they can generate more money by working in the society
                                  than by being in the army and waiting for the salary every month;
                            •     Information was provided to the ex-combatants about various possibilities within the
                                  Government of South Sudan of receiving various tangible assistant if working in a formal
                                  cooperative;
                            •     Psychologically, it was a relief for these ex-combatants to meet the training team to make
                                  sure that someone still cares about them and makes efforts to assist them in their
                                  reintegration process.


                 Challenges

                 The following challenges were noted by the training teams:

                            •     High mobility of these XCS makes it very hard to reach them. We managed to get these
                                  ones because they had come to pick their salaries;

         •    The traditional farming practices that are practiced by the population are now obsolete and
              mostly ineffective;
         •    Pests and diseases pose great danger to the efforts of the ex-combatants;
         •    Most of the ex-combatants do not have the information on where to get veterinary and
              agricultural services, which are available to the general public, including them;
         •    The town areas do not provide land to start their business. The available land plots are
              usually in remote, unsafe locations that are not the best for business or agriculture;
         •    The ex-combatants would like to have received a more “complete” start-up kit: more tools,
              better brands etc.;
         •    There is a superstition that if one works hard and makes good money – they will definitely
              be robbed and killed by bad people.


Start-up kit use

The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:

     •       One start-up kit is still stored in the state NDDRC office in Kuajok and were never delivered
             to the ex-combatants;
     •       The start-up kits in the ex-combatants’ possession are intact and used, usually except the
             ox-plough, which requires 2 bulls and a chain to operate, none of which is generally
             available to the ex-combatants;
     •        The auto-mechanics ex-combatants need additional training before they are able to use
             their start-up kits, because at the moments they do not have sufficient knowledge.

     5.6        State Specific Reporting: Lakes

Among the four participating states, Lakes state is the
closest one to the territories of recent unrest in South
Sudan’s oil-rich regions. Considering this, it is seen as a
great success of the South Sudan DDR Program that
none of the 93 ex-combatants residing in this state,
returned to any kind of conflict-related activities. All of
them fully realized the advantages of the peaceful,

          society-oriented lives in the communities. Living with their families, having a small business of their
          own and being in control of their own income and its distribution became the deciding factor for
          staying at home and away from taking sides in the conflict.

          The training team was able to reach and train 81 of Lakes’ 93 ex-combatants participating in this
          Pilot Project. In addition, one ex-combatants from Warrap state was trained and a widow of an ex-
          combatants who passed away earlier this year.

          The training team received a high level of cooperation from both the local authorities and the state
          DDR Commission, who assisted in the team’s in-state travel as well as in contacting the ex-
          combatants leaders and in organizing their timely arrival for the training activities.

          The ex-combatants in Lakes state preferred to work by themselves and start their own/family
          operated small businesses as opposed to joining forces with other ex-combatants and community
          members in forming cooperatives. The logistics in Lakes state is difficult and, for example,
          agricultural small business can mostly be targeted at the local/regional market, because it is difficult
          to deliver the produce to other regions and states.

                 5.6.1 Week of 9-14 June 2014

          The training team provided training to 35 ex-combatants and 1 community member during week 1
          of the state-level training, which focused of the ex-combatants who reside in Rumbek center area.

          Most of the participants are still in possession of their start-up kits. However, in many instances the
          ex-combatants do not have adequate skills to make the best use of the tools provided to them. This
          creates a lot of sense in the expert visits program introduced in this Phase II of the Pilot DDR
          Project.

Achievements

The following achievements were noted by the training teams:

     •    Several ex-combatants have started commercial farming like Marial Madol and others. The
          training on sales and marketing, Production, Cooperative formation and commercial farming
          was provided to them;
     •    The training team targeted at igniting the ex-combatants’ effort in further developing their
          business skills. For some of them, the team will visit their business locations to boost their
          morale and deliver additional hands-on knowledge;
     •    The fact that the ex-combatants are now community members makes them learn many
          thing as their life goes. For example, the importance of daily and weekly budgeting has
          been realized by most of the ex-combatants;
     •    Several ex-combatants were able to find themselves in areas different from those indicated
          during Phase I. They are successfully using the business skills obtained;
     •    There is a 7 ha. farm organized by one of the ex-combatants that deals with sorghum and
          groundnut.


Challenges

The following challenges were noted by the training teams:

     •    The ex-combatants who received the agricultural start-up kit request a chain and an ox for
          the ox-plough;
     •    Auto-mechanics ex-combatants need the driving lessons so they can test the vehicles they
          have repaired;
     •    Land is needed by the ex-combatants for expanding their businesses;
     •    Irrigation is often a problem, especially when there is drought. So, a water pump is desired
          by many of the ex-combatants;
     •    The general complaint by the ex-combatants is that Lakes state has security problems.


Start-up kit use

The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:

     •    Most of the start-up kits are intact, but many are not used because of lack of skill or financial
          resources;
     •    Ox-ploughs did not include chains and/or bulls;
     •    There is an issue of expectations. Some ex-combatants expected to receive more
          tools/cattle with the start-up kits.

                 5.6.2 Week of 9-14 June 2014

          The training team visited 9 ex-combatants and 1 community member. The one community member
          is the widow of an ex-combatant who was unfortunately killed while working on his farm.

          While there were no cooperatives formed so far, the ex-combatants are planning to start their
          businesses in the nearest future. Being owners of an ox-ploughs, some of them acquired the
          cooperation skills by co-working with owners of bulls to plough both interested persons’ land.

          Achievements

          The following achievements were noted by the training teams:
             • The ex-combatants have made their first steps by establishing subsistence farming to make
                  sure they can feed themselves and their families. This includes planting crops small scale in
                  their personal gardens and backyards;
             • The ex-combatants realize the importance of the training and appreciate the efforts of the
                  training team;
             • The newly introduced agricultural training proved to be very useful and more of such
                  training will be needed in the future as the ex-combatants’ farming businesses grow;
             • Cooperation in sharing an ox-plough and a bull is an indicator of the ex-combatants’
                  preparedness to be full scale community members and they can already be considered as
                  such.


          Challenges

          The following challenges were noted by the training teams:
             • Chains and ox for the ox-ploughs are needed;
             • Auto-mechanics training is needed by the ex-combatants who chose auto-mechanics and
                  their reintegration field;
             • General infrastructure state is slowing down the development: roads, utilities, services etc.;
             • Support needed for the land allocation;

     •    Security issues in Lakes state often interfere with the ex-combatants’ business development
          plans;
     •    Micro financing is underdeveloped in South Sudan. Otherwise the ex-combatants would be
          able to take small loans to facilitate business growth;
     •    Pesticides/insecticides are needed.


Start-up kit use

The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:
   • Most of the start-up kits are in possession of the ex-combatants. They are using them to
        some extent, but not effectively because of lack of specialized training, financial resources
        and lack of entrepreneurial mentality;
   • The Most of the start-up kits were still in good condition and being used by the owners.

     5.6.3 Week of 23-28 June 2014

During this week the training team visited the counties of Yirol East, Yirol West and Awerial. The
total number of people trained is 37, which includes 32 ex-combatants and 5 community members.

Due to occasional unrest in the state, some of the ex-combatants were not able to start their
business. On the other hand, they did not go back to the army and did not join any side of the
conflict, because they realize that they now have to reintegrate back into the community.

The animal husbandry ex-combatants are waiting to receive the goats and the chicken, which will
be purchased and delivered to them by the training team in the nearest future.

Achievements

The following achievements were noted by the training teams:
   • Even though some ex-combatants do not yet have enough skills and resources to run their
        business, they fully realize the importance of being able to support themselves and their
        families;

                 •       Most of the ex-combatants have a small farming operation regardless of the their field of
                         reintegration and the type of everyday job;
                 •       Given the scarce resources, the ex-combatants have learned to share them. For example, if
                         their neighbor has a bull and they have some other faring tools, the ex-combatant will take
                         the bull for 1 days and give his neighbor the farming tools for 2 days;
                 •       Carpentry can be seen as second most valuable reintegration field, because even the basic
                         carpentry skills and some tools will provide living to the person and his family;
                 •       The ex-combatants positively respond to the motivational and inspirational activities carried
                         out by the training teams as part of the follow-up visits.


          Challenges

          The following challenges were noted by the training teams:
             • General sense of insecurity continues to be a constraining factor in several parts of the
                  state, although in general the situation is showing signs of improvement;
             • The ex-combatants claim that they need assistance with more tools, seeds, water pumps,
                  boreholes and chemicals (pesticides);
             • Due to vast fishing resources in the state, some of the ex-combatants requested fishing
                  nets;
             • Fencing materials are needed to protect the harvest;
             • The ex-combatants think that they should also be getting the working (expendable)
                  materials, e.g. fixtures for the tables for carpenters etc.


          Start-up kit use

          The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:
             • The start-up kits are mainly in the ex-combatants’ possession and are mostly used;
             • The animal husbandry start-up kits are being completed and the ex-combatants willstart
                  working with them soon;
             • The ex-combatants complained that mane tools’ handles broke already.

     5.6.4 Week of 30 June-5 July 2014

Three ex-combatants received a visit by the training team during this week – all of them in the
reintegration field of agriculture. They are all using their yards to grow crops in order to feed
themselves and their families as well as to sell any surplus that emerges.

The usual crops that they grow are tomatoes, okra and onion, which are considered a fairly safe
choice in terms of growing as own food and for sale.

Achievements

The following achievements were noted by the training teams:
   • During the okra season, it is possible to receive a revenue of up to SSP 75 per day from
        selling okra. This is of course not entirely profit, because the ex-combatants spent their
        time, effort and resources while growing it, but they still see it as their profit because it is
        real cash in their hands;
   • The business side of their farming is only starting and it will only develop after they are
        completely confident in their ability to support themselves and invest some of the effort and
        finances in business development, but they are on the right track.


Challenges

The following challenges were noted by the training teams:
   • The ex-combatants claim that they need assistance with more tools, seeds, water pumps,
        boreholes and chemicals (pesticides);
   • Due to vast fishing resources in the state, some of the ex-combatants requested fishing
        nets;
   • Fencing materials are needed to protect the harvest;
   • They feel they should be getting even more support from the government.


Start-up kit use

The following comments can be made on the start-up kit use:
   • The start-up kits are used widely, but, as in different parts of the state, the ex-combatants
        need an ox and a chain for that ox-plough;
   • Some of the smaller tools are broken, lost or stolen;
   • Opinion is expressed that they should have received more tools.

                  5.7           State Training Lessons Learned

           The state-level training activities covered 270 (93%) of the ex-combatants, and 129 community
           members and overall can be considered a major success of South Sudan’s DDR Program.
           However, as this project is a pilot, the Consultant kept a constant eye to areas where lessons could
           be learned and improvements made in future DDR programming in South Sudan.

           The training teams faced numerous challenges, which should be addressed during the planning
           stage of the future DDR activities in South Sudan. Resolving the issues listed in this chapter will
           facilitate smooth operation of field training activities, follow-up visits, and vocational training
           arrangements as well as more effective cooperation among and within the training teams.

           This section outlines the most significant constraints that the training teams faced while in the field.
           The challenges and ways of addressing them are covered in detail in Appendix 2 of this report.

           Timing of training

           The Phase II activities, after being rescheduled several times for reasons outside of Client’s or
           Consultant’s control, started at a time when most of the population of South Sudan is busy in their
           fields and backyards cultivating crops, because mid-May is usually the start of the rainy season,
           which then ends in October.

           Also, the rainy season in South Sudan is the time when many of the roads, especially regional
           roads, are in extremely bad condition and sometimes unpassable, which makes it difficult for (i) the
           training teams to travel to the training locations from the state capital and (ii) the ex-combatants to
           travel to the training locations from their payams and bomas.

           Literacy/Numeracy

           Even basic level of literacy and numeracy among the ex-combatants cannot be considered as a
           given for project planning purposes. The training teams, while in field conditions, had to sometimes
           redesign the previously developed curricula to turn them into more visual and to include additional
           modules on literacy and numeracy.

Expectations

Many of the ex-combatants were expecting the training teams:

     •    To bring their salaries, which were sometimes not paid for a few months;
     •    To pay them money for coming to the training;
     •    To provide food and accommodation; and
     •    To provide more tools.


Mindset

Many ex-combatants, unfortunately, did not overcome the habit of receiving instructions, salary,
clothing etc. This affects their ability to make adequate decisions in financially planning their small
businesses. Even the ex-combatants who have relatively successful business operations have a
hard time realizing that the revenues they get need to be partially reinvested, otherwise the
business will slowly decline and at some point stop making revenues.

Information

The Government of South Sudan, in cooperation with international donors, offers various and
numerous opportunities for its population to receive assistance in supporting their livelihood. For
example, the Ministry of Agriculture can provide tractor services, fencing, seeds etc. Other
ministries also have different support programs. Unfortunately, the ex-combatants in most cases
have no knowledge of such programs and have to only rely on themselves, their families and
NDDRC in their reintegration into the society and financially supporting themselves in their day-to-
day lives.

High mobility

Many ex-combatants have a tendency to move a lot within their state or even within the region,
which makes it difficult for the training teams to plan their participation in the training sessions
before they are actually contacted and commit to attending the training in one of the locations.

Alcohol

Unfortunately, alcohol abuse is a constraining factor in DDR activities, because it seriously limits
the ability of the training teams to successfully deliver the knowledge and reintegration concept to
the ex-combatants. The ex-combatants who have a drinking problem often do not accept the very
existence of this problem and are not willing to join forces with other ex-combatants and community
members in forming cooperatives.

Cooperative registration

The efforts of both the Government of South Sudan and this Pilot DDR Project are largely targeted
at stimulating the formation of cooperatives, which is both (i) a great reintegration tool for the ex-

          combatants and (ii) a way for society to collectively support its members by sharing the tools,
          knowledge, experience etc.

          Both Phase I and Phase II of this Pilot DDR project promoted the idea of cooperatives among the
          ex-combatants, but it became obvious during the Phase II follow-up visits, that, although many ex-
          combatants accepted the idea of cooperatives being one of the best ways to improves their lives,
          they only organized themselves and community members on the basis of verbal agreements. The
          cooperative operations witnessed by the training teams were all not registered with the state. This
          is partially because they did not have enough procedural knowledge and were not willing to pay the
          state registration fees, which is approximately SSP 650 (approximately USD 206 at the official
          exchange rate).

          Land

          While some groups of ex-combatants received assistance from NDDRC in receiving and registering
          land plots, land is generally a problem, because most of the ex-combatants still do not have land
          for starting their own business. Many have agricultural land but no land in a location conducive to
          small business use. The government does have some land to offer, but this land is usually located
          in unfavorable locations difficult to cultivate in (e.g. water is not available). Obtaining a land plot in
          urban areas is especially difficult.

          Training venues

          The training teams had to spend significant amount of time at each training location looking for a
          suitable training venue and negotiating the terms of use. In most cases, they were able to
          successfully arrange the venues, but at the cost of the time that could potentially be used for
          reaching out to/training ex-combatants.

          Start-up kits

          The training teams also collected feedback on the use and status of the start-up kits by the ex-
          combatants. This detailed feedback is compiled in the attached Livelihoods Start-up Kit Report,
          however it is of note that the proper alignment of start-up kit materials to needs, and knowledge in
          their use is an important part of the XCs potential success.

                                 6. Technical Skills Extension
Apart from the core task of providing the ex-combatants with the follow-up visits and to monitor
their reintegration progress, Phase II of the South Sudan Pilot DDR Project was designed to deliver
additional assistance to supplement the strengthened business skills with activities targeted at
building additional capacity of the ex-combatant in his/her particular previously picked reintegration
field.

This assistance was provided as supplementary training, some of which was integrated in the core
activities of the Project such as agriculture trainings which reached out to all the ex-combatants in
the particular reintegration field. For the other reintegration fields, ex-combatants had a choice
whether to attend additional structured training or not.

The Technical Skills Extension included (i) agricultural extension visits, (ii) vocation expert visits
and (iii) targeted vocational trainings.

     6.1      Agricultural Extension Visits

The agricultural extension training was an integrated part of the Phase II state-based trainings as
outlined above. The training was provided to all the agricultural ex-combatants by Ministry of
Agriculture Extension Workers in coordination with the follow-up entrepreneurship, cooperatives
and financial literacy training provided by the teams of state managers and ICRS caseworkers.The
South Sudan Ministry of Agriculture extension workers were made part of the state-level training
teams and available to provide training in agriculture to all the ex-combatants reached in the four
participating states.

Similar to the business training teams, the agriculture extension workers attended a Training of
Trainers at the start of Phase II. The details of the agricultural extension training can be found in
the “Project Preparation” chapter of this report, covering the Agricultural Training of Trainers as well
as in the Training of Trainers curriculum and handbook developed by the international agricultural
expert and submitted separately with this report.

Within Phase II of the South Sudan Pilot DDR Project, the agricultural extension training was
delivered to 119 ex-combatant out of the original 129 people who chose agriculture as their field of
reintegration. In addition, because the extension workers were travelling together with the Phase II
training teams, the agricultural extension training was available for the ex-combatants of other
reintegration fields to attend, provided that it did not interfere with their core training following a
non-objection of the state manager. The number of additionally trained ex-combatants was not
recorded as no separate attendance sheet policy was introduced for them.

     6.2      Vocational Expert Visits

The expert visits became one of the Phase II components that were arranged and administered by
the National DDR commission. This track gave the ex-combatants of non-agriculture reintegration

                 fields the opportunity to receive a visit by an experienced professional with proven skills in their
                 respective field.

                 The expert visits were not mandatory and the ex-combatants were free to decide if they wanted to
                 participate in this sub-component or not. The reach or this activity was also limited by availability of
                 experts in locations close to those of the corresponding ex-combatants and other options chosen
                 by the ex-combatants (see “Additional Assistance” section below). Additionally, the majority of the
                 population was busy cultivating.

                 Although having potential, this component needs careful state-level pre-planning in order to be
                 successfully implemented. With proper logistical support and coordination, the National DDR
                 Commission, in cooperation with small business representatives and training facilities, will be able
                 to provide the ex-combatants in all the states with expert visits that will benefit their reintegration. In
                 the absence of the above, the expert visits were limited to 1 welding expert, who visited the states
                 of Western Bahr el-Ghazal, Warrap and Lakes and mentored the ex-combatants of welding
                 reintegration field residing in those states.

                        6.3           Targeted Vocational Training

                 At the request of the NDDRC the project was asked to incorporate targeted vocational training in
                 phase II for those ex-combatants that did not receive sufficient vocational training at the Mapel
                 Transitional Facility. Specifically, the ex-combatants that had chosen the auto-mechanic/driving
                 vocational track were deemed to be in need of additional training.

                 To provide this additional training the Consultant worked with local vocational skills training entities.
                 South Sudan has a number of professional training facilities which provide both basic and in-depth
                 professional training. Some of them are multi-functional and provide training in various professions,
                 while others are single profession training centers, e.g. driving school, which assist students with
                 both training and also help them receive their driving licenses.The auto ex-combatants in each
                 state was informed of the training options and the results of the targeted vocational training
                 accomplished by the National DDR Commission are presented in the table below6.

                                      7. Additional Assistance
Although most of the components and sub-components of the Phase II were thoughtfully and
thoroughly planned in advance, there were instances where this Project was able to assist the ex-
combatants’ reintegration by providing assistance as needs and opportunities arose. These
activities were minor in terms of the size of the Project, but ended up being extremely valuable to (i)
boost the ex-combatants’ trust in the DDR Program, (ii) ensure their trust in NDDRC as an
organization and (iii) set a foundation for their further progress in building their livelihood in the
communities of return under the modern society-driven and market-based rules.

     7.1      Land Registration

South Sudan, being a country of sizeable area, makes land plots available to certain groups of
citizens free of charge, including ex-combatants, provided that they organize themselves into
partnerships or cooperatives. The National DDR Commission’s state-level offices assist the ex-
combatants in utilizing this opportunity and registering for a land plot. The state NDDRC offices
make this information available to the ex-combatants on a regular basis and provide assistance to
the ex-combatants in following all the formal procedures associated with this opportunity. To date,
four land plots were officially registered under the names of ex-combatant-organized cooperatives
in the counties of Wau and Tonj in the state of Western Bahr el-Ghazal. The Phase II Pilot DDR
Project contributed by covering the registration fees for these four plots of land.

     7.2      Cooperative registration

The government of South Sudan encourages cooperatives by providing through various ministries,
numerous opportunities to registered cooperatives, e.g. tractor lease, subsidized seeds etc., but
very often financial illiteracy prevents people (not just ex-combatants) from registering a
cooperative, and when they do go all the way – the registration fee becomes the final obstacle that
they, even collectively, cannot overcome. This Project contributed by paying the cooperative
registration fee for a cooperative of 10 ex-combatants and numerous community members in
Marial Bai, Western Bahr el-Ghazal.

     7.3      Driving licenses and medical tests.

As outlined above the ex-combatants who chose the automotive track were provided
supplementary vocational training by being enrolled in the state-run driving school. Here they were
able to obtain the necessary skills that would result in them receiving the official driver’s license,
enabling them to launch a career in driving. In order to receive a driver’s license a medical
examination and license issuance fee was required. Phase II of the Pilot DDR Project financed
these mandatory medical examinations as well as official license issuance fees for all the ex-
combatants who attended the driving schools.

                 7.4           Timber supply

          Some ex-combatants were not interested in additional skills training, stating that they have all the
          necessary skills, and their start-up kit however, they had a shortage of raw materials to successfully
          run their business, i.e. timber. Following the above, the National DDR Commission, within Phase II
          of the Pilot DDR Project, procured timber through the line ministry for 5 ex-combatants, who
          chose to forego the expert visits and suggested this as an alternative.

                       8. Recommendations and way forward
The lessons learned presented here are envisaged to act as a major tool in the process of
designing the projected future DDR activities in the Republic of South Sudan. Therefore, they are
presented in this Final Report (i) as separate sections outlining the major challenges as well as
ways of addressing them, and (ii) as Appendix 2 to the report, incorporating both major and minor
lessons learned of this Pilot Reintegration Project.

Lessons learned include challenges and recommendations of every component of this Phase II of
the Pilot reintegration (Project preparation, Training of Trainers, state-level training) as well as
recommendations on modification of the start-up kit component, which was a part of the Phase I
activities.

A basic theme of the Lessons Learned from the livelihoods component is that all parts of the
Project (starting from Project preparation and up to the follow-up training) should be carefully
planned to the last detail. At the planning stage, advice should be sought from the local authorities,
NDDRC HQ and state offices, ex-combatant leaders, and other parties that can potentially
contribute to smooth flow of the DDR activities in South Sudan.

Additionally, several important factors should be considered during the planning stage of any
community-aimed project in South Sudan, because ignoring them may result in challenges during
the project’s implementation stage, which can be negative experience for both the implementing
party and the beneficiary. Some of these factors are:

             •    Rainy season start and finish;
             •    Language/dialect for each state/region;
             •    Road conditions/transportation;
             •    Ex-combatants’ expectations/mindset;
             •    Literacy/numeracy levels in different parts of the country;
             •    Current small business trends in various states;
             •    Significant difference in prices for the same products in different states.

This section of the Report provides general recommendations to further develop the structure of
South Sudan’s DDR Program to better suit the current situation in the country, existing challenges,
constraints and bottlenecks. It is the Consultant’s opinion that following these recommendations will
allow the NDDRC to not only smoothen the existing design of DDR Program, but also to further
improve some of its key aspects.

Besides these recommendations and the lessons learned within this Phase II, it is very important
that continuity be maintained throughout the whole South Sudan’s DDR Program. This specifically
involves continuity within the National DDR Commission’s implementation team, because the
knowledge collected within the NDDRC during the 2 phases of this Pilot can be invaluable when
the program scales up to include increased numbers of ex-combatants in more states.

                      8.1            Project Preparation

               The planning stage is crucial for success and sufficient time should be allocated to plan all stages
               of the Project in detail. The knowledge accumulated by the TDRP, NDDRC and UNICON during
               this Pilot allows to collectively design a potential DDR Program which may become more effective
               and efficient. This will be especially useful if the number of participating states and ex-combatants
               rises.

               Careful planning is needed from the very beginning and for all stages of the DDR Program. The
               plan needs to be as detailed as possible, but at the same time as flexible as possible, to
               accommodate any unforeseen circumstances along the way. Special attention at the planning
               stage should be given to the following areas:

                         •      Budgeting
                                The budget for all the DDR activities should be planned at the earliest possible stage,
                                using the current costs obtained from all the participating states (the prices may vary
                                greatly from state to state).

                         •      Timing
                                Each stage of the project needs to be planned in accordance with South Sudan’s dry/rain
                                season pattern and other potential time constraining factors, e.g. holidays, training centers
                                availability etc.

                         •      Logistics
                                Various logistical tasks should be handled with great attention. This includes logistics of (i)
                                start-up kit procurement, (ii) training team travel7, (iii) ex-combatant travel and (iv) possible
                                food and accommodation for the ex-combatants.

                      8.1.1 Vocational options

               The feedback and information collected during Phase II of the Pilot DDR project suggests that
               some of the vocations/reintegration fields do not necessarily bring substantial value to the ex-
               combatants in terms of potential income in their particular locations of return.

               It is recommended by the Consultant that the vocations are carefully revised and reduced in
               number, which (i) will allow easier further planning and (ii) ensure that the ex-combatants are
               trained in a profession that has a high likelihood of bringing them stable income.

               Within this Project, most of the ex-combatants did not appear to have made an informed decision of
               their field of reintegration and their choice was excitement-driven rather than pragmatic. There
               should be preparatory work done in all the participating states to identify the existing short-term and
               medium-term need for professions so that the ex-combatants can be informed of that at the time of
               making a choice of their reintegration field.


               7
                   Especially so in light of UNMISS flights being unavailable to the NDDRC as of July 2014.

Considering the fact that South Sudan is predominantly agricultural country as well as having
carefully analyzed the original eight fields of reintegration and their marketability in the participating
states, the following steps are recommended for consideration in designing a future DDR program:

       •   Provide agricultural/animal husbandry training to all the participating ex-combatants,
           because these are the fields the ex-combatants are most likely to succeed in.;
       •   Reduce the number of reintegration fields (and correlated start-up kits) to:
                    o Agriculture;
                    o Animal husbandry;
                    o Carpentry;
                    o Auto-mechanics.
       •   Depending on their community of return, provide the ex-combatants with
           recommendations on the reintegration field, which will have a better chance of providing
           them with a stable source of income.

The above recommendations are also supported by the results of numerous studies and reports on
DDR activities in northern Africa.8

     8.1.2 Start-up kit design

According to the information collected during the follow-up visits to the various payams in the
participating states, the local markets do not lack basic tools for any of the start-up kit types used in
this Pilot DDR Project. It is, however, difficult to find more complicated and/or expensive tools and
materials.

Since numerous complaints were received, it is suggested to involve the representatives of the ex-
combatants in the start-up kit design process so that they can make their suggestions on the
composition of the start-up kits.

The main recommendations on the start-up kit composition are the following:

       •    Agriculture
            The Pilot start-up kit contained numerous basic tools (spades, hoes etc.) that are
            generally available to the ex-combatants to either buy from the local markets or to borrow
            from their neighbors. In addition, the ox-plough requires 2 bulls to operate, whereas the
            ex-combatants do not have access to any. It is suggested to revise the start-up kit
            composition to include fewer more substantial items, e.g. 1 bull and seeds. This will make
            the ex-combatants very attractive to the community members in terms of cooperative
            formation.

       •    Carpentry
            Although minor additional consultations may be needed, the start-up kit was of acceptable

                           composition, but consideration should be given to creating a system of providing the ex-
                           combatants with timber.

                    •      Auto-mechanics
                           Repair shops should be consulted to refine the start-up kit to be sufficient to perform most
                           popular repair jobs for the motorcycles.

                    •      Animals
                           With proper animal husbandry training, the existing design of the start-up kit provides the
                           ex-combatants with the potential of creating an animal farm with a large number of goats
                           and chicken.9

                 8.2           Training of Trainers

          As briefly covered in the Lessons Learned, there are several factors that contribute to a successful
          Training of Trainers program. In addition, it is essential that the experts conducting the Training of
          Trainers program have a chance to witness the result of their work in the field and possible
          introduce modifications to the program. The recommendations are as follows:

                    •      Allow 3-4 weeks for design of the TOT curriculum and training manual;

                    •      Allow 10 days in-country preparation time for the TOT expert in order to produce
                           necessary training materials, equip the venue etc.;

                    •      Arrange for all the TOT participants to stay at the same hotel, preferably also being the
                           TOT venue, because transit time can be unpredictable;

                    •      Conduct the Training of Trainers program for 2 weeks with half-day Saturdays and
                           Sundays off;

                    •      Allow 1 week immediately after the Training of Trainers for the TOT expert to accompany
                           some of the teams to their respective states, witness the launch of the state-level training
                           and provide recommendations on improvements to all the training teams.




          9
            Procurement of large numbers of animals/birds locally be it bulls, goats or chicken, bears high risk of inflating the prices
          for those on the state, regional or even national level.

     8.2.1 Hiring of trainers

While the system of hiring ICRS caseworkers as business/cooperative trainers proved itself
effective, the TOT expert should be able to rate the TOT participants and recommend those that
meet the requirements to become state-level trainers. For that, the number of TOT participants
should be higher than the number of state-level trainer positions available.

This needs to be done, because it is natural that some of the ICRS caseworkers may lack
motivation for this type of task as it involves extensive human interaction and a lot of travel to the
regions that some might consider uncomfortable. The TOT expert will be able to identify potentially
best candidates and the rest, having benefited from the training, will go back to their original duties.

     8.2.2 State managers

Externally hired state managers provide additional depth to the training teams and should be kept
in the DDR Program in order to maintain the system of mutual quality control between the NDDRC
and the implementing partner.

     8.3      State-level training

The state-level training process involves numerous challenges described in the corresponding
section of this report. Most of the challenges can be addressed by introducing minor modifications
to the reporting and budgeting approach. The recommendations are as follows:

       •    The training should ideally finish a few weeks before the start of the cultivation period
            (May);

       •    The training materials should be as visual as possible to properly address the ex-
            combatants’ literacy and numeracy challenges;

       •    The goals of the DDR Program should be reiterated to the ex-combatants to avoid false
            expectations, rumors etc. as they can harm the overall project and create unnecessary
            antagonism;

       •    The trainers should have specific knowledge and be able to advise on exact steps one
            should take in order to formally register a cooperative and/or a land plot;

       •    Training venues should be agreed upon before the training teams arrive to avoid spending
            time to look for a place and to negotiate on the price (if any);

       •    Extensive reporting structure should be created for all the training team members. It
            should include minimal writing, but a substantial about of data and yes/no questions about
            the ex-combatants’ DDR experience.

                 8.4            Logistics

          DDR Program logistics, just like its budget, needs to be both detailed and flexible. Components of
          the DDR Program may take months to implement and, during those months, various factors may
          come into play and affect the originally planned approach. The changes in the plan, even minor
          ones, usually reflect in the logistics of the Program and all sides should be prepared to quickly react
          to any challenges that may arise.

                 8.4.1 Start-up kit procurement

          Sufficient time should be invested in creating a detailed procurement plan for purchasing and
          delivering the start-up kits. Reliable partners in South Sudan and/or other countries need to be
          identified and contracted. Preference should be given to single source procurement with the
          supplier responsible for delivering the start-up kits to each state. In case that is not possible, a
          transportation company will need to be hired separately.

          The start-up kit supplier will need to be made responsible for properly packaging each start-up kit to
          minimize loading/unloading efforts. The start-up kits will need to be packaged individually and
          ready to be given to the ex-combatant without prior re-packaging, assembling etc., because
          additional manipulations with the start-up kits at the time of distribution may create significant delay
          as the DDR program scales up. The procurement and delivery process needs to be as simple as
          possible.

                 8.4.2 State-level training

          If the further DDR Program is designed to keep the current approach of using several central
          training locations in each state, the state-level training logistics will consist of (i) training teams
          travel and (ii) ex-combatants travel and food, both of which are very important for the overall
          Project success.

          Training teams travel

          The state-level training teams consist of (i) state managers, (ii) resident ICRS caseworkers, (iii) out-
          of-state ICRS caseworkers, and (iv) agriculture extension workers. All of them have different
          financial arrangements for the state-level training process, which can potentially cause conflicts,
          especially so among the government employees, because the state managers in Phase II were
          under contract with the implementing partner and were specifically instructed not to discuss the
          financial side of their work with the colleagues.

          The recommendations for planning the training team logistics are the following:

                     •      Avoid including UN flights as means of inter-state transportation because they are not
                            guaranteed even at times when NDDRC is able to apply for them;

       •    Collect the current price levels for all the participating states and set an adequate travel
            allowance/per diems for the government employees. The prices vary greatly from state to
            state and an amount sufficient for one state may not be enough for another state;

       •    Plan the training sessions in locations where the training teams can live in acceptable
            conditions for several days.

Ex-combatants’ travel and food

While many of the ex-combatants’ expectations from the DDR program may be considered
unreasonable, some basic needs should be considered/addressed when mapping out the future
DDR activities in South Sudan:

       •    One day should be allowed for the ex-combatants to arrive to the training location;

       •    Reasonable (fixed amount) transport reimbursement should be made part of the budget;

       •    2 tea breaks and 1 lunch break on training days should be provided by the Project in order
            to make sure the ex-combatants stay in training and do not leave;

       •    Although unlikely to happen, consideration should be given to providing the ex-
            combatants with accommodation for the nights between the training days.

     8.5      Additional Recommendations

In addition to the modifications suggested for the existing components of the South Sudan DDR
Program, several new provisions are recommended by the Consultant for introduction. They will
create additional motivation for the ex-combatants to develop as small business owners and to fully
reintegrate into their communities. The opportunities resulting from introducing the items listed
below have the potential to not only bring the ex-combatants to the level with their fellow society
members, but to create leaders, who will ultimately become major employers in their communities.

Demonstration farms

Demonstration farms have proved to be a very effective method of practical knowledge delivery in
Africa. It is recommended to design and implement a program of establishing at least one
demonstration farm in each participating state with an experienced (perhaps regional) farmer in
charge of the whole program and local farmers responsible for each of the state-based farms.

The demonstration farms can be owned collectively by the ex-combatants with the DDR Project
responsible for operating it and ensuring that the farm brings adequate revenues. The basic
farming equipment can be provided within the DDR Project framework and become property of the
farm, which means collective property of the ex-combatants.

                                                                                     DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    87

          While the details of the demonstration farm operations still need to be investigated and refined,
          such a sub-component will provide the ex-combatants with valuable hands-on experience in
          agricultural practices, while profits from the demonstration farming activities can be used for the ex-
          combatants’ benefits.

          Formal cooperatives

          According to the information collected during the Phase II of the Pilot DDR Project, the Government
          of South Sudan makes significant effort to assist the population in their self-development through
          various ministries, including the Ministry of Agriculture, which has the ability to (i) arrange
          temporary use of a tractor, (ii) provide barbwire fencing for the farms to protect them from animal,
          (iii) provide seeds either for free or at subsidized prices.

          These special arrangements, however, in many cases are only available to registered
          cooperatives, so that that government is certain that it helps a working group of people and this
          assistance can be formally accounted for.

          As stated in this report, most of the cooperatives formed under this Pilot DDR Project, although
          operating, are not properly registered. This happened because (i) the ex-combatants did not
          receive enough information on cooperative registration and (ii) the cost of registering a cooperative
          is quite high and sometimes is difficult to afford (~USD 206 per cooperative).

          It is therefore recommended to ensure cooperative registration fee coverage/reimbursement is
          included or that the fee is waived for ex-combatants in the further DDR activities in South Sudan.

    Executive Summary

    1.1.        Trainings

    Under Training Component, we have two types of trainings – (i) Entrepreneurship Training at
    Mapel Transition Facility; and (ii) In-State Livelihoods Trainings.

    Entrepreneurship Training at Mapel Transition Facility commenced on 28 July 2013, upon
    arrival of our international training expert to Juba. The following activities and outputs have been
    achieved:

    1)     Selection of 10 Trainers for conducting training for ex-combatants at Mapel and follow up
    and state level training

    2)      Curriculum and Training module addressing the needs and issues of ex-combatants in
    their reintegration process through setting up small enterprises as individual, partnership or
    cooperatives

    3)      Development of Training of Trainer Manual as a guide for training ex-combatants in
    financial literacy, entrepreneurship and cooperatives for creating small enterprises based on
    their technical skills sets

    4)    Training of 10 trainers for conducting training in financial literacy, entrepreneurship and
    cooperatives at Mapel

    5)     Mentoring 10 trainers for training of further 290 ex-combatants in financial literacy,
    entrepreneurship and cooperatives at Mapel

    6)    Preparation of a note on the framework of follow up support and state level Training for
    ex-combatants during the process of reintegration with their community from 23 September to
    13 November 2013

    The above activities were completed while dealing with several constraints and unexpected
    events. Most activities were highly interdependent in nature. These were owing to the fact that
    the preparatory phase and implementation phase were tied together.

    All the activities performed by the Consultant received high level of appreciation by the
    stakeholders. These includes TOT manual which had passed stringent standards of the World
    Bank, TOT was rated very high by the trainers, and ex-combatants have experienced visible
    benefits of training imparted by the trainers. The Consultant made a significant contribution in
    capacity building in technical areas (Curriculum and Training Manual) and human resources
    development (training of trainers) to DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan. The

resources could be further developed with new dimensions as the ex-combatants respond
positively to reintegration support services and training.

In-State Livelihood Trainings commenced on 23 September 2013 with mobilization of our State
Managers and Trainers to States. Overall, we had 4 State Managers and 8 Trainers covering
four States, which included 290 ex-combatants and unfixed number of community members
willing to join livelihood trainings.

In Warrap State, 70 ex-combatants (out of 75 in total) have received trainings. In addition to ex-
combatants, 34 community members have also benefited from these trainings by active
participation.

In Lakes State, trainings covered all of 93 participating ex-combatants and 29 community
members. Some of the ex-combatants participated in trainings more than once – some two
times and some even three times.

In Northern Bahr el Ghazal, all 30 ex-combatants have been covered with trainings. In addition
to ex-combatants, trainings also covered 108 community members. Some of the ex-combatants
and community members visited trainings more than one time showing their deep interest in
new skills.

In Western Bahr el Ghazal State, only 60 (out of 92 participating ex-combatants in this pilot)
have been covered. The main reason for small coverage of ex-combatants is weather
conditions that made some of the areas inaccessible. In addition to ex-combatants, 113
community members were also covered in trainings.

Overall, 253 XCs have been covered in In-State trainings, which is an 88% coverage of all XCs
in the pilot. In addition to XCs, 284 community members have also attended In-State Trainings.
In total, In-State trainings have covered 537 people in four States. Below is the summary of
participation in In-State trainings by State:

    1.2.       Start-up Toolkits

    The selection of tools for the different kits followed a process that aimed at ensuring standards
    and prioritized relevance of tools to the specific profession. The Consultant has approached
    Ministry of Labour for guidance and, at the direction of the Department of Vocational Training,
    the project cooperated with the Ministry’s Multipurpose Training Centre (MTC) in Juba and Wau.

    The MTC is a public institution that was established in 1973 and, with the exception of trainings
    in agriculture and animal husbandry, has been providing vocational training in all the areas that
    featured in the Mapel Transition Facility. MTC is responsible for setting nation training policies
    and standards.

    The Juba MTC office provided the first draft of standard list of equipment that would be required
    for the various skills. The list was then referred to the Wau MTC to ensure the relevance of the
    kits to the region – the project area. At the same time, the list was also shared with the Juba
    based UNESCO DDR Vocational Training Specialist and Programme Coordinating Officer for
    their appraisal. Parallel to the distribution, the UNSECO vocational trainers in Mapel were
    requested to compile a list of essential tools for each skill.

    The latter exercise was necessary so as to allow the project to identify and sequentially prioritize
    the tools essential for starting a trade. It was also required to prepare for eventualities where kit
    prices are over-priced and adjusting the list to correspond to the set budget becomes necessary
    without critically affecting the potential to launch the ventures.

    For the agricultural and animal husbandry kits, the project approached FAO and ILO for seek
    advice and possible list of items. ILO already had a direct experience in the distribution of such
    kits in the project area. The specialized vocational trainers in Mapel were also requested to
    prepare their respective lists. The same process was followed when preparing the final
    packaging of the two kits; the UNESCO vocational trainer played an essential role when
    determining the specification of inputs and seeds types that suited the region.

    A comprehensive portfolio of start-up kits was then presented to NDDRC Senior Management
    for their consideration and approval. As a result, some important adjustments were introduced,
    especially so to the welding and auto-mechanic kits. The list was shared and approved by the
    World Bank.




8     SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
The Request for Quotations (RFQ) was finalized and issued on 12 September 2013. Bids were
opened and evaluated on 20 September 2013. Following long discussions and evaluations of
bids, Consultant has proposed a re-adjusted list of goods per Toolkit, which was subsequently
approved by NDDRC and World Bank. On 1 October 2013, contracts with suppliers were
signed.

UNICON has approached 66 organizations from the region to participate in bids submission for
these toolkits. Of these, 16 organizations from South Sudan, Kenya, and Uganda have
submitted their bids. This covers mostly all of the potential suppliers in the region that operate in
this market and we were able to provide a full picture of the market and its players. At the end,
two organizations were contracted to supply goods – one from Kenya and one from South
Sudan.

The toolkits were supplied by two organizations – NZOU (South Sudan) and Dryland Seed
(Kenya). Toolkits supplied were of good quality and reached final beneficiaries in same good
quality. Most of the toolkits originated from Europe and some of them from China. The
agriculture components that were supplied by Dryland Seed are produced by Dryland itself
since they are also producers of agriculture goods (seeds and some of the hardware).

Trojan Enterprises was selected to transport goods from Juba to States, delivery conditions
were also agreed upon. In particular, Trojan Enterprises has agreed that each truck will spend
48 hours in each location (i.e. 4 capitals of States) free of charge. After 48 hours, it has to move
to next destination.

The Consultant, World Bank, and NDDRC have agreed that distribution will last during these 48
hours in each location. Public campaign to inform ex-combatants of the arrival of trucks will be
done by NDDRC. When the truck arrives to a location, representatives of (i) NDDRC; (ii) World
Bank; and (iii) Consultant would jointly distribute toolkits to ex-combatants who have arrived for
collection. UNMISS representatives also attended distribution in each of the four locations.

Transportation of ex-combatants from their home locations to State capitals, where Trojan
trucks were stationed for distribution, was carried out by NDDRC with World Bank support.
NDDRC then have assisted ex-combatants to get their toolkits back home due to their heavy
weight and volume.

Distribution in Lakes State was carried out from 31 October (mid-day) to 2 November 2013
(mid-day). The total number of ex-combatants in Rumbek to receive toolkits was 93. However,
due to major floods in Lakes State, a big portion of participating ex-combatants were not
reachable for distribution within this time frame. Therefore, of 93 ex-combatants in total, only 50
toolkits were distributed to ex-combatants as of the moment of report preparation with 43 being
left at NDDRC premises for later distribution once weather conditions allow.

                                                                                DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   9
     Distribution in Western Bahr el Ghazal State was carried out during 1 and 2 November 2013.
     There are 92 ex-combatants in Western Bahr el Ghazal. During distribution, 88 toolkits have
     been distributed and only 4 were remaining with NDDRC for further distribution, as of the date of
     report preparation. Of these 4 uncollected toolkits, 2 beneficiaries are currently in prison and the
     toolkits will be awaiting for their return home.

     Distribution in Warrap State was carried out from 4 to 6 November 2013. The total number of
     ex-combatants from Warrap is 75, of which 71 have successfully received their toolkits. Only 4
     uncollected toolkits were remaining as of the moment of report preparation. The Consultant has
     distributed toolkits from 4 to 5 November, and then assigned toolkits to NDDRC. However, the
     Consultant, together with World Bank representative, have decided to stay in Kuajok during 6
     November as well to assist NDDRC in their further distribution of toolkits on that day.

     Distribution in Northern Bahr el Ghazal State was carried out on 5 November 2013. Total
     number of ex-combatants in Northern Bahr el Ghazal State is 30. Due to successful initial
     orientation visit, the local team of UNICON and DDR officials were able to successfully distribute
     all 30 toolkits within 1 day of distribution. This State had 100% coverage on Day 1.

     * Major floods in Lakes State did not allow Consultant & NDDRC to approach big number of ex-
     combatants since roads were completely inaccessible. However, these toolkits will be
     distributed to the remaining number of ex-combatants once roads would become accessible.

     1.3.        Lessons Learned

     This pilot has provided all parties (Consultant, NDDRC, World Bank) significant number of
     lessons learned which are described at the end of this report, in Section “Summary and Lessons
     Learned”. Lessons include trainings provision, toolkits composition, toolkits procurement and
     distribution, as well as feedback from ex-combatants. This provides valuable information to
     structure future activities taking these lessons into account.

()     Entrepreneurship Training at Mapel Transition Facility
2.1.   Need Assessment and Challenges in Training of Ex-combatants

Since the final beneficiaries were ex-combatants who were undergoing vocational training in
eight skills areas at Mapel Transition Facility, it was therefore important to identify and assess
the needs and constraints in training ex-combatant for entrepreneurship and cooperatives. A
series of meetings were held with the people who had interacted extensively with the ex-
combatants. These people represented NDDRC in Juba, UNMISS, UNESCO and BICC
Technical Adviser.

2.1.1. Training Needs

Our training needs assessment has identified the following:

1)       Most ex-combatants were illiterate which posed serious challenges on the selection of
learning methods
2)       The ex-combatants could speak mainly two languages Dinka and /or Juba Arabic
3)       Limited numerical skills – very few could count up to 100 but they may not be aware of
addition, subtraction and division for different level of computation in business transaction
4)       Also weak in dealing with money and currency in buying and selling transactions
5)       Attitude toward saving was not favourable as most of them would spend their salaries in
a day or two on the items of non-priorities of family and community life
6)       They have been away from civilian life for a long time – therefore may not be aware of
challenges in dealing with civilian attitudes and business transactions
7)       Unaware of potentials in business and possible opportunities based on technical skills
that they had acquired
8)       Lack adequate motivation to seek business careers as they were not aware of the
potentials in business
9)       As they have been away for a long time for their military jobs, they lack exposure to
business operations and traits or behavioural qualities of a business person
10)      Lack confidence in dealing with trade and commercial activities for example, complex
accounting computation, legal processes, dealing with consumers and sale and marketing
activities
11)      Unaware of their own potentials and positive qualities which can be a useful resources in
entrepreneurship
12)      Lack knowledge and skills in business start-up and business management
13)      Experience socio-cultural barriers to entrepreneurship and commercial activities

It was considered most feasible if the ex-combatants are largely prepared for start-up of
cooperatives with community participation or as business start-up as partnership in the relevant
technical skills areas.




                                                                                                     Final Report - Annex A
                                                                             DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   11
     2.1.2. Possible Constraints

     In addition to the above needs for ex-combatants in livelihood training, the following challenges
     were identified during training at Mapel Transition Facility:

     1)      Relative to theoretical and classroom teaching, trainees are confirmed to appreciate
     practical training involving small groups, game, exercise and role plays
     2)      It has also been confirmed that they cannot attend long hours of training and normally
     their concentration level and focus declines considerably after 3 to 4 hours
     3)      Training classroom have limited facilities in terms of teaching aids like LCD projectors,
     computers, white or black boards, and table and chairs
     4)      Meals are not served on time and this delay may disturb classes
     5)      As the ex-combatants reside at Mapel with barely minimum living facilities, most of them
     keep falling sick which may also have negative impact on training

     2.2.         Recruitment of Trainers

     10 trainers were required to be recruited to conduct training for ex-combatants due to language
     barriers. All the recruited trainers were subject to a 10-day Training of Trainers in Financial
     Literacy, Entrepreneurship and Cooperatives. The TOT was conducted by the Training
     specialist with technical support from two NGOs – BRAC and CRADA.

     UNICON’s Lead Training Expert has interviewed over 40 candidates for training positions, of
     which 15 candidates were shortlisted and these 15 candidates were included in our pool. The
     major criterion for short listing was the knowledge of Dinka and /or Juba Arabic. Given the time
     constraints, it was not possible to attract people who had experience in trainings (especially in
     entrepreneurship and cooperatives) or who had experience in teaching illiterate people.
     However, UNICON made an attempt to covert these trainers who had no prior training
     experience as effective trainers in entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and cooperatives for
     training a group of illiterate people through 10 days of trainings.

     The trainers selection was therefore largely based on their abilities to learn quickly and have
     abilities of personal efficacy (a concept of toe effective in uncertain situation) quality. Within one
     week time, the following consultants were engaged by NGO CRADA upon UNICON’s Lead
     Training Consultant approval:

The Team Leader made the arrangement for these trainers to travel to Wau and to Mapel along
with the Training Specialist and two staff members from NGO BRAC. Out of these 10 trainers, 8
trainers were to continue to assist the project up to mid-November and 2 of them would take the
role of State Coordinators for the same duration of time.

2.3.    Training Modules and Curriculum for Ex-combatants

In order to develop requisite modules and learning process, the following outcome and goals
were set by the Consultant:

1)     to prepare ex-combatants for reintegration and take up productive and gainful
employment through micro-enterprises
2)     to develop entrepreneurial capacities for business start-up as individual, partnership
and/or cooperatives with their respective communities
3)     to support 290 ex-combatants in selecting their business opportunities relevant to
vocational training received by them at Mapel under UNESCO trainings
4)     to develop Business skills and behavioural qualities among ex-combatants for start and
manage their enterprises

2.4.    Training Process

     2.6.       Training Manual

     2.6.1. Content and approach

     A well-structured Training Manual with innovative learning methods for making a quick impact
     on the beneficiaries in a short period of time towards initiation of micro-small enterprises was
     considered most important output as part of this Pilot Project.

     The training manual developed by UNICON presents the analysis of training needs as well as
     constraints which may affect implementation of training. It explains training strategies and
     processes for meeting the training needs as well as responding to the constraints at three
     stages of training: (i) pre-training, (ii) training, and (iii) post-training.

     The training approach outlined in the manual clarifies that the training is not something that
     starts and ends in a classroom situation. All three stages are equally critical in creating desirable
     impact.

     Training manual covered session-wise plan, training contents and learning exercises for all 15
     modules. The learning process adopted is based on experiential and participation methods of
     learning. Each module presents learning goals, activity and list of material required for delivering
     each module. The manual also provides detailed instruction for trainers in introducing topics and
     different exercises for attaining learning goals, and managing learning process through
     engaging participants to share their thoughts and ideas. At the end of each module, trainers are
     initiated to summarize learning of each module and link them with the overall learning process.
     Instructions for trainers also ensure continuity and relevance of learning from one module to
     another (transition).

     Most importantly, training manual has also guided trainers for development and production of
     learning materials relevant to context of each of the technical skills for business opportunity
     identification and start up processes. The manual also covered adequately learning pertaining to
     entrepreneurial and cooperative behavioral qualities, business skills, and process of enterprise
     initiation and management.

     The comprehensiveness of this training manual makes the Manual as a complete guide for
     trainers for undertaking preparatory work, conducting lessons and concluding the learning of




24     SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
each module. The manual also provides Notes for Trainers to help them learn technical
contents conceptually well.

Training Manual also represents entire leaning materials and contents which need to be
delivered to ex-combatants to establish micro-enterprises relevant to each of the technical skills
for establishing their businesses as individual, partnership, or cooperative.

2.6.2. Application and Benefits of Training Manual

Ten trainers who had no previous experience in training in entrepreneurship and cooperatives
have delivered training to ex-combatants in 10 different classes. The manual became very
handy in building self-confidence in conducting all of the 15 modules while maintaining
consistency in learning across 10 classes. It played a significant role in attaining high success
rate among trainers in training ex-combatants.

The training manual was so designed as to incorporate diverse set of needs of different
technical skills for creating different types of enterprise. For example, participants in agriculture
learnt about setting up a farm house while participants from carpentry team learnt setting up a
carpentry workshop as individual or cooperative business. The training manual could be
adapted for small business development for different technical areas as it details out the
adaptation of learning materials for each module.

Modules covered in training manual were based on comprehensive development process of a
person as an entrepreneur as well as to empower him/her to undertake key steps leading to
start up and management of enterprise. This allowed flexibility for the trainers to offer modular
training to ex-combatants and community members at state level to satisfy specialized needs of
trainees. For example, trainers were able to providing trainings in Business Development in
Agriculture, Business Plan for Carpentry, or even offer training in Marketing and Book-keeping
for different types of business activities.

The learning process detailed in the training manual draws heavily on the application of
experiential and participatory learning methods and uses practical learning exercises, role plays,
simulation game and small group work. Such training manual will be found very useful in
development of business skills and behavioural qualities among beneficiaries even if these
beneficiaries are less educated or illiterate.

The training manual works as a good instructional handbook for trainers as it details out the
preparatory work for each module and also provides instructions on how to start up a session
and end it with lesson on learning drawn and facilitate transition from one module to another.

2.6.3. Validation

The training manual was developed based on curriculum and training modules developed by the
Consultant and approved by the World Bank. The training manual was subject to peer review




                                                                                                        Final Report - Annex A
                                                                                DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   25
     process. Based on comments received from the World Bank, adjustments were made and final
     version received no objection. The manual has been tested for its contents and delivery process
     during the training of trainers (TOT), as well as training provided to ex-combatants. Therefore,
     this Training Manual can be classified as a duly validated document for the use in the project in
     South Sudan.

     2.7. Training of Trainers (TOT) in Financial Literacy, Entrepreneurship, and
     Cooperatives

     One of the major outputs of the Consultant’s activities under TOT was spinning out 10 well
     prepared trainer-motivators who were confident of providing training in financial literacy,
     entrepreneurship and cooperatives under NDDRC’s Reintegration Project. These 10 trainers
     are capable of continued support to the NDDRC’s future efforts, as well as relevant Ministries of
     South Sudan Government in turning out micro-enterprises in different technical sectors. In
     addition to training for ex-combatants, these trainers are trained to deliver follow up assistance
     and business advisory services to ex-combatants in their reintegration process as well as to
     conduct relevant trainings at State level. These trainers are also equipped with entrepreneurial
     mind-set and have already launched Trainers’ cooperative with head office in Juba. These
     people would therefore be capable of creating community resources and turn their problems
     and needs into marketable opportunities and business model.

     2.7.1. Challenges of Training of Trainers

     A 10-day Training of Trainers in Financial Literacy, Entrepreneurship and Cooperatives had
     commenced on 21 August 2013 and was completed on 30 August 2013. The main objective of
     Training of Trainers (TOT) was to prepare 10 trainers who could deliver training to ex-
     combatants in starting up and managing their enterprises as individual, partnership and
     cooperatives. The training was conducted at Mapel Transition Facility where ex-combatants
     were undergoing vocational training under UNESCO arrangement. The TOT learning process
     therefore had a distinct advantage of continuous interaction with main beneficiaries and was
     very helpful in modifying the learning strategy, contents and process.

     The TOT for turning out 10 Trainers in 10 days for delivering 15 modules to ex-combatants
     faced following challenges:

     1)     Trainers had neither previous experience in training nor experience in entrepreneurship
     and cooperatives. The ToT was expected to develop not only technical skills in conducting and
     organizing training but also in technical, behavioral and conceptual contents in entrepreneurship
     and cooperatives

     2)      The TOT was expected to attain the goal of comprehensive learning in entrepreneurship
     and cooperatives for developing business skills and behavioral qualities among ex-combatants
     who were illiterate for settling different types of businesses. These constraints posed multiple
     set of challenges as it had implication on the development of innovative learning methods




26     SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
3)      The TOT was conducted at Mapel where trainers had limited opportunity for exposure to
wide range of business opportunities and business operations in different technical skill areas
as individual, partnership or cooperative business models. The training could achieve very
limited learning from the market visit and interaction with local entrepreneurs

4)      Since main beneficiaries were illiterate, it required development of learning materials
such as posters, pictures of products and processes, visuals of business operations and other
learning tools. A substantial amount of time was devoted by the trainers to preparation of their
individual kits with availability of limited resources and raw materials

5)     Given the scope of the training and its objective, the duration of 10 days for training was
too short. However, the Consultant could motivate trainers to work over 16 hours per day
without taking a single day break for almost two weeks

6)      Mapel Transition Facility had several limitations in terms of class rooms, learning aids,
and accommodation was not suitable for preparatory work at nights for each day’s session.
Further, trainers, on a few occasions, were deprived of water and food and living conditions
were not hygienic. As a result, a few trainers fell sick during the TOT as well as during the
training session to ex-combatants

7)     There was no sufficient time for review or self-assessment by trainers to transfer their
learning to classroom where they were expected to conduct the training for ex-combatants

Despite several constraints on account of location of training and limited experience of trainers
as participants, the TOT has achieved its capacity building goals very effectively. These are
detailed in the following sub-sections.

2.7.2. Capacity Building of Trainers at Mapel Transition Facility

The training has fully prepared 10 trainers in a comprehensive development approach, which
covers aspects involving motivational and behavioural qualities in entrepreneurship and
cooperatives and key steps critical to the start-up and management of an enterprise.

The training process also ensured that trainers are able to design curricula for meeting different
needs of ex-combatants in fields covering different need-based capacity building training
leading to setting up individual- and partnership-based enterprises and/or cooperatives in
relevant technical sector including farm houses, animal husbandry, masonry works, plumbing,
carpentry, wielding, electrical, auto-mechanic workshops, and other related businesses.

Most importantly, the trainers are equipped with a complete training kit for each module which
was used to conduct training at Mapel, as well as at State level for start of businesses in
different technical trades. They have adequate flexibility to offer learning in small modules to
focus on further strengthening of skills ranging from basic to relatively advance levels in




                                                                                                     Final Report - Annex A
                                                                             DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   27
     business development or formation of individual/partnership businesses and cooperatives
     among ex-combatants along with their partners or community members.

     Trainers have been also trained to offer training and follow-up assistance to ex-combatants to
     reinforce progress towards enterprise formation. This has helped trainers to offer trainings at the
     State level broadly in the areas of business development, start-up of individual/partnership
     enterprises, formation of cooperatives, and management of enterprises.

     With regard to follow up assistance, trainers were prepared to offer a wide range of assistance
     which included the following – selecting business opportunities (including business opportunities
     for adding value through cooperatives), motivating ex-combatants and community members to
     set up cooperatives and offer support services for preparation of business plans, setting and
     launching of cooperatives and managing related issues including deciding on an appropriate
     business location, acquiring all necessary inputs and requisites (such as establishing a Board),
     choosing an appropriate business name, addressing and putting in place other relevant legal
     and business issues, and efficient book-keeping system.

     Similarly, trainers would be able to offer assistance in setting up individual and/partnership
     based enterprises with regard to preparation of business plans, marketing, financial records
     keeping, etc.

     The effective delivery of the training component requires knowledge of Dinka, the popular local
     language, and/or Juba Arabic. Also, the 2-months State level follow-up required knowledge of
     and working experience in the socio-economic and cultural fabric of communities in South
     Sudan.

     The TOT was one of the most successful activities in building the capacity of DDR in
     reintegration process of ex-combatants in entrepreneurship, financial literacy and cooperatives.
     Currently, these trainers are highly motived to prove that they can contribute in the process of
     nation building.

     2.7.3. Evaluation of Training of Trainers

     The TOT was designed to have transformational impact on behaviour and technical skills of
     trainers. Participants shared impact of training on them. Some of these have been highlighted
     during the oral feedback in the presence of the World Bank and NDDRC representatives. The
     participants indicated that the learning in the TOT builds their commitment to work long hours
     and also help them develop as entrepreneurs leading to setting up Trainers Cooperative in
     South Sudan. They had enhanced their conceptual and technical skills with regard to
     development of training curricula and technical contents in entrepreneurship and cooperatives.

     Feedback of participants was sought on continuous basis during the course of TOT. On several
     occasions, participants were asked to share how they felt about the training and whether




28     SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
learning was relevant and useful to them (as teachers, as individual, as members of community,
family and even as citizens of their country).

On last day, formal feedback on various aspects of the TOT was sought. Evaluation instrument
used a 5-point rating scale and was divided into five sections as follows:

      •      Training Venue and Refreshment
      •      Training Organisation and Coordination
      •      Training Materials
      •      Training Facilitators
      •      Level of Understanding and confidence in delivering learning modules to ex-combatants

With regards to the dimension on Training Venue and Refreshment, participants rated this as
the weakest aspect of the entire training. The training location had offered some benefits of
interactions with main beneficiaries; however, accommodation, training hall and refreshments
were rated poorly. These factors could also affect the academic learning and feedback. At the
same time, the effort was made to ensure that weak training facilities did not affect the learning
outcome of training overall.

Training organisation and coordination received above average rating with the lowest score of
the length of training (78%). It can therefore be inferred that the little longer duration of training
was desirable given the learning goals of TOT and other challenges. Other dimensions, such as
timings of activities and coordination of training received very good ratings (84 and 86%,
respectively).

     2.8. Training of Ex-combatants in Financial Literacy, Entrepreneurship, and
     Cooperatives

     2.8.1. Management and Leadership

     Training does not start at classroom and does not end with it – a lot needs to be done beyond
     the classroom to capture impact involving tremendous capacity in exercising management and
     leadership processes. Training to ex-combatants at Mapel Transition Facility was completed




30     SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
successfully with good impact on participants. Training to ex-combatants was not just a matter
of delivery of training contents but management of ‘institution’ over a period of 10 days in
dealing with several challenges. Sharing of these experiences in dealing with certain challenges
may have significant learning value.

Figure 1 below presents a framework of complex management systems and challenges which
are applicable to most training situations, which essentially involve social change and
behavioural capacity building. Management of training for ex-combatants was seen as complex
management system as it involved managing 10 trainers and their deliverables to ex-
combatants with desirable impact and learning. Ex-combatants at the Mapel Transition Facility
were living in the institution systems for over 4 months. These would have certainly impacted
them in formation of certain beliefs, attitude and mind-sets. Further, institutional systems would
also be operating under certain administrative systems and resources which may not be
adequate to support intensive training, since it was much different from technical and vocation
skills training systems.

In order to make training successful and not surrender to situational factors, Consultant had
exercised a lot of problem anticipation and resources mobilization skills without posing much
strain on the existing system.

                                                                              DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   31
     2.8.2. Training Management Systems

     Mapel Transition Facility had its on-going systems and processes for managing a set of
     vocational training facility and therefore resources, infrastructure, and management processes
     were designed to host temporary structure and learning process was relevant to technical
     workshop. The Consultant was to ensure adequate support systems to manage the following:

     1. Full 6 hours of training per day during 10 days as per learning schedule – all the classes
     were to start on time and end on time
     2. If participants miss a few classes, they cannot catch up as learning processes designed in
     each module were highly interdependent and most of the module intended to initiate
     behavioural changes and add new dimensions to their perceptions
     3. Distraction during the training on account of other activities may not allow continuity in
     building cognitive learning and thought process
     4. All the classes were required to be conducted in parallel and therefore required identical
     resources in all 10 classrooms, e.g. tables, chairs, white or black boards, LCD projectors
     5. If tea and lunch is not served on time, it could result in loss of time
     6. Any discontent among participants with regard to existing systems may also affect the
     training
     7. Ensuring that ex-combatants were adequately motivated to attend the 10 days of intensive
     training with positive mind-set

     Considering the above challenges, we have identified certain critical set of tasks for each trainer
     to manage infrastructure and resources and presented these requirements to the management
     of Mapel Transition Facility:

       •      Early interactions with ex-combatants: Trainers and Lead Training Consultant met ex-
              combatants on their first day of arrival at Mapel. This interaction was planned to raise a
              lot of curiosity about the proposed training while the TOT was going on at the campus.
              One of the trainers was assigned to meet ex-combatants to learn about their mind-set -
              what they think and feel and what they wish to do. This was helpful in adjusting training
              contents accordingly.

       •      Logistics for meals and coordination with ex-combatants: One of the trainers was
              asked to coordinate the logistics and also meet people who were serving tea and
              lunches. It has ensured good communication among ex-combatants and also coordinated
              services of tea and lunches timely.

       •      Allocation of classrooms, display of list, and announcement of list to ex-
              combatants: In consultation, 10 classrooms were identified with list of participants for
              each classroom according to their technical skills. This list was displayed at multiple
              locations so that ex-combatants knew where they were expected to go for their classes.




32      SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
  •    Logistic in classrooms: It was decided that the furniture that was required and sitting
       arrangements to be finalised and sourced. Trainers took responsibility of regular
       classroom cleaning and provided safety of training materials before and after each class.

  •    Display of all posters in classrooms: Since this activity was an important part of
       learning, one of the trainers was made in charge of this activity.

In the process of interaction, it became evident that some of ex-combatants were traumatised
and therefore one needed to deal with them differently.

2.8.3. Situational Constraints and Leadership for Change

The training for ex-combatants was designed to be very intensive under tight schedule of
working 6 hours every day during the next 10 days. The training for ex-combatants commenced
on 2 September 2013, as planned, but ended abruptly a day before the scheduled date (12
September 2013). During the course of the training, there were a number of unexpected events
which could disrupt the training process.

These disruptions were largely due to specific dates of training chosen – the following factors
could be attributed:

1)    The above Training was scheduled after the end of UNESCO’s vocation training which
was on 31 August 2013 and before the scheduled graduation on 16 September 2013
2)    A lot of unexpected events took place during training session as some contracts for
goods and services (water and cooking) were about to be completed within a few day time

3)     End of the month is linked to payment of salaries to ex-combatants and this took away
whole day on 4 September 2013, unexpectedly. This event had some disturbing impact on the
trainees and also on the training overall, which includes the following:

   •    a few ex-combatants did not receive salary as they have expected – less or no salary
        caused deep frustration among some of the ex-combatants
   •    those who received salaries after long interval of time wanted to enjoy and went to
        market for personal pleasure
   •    a number of creditors crowded the gate of the Transition Facility as they wanted to
        recover their dues
   •    some of them wanted to send money to their families and the Consultant was told a few
        of ex-combatant left the Transition Facility

4)    ICRS caseworkers also visited the Transition Facility and wanted to meet each of the ex-
combatant

5)    Cleaning of campus as some VIPs were visiting on account of closure of the training and
graduation.




                                                                                                          Final Report - Annex A
                                                                                  DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   33
     The timing and schedule of training for ex-combatants posed many challenges and could disrupt
     the training and classes, as well as negatively affect the involvement of training physically and
     psychologically. However, once the Consultant realized the fact that such eventualities were
     unavoidable under current circumstances, the training specialist along with trainers made
     certain arrangements to eliminate negative effects of such eventualities. Despite all possible
     eventuality expected and unexpected, the training was completed at highest level of
     commitment among the trainers and trainees.

     Loss of time was recovered by sessions starting as early as 07:00 AM in the morning and
     ending up at 5:00 to 5:30 PM most of the days. During the last few days, training sessions were
     wrapped up at 4:00 PM, since ICRS caseworkers wanted to meet ex-combatants after 4:00 PM.
     There was only one hour break for lunch and tea at 9:00 AM. Trainers managed to get around 2
     more hours for each day, which compensated the loss of two days.

     2.8.4. Training for Ex-combatants

     The training for ex-combatants was delivered through 10 trainers who were trained under the
     TOT at Mapel in 10 different classrooms. The participants were grouped as per their TVET
     classes. Training commenced on 2 September 2013 and ended on 11 September 2013. All 15
     Modules were delivered to ex-combatants according to the TOT manual which guided trainers in
     carrying out each of the sessions and respective learning exercises.

Leaning and impact of training on ex-combatants:

1)      Motivation and Commitment: The training started with motivating ex-combatants how the
training would help them shape in creating income generation activities based on technical skills
and sessions on Introduction and micro-lab also initiated them to make commitment to the
learning processes designed during the next 10 days

2)     Respect for Money as an effective instrument for happy living and meeting future
uncertainties. The sessions on Financial Literacy proved to be ‘eye opener’ for ex-combatants
and they acquired useful skills:

 •       Participants realized that they were making mistakes in giving cash and receiving cash at
         the market as they did not know how to add up currency to make payment when
         purchasing multiple items in the market and they were not sure whether they had
         received cash back correctly. Participants therefore practiced a number of transactions
         involving exchange of local currency to master the skills in paying and receiving currency
         in market transactions.

 •       Participants also felt that they did not know the value of money and they would spend the
         money as soon as they receive for buying items of non-priorities. Most tend to spend their
         salaries in a day or two and then manage the rest of the days during the month through
         borrowings from shopkeepers. They were not aware of the fact that money can be used
         for happy living of family and community and also as instrument for meeting any
         eventuality in the future. In the role play, they learned how they can make their family
         budgets. In the first round, they found that their family members were all upset as the
         money was spent without catering to their needs. In second round, they had decided to
         make a budget that could make every member of the family happy and at the same time
         they could plan to save at least 200 SSP out of 460 SSP given to them. Here the
         participants realized the magic of effective and healthy family budgeting leading to
         formation of favourable attitude towards saving and effective use of money for better
         living.

3)       Awareness and Motivation for Business career:

     •   Participants identified different types of business opportunities with respect to their
         customers and their needs and problems. They could identify at least 2 to 4 opportunities
         based on their technical skills and become aware of market potentials

     •   Participants interacted with several business people who started their businesses with
         less than 10 pound a year ago and today they were earning 50 pounds per day. This
         inspired most of the participants as they realized that one does not need a lot of money to
         start a business. One of the participants made a statement that the Government gave




                                                                                                          Final Report - Annex A
                                                                                  DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   35
            money but they [participants] actually have money in their own head. They committed to
            depend on themselves for creating a better future.

4)            Business Opportunity toward enterprise start up:

     •      Participants learnt how to connect business opportunities with needs of people. This
            actually helped some of the participants to start their business during the course of
            training. One of the participants started selling milk powder to ex-combatants when they
            were drinking black tea, another ex-combatant sold biscuits to them. The third ex-
            combatant started selling soda and other items to ex-combatants at the campus.

     •      All the participants identified and selected business activities which they want to start
            when they would be back home. Participants were assisted in taking key decision as to
            who would be their customers; why they would buy their products (needs) from them;
            what would be the name of their business and where their business should be located.

5)            Concept of Cooperatives:

     • One of the major goals of the training was to motivate participants to set up their
       businesses as cooperative. The concept of cooperatives was introduced very
       innovatively. Participants were given a stick and were asked to break it. They could break
       it easily. The trainers then joined 6 to 8 sticks together and tied with a small rope. Now
       participants were asked to break the bundle of sticks which they failed to do. Participants
       soon realized that when they are together they become strong and add more money,
       resources and skills for the benefits of each other. This motivated most of the ex-
       combatants to start their business as cooperative.

     • The training module also helped them develop requisite skills sets critical to the success
       of cooperatives. Through one of the simulations exercises, they learnt how to set up team
       goals (cooperative goals) and how to ensure the success of members of cooperatives
       rather than individual success at the cost of other members. Participants leant to apply
       the principles of cooperative for success of their cooperative businesses.



6)     Business Skills Development: In order to build confidence among participants that can
start and manage cooperative business enterprises, participants carried out a day long
simulation exercises (mock Business). The exercise facilitated them to form the cooperative and
run entire business transaction involving:

     •        Formation of cooperative: name of business, setting up board and officials and work
              allocation




36       SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
   •   Production: Skills building in making products, estimating products target, skills
       assessment, skills improvement, carryout the production and manage the quality
       standards

   •   Purchasing: Determining purchase of raw materials, calculating the cost, and check the
       supply and quality of raw materials

   •   Marketing and selling: Product promotion, pricing, selling skills, computing the sales
       achieved

   •   Bookkeeping: Computing cost, profit and loss, keeping the records of transaction

   •   Business improvement: Assess business results; analyse causes of profit and losses;
       take steps to correct the mistake and improve business performance

7)     Enterprise Management: Participants learnt how to manage the different function of a
business enterprise:

   •   Purchase Management: The process of determining the needs of business, quantity,
       sources of purchases, keeping recodes of purchases and stock

   •   Production: participants drew their work place on business that they want to start and
       identified how that would arrange all the equipment and raw materials for efficient
       production

   •   Marketing: Participants found out different ways to reach out to consumers and how to
       affect sales when consumers are in the shop. They learned about relationship
       management. They realized that ‘customer is the king’ and they should treat him/her
       nicely.

2.8.5. Sample of Business Plan of cooperative and Individual Business

Trainers have prepared business plans for each business that ex-combatant decided to start.
These business plans are available with them for use during the follow up. They have advised to
send all their business plans as soon as possible to the respective DDR offices:

     2.8.6. Evaluation of Training

     The feedback from ex-combatants was sought on a daily basis with regard to their satisfaction
     as well as value of learning they receive. A formal written feedback could not be taken as most
     of the ex-combatants could not fill up the feedback sheet independently and assistance through
     trainers might be seen as influencing. The feedback was sought without disclosure of the name
     of the participants. As a result, it was decided that oral feedback could be sought in gathering of
     all the participants and also in the presence of the management team of Mapel Transition
     Facility. The trainers were advised with just one hour notice to close the training on 11
     September 2013 at 12:30 on account of preparation for the President’s visit.

     UNICON’s Lead Training Consultant invited all participants to meet with trainers and
     management team at 3:30 PM. During the meeting, a selected number of representatives were
     invited to share their views and benefits of the training. This can be summarized as follows:

     1) All speakers shared immense satisfaction with training and acknowledged that this 10-day
     training benefited more than 6 months of training in terms of overall benefits.



     2
         The detailed Business plans are available with the trainers

                                                                                               DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   39
     2) They also told that the training has helped them remove myths about the fact that they
     knew how to add and subtract when dealing with currency and their knowledge was wrong.
     They now feel confident in dealing with financial transactions

     3) They also ensured that they are fully committed to start their business enterprises as soon
     as they go back home. They would start their businesses and they would be happy if trainers
     came to see how they were doing their businesses

     4) They learnt something about cooperative which they were never aware of. They are now
     committed to set up cooperatives with the help of local community

     5) They shared that they are less dependent of Government support as they now know what
     they need to do for their livings

     6) They expressed gratitude to all the trainers for making a difference to them in such a short
     time

*)     State Level Trainings
Following the Mapel-based training in Financial Literacy, Entrepreneurship and Cooperatives for
ex-combatants, UNICON will conduct further trainings at State level and provide follow up
support and assistance in making progress toward establishing their enterprises. Trainers
trained through Training of Trainers at Mapel would visit the respective States from 23
September 2013 to 13 November 2013. UNICON’s Lead Training Consultant prepared a note
on the framework of follow up assistance and suggested training and curricula for conducting
training at the state level.

3.1.   Objectives of State Level Reintegration Livelihoods Support

•        To support the ex-combatants utilize the Vocational, Literacy and Life Skills trainings
gained at the Mapel Transition Facility toward productive livelihoods in their communities of
return.
•        To reinforce and facilitate the operationalization of the decision made by ex-combatants
during their training in Mapel to establish themselves in individual businesses or in partnerships
and cooperatives.
•        To assist in cooperative formation and offer subsequent training to ex-combatants along
with community members who wish to join in the formation of cooperatives and management of
cooperatives in different technical sectors
•        To assist the establishment of individual entrepreneurships or partnerships in business
activities by offering further training to ex-combatants in business start-up and management
including (i) micro-enterprise skills training as correlated to the vocational trainings received in
the Mapel Transition Facility; and (ii) small farm business skills training.
•        To assist ex-combatants in handling the start-up and management process such as
board formation, marketing and book-keeping initially
•        To offer advice in initial troubleshooting such as lack of support of family or community
members or selection of location appropriate to the opportunities.

3.2.   Framework of Activities at State Level

The following framework of activities is the foundation of the State-based follow up support
assistance and training curriculum.

Mobilization and Sensitization

Ex-combatants, after having completed the 10-day training in financial literacy, entrepreneurship
and cooperatives, were expected to work on implementing their business ideas. However, as
they arrived in their communities, they experienced a few obstacles to their plans to be in
business due to socio-cultural barriers toward business. Ex-combatants would therefore need
further reinforcements and support of their community in start-up for partnership and/or
cooperative based enterprises. At this juncture, the trainers acted as change agents in
mobilising the support of the community and family members and sensitise them towards




                                                                                                      Final Report - Annex A
                                                                              DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   41
     potential benefits of business and cooperatives such as local development, improved living
     standards and income, security of income for the family and education of children. Trainers
     carried out the following activities to create a supportive environment for ex-combatants:

         •       Sensitize community on the benefits of business and cooperative
         •       Identify value added services through cooperatives
         •       Motivate people volunteering to join ex-combatant in establishment of cooperatives or
                 partnership
         •       Revisit ex-combatants on their decisions to individuals/partnership/cooperatives
         •       Conduct need assessment of services and training for establishment of their business as
                 individuals/partnership and/or cooperatives
         •       Prepare work plans for services (counselling and assistance) and training

     Assistance in Establishment of Businesses relevant to each technical trade

     This was an on-going activity of the trainers which was offered as soon as ex-combatants and
     their communities decided for a specific business enterprise model. Trainers offered assistance
     before, during, and after the training to ex-combatants. The need for the assistance was largely
     required as ex-combatants cannot read and write and would not know how to proceed for
     resources mobilisation or legal processes involved.

     Trainers offered assistance in the preparation of:

        •        Business Plans
        •        Location selection
        •        Select name of Business
        •        Legal procedure (Registration), where needed
        •        Opening bank account, where needed
        •        Formation of Board
        •        Organization of production/farm establishment
        •        Resource mobilization (inputs)
        •        Implementation of formats for record keeping
        •        Arrange technical inputs pertaining to their business with local experts/institutions
        •        Advise on packaging of farm produces for marketing

     3.3.       State-Based Training and Curriculum

     As the trainers visited communities of ex-combatants, they assessed training needs of ex-
     combatants and their communities and offered need-based training to ex-combatants along with
     their community members.

     The training programme proposed at the State level was conducted with respect to the different
     types of business in technical trades as mentioned above separately into two different business




42     SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
formats, namely – individuals/ partnership and cooperatives. For example, if participants are
from agriculture technical trade and then the first training proposed is on Business
Development, it was offered as “Training for Business Development in Agriculture or Farm-
house Establishment” (see Figure 2 below). In case of mixed groups, trainers formed different
groups and used relevant training kits for each group. This facilitated business development,
entrepreneurship and cooperatives in different technical trades for different business format.

     Only 2 females were registered as participating ex-combatants in this pilot out of 75 XCs in total
     for Warrap State. Of these two, only one participated in trainings. Among community members,
     no female participation was observed.

     After distribution of toolkits was completed, our team has made a follow-up visit to participating
     ex-combatants in Tonj where they assessed their progress in various business skills they
     acquired during training and how they use newly received toolkits in this regard. In addition to
     this, UNICON team has assisted XCs in the following ways:

          •       Assisted ex-combatants to assess land allocation and hold negotiations with the county’s
                  commissioner on progress made
          •       Ascertained to which degree participating ex-combatants still remember their business
                  skills acquired at Mapel Transition Facility
          •       Assisted with understanding of how to apply newly acquired skills during trainings with
                  toolkits received (e.g. how to managed fixed capital in relations to their toolkits)
          •       Reminded them on the principle of daily and monthly family budgets so that their
                  businesses are not affected negatively due to poor budgeting

     3.4.2. Trainings in Lakes State

     Staff involved in State trainings:

     State Manager:                              Biar Abraham Dhieu
     Trainer:                                    Gar Malual Gar
     Trainer:                                    Puot Jacob Kir

     Training in Lakes State was carried out from 23 September to 13 November 2013. The State
     has 93 participating ex-combatants in this pilot. Distribution of these ex-combatants was as
     follows:




48     SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
   •   13 in Rumbek Centre
   •   6 in Wulu
   •   9 in Cueibet
   •   17 in Rumbek East
   •   3 in Rumbek North
   •   20 in Yirol West
   •   16 in Yirol East
   •   9 in Aweirial

UNICON trainers and state manager have provided a wide range of assistance to ex-
combatants and community members, including assistance with selection of business with focus
on cooperatives, motivating ex-combatants and community members to join hands and set
cooperatives together, as well as forming boards that can administer and manage newly created
enterprises, run proper accounting and bookkeeping, and other assistance as needed.

Trainings overall covered all 93 participating ex-combatants and 29 community members. Some
of the ex-combatants participated in trainings more than once – some two times and some even
three times.

Below are illustrations indicating training participation by (i) gender; and (ii) ex-combatants /

Females did not participate in the training program not because they were not interested, but
mainly because all 93 participating ex-combatants from Lakes State are male. The community
members that joined trainings were also all male. Therefore, training did not cover any single
female in Lakes State.

     3.4.3. Trainings in Northern Bahr el Ghazal State

     Staff involved in State trainings:

     State Manager:                              Christine Asienzo
     Trainer:                                    Deng James Manyok

     Training in Northern Bahr el Ghazal State was carried out from 23 September to 13 November
     2013. The State has 30 participating ex-combatants in this pilot. Distribution of these ex-
     combatants was as follows:

         •       16 in Aweil East
         •       12 in Aweil South
         •       1 in Aweil North
         •       1 in Aweil West

     To provide better coverage and for more efficiency, trainings were implemented in five centres –
     Malual Bai, Wanyjok, Kolbith, Malek-Alel, and Pantit. Each training lasted for 2 days minimum.




50     SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
Trainings implemented in Northern Bahr el Ghazal successfully covered all 30 ex-combatants.
In addition to ex-combatants, trainings also covered 108 community members. Some of the ex-
combatants and community members visited trainings more than one time showing their deep
interest in new skills.

Upon completion of the training component in Northern Bahr el Ghazal, five cooperatives were
formed by the ex-combatants. No one chose individual or partnership form of business. The five
created cooperatives operate in the field of (i) agriculture production, (ii) trading, (iii) fuel
business, (iv) fisheries, and (v) restaurant business. Our State Manager and Trainer have
assisted ex-combatants and community members in registration and start-up assistance.

After distribution of toolkits, UNICON local consultants designed a strategy to follow these
beneficiaries to see how they were progressing and how they used toolkits in line with trainings
received. Consultants have done 2-3 follow-up visits per centre after the major trainings were
completed.

UNICON trainer has also observed synergy of cooperation between ex-combatants and
community members in reintegration and has witnessed successful integration of the two
groups in newly established cooperatives.

The following cooperatives have been created:

     +)            Livelihoods Start-Up Kits
     Livelihood Start-Up Kits constituted a critical sub-component of the Livelihoods Support work
     conducted in the Pilot Reintegration project. The procurement and delivery of start-up kits was
     designed to enhance the efforts of ex-combatants to engage in productive and gainful
     employment; be it as a private venture, partnership or cooperative arrangements.

     There were six key steps in the task of start-up kit distribution:

     1.            Preparation
           •       Agreement on design of start-up kits
           •       Formation of start-up kits components list

     2.            Procurement
           •       Search for potential suppliers
           •       Design of Request for Quotation (RFQ)
           •       Invitation of potential bidders and bids submission
           •       Evaluation of bids
           •       Selection of suppliers

     3.            Logistics
           •       Delivery of goods to Juba by suppliers
           •       Warehousing in Juba
           •       Confirmation and Bundling of Contents of Kits
           •       Transportation from Juba to States
           •       Storage in States

     4.            Distribution Support
           •       Orientation Visits
           •       Toolkits Distribution Visits
           •       Communications – XCs and Media

     5.            Distribution of Start-Up Kits

     6.            Collection of Lessons Learned and Documentation
     In total, 199 ex-combatants received their kits during the 2-day distribution event in each state,
     with 239 out of 290 ex-combatants collecting their toolkits by the end of Phase I. The remaining
     ex-combatants were informed that they could collect their toolkits at any time in the NDDRC
     state office.
     This work was substantial and detailed and as such has been separated from this
     report into a standalone report: Livelihoods Start-Up Kits Summary & Reflection.

trainings process, we would like to make some recommendations to the World Bank and
NDDRC, based on our observations on the ground, for improvement in the project
implementation process as well as to share our innovative ideas for effective reintegration
process of ex-combatants at next stages.

In order to ensure smooth implementation of the project, it is suggested that adequate time gap
is allowed between the preparatory and implementation phases. The preparatory phase should
have commenced early July and completed by 15 August with 10 trainers fully trained to
conduct training for ex-combatants.

Training in financial literacy, entrepreneurship and cooperatives should be organized near the
market area in semi-urban or urban areas. The trainings need to expose participants about
business and management practices and market operations through continuous visits to the
market and collecting data about products, customers, suppliers, and help in building
perspectives in market channels. The training module also requires interaction and experience
sharing sessions with local entrepreneurs and cooperatives. Such opportunities were very
limited in Mapel.

Most ex-combatants are illiterate and this may pose a serious constraint at the growth phase of
business when management of enterprises would become more complex, including adherences
to legal and taxation issues, as well as expanding business to more sophisticated market
channel. It is recommended that ex-combatants and their community members are supported
with Adult literacy. In future, vocational training should include adult literacy as a major
component and should cover minimum acceptable level standards in reading, writing and
numerical skills.

Mapel Transition Facility had offered vocational training in eight technical skills. Most ex-
combatants had to choose out of very limited options of technical skills. It is recommended that
ex-combatants could be given more options and more vocational skills such as agro-food
processing, cooking, garment, etc. These may have good market demand in rural areas.

One another observation, which was common to all four States, was that the ex-combatants in
Auto-mechanical sector complained that the training they have received at Mapel Transition
Facility was not sufficient enough for them to continue working on their own. Perhaps, a training
curriculum for auto mechanics could be revised or reviewed since this observation was common
only to auto mechanics and throughout four States.

Vocational skills training offered at Mapel Transition Facility should be now validated in terms of
their market and employment potentials in rural areas, as well as local demands of these skills.

    Summary and lessons learned from the toolkit component are presented in a separate report.




                                                                                                                    Final Report - Annex A
                                                                                            DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   57
     Arrangements should be made to counsel ex-combatants while selecting a particular vocational
     skill set as per market potential in local areas. Some of the vocational skills such as plumbing,
     electrical, auto-mechanics, wielding may have limited market potentials in certain rural areas.

     Entrepreneurship and cooperatives are being considered a major instrument for reintegration of
     ex-combatants, therefore training in entrepreneurship and cooperatives should be arranged
     before the selection of technical skills. Such training would help ex-combatants select
     marketable opportunities and help them select the vocational skills relevant to their business
     ideas. It is not necessary that business should be started based on the technical skills of the
     participants4. Many business enterprises could sources technical skills from the market. It is also
     not critical for prospective entrepreneurs to acquire technical skills until he/she decide it would
     be helpful.

     Technical trainers should also been given training in entrepreneurship and cooperatives as they
     could enhance technical skills and their relevance to potential business prospects. The technical
     trainers would involve their trainees in market research and determine cost, price, and profit or
     loss for each product made and sold. This ultimately would help them acquire financial,
     business, and technical literacy while acquiring vocation skills.

     Training for ex-combatants at Mapel has been very successful in building saving attitude and
     participants realized the importance for their own (and family’s) welfare and better future.
     However, they have very limited opportunities for reinvestment in rural areas and cannot keep
     the money [cash] safe. As a result, they tend to spend money as they always fear that it could
     be stolen by someone including their family members. The Consultant therefore proposes that
     “Rural Bank” could be promoted and set up in rural areas to offer opportunities to ex-
     combatants and other local people to keep money protected at the Bank.

     There is now need to extend or set up Business Advisory and Training outlets in rural areas.
     These services could be set up under cooperative business format. Already 10 trainers trained
     by the Consultant have formed Trainers Cooperative. It is suggested that such cooperatives
     could be created through organizing more training for trainers and business consultants in
     entrepreneurship and business advisory and training services. This will ensure continuous self-
     sustaining support services though commercially viable enterprises without dependence on
     government support. There are similar success stories from Uganda, Kenya, and Benin. These
     enterprises offer training to prospective entrepreneurs, as well as enterprise management
     services including modular training in bookkeeping, marketing, production management, laws
     and regulations, market network, IT services, and other relevant sectors.

     Rural Incubation Centre (RIC) should be set up to cover cluster of 30 to 40 villages as business
     incubation centre or industrial parks equipped with electricity and communications facilities,
     where ex-combatants could start their micro and small businesses and use common equipment
     and facilities for carrying out business activities. For this purpose, RIC should make


     4
         Note: many ex-combatant have selected businesses which are not consistent with vocational skills




58        SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
collaborative arrangement with technical training institutions, production centres and industrial
development estate to create an effective infrastructure in rural areas. The proposed RIC could
be linked to farm houses and farm produces could be brought for value addition by the RIC’s
entrepreneurs.

To provide additional support to ex-combatants in vocational skills, entrepreneurship and
cooperatives, Consultant suggest the following activities:

a.     Vocational Training already acquired by ex-combatants may not be adequate and would
not be adapted to meet the acceptable as per market and business practices and standards. It
is proposed that ex-combatants could be offered apprenticeship in small and medium size
enterprises where they could have more exposure and experience at the State level. In order to
arrange the apprenticeship training in these enterprises, support of business and industry
associations could be mobilized and they are oriented through a short workshop on the need
and nature of apprenticeship for ex-combatants.

b.      While ex-combatants are progressing in business including managing their farm houses,
they may be required in more agriculture-based technical information and guidance. It is
suggested that community radio would be useful instrument in offering these information about
agriculture, technical skills, and business management. A few technical teachers could be
trained in entrepreneurship and capability for setting up community radio on a commercially
sustainable manner. The community radio could be used for dissemination of useful information
and learning about business and market as well.

c.      There is a need to carry out needs assessment of ex-combatants based on the progress
towards reintegration achieved along with their community members who have joined them in
starting partnership or cooperative based enterprises. This will help to determine the need for
further follow up assistance and training at State level. Those who have already started their
businesses may require more training and assistance leading to stabilization of their
enterprises. This would require more advance level services and training in dealing with
financial management, taxation, reinvestments, people management and leadership,
microfinance and banking operations, creativity and problem solving, business performance
improvement, legal and regulatory aspects of business and taxation, market linkages
development, and network through business associations and enterprise management.

In addition, there could be a few ex-combatants who may like to explore other opportunities
such as employment in private or government institution. These may require different set of
support services through improvement of the access to these opportunities and/or tie up with
technical and vocation institutions for further education.

In the future, logistics arrangements might be organized differently as well. In this pilot, we had
4 States and UNICON teams (state managers and trainers) were based in the capitals of each
of the States. From there, they travelled to payams of their base-States to carry out trainings.
However, and as it can be seen from picture below, some capitals of neighbouring States are




                                                                                                      Final Report - Annex A
                                                                              DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   59
     located closer to payams of neighbouring States rather than capitals of originating States. For
     example, our team from Warrap State, based in Kuajok, had difficulties in travel arrangements
     and logistics to Tonj South, Tonj East, and Tonj North. Each time they travelled to these areas,
     they had to bypass capital of Western Bahr el Ghazal – Wau, where our other team, responsible
     for Western Bahr el Ghazal, was based. Their journey from Kuajok to Tonj South was twice as
     long and time consuming as it would have been from Wau directly. And most southern areas of
     Tonj South are quicker accessible from Rumbek, Lakes State.




     This lesson suggests that in the future, teams, although based in capitals of States, shall not be
     locked to their States only, but rather locked to payams or coverage areas that are best covered
     from a certain capital. This will avoid possible loss of time and resources for teams to travel to
     areas which can be more efficiently covered by teams from neighbouring State. Tonj South is a
     good example as either team from Wau or Rumbek could have done a more efficient travel to
     Tonj South rather than original team from Kuajok that had to travel all the way south through
     Wau itself.

2   SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
1. Introduction
Tasks to be performed by UNICON: UNICON has been contracted to conduct livelihoods
support activities for ex-combatants in the four states of reintegration – namely Lakes, Warrap,
Western Bahr el Ghazal and Northern Bahr el Ghazal.

Livelihood activities will be offered in three primary tracks:

   1) Livelihood fundamentals in Mapel Transition Facility
   2) Livelihood start-up kits
   3) Livelihood opportunities in the states

           a. Initiating livelihood opportunities through associations/ cooperatives.
           b. Initiating livelihood opportunities through partnerships or individual training –
              including options for business development training & small farm business
              training, and
           c. Adult & formal education opportunity identification and vouchers.

The livelihoods support component will also include:

   1) Monitoring and evaluation
   2) Reporting

The UNICON team: The core UNICON team consists of:

   •   Rustam Davletkhanov: Project management and oversight
   •   Goder Yohannes: Field team leader
   •   Gautam Raj Jain: Training Specialist
   •   Jediel Muthuri: Procurement Specialist.

Implementing partners: The team will be supported by two locally based NGOs; namely BRAC
and CRADA; while BRAC will support the actual training process, CRADA is tasked with the
responsibility of recruiting and managing the trainers both while at the TF and when in the
States.

Trainers and field staff: August 21st - Nov. 13thth. UNICON, through CRADA, will recruit ten
trainers who will deliver in the training of the combatants in the Mapel Center. Eight of this will
proceed to be based in the four participating States and continue supporting and counseling ex-
combatants on entrepreneurship development and formation of cooperatives. The trainers will




                                                                                                         Final Report - Annex B
                                                                                 DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   3
     be assigned to states once the ICRS caseworkers complete their livelihood discussions and
     confirm each XC’s location of reintegration.

     To facilitate easier rapport and communication, we had required that the profile of the trainers
     included proficiency in Juba Arabic and English with a preference for Dinka speakers. Those
     selected are all South Sudanese and do answer to the profile. They are:

                            1. Lodiong John Duku
                            2. Ghar Malual Ghar
                            3. Adire Simon deng
                            4. Chol Kir Peter
                            5. Kanybil Albino Noon
                            6. Biar Abraham Dhiew
                            7. John Gbazamanji Samuel
                            8. Jacob Aguer Mayen
                            9. Deng James Manyok
                            10. Khor Gatwech Chan
                            11. Puok Kir Jacob (Standby trainer)

     Finally, UNICON has engaged four State Training Coordinators responsible for coordinating the
     training teams, mentoring the staff at SPMUs, and preparing periodic progress reports.
     Interviews were held, with the team leader, NDDRC (Dir. Reintegration) and CRADA in the
     panel. Of the 10 trainers above, 2 have been selected to act as state training coordinators, with
     the other 2 state training coordinators selected through the interviews. The state training
     coordinators will begin their work on September 6th, 2013., As in the case of the trainers, we
     also preferred a profile that could facilitate easier communication and understanding between
     staff and beneficiaries. The profile has been satisfied. The remaining two State Training
     Coordinators will join the trainers in Mapel starting no later than September 5th, 2013.

     Livelihood project preparation/inception report: The inception report was prepared,
     appraised and approved by the NDDRC and the World Bank.



     2. Livelihood Fundamentals
     Timeframe: Training of Trainers: Aug 21st-Aug 31st; Livelihood Discussions: Sept 2nd -7th 2013;
     Financial Literacy, Cooperatives and Entrepreneurship Trainings

     2.1.           Transition Facility livelihoods discussion




4   SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
The livelihood discussions will be conducted by ICRS caseworkers which is scheduled to be
conducted from September 2nd-7th. This exchange is expected to inform the UNICON
procurement process in finalizing the trainings chosen by the ex-combatant during Mapel and
determining the number of ex-combatants who opt to further their education and will not need to
be considered for start-up kits.

These discussions will also include confirmation of the intended location of reintegration which
will determine to which states the start-up kits are sent as well as the work schedule of the
state-based trainers that will assist in the formation of cooperatives.

2.2.   Transition facility entrepreneurship training:

UNICON is tasked with the responsibility to train ex-combatants in financial literacy, small
business development and cooperatives, including the formation of private, and joint ventures
and cooperatives. The training will be delivered in 10 days (60 hours) in the Mapel Center. A
total of 60 hours of training has been planned to be delivered to ex-combatants. Out of these 60
hours, about 27 hours of inputs will be on financial literacy and another 33 hours will be
dedicated to entrepreneurship and Cooperatives. A balance will be maintained between theory
and practice – learning by doing and simulated interaction will be encouraged. The Curriculum
and the training modules have been finalized and shared with the World Bank and underwent a
peer review and received a no objection.

BRAC and CRADA have been sub-contracted to support the reintegration trainings. The trainers
have been selected and contracted by CRADA. BRAC is directly supporting the Training
Specialist preparing and delivering the Mapel training component which involves the preparation
of the training curriculum and the design of the training modules already appraised and
approved by the PMU and TDRP.

The strategy of the training is explained in the following three stages.

2.2.1. Pre-Training Stage and Training of Trainers

   •   Analyzed Training Needs of Ex-combatants based on briefs and extensive discussions
       with colleagues who interacted with and directly trained ex-combatants including
       UNESCO vocational training and Literacy specialist.
   •   Finalized the training inputs, methods and approach, and prepared modules for the
       training of trainers
   •   Developed initial modules for training of trainers
   •   Conduct a 10 day training for trainers and train 10 trainers who have been contracted by
       Christian Recovery and Development Agent (CRADA) with the support of BRAC. The
       training of trainers is scheduled for ten days from August 21st to August 31st. The training




                                                                                                        Final Report - Annex B
                                                                                DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   5
                   of ex-combatants will follow immediately on September 2nd and will be concluded on
                   September 12th.
           •       Develop posters for creating business activities, exercises, visuals, format for use in the
                   training of ex-combatants during the TOT and also planning of the post training follow up
                   process

    2.2.2. Training Stage

    Structure of Training for Ex-Combatants

           •       The proposed inputs will be covered in 10 days with 6 hours of Training inputs
           •       6 sessions per day, each session would be 60 Minutes. A total of 60 session of learning
                   inputs during 10 days to ex-combatants
           •       Three breaks: Morning tea break (30 Minutes), Lunch break (60 Minutes) and evening
                   tea break (30 Minutes)
           •       Ex-combatant will be divided into 10 groups on the basis of their technical skills but
                   mixed with varying level of and literacy

    Training Modules

                  Module 1: Introduction and Micro lab: Expectation and Commitment
                  Module 2: Financial Literacy
                  Module 3: Business and Market
                  Module 4: Key activities of a Business, Cooperatives Financial aspects of Business
                  Module 5: Selecting a Business and Cooperatives Format
                  Module 6: Steps in Starting a Business
                  Module 7: Business Skills Development in Cooperatives
                  Module 8: Behavioral Skills in entrepreneurship and Cooperatives
                  Module 9: Team Building and Management of Cooperatives
                  Module 10: Business Plan for setting up Cooperatives
                  Module 11: Enterprise Management: Sales and Marketing
                  Module 12: Enterprise Management: Purchasing
                  Module 13: Enterprise Management: Work Place Management
                  Module 14: Enterprise Management: Book-keeping
                  Module 15: Concluding and action Plan for setting up Cooperatives

    Training Process

    The learning process involves a comprehensive development approach, which covers aspects
    involving motivational and behavioral qualities in entrepreneurship and cooperatives and also
    key steps critical to the start-up and management of an enterprise. The training ensures that




6   SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
participants take key decisions during training pertaining to t the areas such as selecting a
business idea, identify key resources required to be in business, locations of the business and
other partners.

The training process will use the following learning methods extensively:

   •   Experiential learning – simulations and role plays
   •   Participatory method – learning by doing
   •   Visuals and illustration
   •   Awareness generation- through market visit and interaction of entrepreneurs and
       consumers
   •   Individual counseling
   •   Practice sessions

2.2.3. Post-Training Stage

   •   Follow up to assess the progress by the Trainees

Staff to be involved: The training specialist is central to the delivery of this task. He will lead
the preparation of all the necessary components for the effective delivery of the training. He will
be supported by the team leader, BRAC staff and the 10 state trainers. One NDDRC
Reintegration Staff has joined the ToT session so as to ensure capacity building and
sustainability of services.

Task Output: Ex-combatants trained in fundamental financial skills and the development of
small business including private, joint and cooperatives.



3. Livelihood Start-Up Kits
Timeframe: July 18 – October 29-30-31st

The second major task that UNICON is contracted to deliver is the procurement and delivery of
a start-up kit that will enhance the efforts of ex-combatants to engage in productive and gainful
employment; be it as a private venture or in a joint and cooperative set ups.




                                                                                                        Final Report - Annex B
                                                                                DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   7
    There are six key steps in the task of start-up kit distribution:

           1.      Agreement on Modality
           2.      Formation of Start-Up Kit Content Lists
           3.      Procurement
           4.      Transport & Storage
           5.      Confirmation of Contents of Kits
           6.      Distribution to XCs

    3.1.          Agreement on modality

    The NDDRC leadership has directed UNICON that the start-up kits will correlate to the
    vocational training chosen by the ex-combatant at the Mapel Transitional Facility. In keeping
    with the 8 Vocational Trainings being conducted in Mapel, there will be 8 varieties of start-up
    kits:

           1.      Agriculture
           2.      Carpentry
           3.      Electrical
           4.      Plumbing
           5.      Auto-Mechanic/ Driving
           6.      Animal Husbandry
           7.      Welding
           8.      Masonry

    An ex-combatant may opt to receive no start-up kit but instead receive a voucher for education.
    This choice will be determined in the week of Sept 2-7 during the ICRS caseworkers livelihood
    discussions.

    3.2.          Formation of Start-Up Kit Contents Lists

    Before launching the actual procurement process, it was necessary to consult with stakeholders
    including the Department of Vocational Training in the Ministry of Labor and its field based
    Multipurpose Training Centers (MTCs) in Juba and Wau, and partners including FAO, UNESCO
    and UNDP.

    The Ministry of Labor and the MTCs were approached because of their role and authority to set
    national standards; especially so in policy and curriculum. The Juba MTC provided a list of tools
    for each vocation including for Carpentry, Masonry, Electrical engineering, plumbing, car
    mechanics, and welding. Because the Ministry was not involved in agricultural activities, FAO
    was requested to provide standard kits for Agriculture and animal husbandry.




8   SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
As a second step, the UNESCO trainers in Mapel were requested to prepare what they consider
to be priority tools that need to be included in a kit so as to enable an ex-combatant to promptly
and independently engage in a vocation of his/her choice.

At this point, the lists were cross-checked to confirm that the tools in the Mapel list are reflected
in the standard tools as provided by the MTC and FAO and further discussions were held with
the vocational trainers in Mapel to finalize each of the package contents. The list was then
preliminarily priced and submitted to the NDDRC for a non-objection.

The Consultant team has prepared contents for each of the 8 toolkits mentioned above. These
details are presented below:

     We expect to receive no objection on contents of each of the toolkits by 3 September 2013.
     Upon receiving no-objection from NDDRC and World Bank, we will proceed to next step –
     Procurement process.

     3.3.           Procurement

     After obtaining a no objection described above, UNICON will then call for suppliers to submit
     sealed quotations that will be opened and awarded by an independent committee on 8
     September 2013.

     The following procurement process (and timing) will be followed:

            •       Call for bids from potential suppliers           - 3 Sep 2013
            •       Receive quotations from suppliers                - 8 Sep 2013
            •       Evaluation of received bids                      - 11 Sep 2013
            •       Approval from NDDRC/WB                           - 16 Sep 2013
            •       Notification of award to suppliers               - 17 Sep 2013
            •       Contract award                                   - 20 Sep 2013
            •       Delivery of goods                                - starting from 10 Oct 2013

     We have already identified potential suppliers of goods and this list is presented below. We
     would like to note that we do not want to segregate from the beginning international

    procurement from local, and let the suppliers provide us details on what exactly they can
    provide. Upon receiving their proposals on 8 September 2013, we can see which ones are able
    to provide goods per each of the toolkits. Our proposal is that each of the toolkit shall be
    presented as separate Lot and each supplier can provide quotation for one lot or more. The
    Contracting party would then evaluate all lots separately.

    Potential suppliers that would be called for bidding are:

Separate Request for Quotation will be sent to the above-mentioned organizations for
comparison of prices when Suppliers of Goods will present their proposals.

We are currently in discussions with UNMISS to use their warehousing facilities in States. As it
currently stands, goods can be delivered to UNMISS’s warehouses and kept there until
distribution of kits takes place.

3.5.   Confirmation of Contents of Kits

We will ask the bidders to indicate whether they can supply goods to Juba only or to States
directly. Depending on this, a quality control will be carried out to ensure that goods delivered
correspond to the goods ordered. We anticipate that goods will be delivered to States directly
and in this case, we will check contents of delivered kits on site prior to storage at UNMISS
warehouses. If goods will be delivered first to Juba, then we will do a random check of goods to
ensure that they correspond to the order and then dispatch them to the States via different
logistics company, identified above. This logistics company will have responsibility to deliver
goods as is and second quality check will be done already at State level, again – prior to locking
up at UNMISS facilities.

3.6.   Distribution to XCs

The NDDRC will be responsible for conveying the information regarding the kit distribution days
to the ex-combatants. This must be done through a variety of media, and should include public
distribution methods such as radio.

The kits are expected to be delivered in the State NDDRC Offices by October 28th and
distributed to ex-combatants the 29th, 30th and 31st of October against a signature by the ex-
combatant and cosigning by an NDDRC State officer, an NDDRC HQ officer, and a UNICON
State Coordinator.

Those kits which may not be collected on the appointed dates will be passed on to the NDDRC
State Offices for distribution. The above mentioned signing off arrangements will apply. At this
point the NDDRC will be responsible for further storage and remaining distribution to XCs.
These should continue to require co-signing for confirmation of contents and receipt.

                                          Expected Output:
                                          Start-up tool kits for all ex-combatants except those who opt to further their education. The latter will receive education vouchers to
                                          partially meet their educational fees.
4. Livelihood Opportunities
Field activities: September 23rd – November 13th 2013)

Following the Mapel based entrepreneurship trainings, UNICON will conduct further trainings
through cooperatives, partnerships or individual training – including options for business
development training & small farm business training. Trainers will be out posted in their
respective States of assignment from September 23rd – November 13th 2013.

After allowing the ex-combatants and the trainers sufficient time to return to their places of
residence following the September 15th close of the Mapel Transitional Facility and assignment
respectively, the trainers will start to provide field (State) based support the week beginning the
23rdof September.

4.1.   Objectives of State Level Reintegration Livelihoods Support

       1. To support the ex-combatants to utilize the Vocational, Literacy and Life Skills
          trainings gained at the Mapel Transition Facility toward productive livelihoods in their
          communities of return.
       2. To reinforce and facilitate the ex-combatants’ decision on start-up of their business
          enterprises during the training at Mapel as individual, partnership and/or
          cooperatives.
       3. To assist in cooperative formation and offer subsequent training to ex-combatants
          along with community members who wish to join in formation of cooperatives and
          management of cooperatives in different technical sectors
       4. To assist individuals/partnerships in business activities and trainings by offering
          further training to ex-combatants in business development, start-up and
          management of individual and partnership based enterprises including 1) Individual
          or Partnership micro-enterprise skills training as correlated to the vocational trainings
          received in the Mapel Transition Facility and 2) Individual or Partnership Small Farm
          business skills training.
       5. To assist ex-combatants services in handling the start-up and management process
          such as board formation, marketing and book-keeping initially
       6. To offer advice in initial troubleshooting such as lack of support family members or
          community or selection of location appropriate to the opportunities.
       7. To assess options for formal education and, where acceptable alternative in
          education is presented, the pilot will provide vouchers

4.2.   Training Preparations

A 10 day Training of Trainers in Financial Literacy, Entrepreneurship and Cooperatives has
been concluded on August 30th, 2013. The training has fully equipped the 10 trainers in a
comprehensive development approach, which covers aspects involving motivational and
behavioral qualities in entrepreneurship and cooperatives and key steps critical to the start-up
and management of an enterprise. The training process also ensured that trainers are able to
design curricula for meeting different needs of ex-combatants in the field covering different
need-based capacity building training leading to setting up individual and partnership based




                                                                                                           Final Report - Annex B
                                                                                   DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   23
             enterprises and/or cooperatives in relevant technical sector including farm houses, animal
             husbandry and so on. Most importantly, the trainers have been equipped with a complete
             training kit for each module which can be used for conducting the training at Mapel as well as at
             the state level. They have adequate flexibility to offer the learning in small modules to focus on
             further strengthening skills in business development or formation of cooperative among ex-
             combatants along with their partners or community members.

             Trainers have been prepared to offer training and follow up with ex-combatants for reinforcing
             the progress toward enterprise formation. It is expected that the trainers may have to offer
             training at the state level broadly in the areas of business development, start-up of
             individual/partnership enterprises, formation of cooperatives, and at later stage offer training of
             management of enterprises. With regard to follow up assistance, trainers are prepared to offer a
             wide range of services which will include: selecting a business opportunity including value
             added opportunities, in cooperatives, motivating ex-combatants and community for setting up
             cooperatives and offer services in preparation of business plan, launch of cooperative and
             handling subsequent cooperative management issues including formation of board and book-
             keeping, acquiring necessary inputs, locations of the business, name of cooperatives and other
             legal processes relevant at the stage of enterprise development..

             Similarly, trainers would be able to offer assistance in setting up individual and/partnership
             based enterprises with regard to preparation of business plan, marketing, financial records
             keeping.

             The effective delivery of the training component requires knowledge of Dinka, the popular local
             language, and/or Juba Arabic. Also, the State level training will require knowledge of and
             working experience in the socio-economic and cultural fabric of communities in South Sudan;
             ideally of the Pilot area. UNICON is ultimately responsible for the quality of the services it has
             been contracted to deliver, and has subcontracted the actual delivery to a locally established
             NGO to closely oversee the implementation process. This arrangement and the experience of
             the sub-contracted NGO will benefit the training, possibly the efficient procurement and
             distribution of the start-up kits, and the planned follow-up trainings.

             4.3.          Training Content

             The following framework of activities is the base of the state-based training curriculum. The
             exact curriculum for the state-based trainings on cooperatives and individual small-business
             training, including agriculture and agri-business will be finalized by September 12th 2013.

4.4.   Cooperatives - Initiating livelihood opportunities through associations/
       cooperatives

The suggested economic association/cooperative module is intended to create economic
opportunities for ex-combatants and support their reintegration into the communities where they
will return. Cooperatives receiving support through this program must have a minimum of 3 ex-
combatants. These associations would also include an average of 30% community members
and as such enhance both the social capital of ex-combatants generally and specifically the
economic potential of the ex-combatants because the community members joining associations
will already have both experience and knowledge in the economic activity of that association.

Our team will assist those who would like to form cooperatives, providing the following support:
   • Advise on legal background of cooperative formation
   • Assist in developing corporate governance, at basic level, for these cooperatives
   • Assist in Board formation and start-up activities
   • Organizational advisory such as: opening bank account, marketing skills, etc.
   • Assist in creation of business plans
   • Provide on-going trainings in running cooperatives, business development, strategies,
       and other relevant skills required for proper cooperatives functioning

                                                                                 DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   25
             The curriculum discussed above will be developed to provide additional detail to this content.

             At this stage, it is unknown how many participating ex-combatants would like to form
             cooperatives. After the ICRS caseworkers conduct the livelihoods discussions and the UNICON
             trainers hold discussions with participating ex-combatants at the Mapel Transition Facility during
             the trainings, it will be clear what number of participating ex-combatants is interested to form
             cooperatives.

             Stages in Setting up Cooperatives

             Below we list actions that are required to be undertaken for successful formation of
             cooperatives. UNICON team of trainers will assist ex-combatants who choose the option of
             cooperative formation throughout this process.

             Curriculum for training with modules will submitted to the World Bank for review and non-
             objection to be finalized by Sept 12th. The exact timing of implementation will be completed once
             those interested to form cooperatives are identified and locations of reintegration confirmed. At
             this point the schedule will be worked out by the state coordinators and trainers.

             4.4.1. Village meetings and Formation of Cooperatives:

             Following the Mapel training, UNICON is responsible for supporting the initiation of various
             livelihoods activities that create economic opportunities for interested ex-combatants and
             support their reintegration into their respective communities. This will be enhanced further by
             allowing associations and cooperatives to include about 30% of community members.
             Following the identification of the economic activity and identification of community members,
             training will be given on how an association should be formed, governed and managed.

             The timing, frequency and venue for these activities will be determined after the village
             meetings and consultations with community leaders and elders.

             4.4.2. Training on Cooperative formation:

             The timing will be determined based on needs identified at the village meetings.

             The Cooperatives Formation and Operation curriculum will address:

                    •      What is a Cooperative
                    •      Types of Cooperatives
                    •      Why set up a Cooperative
                    •      Areas of Cooperative activities (value chains, etc)
                    •      What legal structure should be adopted
                    •      Cooperative governance
                    •      How to run a Cooperative (capital inputs management, basic accounting and business
                           management, Human Resources, profit sharing, social safety nets, saving mechanisms,
                           saving reinvestment plans, etc.)




26   SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
4.5.   Individual Business Trainings

We also expect that some of the participating ex-combatants would prefer to work as individuals
or in partnerships of 2-3 people. As with case of cooperatives, we will provide assistance
through trainings in fields of business planning, bank accounts operations, bookkeeping and
accounting, marketing skills necessary for their businesses, and other relevant skills.

   •   What is a business
   •   Basics of financial reporting and management
   •   Accounting principles, cash management
   •   Searching business opportunities

   •   Establishing business relations
   •   Background on laws and regulations, how to arbitrate disputes
   •   Sharing business roles and administrations
   •   Managing capital inputs and other business capital

The above topics will be offered to all individuals. These classes will be conducted for non-
agriculture small business and agriculture/ small farming. The following outlines areas specific
to each and demonstrates the need for the 2 types of individual training for the various
audiences.

4.5.1. Business development training (non-agricultural)

   •   Business opportunities found in the state and beyond
   •   How to search advice on local opportunities
   •   Ideas generation
   •   Business language

       finances, debt management, proper bookkeeping, etc.
   •   Public and customer relations
   •   Laws and regulations
   •   Sharing business roles and administrations

                                                                                                          Final Report - Annex B
                                                                                  DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   27
             4.6.          Implementation and Method of Delivery – State-based Livelihoods Support
                           Trainings

             In the states there will be 4 state training coordinators and 8 trainers. These trainers will be
             allocated based on intensity of returnees to a particular state. Through the training of trainers
             process, 10 South Sudanese trainers are now prepared to travel to communities and support
             cooperative formation and initialization, they are further trained as outlined above on financial
             literacy and individual and partnership business skills. Two of the trainers will transition and
             they will become state training coordinator, although they will still be required to conduct
             trainings.

             The exact distribution of the trainers will be determined by the state training coordinators
             together with the Project Manager and Training Specialist once final data is collected on the
             location of reintegration. However, data collected as of August 30 indicates that of the 280 for
             whom data was collected, 87 plan to return to Lakes, 84 to Western Bahr el Ghazal, 78 to
             Warrap and 32 to Northern Bahr el Ghazal.

             The most recent data was further analyzed to determine what number of cooperatives that
             could potentially form by location. Overall, it would be possible for up to 42 cooperatives to
             form, although it is likely to be less given that is assuming all groups of 3+ with related interests
             from 1 payam would choose to form a cooperative. For design purposes we will work from the
             premise that there will be 40 cooperatives distributed among 28 payams. If there are less
             cooperatives materializing, then UNICON will adjust accordingly.

Training roll-out plan: After the 1st week of the Mapel Entrepreneurship, Cooperatives and
Financial Literacy training UNICON state training coordinators, together with the project
manager and training specialist will develop a full roll out schedule for visitation and trainings.
This must be completed between Sept 8-10 before the ex-combatants complete the Mapel
training so they are informed of when they would expect attention. Additionally, this schedule
must be signed off on by the NDDRC.

For cooperatives, the trainers will travel to the communities of return in the case that 3+ XCs
choose to form a cooperative. This will serve approximately 141 of the 290 XCs in the pilot
reintegration project. Each cooperative will be visited at least once from Sept 23 rd - Nov 21st.
This visit will take no less than 4 days per community, with 2 additional days allocated for
training and travel to unique payams. As time allows, while in a particular payam the trainers will
also discuss business techniques with any individual XCs in that location.

For individuals, the trainers will not travel to every community. Trainings will match to the
above outline of training content for both Business development training (non-agricultural) and
small farming business training (agricultural). The centralized individual training will be held 2
times per month in each state in centralized locations and will consist of 2-3 day trainings
(Tentative dates: Sept 30-Oct 1, Oct 17-18, Oct 31-Nov 1, Nov 14-15.) For more efficiency, we
will cooperate with local PMU offices to target dates of our trainings at the planned time when
ex-combatants come to the state offices for salary at the end of month. Transport will not be
provided to ex-combatants as these trainings are voluntary services at their disposal.

The training of trainers did not cover the depth of the agriculture specific business training
required, thus UNICON will explore working with the Ministry of Agriculture and state-based
agricultural extension entities to work alongside the state-based trainers to provide such
trainings.

                                      INTRODUCTION

UNICON has been contracted to conduct Livelihood Support activities (component three) of the
South Sudan National Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Commission (NDDRC)
Pilot Reintegration Project. The Livelihood Support activities, for this Pilot project, are targeting
a group of 290 ex-combatants in the states of Lakes, Warrap, Western Bahr el Ghazal and
Northern Bahr el Ghazal.

The Pilot Reintegration Project livelihood component has been divided into 2 phases in order to
facilitate gradual return of the ex-combatants into the community as well as to ensure their final
and irreversible reintegration at the end of the activities.

Phase I is designed to provide the ex-combatants with the initial training as well as the start-up
toolkit and includes the following sub-components:

     •   Livelihood fundamentals;

     •   Livelihood capital input/start-up toolkit;

     •   Livelihood opportunities project initiation:

           o   Through cooperatives/associations;

           o   Through partnerships/individual training;

     •   Monitoring and evaluation;

     •   Reporting.

Phase II will build on the achievements of Phase I to further train the ex-combatants in the
chosen area of interest. In addition, supplementary training will be provided in cooperative
business operation and financial management. Following are the sub-components of Phase II:

     •   Follow-up Entrepreneurship, Financial Literacy & Association and Cooperatives
         Training;

     •   Training and mentoring of NDDRC outreach staff in entrepreneurship, financial literacy
         and association/cooperatives;

     •   Coordination of Agricultural Extension in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture
         extension workers;




                                                                                                          Final Report - Annex C
                                                                                  DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   3
              •      Training of Ministry of Agriculture extension workers in best practices and appropriate
                     farming techniques for the ex-combatants of Greater Bahr el Ghazal choosing
                     agriculture;

              •      Facilitation of Targeted Vocational Trainings being provided to XCs via vocational
                     training centers;

              •      Implementation of an Apprenticeship/Secondment program for interested XCs in
                     vocational skills not covered through the targeted vocational trainings or agriculture;

              •        Monitoring and evaluation;

              •      Reporting.

    The above sub-components will be performed in accordance with the Work Plan (Appendix 1) in
    close cooperation with TDRP, NDDRC HQ PMU, Ministry of Agriculture and NDDRC state
    offices. While participation of the ex-combatants in the training is voluntary, it is anticipated that
    the major part of the pilot group of 290 ex-combatants will express interest in receiving
    additional business, vocational and/or agricultural training.

    UNICON team for Phase II of the Project will consist of the following specialists 1:

4         SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
                                PHASE I OVERVIEW

Implementation of Phase I of the Pilot Reintegration Project took place August-November 2013
and is widely considered to be successful as all the major goals have been achieved and
numerous lessons learned have been noted for making further improvements of the program in
the future. Among other things, the program has received significant publicity with the
population of the country, which is a significant part of the reintegration process.

Given that fact that that Project is a pilot, it was expected that all side would benefit from
learning during the implementation. NDDRC as an organization showed great potential for
improvement and willingness to develop its potential through accumulating project-related
experience and knowledge both in the headquarters in Juba and in the state offices.

Pre-training of ex-combatants

Initial training of the 290 ex-combatants was performed in Mapel DDR Training Facility – a
specialized training camp built by UNMISS and the local government, which is located in the
state of Western Bahr El-Ghazal.

Every one of 290 ex-combatants was trained by UNESCO-hired and trained local specialists in
one of the pre-set 8 areas of their choice. Those areas are agriculture, auto-mechanics,
plumbing, electrical services, masonry, welding and animal husbandry. Based on the type of
vocational training received by an ex-combatant, a corresponding start-up toolkit was put in the
procurement plan to be delivered to the ex-combatant’s state of return for collection.

Training of trainers

UNICON hired and trained 8 state trainers and 4 state managers to run the
business/cooperative training sessions for the ex-combatants in their communities of returns. An
international training expert developed the TOT (training of trainers) curriculum as well as the
field training manual and training materials to be used by the trainers during the
business/cooperative training for the ex-combatants.

The training of trainers took place in Mapel training facility in August 2013 during the time when
the ex-combatants were receiving their initial vocational training, which allowed the trainers to
get introduced to many of their future students and receive basic information on them, including
approximate location, possible grouping preferences etc.

The field training method involves a comprehensive development approach, which covers
aspects involving motivational and behavioral qualities in entrepreneurship and cooperatives
and also key steps critical to the start-up and management of an enterprise. The training
ensures that participants take key decisions during training pertaining to the areas such as
selecting a business idea, identify key resources required to be in business, locations of the
business and other partners.




                                                                                                       Final Report - Annex C
                                                                               DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   5
    Field training

    Field training was performed by UNICON trainers and state managers in close cooperation with
    NDDRC state officers and ICRS caseworkers. In some cases, NDDRC state offices were used
    as training venues, provided by the Commission as a courtesy.

    The training manual included 15 modules that were used as needed based on the needs
    evaluation done by the training team. The modules are:

          •       Module 1: Introduction and Micro lab: Expectation and Commitment

          •       Module 2: Financial Literacy

          •       Module 3: Business and Market

          •       Module 4: Key activities of a Business, Cooperatives Financial aspects of Business

          •       Module 5: Selecting a Business and Cooperatives Format

          •       Module 6: Steps in Starting a Business

          •       Module 7: Business Skills Development in Cooperatives

          •       Module 8: Behavioral Skills in entrepreneurship and Cooperatives

          •       Module 9: Team Building and Management of Cooperatives

          •       Module 10: Business Plan for setting up Cooperatives

          •       Module 11: Enterprise Management: Sales and Marketing

          •       Module 12: Enterprise Management: Purchasing

          •       Module 13: Enterprise Management: Work Place Management

          •       Module 14: Enterprise Management: Book-keeping

          •       Module 15: Concluding and action Plan for setting up Cooperatives

    The field training, in order to increase its effectiveness, used several well-known learning
    methods that proved to be successful in the region, such as (i) simulations and role play, (ii)
    learning by doing, (iii) visuals and illustration, (iv) hands-on experience via interaction with
    existing businessmen, (v) individual counseling and (vi) practice sessions.




6     SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
In addition to the ex-combatants, the above training also targeted the interested community
members, thus creating publicity and additionally developing the country’s potential in small
business and private entrepreneurship areas. A total of 284 community members received the
training in addition to 253 ex-combatants.

Start-up toolkits

The toolkit composition for all the 8 areas was agreed upon by both UNICON, TDRP and
NDDRC. In addition to that, advice was obtained from MTC (Multiservice Training Center) Juba
headquarters to make sure that the tools included in the kits are the best fit for the local
conditions.

NZOU Group – a South Sudanese company – procured the toolkits from Kenya and Uganda to
the distribution warehouse in Juba. The toolkits were then divided into separate shipments for
the 4 states and dispatched, using services of Trojan Enterprises – a local transportation
company.

Despite uncertainty of the road conditions, NDDRC, TDRP and UNICON were able to
coordinate effectively and ensure that most ex-combatants at each state were able to collect
their toolkits immediately upon the arrival of the truck. The distribution process was monitored
by representatives of NDDRC HQ, TDRP and UNICON in all states, making sure that the
process goes smoothly and in accordance with the plan that was previously drafted based on
collective vision.

239 out of 290 ex-combatants were able to receive their toolkits during the distribution event,
while the rest were informed that they could collect their toolkits at any time in the NDDRC state
office.

    Phase II is going to become the final stage of the NDDRC Pilot Reintegration Project in South
    Sudan. Until 31 July 2014, every one of the pilot group of 290 ex-combatants will have a chance
    to receive additional training both in business/cooperative operation and in their area of initial
    vocational training conducted in August 2013 in Mapel Training Facility.

    In accordance with the Phase II TOR, interested ex-combatants will receive up to 2 follow-up
    visits by the business/cooperative training teams that will consist of a state manager and ICRS
    caseworkers that will be, after a proper TOT by an international specialist, acting as
    business/cooperative trainers.

    Given that the largest group (129 people) of ex-combatants chose agriculture as their main field,
    a decision has been made that they will have a chance to receive additional agricultural training.
    For that purpose an international agricultural expert and a local agricultural expert have been
    contracted to conduct a Training of Trainers for 11 Ministry of Agriculture extension workers that
    will perform the training sessions for the 129 ex-combatants.

    In addition to the 11 Ministry of Agriculture extension workers, 7 ICRS caseworkers will
    participate partially in the agricultural TOT for capacity building purpose. They will then provide
    the extension workers with all available information of ex-combatant location and contacts so
    that they can be easily found to conduct the training. It is also planned that at least 1 ICRS
    caseworker will accompany the extension workers during the field training.

    Until the end of the Project, the non-agricultural ex-combatants will, via NDDRC local offices,
    have an opportunity to receive additional training in their field either in a training facility or as an
    apprenticeship/secondment with an existing business that operates in a similar area. The
    Commission will make effort to locate government-financed institutes that will provide such
    training free of charge.

    As a result of the Phase II activities, the ex-combatants will have gained additional confidence
    and a clearer vision of their future as full valued community members. They will have acquired
    necessary skills in how to (i) choose a business to start, (ii) operate the chosen business and
    (iii) make sure not to lose their business. In addition, this DDR program will give the ex-
    combatants the opportunity for a faster reintegration as it encourages the community member
    participation both in the field trainings and in the business cooperatives being registered by the
    ex-combatants.

       COOPERATIVE/BUSINESS TRAINING OF TRAINERS

This part of the Phase II of this Pilot Project is building on the same topic training delivered by
the UNICON-trainers in Phase I. Knowledge of business essentials is basic and at the same
time vital component of the ex-combatants’ reintegration process. Due to the time limits of the
Phase I training of trainers and the field trainings as well as learn-as-we-go approach to the field
trainings, some of the training topics were not fully covered by the UNICON trainers and Phase
II provides for up to 2 additional visits of the cooperative/business training teams to each ex-
combatants who makes the choice to receive this additional training.

While the training itself will be built on the Phase I curriculum, the training teams structure will
be adjusted to further build the NDDRC capacity that will help during the implementation of
further DDR activities in the country.

Instead of UNICON-hired trainers, the field cooperative/business trainings will now be
performed by the ICRS caseworkers, who are NDDRC employees and whose work duties,
among others, include personally knowing all the ex-combatants in their respective state,
assisting them in their reintegration into peaceful life community and advising on various
problems that the ex-combatants might run into on their way to successful full return to the
community.

NDDRC will provide 7 ICRS caseworkers from the participating states NDDRC state offices,
who will be trained to train the ex-combatants on modern principles of cooperative/business
practices. They will arrive to Juba from their states in order to receive the 10-day Training of
Trainers that will be provided by the international expert (Mr. Gautam Raj Jain).

In order to keep the training link with Phase I, the four state managers will be hired from among
the teams of 12 people in charge of state field cooperative/business training. The state
managers will be in charge of ensuring the high quality of the trainings, provide additional depth
to the training process as well as to take over the report writing and financial planning. The four
candidates will be proposed by UNICON based on their performance in Phase I and then
approved by the World Bank and NDDRC. NDDRC will collect opinions from their state offices
in regard to the level of the respective candidate’s level of ability to coordinate the trainings as
well as cooperate with both the ex-combatants’ and the NDDRC state offices.

In keeping with the principle of maximizing capacity building provided to the NDDRC, the
Commission will also invite 8 ICRS workers that are based in Juba to participate in the
cooperative/business training. In addition, 1 ICRS caseworker from Eastern Equatoria state and
1 ICRS caseworker from Western Equatoria will be attending the TOT for the purpose of
capacity building for the future DDR activities in South Sudan. Upon completion of the Training
of Trainers, these 10 ICRS caseworkers will join the field training teams in order to arrange for 4
ICRS caseworkers in every state providing follow-up trainings to the ex-combatants.




                                                                                                       Final Report - Annex C
                                                                               DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   9
     Additionally, following experts will be invited to participate in the Training of Trainers as guest
     speakers in order to further improve the training capacity of the participants:

            •       Business registration/legal specialist;

            •       Banking/microfinance specialist;

            •       Successful entrepreneurs.

     Attendance of the TOT will be monitored by having every participant sign the attendance sheet,
     which will then be signed by a representative of NDDRC and UNICON (draft attached as
     Appendix 7).

     By the end of the Training of Trainers, the teams will be expected to develop a workplan for the
     field trainings, which will explain the logistics of the team movements within the state to ensure
     that every ex-combatant receives the necessary number of visits.

     At the time of submission of the present Project Implementation Plan, the cooperative/business
     TOT curriculum has been drafted and is prepared to be used for the training program in Juba. It
     has also been circulated with the Bank for comments. However, it is anticipated that the
     curriculum will undergo significant changes and additions during the actual training process. The
     curriculum, with changes, will be submitted shortly after completion of the TOT on 26 May 2014.


                               FIELD COOPERATIVE/BUSINESS TRAINING

     Upon successful completion of the Training of Trainers in Juba, on the date agreed upon by
     NDDRC, World Bank and UNICON, the field training teams will depart to their respective states
     in order to start the follow-up visits to the ex-combatants. The state teams will consist of the
     following:

            •       Northern Bahr El-Ghazal             1 state manager and 3 ICRS caseworkers

            •       Western Bahr El-Ghazal              1 state manager and 4 ICRS caseworkers

            •       Warrap                              1 state manager and 4 ICRS caseworkers

            •       Lakes                               1 state manager and 4 ICRS caseworkers

     According to the schedule/workplan agreed upon during the Training of Trainers and using the
     skills acquired during the Training of Trainers, the state managers and ICRS caseworkers will
     provide each one of the 290 ex-combatants, who will show interest in receiving additional
     training, with up to 2 follow-up visit in their location of reintegration to the community.




10      SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
The objective of having the ex-combatants receive the extra training is to further strengthen their
ability to use their own skills in making their living with gradual transformation from a
government-dependent soldier into an independent, self-sufficient while completely integrated
member of community.

The main approach of the training will be to stimulate independent thinking within the ex-
combatants so that they can both identify the problem they might be facing at some point and,
most importantly, come up with a possible solution(s) to this problem.

It is also very important that the ex-combatants become aware of the sources of information
available to them as citizens and businesspersons. The government of South Sudan has been
allocating substantial funds to support small business in the country and one of the goals of this
training will be to make sure that the participants of these trainings know that they can receive
support not only through NDDRC, but also, just like any other citizen, through various
government agencies.

UNICON will work with law practitioners in Juba to obtain advice on what are the most useful
sources of information that the ex-combatants can use to obtain support from the government.
In addition, state NDDRC offices will stay in contact with state-level government business
support authorities that can provide valuable services on the ground.

At the time of submission of the present Project Implementation Plan, the field training manual
has been drafted. However, it is anticipated that the manual will undergo significant changes
and additions as a result of the Training of Trainers, because the Consultant expects to collect
valuable opinions from the participants of the TOT. The training manual, with changes
incorporated, will be submitted shortly after completion of the TOT on 26 May 2014.




                                                                                                      Final Report - Annex C
                                                                              DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   11
                                  AGRICULTURAL TRAINING OF TRAINERS

     129 ex-combatants out of 290 chose agriculture as their main direction of development. In the
     opinion of many people involved in organizing and implementing the Phase I of the Project,
     there is a great chance that this number is representative of the share of agriculture-oriented ex-
     combatants in the possible future phases of the Project. Keeping this in mind, a decision has
     been made to engage the Ministry of Agriculture of South Sudan in training the ex-combatants
     in this Phase II of the Pilot Project.

     Unlike the other types of training, the additional agricultural training will have a preliminary
     capacity building arranged for within this Pilot Project. This will involve training the employees of
     the Ministry of Agriculture from each participating state of South Sudan who will then provide
     training to the ex-combatants who express interest in receiving such training.

     Agricultural Training of Trainers (TOT) will be held in Juba, South Sudan in the NDDRC
     headquarters. The venue will be kindly provided by the NDDRC and will fit all the participants.
     TOT will start on 27 May and finish on 3 June, after which the Ministry of Agriculture extension
     workers will become qualified to train agricultural practices to the ex-combatants and will leave
     Juba to start the field trainings.

     The TOT will be attended by 11 Ministry of Agriculture extension workers, who are government
     employees with existing knowledge in the field of agriculture, which will be further developed as
     a result of the TOT. The extension workers will arrive to Juba on 26 May to be able to start
     attending the TOT on 27 May:

            •       Northern Bahr El-Ghazal – 2 people;

            •       Western Bahr El-Ghazal – 3 people;

            •       Warrap – 3 people;

            •       Lakes – 3 people;

     This training will be delivered by 1 international agricultural expert (Mrs. Beth Oliver) and 1
     national agricultural expert (Mr. Angelous Odego). The national expert has the necessary
     project experience and has the ability to provide quality assistance to the international specialist
     as in August 2013 he was hired by UNESCO to be one of the agricultural trainers during the
     training session provided for the ex-combatants in the Mapel Training Facility.

     The TOT will also be attended by 7 ICRS caseworkers, who are also government (NDDRC)
     employees and will benefit from the agricultural training as additional capacity building, given
     that most of the ex-combatants they mentor have chosen agriculture as their field of return to
     peaceful life. By the time the TOT start, ICRS caseworkers will have already finished the
     business/cooperative training and will be in Juba and available to start 27 May.




12      SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
Due to possible repetition of training topics and general length of activities, the Consultant and
the Client are discussing the possibility of having the 7 ICRS caseworkers attend the agricultural
TOT partially – specifically the parts that will be new to them and they would be able to use in
their future work.

Attendance of the TOT will be monitored by having every participant sign the attendance sheet,
which will then be signed by a representative of NDDRC and UNICON (draft attached as
Appendix 7).

At the time of submission of the present Project Implementation Plan, the agricultural TOT
curriculum has been drafted and is prepared to be used for the training program in Juba.
However, it is anticipated that the curriculum will undergo significant changes and additions
during the actual training process. The curriculum, with changes, will be submitted shortly after
completion of the TOT on 3 June 2014. The draft will be circulated for comments before the
TOT starts.


                      FIELD AGRICULTURAL TRAINING

All the ex-combatants are entitles to receive additional training in the profession each one of
them chose for their further peaceful living. For the additional training in 7 out of 8 professions,
NDDRC, using the project budget, will hire local training providers to perform the training in the
event that the ex-combatants show interest.

The field training in agriculture will be provided by the Ministry of Agriculture extension workers,
who will have been trained specifically for this within the current Pilot Project. Trainings will be
delivered in accordance with the schedule and the training modules designed by the
international agricultural expert and finalized during the Training of Trainers in Juba NDDRC
HQ.

Considering the fact that the supplementary agricultural training is being provided as part of the
pilot project, it is envisioned that during the training of trainers and the field trainings a
substantial number of lessons learned will be collected that will help the consultant establish the
level of need or such training in the possible future phases of the Project.

The consultant is planning to collect the information during the training of trainers that will help
determine the best way of delivering knowledge to the ex-combatants, considering the following
possible challenges:

     •   remote locations;

     •   literacy/numeracy level;

     •   lack of funding/starting capital;




                                                                                                         Final Report - Annex C
                                                                                 DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   13
            •       deficit of seeds;

            •       means of transportation, etc.

     Given consultant’s experience, one of the best means of knowledge delivery in similar
     conditions is learning by doing/seeing. In order to provide the ex-combatants with this
     experience, the consultants, in the Final Report to this project, is planning to propose NDDRC to
     find a partner farm in each participating state that can host the ex-combatants from time to time
     for training in modern way of working in the agricultural sector.

     The field training will be delivered by at least 1 Ministry of Agriculture extension worker
     accompanied by at least 1 ICRS caseworker in accordance with the field training plan that will
     be developed during the TOT.

     While delivering the agricultural knowledge to the ex-combatants, the Ministry of Agriculture
     extension workers as well as ICRS caseworkers will collect necessary information that will
     support further introduction of demonstration farms in each state.

     It is envisioned that the partner farm (demo farm) will be divided into several sections cultivating
     different crops. Each state will have its own set of crops that will depend of its geographical
     locations, climate, proximity to water, flood pattern etc.

     During the training of trainers the best way of the initial field training will be established, be it (i)
     the ex-combatants travelling to the demo farm from the locations or (ii) the Ministry of
     Agriculture extension workers travelling first to the ex-combatants’ locations for the initial
     training and then inviting them to the demo farm if/when it is ready.

     The chosen demo farm will be located in a way to be easily reached by all the ex-combatants
     located in the corresponding state. The location of the demo farm should also have the
     necessary minimum living conditions for the arriving ex-combatants, who will be receiving
     training in groups of 15 people at most.

     Like in the training of trainers, the field trainings for the ex-combatants will use modern
     teaching/knowledge delivery techniques, participatory learning being the most important of
     them. Participatory learning is a creative, problem solving method in which every participant
     participates actively. The learning process is just as important as the subject being learned. The
     advantages of participatory method are:

            •       Addresses the needs and problems of the participants;

            •       Uses participants’ knowledge, experience and skills;

            •       Considers every participant a trainer and trainee;




14      SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
     •   Uses practical real life activities so participants can learn by doing;

     •   Takes place in a location and in a setting where participants feel at ease.

Additionally, communication would be improved by role playing, visual illustrations, experiential
learning, working in groups, working in the field, demonstrations and counseling.

The field training manual will be finalized during the TOT and will be circulated for a no-objection
with NDDRC and the World Bank.


                              VOCATIONAL TRAINING

In addition to the agricultural training that the Projects provides targeted capacity building for,
the ex-combatants, who chose professions other than agriculture, are entitled to receive
supplementary vocational training that matches their profession of choice and the type of toolkit
received during Phase I of this Pilot Project.

The vocational training will be provided by NDDRC-designated training facilities that exist in the
country and have experience training people in the respective field. The additional vocational
training is expected to be free for the both the NDDRC and the ex-combatants as it should be
provided by government institutions. The indicative process for this sub-component is as
follows:

    1. XC approached by the state NDDRC representative to determine if he/she would like to
       receive vocational training or apprenticeship;

    2. In case the XC refuses to receive training, he/she signs the refusal form (draft attached
       as Appendix 9);

    3. In case the XC is interested in receiving the training, NDDRC determines the type of
       training needed and finds the appropriate training facility that can provide the necessary
       type of training. It is assumed that the training facility will provide the training free of
       charge, while there is a limited budget for the ex-combatants’ accommodation during
       such training;

    4. The details of training (location, length etc.) are determined and section 1 of the training
       form (Appendix 8) is filled out and signed by the XC, training provider and NDDRC.

    5. “Remote location” checkbox is checked in case the XC needs travel and housing
       allowance (exact policy/amounts to be developed by NDDRC);

    6. The training starts.




                                                                                                           Final Report - Annex C
                                                                                   DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   15
     It is important the Commission is made aware of the size of the limited accommodation budget
     and plan accordingly when arranging the vocational training for the interested ex-combatants.

     As the information collection is time consuming and the ICRS caseworkers will be busy during
     the Training of Trainers, the implementation of this sub-component might not start until the end
     of both TOTs, after which 1 ICRS caseworker in each state will be appointed as responsible for
     start/completion of vocational training/apprenticeship.

     As a result of targeted vocational training, the ex-combatants will receive additional practical
     knowledge in their profession of choice, which will allow them to more effectively use the
     theoretical knowledge already received as well as the start-up toolkit collected during Phase I.

     Among the non-agricultural ex-combatants, there are pre-determined groups that will attend (i)
     driving courses, (ii) auto-mechanic course and (iii) Don Bosco institute courses. All of the above
     are official government courses with official certificates issued upon completion of the training.
     As these institutions are professional organizations and have universal policies and fees for
     anyone, necessary budget has been allocated to finance these trainings in accordance with the
     pricelists of the institutions.


                                                  EXPERT VISITS

     In some cases, it may be difficult to find a vocational training facility to train the ex-combatants
     (e.g. animal husbandry, electrician business etc.). In order to provide the ex-combatants with
     experience in their chosen field, NDDRC will attempt to locate a local professional in the field
     matching that of the ex-combatant, who will agree to provide the ex-combatant with necessary
     training.

     The local expert will visit the ex-combatants who chose his area of training and train the ex-
     combatants for a pre-determined amount of time. In cases, that the ex-combatant does not have
     the workplace equipped that will allow the expert to train him/her effectively, NDDRC will
     consider arranging for the ex-combatant to travel to the expert’s location in order to receive the
     training.

     Like in case of vocational training, the process will be monitored by NDDRC, the World Bank
     and UNICON by means of having the host, the ex-combatant and NDDRC representative sign
     the training form (Appendix 8).

     Expert visits are subject to availability and affordability. There is limited budget for the ex-
     combatant accommodation to be provided on “as-needed” basis and which NDDRC should use
     with proper planning in order to avoid taking on the expenses that the Project cannot cover.

     Expert visits will be very useful for the ex-combatants not only because they will collect valuable
     experience and knowledge, but also because they may create an opportunity for the ex-
     combatant to eventually join forces with the hosting master and create a cooperative using the




16      SECTION I: UNICON - Livelihoods Support
expert’s existing knowledge and capital supported by the ex-combatant’s will to reintegrate and
his/her start-up toolkit.


                          ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS

As requested by NDDRC, funds will be allocated by this Project to cover the land registration
fee for 26 plots of land that the ex-combatants are going to receive from the Government of
South Sudan. The land plots will be provided to the ex-combatants free of charge, but the
current regulation does not provide for waiving the registration fee, which is grounds for this
additional provision.




                                                                                                   Final Report - Annex C
                                                                           DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   17
                                                        LESSONS LEARNED

      Keeping in mind the pilot nature of the Project, lessons learned are an essential deliverable. All
      parties involved will be responsible for providing their personal opinion on lessons learned
      during the project implementation and possible ways to overcome the existing problems. The
      lessons learned will be compiled by the Project Manager and presented to the client upon

                           which have been neglected as services do not reach them – Payam Administrator, Lakes State

                          We thank NDDRC, World Bank and IOM for making it possible to drink safe and clean water, which
                           we have been looking for. We welcome ex-combatants that have been disarmed and demobilized in
                           Mapel. We hope ex-combatants will be able to live in peace with their friends, relatives and family
                           members within the community. – A leader of a beneficiary community, Warrap State

              C.                General principles

              The following principles apply for the entire support provided by ASI and Integrity:

                      a) The pilot project is designed and will be implemented as a learning process.

                      b) The ASI/Integrity team will work closely with the PMU, with the perspective to
                         improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the NDDRC as a whole.

                      c) The systems that will be developed with the NDDRC would need to be sound, but
                         also realistic given the circumstances.

                      d) The assistance will be based on a complementarity of training, mentoring and
                         systems development.

                      e) The assistance will focus on the NDDRC capacity at HQ level as well as in the four
                         states of greater Bahr el Ghazal.

                      f) The assistance will focus on the pilot phase, and work primarily through the PMU.
                         But all activities will be undertaken from the perspective of strengthening the
                         national capacity to implement the larger DDR operation that is foreseen.

                      g) ASI/Integrity are taking a purposeful approach to monitoring for this assignment,
                         focusing on building a responsive M&E system that provides real-time feedback into
                         the PMU and management team to develop evidence-based implementation and
                         draw lessons for the future.


              D.                Project Implementation Manual (PIM) – 10 June - 3 September

              The Project Implementation Manual (PIM) will be developed by the HQ PMU of the
              NDDRC. Basic components for the PIM have already been developed with assistance of
              World Bank consultants. The ASI/Integrity team will ‘shepherd’ the process through the
              provision of technical advice and feedback. The HQ PMU will continuously update the
              PIM as the project rolls out. The SPMUs and the ASI/Integrity team will throughout the
              project provide their inputs into the process of updating and adapting the PIM, building on
              the lessons learned.




4   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
The PIM will among others:
   • Outline the institutional setup of the project;
   • Define the main principles and approaches of reintegration support during the pilot
      phase;
   • Define the main principles and approaches of M&E;
   • Define the principles and systems of project management;
   • Define the role of the HQ PMU within the wider NDDRC;
   • Define distinct (complementary) roles of HQ PMU and the 4 SPMUs;
   • Identify relevant external organizations that the NDDRC will work with;
   • Define a division of responsibility between SPMU and the firms delivering
      components 3 and 4 of the project, which will have their own project management
      activities; and
   • Determine specific procedures, such as for: eligibility, data capture and
      management; metrics for data analysis; and reporting requirements.

The PIM will be the foundation for the development of the SPMUs, providing key
information on procedures to be followed and guidelines on staff activities.

Staff involved:
   • ASI/Integrity: all team members will be involved, coordinated by the Team Leader.
   • NDDRC: all members of the PMUs will be involved over the entire project period,
        coordinated by the chairperson of the PMU.

Product: The – by then – draft version of the PIM will be attached to the Final Report, to
be presented to the NDDRC and the World Bank on November 15, 2013.


E.       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) – 24 June - 19 July

The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) component of the project includes the design of an
M&E system and the formation of an M&E Unit. The M&E system will as much as
possible be based on existing systems of the NDDRC and build effective and efficient
linkages with the Commission’s Information, Counseling and Referral System (ICRS).
Similarly, the M&E Unit will establish clear working arrangements with those that will be
working on the ICRS.

Monitoring and data collection is crucial for the successful delivery of the pilot project,
aiming to draw lessons to inform forthcoming phases of the DDR programme.
ASI/Integrity are taking a purposeful approach to monitoring for this assignment, focusing
on building a responsive M&E system that provides real-time feedback to the PMU and
management team to develop evidence-based implementation and draw lessons for the
future.

By the end of the pilot the team will have begun to build the capacity at the HQ and State
level in order for the Commission to be able to continue the M&E efforts with reduced
mentoring in future phases of the programme. At the State level M&E officers will be
trained to continue data collection efforts, and relevant NDDRC staff will have been trained
how to produce basic M&E reports.




                                                                                                        Final Report - Annex A
                                                                               DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    5
              The M&E Expert will work closely with the implementation and M&E teams of the
              livelihood and community support components (components 3 & 4) of the pilot project in
              order to ensure cross-programmatic coordination and minimize data collection duplication.
              The M&E approach is designed to be both purposeful and responsive, and tailored to
              support the overarching capacity building goals of the pilot. Right from the initial steps of
              the pilot, the M&E component will be integral to successfully directing the programme and
              to achieving the pilot’s learning objective.

              The M&E system will be designed to:
                 1. Provide a continual assessment of progress;
                 2. Create a data flow and real time feedback loop to inform and adjust operations; and
                 3. Document all lessons learned recommending modifications or improvements to
                    individual parts or all of the components.

              The M&E Expert, in close consultation with the NDDRC and the World Bank M&E
              consultant, will design the M&E system and in particular programme indicators. The
              number of indicators is meant to remain manageable and realistic bearing in mind the scope
              and timeframe for the project and associated data collection. The indicators will feed into
              the log-frame design and the M&E Expert along with the senior management and World
              Bank M&E consultant will ensure the development of a realistic and suitable data collection
              plan.

              To manage the data collection, the NDDRC will establish a formal M&E Unit in Juba. The
              adequacy of the staffing will be assessed and discussed with NDDRC management.

              From the HQ PMU the M&E Capacity Building Mentor will undertake training of M&E
              support staff and officers in the four States. The focus of the training of the HQ based staff
              will be on the basics of data collection as well as data management, analysis and simple
              report writing. In the States the focus will be more on data collection and data collection
              coordination, data storage and management. Beyond the specific training sessions and
              mentoring processes for the NDDRC staff will be an integrated part of the design of the
              M&E Unit, to ensure that the tools and systems developed are transferrable and capacity
              remain in NDDRC for future implementation of the programme.

              Staff involved:
                 • ASI/Integrity: a) the M&E Expert, and b) the M&E Capacity Building Mentor.
                 • NDDRC: a) the ICRS Manager, and b) the head of the M&E Unit of the NDDRC.
                      All other ICRS and M&E related staff of the NDDRC will be involved.
                 • The coordinators of the livelihoods and community support components.

              Product:
                 • Components of the draft M&E system were discussed and after revision submitted to
                    the NDDRC on 25 July. A revised draft will be produced once feedback received
                    from the NDDRC.
                 • The components of the M&E system will be reflected in the draft PIM.
                 • M&E training will be included in the training sessions planned for.

F.       Baseline Surveys – 1 July - 15 November

A significant part of the implementation phase of the M&E component is to supervise,
support and report on the two baseline surveys, one of the XCs and one on communities.
The objectives of the surveys are:
    a) To understand the demographic characteristics, livelihood aspirations and social
       capital profiles of ex-combatants (XCs);
    b) To document the impacts of livelihood activities on XCs and their communities,
       income and savings, and overall economic productivity per cooperative and small
       farm and enterprise; and
    c) To provide broader level information to NDDRC for use in documenting programme
       impacts in a post-pilot phase, and methods for improving programme management,
       and developing new and improved livelihood and capacity building products and
       services.

The baseline data will be integral to the ongoing M&E feedback loop into the programme,
analyzing the data will contribute to establishing how progress will be made against the
stated objectives. The XCs and community baselines are however standalone deliverables
from the M&E Unit and require further methodological elaboration.

Baseline survey on ex-combatants (XCs)

The baseline survey of XCs has been designed with assistance of World Bank consultants,
and was tested during the ASI/Integrity inception mission. The World Bank has handed
over the survey to the contractor, ASI/Integrity, which has taken charge of training
enumerators and implementing the survey. The sample will be the entire population of XCs
accepted into the Transitional Facility in Mapel by 1 June 2013.

The training of the enumerators (12 NDDRC ICRS caseworkers) took place in Wau 2-4
July, led by the M&E Capacity Building Expert. The training focused on getting
enumerators comfortable with administering the tool itself, as well as with good interview
practice, and research ethics required for conducting surveys.

The training was a positive experience, enjoyed by all participants. The enumerators are
motivated, and were indeed seen as capable of carrying out the survey. They identified
several questions that they felt risked being culturally insensitive and could thus damage
rapport and jeopardize data quality, or even in themselves generate erroneous or irrelevant
data. Discussions allowed enumerators to discuss amongst themselves how to frame the
questions during the interview in order to get the intended information (enumerators need to
translate questions in any case; XCs in the facility mainly speak their own ethnic
languages). Enumerators took notes about interviews as they conduct them, flagging
problematic questions or issues that participants raise and do not have a place within the
questionnaire, as background information for the analyst that will do statistical analysis.

A Sr. Research Supervisor oversaw the work of the enumerators conducting the XCs survey,
mostly through spot checks and the like. Rather, the role of the supervisor was to provide
quality control by reviewing data as it is entered into the ICRS database, and hold
debriefings each evening in order to receive feedback from enumerators about issues they
encountered and consolidating these issues into notes for the analyst who will conduct
statistical analysis. Both the enumerators and the Research Supervisor submitted reports.

              Reporting on the XC baseline survey is being led by the M&E Surveys Expert (in Nairobi).
              A draft report on the survey will be submitted on 15 August 2013, to be discussed with the
              NDDRC.

              Baseline survey on communities

              As set out in the ToR, a baseline survey of a sample of communities that is representative of
              the various location types where XCs return will be conducted. The baseline will provide a
              snapshot of community attitudes towards returnees and XCs, which will provide important
              input for the Steering Committee in its development of the strategy for community support
              through the project. Perceptions, expectations, fears, attitudes and socio-economic
              circumstances of the communities that the XCs are reintegrating into will be captured, using
              indicators that will be simple to track.

              The baseline will also provide a point of comparison for the tracer study that will be
              conducted in later stages of the project, which allows the project to capture any changes that
              may have come about over the period of project implementation.

              The parameters for the survey are the following:
              • Four locations: The survey will cover 4 locations in greater Bahr el Ghazal, and capture a
                representative mixture of urban and rural respondents.
              • 800 respondents: Fieldwork will be conducted by 10 enumerators over 20 days, at an
                expected average rate of 4 surveys/enumerator/day. (This planning will be more detailed
                once the communities will have been selected.)

              The questionnaire is being developed by Integrity, based on lessons from the XC survey and
              previous other templates. The XC baseline survey training made it clear that ICRS workers
              and Commission staff need to be more closely involved in the development of the tool than
              they have been in the past for three reasons: 1) building capacity of staff to carry out
              research activities, 2) validating the tool and ensuring questions are culturally appropriate,
              and 3) maintaining ‘ownership’ of the program by the NDDRC staff. Therefore the
              implementation of the survey will include a thorough validation and pilot phase to adjust the
              instrument, if required.

              At present, the plan is to implement the survey using open source survey software on
              Android-based tablet computers. These will allow data to be uploaded to remote servers
              whenever the tablets are online. This offers clear logistical benefits over traditional pen and
              paper surveys, and XC training with enumerators has shown that with training, the
              enumerators will be able to learn to use the survey application on tablet computers

              Enumerator teams will be supervised by one Sr. Research Manager, who will ensure that
              proper community sampling protocols will be observed so that representative data is
              collected according to the sample plan.

              Staff involved:
                 • ASI/Integrity: design supervision by M&E Expert; training by M&E Capacity
                      Mentor and Sr. Research Supervisor; implementation by all Research Supervisors;

       for the community survey still to be specified (but is budgeted for 20 days in total).
       The selection of communities to be included in the survey is currently being
       discussed with the NDDRC.

Product:
   • The draft report on the XCs baseline survey will be submitted on 15 August 2013, to
      be discussed with the NDDRC.
   • The draft report on the community baseline survey will be submitted on 15
      November 2013, to be discussed with the NDDRC.


G.       Training of Project Management Units (PMUs) – 19-30 August

The PMUs at HQ in Juba as well as those in the four states of Bahr el Ghazal will be
provided with training as well as on-the-job mentoring. The Principle Capacity Building
Mentor, with support from the M&E experts, will develop a comprehensive training process
for HQ PMU and SPMU. The training sessions will be concentrated in the period 19-30
August, with one multi-day session foreseen in Juba and one in Wau. The training will
cover the key systems and processes that will be put in place, using the PIM as the basis. In
the training sessions the NDDRC staff themselves would play a central role.

The Principle Capacity Building Mentor will facilitate the delivery of the PMU training.
The first sessions will be with members of the HQ PMU in a train the trainers / supervisors
modality. Training will cover the key requirements for reporting and monitoring. It will
also sensitize the HQ on its central role and its dealings with the SPMUs. The four
Assistant Mentors who will lead the capacity support in the State offices will also actively
participate in the Juba training.

Following the training of the HQ, the Principle Capacity Building Mentor and the four
Assistant Mentors will facilitate training to the SPMU teams in Wau. The training will be
tailored to the needs in the four states, addressing how they deal with issues in the State
whilst also providing the key data requirements to HQ.

Following the delivery of the capacity building training, the Assistant Mentors will be
embedded in the NDDRC Offices in their respective States, with the Principle Capacity
Building Mentor continuing his mentoring and support role in Juba. For the remainder of
the project the mentors will offer advice, guidance and on the job training and support in
managing the reintegration support and in conducting research to their counterparts whilst
also identifying and formulating the lessons learned that will be included in the end of
project report.

In addition to the HQ and the (combined) state level training sessions programmed, smaller
sessions will be held in which the currently existing systems and procedures will be
reviewed with the responsible staff at the various levels in the organization, as well as
relevant implementation partners. The responsible officers of the Commission will play an
important role as resource people. Focus will be on critical approaches and systems to
provide reintegration assistance and conduct M&E. Feasible and practical improvements
will be discussed and proposed to senior management.

                       and b) all staff in the four State PMUs will be part of the training in Wau for 3.5
                       days, plus 5 NDDRC specialist staff from HQ PMU.
                  • Key staff of the implementing partners of components 3 and 4 of the pilot will be
                       invited to the training sessions.

               Product:

               H.                Mentoring – 24 June - 27 September

               An important component of the capacity building support is the process of ‘mentoring’. It
               implies that each of the ASI/Integrity team members will conduct his or her work in such a
               manner that it enables and empowers the members of the PMUs to understand and
               implement their own tasks. Team members will be easily accessible for questions and
               advice. They will also actively ask questions and/or make suggestions with regard to the
               responsibilities of the members of the PMUs.

               The mentoring is an ongoing, flexible and mostly informal process. The main mentoring
               connections will be:
                  • Principle Capacity Building Mentor will mostly work with the chairperson of the HQ
                      PMU and the Director for Reintegration. If requested, he would also work in similar
                      ways with other members of the NDDRC’s senior management.
                  • The M&E experts will mostly work with those members in the Commission with
                      responsibilities for M&E, in particular the M&E officer at HQ. This would also
                      include staff responsible for the ICRS.
                  • The Assistant Mentors will primarily be mentoring the Directors of the state offices.

               Staff involved:
                  • ASI/Integrity: all team members.
                  • NDDRC: all members of the HQ PMU and the four SPMUs.


               I.                Drawing Lessons – 5 August - 27 September

               The pilot project is meant to be a learning process. Both the HQ and SPMUs will be
               capacitated to learn lessons during the pilot phase of the reintegration support that can be
               applied to future DDR programming in South Sudan. The ASI/Integrity team will pull all
               lessons together and present them along with recommendations in the final report. The
               Principle Capacity Building Mentor, with input from other team members, will be at the
               center of the formal effort to develop lessons learned.

The data and indicators that the ICRS will be gathering from the field, with assistance from
the ASI/Integrity team, can then be drawn upon for progress reports and shared in advance
of the final external evaluation.

The ASI/Integrity M&E team will be responsible for tracking progress made as well as on
particular areas of concern that the team needs to address to optimize the impact of the
intervention. The pilot is the opportunity to trial untested activities and approaches and
learn more about what works as well as developing systems and procedures for the
following phases of the programme. Data analysis will provide information for a feedback
mechanism and indeed contribute to the learning objective with the pilot. To be successful
in its ongoing data collection, analysis and reporting, the M&E Unit will require ongoing
coordination between the Unit, the HQ PMU, the SPMUs and implementing partners.

Whilst lessons will be recorded in an ongoing fashion, they will then form part of an open
discussion about each area with the HQ PMU, SPMUs and senior management of the
Commission. Following this feedback there will then be a draft lessons learned document
presented to the NDDRC and the World Bank.

Staff involved:
   • ASI/Integrity: all team members, coordinated by the Team Leader.
   • NDDRC: all staff of the NDDRC, coordinated by the chairperson of the PMU.

Product:
   • A comprehensive set of lessons learned will be presented in the Final Report
      presented to the NDDRC and the World Bank on 15 November 2013.

Executive Summary
1. Introduction

The National Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Commission (NDDRC) in South
Sudan is conducting a Pilot Reintegration Project in order to test its systems and draw lessons
from the initial activities in preparation for what will become a large reintegration support
operation in the future. The project is supported by the Transitional Demobilization and
Reintegration Program (TDRP) of the World Bank (WB), which has contracted Adam Smith
International (ASI) in partnership with Integrity Research and Consultancy (Integrity) to provide
capacity-building and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) support to the NDDRC.

Monitoring and data collection is crucial to the successful delivery of the pilot project, aiming to
draw information about the participants to inform the work of the NDDRC at state level as well
as lessons to inform forthcoming phases of the DDR programme as a whole. A significant part
of the implementation phase of the M&E component is to supervise, support and report on two
baseline surveys; one involving ex-combatants (XCs) and the other on the communities to
which they belong. This report presents the findings of the XC survey.



2. The XC baseline survey

This baseline survey constitutes an essential component of the preparation and learning
process of the NDDRC by providing important data and information about the XC and the
support operation. The baseline survey will be followed up with a tracer study in 2014 to
compare the situation before and after the support operation and to provide further
recommendations to the NDDRC.

The baseline survey of XCs in South Sudan was developed by drawing on the experience of
conducting similar surveys in Uganda, Rwanda and elsewhere. Designed and piloted with the
assistance of WB consultants, ASI / Integrity undertook training and implemented the survey
with the support of caseworkers from the NDDRC.

12 ICRS caseworkers from the NDDRC were engaged as enumerators and trained by ASI /
Integrity in preparation for administering the XC survey from the 2nd to the 4th of July 2013. The
training focused on ensuring the enumerators were comfortable with the survey tool, as well as
with good interview practice and the standard of research ethics required for conducting
surveys. The training also served to pilot the instrument, which was adjusted to fit the context


!                                                                                                                  1

                                                                                                        Final Report - Annex B
                                                                                DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   1

    and the unique needs of the NDDRC and the XC. The survey was undertaken in the training
    facility in Mapel between the 6th and 15th of July, using the entire population of XCs accepted
    into the Transitional Facility by 1 June 2013 as the sample.



    3. Key Findings

    The survey provided data on a number of issues including levels of education, economic
    situation, their interests in terms of livelihoods and information about relations between XCs as
    well as their relations to their host communities. Some findings are of particular interest for the
    programme and future activities.

    The research revealed that levels of literacy among XCs were very low. This is undoubtedly
    due to a lack of access to education during the war and a lack of infrastructure to support these
    services. In terms of training, the highest interest amongst ex-combatant was for
    agricultural / horticultural training and auto mechanic training. The findings also revealed
    that XCs are highly likely to know other XCs returning to the same area, and that the majority
    will be return to thatched roof / mud walled tukul houses. !

    For many, life after the armed forces is concerned with acquiring and working land, obtaining
    livestock and ensuring their family’s food security. Many are able to decrease hunger in the
    household by selling crops, fishing for food and selling fish in the markets. Nevertheless,
    approximately half feel that their families often go hungry. Many XCs are the sole
    breadwinners for their family and face the pressure of continuing their income. The research
    revealed that two-thirds of XCs were only generating income from the military, that most
    have not considered migrating for work outside of the country, and that the vast majority have
    never applied for micro-credit.

    Very few XCs had ever been a part of an economic cooperative, but worth noting is, that in
    South Sudan the concept of a cooperative is quite unfamiliar and thus the term is difficult to
    define (see Annex A). Many understand the idea of a Sanduk, which is an informal joint lending
    scheme, but does not involve a communal enterprise or business. Future iterations of this topic
    should address the definition of a cooperative and the translation into terms that are familiar.

    A further key finding was that most XCs felt that they would be welcomed into the
    community. Most XCs are involved in one or more social groups within their communities, most
    identify their friends as those of the same gender and age, and a majority of male XCs claimed
    to feel free to speak out in their communities. While most XCs claimed to feel happy, and the


    !                                                                                                                  2

2   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
!


majority felt that they are able to make important decisions in their lives, more than half
asserted that the community leaders do not listen to their concerns .

Besides these initial findings the survey has also provided data for comparison with the
subsequently undertaken community survey, both will provide useful comparisons at
programme level when the tracer studies has been undertaken after completion of the pilot.
Lessons learned and specific recommendations for further surveys are included in Annex A.

capacity-building and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) support to the NDDRC.

Monitoring and data collection is crucial for the successful delivery of the pilot project, aiming to
draw lessons to inform forthcoming phases of the DDR programme. This baseline survey
constitutes an essential component of the preparation and learning process of the NDDRC by
providing important data and information about the XCs and the support operation. The baseline
survey will be followed up with a tracer study in 2014 to compare the situation before and after
the support operation and to provide recommendations to the NDDRC.

Drawing on experience of similar surveys in Uganda, Rwanda and other countries, the baseline
for XCs was developed for South Sudan. The baseline survey of XCs was designed with
assistance of World Bank consultants, and was tested during the ASI/Integrity inception
mission. The World Bank handed over the survey to the contractor, ASI/Integrity, which has
taken charge of training enumerators and support the NDDRC in implementing the survey. The
sample is the entire population of XCs accepted into the Transitional Facility in Mapel by 1 June
2013.

12 NDDRC ICRS caseworkers were engaged as enumerators and trained in preparation of the
survey the 2-4th of July 2013. The training focused on getting enumerators comfortable with
administering the tool itself, as well as with good interview practice, and research ethics
required for conducting surveys. The training also served to pilot the instrument, which was
adjusted to fit the context and the unique needs of the NDDRC and the combatants.

The survey took place from the 6th to the 15th of July in Mapel immediately after the ICRS
Caseworker training.

     The purpose of the survey, and the planned tracer studies, is to:

                    (i)         Gain understanding of the demographic characteristics, livelihood aspirations and
                                social capital profiles of XCs;

                    (ii)        Document the impact of livelihood activities on XCs and their communities, income
                                and savings, and overall economic productivity per cooperative, small farm and
                                enterprise;

                    (iii)       Provide a broader level information to NDDRC for use in documenting programme
                                impact in a post-pilot phase, and methods for improving programme management,
                                and developing new and improved livelihood and capacity building products and
                                services.




     2. Methodology
     The survey was undertaken using a standard procedure, starting with training in how to use the
     tools, testing the instrument and adapting the programming based on suggestions and
     amendments. The M&E capacity building advisor led the training along with participation from
     the NDDRC and TDRP programmer. The training was undertaken in the Transitional Facility in
     Mapel and included participation of 11 ICRS caseworkers, who worked as enumerators for the
     survey. The caseworkers had been briefed about the research and were somewhat familiar with
     the survey given that small pilot had already been developed to test the instrument in Juba in
     advance of the larger pilot survey. Moreover, the ICRS team has been involved in similar
     studies and was well equipped to undertake successful data collection.



     2.1 Training

     The ICRS caseworkers were trained in advance of undertaking the survey to improve their
     interviewing capacity and their ability to handle ethical issues that might arise. The ICRS
     caseworkers were also given an in-depth introduction to all questions, and had numerous
     guided practice sessions, including one in which they interviewed each other using local
     languages and developed agreed interpretations of key terminology and concepts. This
     preparation ensured the caseworkers fully understood the questionnaire and were able to
     administer it using the IT platform and laptop computers.

2.2 Instrument

During the pilot, changes were made to the instrument, which was programmed in real-time by
the WB programmer. Given that the instrument was new to most of the ICRS caseworkers and it
employed a template used elsewhere, several of the questions needed clarifications and
adaption to the South Sudanese context. The themes of the pre-developed WB instrument
covered:

         • Relationship and marital status
         • Education
         • Housing and security
         • Land, livestock and food security
         • Reintegration experiences
         • Economic issues
         • Empowerment
         • Social change

This report also provides findings from Registration data, collected for each ex-combatant in the
facility prior to this survey, with the themes including (but not limited to):1

         • Family background

         • Language

         • Medical

         • Resettlement



2.3 Sampling

In total, 269 DDR participants were surveyed within the time frame, of which 17 were female.
The remaining 14 potential respondents (1 female) were unavailable during the implementation
of the study. While the intention had been to collect information from all individuals, the absence
of these 14 is likely to have had only a trivial impact upon the findings, both due to the relatively
small number and as there is no reason to believe that any biases in the sample would occur as
a result.

    !


    2.4 Fieldwork

    A Survey Manager was at the interview site (Mapel) throughout the interview process and
    reviewed the questionnaires daily and initiated assistance when it was required, to ensure they
    had technical support while conducting the interviews. As reported in more detail in Annex A,
    aspects of the instrument caused some challenges during the data collection, as questions were
    found difficult to comprehend by the respondents. Given the complexity of the questionnaire,
    each interview initially took up to two hours to complete. To improve the understanding of the
    questions, the ICRS team spent time explaining each one and provided examples. Over time
    the ICRS team became more familiar with the questionnaire and the average time decreased to
    1-1.5 hours for the fastest caseworkers.

    The XCs were highly interested in participating in the research at the beginning of the research,
    in particular because the survey was linked to receiving official demobilisation identification
    cards. 66 surveys were completed on the first day alone. However, interest dropped as the
    survey continued, and the team often had to wait for or actively look for respondents who had
    not yet participated.



    2.5 Limitations of the Survey

    Survey data must always be treated with caution, as certain interviewees may be tempted to
    provide false or misleading responses, for instance, out of fear, to aggrandise their own role in
    past events, or to distance themselves from certain acts. Social Desirability Bias, the tendency
    of respondents to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed favourably by others, is also
    a repeated concern. In addition, some informants may have viewed research team members as
    potential gatekeepers of material support (e.g. funding, equipment, training), and thus may have
    misrepresented their circumstances and/or cause.2

3. Key Findings
This section is broken down sequentially into subsections on Education and Training, Housing
and Security, Land, Livestock and Food Security, Economics, Cooperatives, Social Issues,
Empowerment, Social Change and Reintegration. Efforts were made during the analysis to
identify differences in responses between subpopulations within the sample (e.g. between
genders, age groups, state of origin). For the most part these differences were limited, and for
each question the most revealing of these cross-correlations is presented in the graphs. The
ability to conduct other demographic cross-correlations (e.g. by education levels) was limited by
concerns with the Registration data (see Annex D). The analysis additionally involved attempts
to identify patterns in the data between questions within the instrument itself (i.e. non-
demographic cross-correlations). For instance, it was found that there was a relationship
between livestock ownership and reported levels of hunger.

!

3.1 Education and Training

The overall education levels in South Sudan are low due to a lack of access to education during
the war and infrastructure to support these services. Some XCs received a minimal level of
education during their military recruitment and training or during stints in refugee camps during
the war. Others are acquiring literacy skills for the first time during the DDR training process.
This subsection focuses on findings related to education and training. Key findings include the
low literacy levels among XCs and the high interest in receiving agricultural / horticulture training
and auto mechanic training.

     Figure 1: Ability to read single words by state and gender



     Figure 1 indicates that the majority of respondents claimed to be unable to read or write single
     words. For instance, this applied to 179 (67 per cent) of the males and 13 (76 per cent) of the
     females. Limited differences were identified in percentage terms between the four states.

Figure 2: Ability to read full sentences by state and gender



As would be expected, even fewer respondents asserted that they were able to read and write
full sentences, as is shown in Figure 2. Only 14 (16 per cent) made this claim from Lakes state
and 14 (22 per cent) from Warrap.

     Figure 3: Training received in vocational training preference by training preference



     Figure 3 shows that the most common first preference for vocational training was agriculture /
     horticulture, with a total of 119 respondents (44 per cent) providing this answer. This is perhaps
     unsurprising as farming is the main vocation of most regions of South Sudan. Figure 3 also
     demonstrates that a substantial proportion of the respondents claimed that they were not being
     trained in their first choice. For instance, 32 of the 119 respondents (27 per cent) whose
     preference was agriculture / horticulture asserted they were not receiving such training.

     The follow-up question on which material (non-cash) assistance would be beneficial following
     vocational training provided varied results, with many respondents offering generic answers
     such as ‘tools,’ ‘equipment’ and ‘materials.’ Amongst those preferring agriculture / horticulture,
     common responses also included seed, an ox-plough, and a tractor. Many of those who opted
     for auto mechanic training often replied that a toolbox, a generator, a garage and a licence
     would be beneficial.

3.2 Housing and Security

For the DDR process it is important to understand ex-combatant perceptions of their
environment for reintegration so that future programming can acknowledge and address
concerns and challenges. This section presents the findings related to housing and security.
Key findings include XCs’ high likelihood of knowing other XCs returning to the same area, the
majority returning to thatched roof / mud walled tukul houses, and that they perceive the areas
of reintegration as being safe. !




Figure 4: Knowledge of other ex-combatants returning to same location by state




Figure 4 shows that the majority of respondents claimed to know of other XCs who will be
returning to their location, for instance, with 52 of 65 (80 per cent) making this claim in Warrap.
This is likely due to close tribal and community relations and networks in states. Familial
networks run wide in South Sudan, suggesting that this may provide additional support for
reintegration.

     Figure 5: Housing type returning to by state




     The majority of respondents (66 per cent) claimed that they would return to a thatched roof /
     mud wall house after leaving the Transitional Facility, with a second common response being
     grass-side houses (21 per cent). This is unsurprising as these housing types are the most
     common throughout South Sudan. As shown in Figure 5, only limited variance was observed
     between states, for instance, with 10 per cent of respondents (9 individuals) claiming that they
     would return to an iron sheeting structure in Lakes, compared to less than 5 per cent in each of
     the other three states. A degree of caution should be taken in interpreting the findings regarding
     housing type as respondents may be homeless, but unwilling to report this due to social stigma.

     A total of 188 respondents (70 per cent) claimed that they owned their housing structure and a
     further 30 (11 per cent) stated that it was owned by a spouse / partner. These findings were
     relatively consistent across the four main states of origin.

        response being somewhat more common in Northern Bahr el Ghazal (94 per cent), as shown in
        Figure 7. This undoubtedly reflects that Northern Bahr el Ghazal has very minimal security
        issues or tensions compared to other states. It is possible that XCs perception of safety is
        different than common citizens, since they have been part of security forces and been exposed
        to greater tensions and conflicts.

Those reintegrating into Western Bahr el Ghazal and Lakes state may feel a heightened sense
of a possibility of war due to ongoing tribal conflicts and tensions in these particular states.

     with 197 of the respondents (74 per cent) maintaining that violence would never occur on the

     welcomed back to their home environment. As shown in Figure 9, however, 3 respondents (4
     per cent) from Western Bahr el Ghazal state claimed that this would ‘always’ occur.

3.3 Land, Livestock and Food Security

For many, life after the armed forces is concerned with acquiring and working land, obtaining
livestock and ensuring their family’s food security. Many are able to decrease hunger in the
household by selling crops, fishing for food and selling fish in the markets. This section presents
findings related to land, livestock and food security. Key findings include that few XCs are able
to sell crops or fish for profit, one-third own livestock, and that approximately half feel that their

As indicated in Figure 10, a total of 108 respondents (41 per cent) maintained they owned more
arable land for planting and harvesting compared to two years ago. A further 97 asserted that
this quantity had not changed (37 per cent), and 31 claimed that they now owned less (12 per
cent). Those stating that they owned additional land tended to claim that this was because of
inheritance, as land was communal (suggesting it was simply the case there was nothing to stop
them utilising additional land), or as they had cleared previously unused land. Future iterations
of the survey may elaborate on the definitions of land ownership and usage.

     maintained that their family members ‘always’ experience hunger, compared to 1 respondent (1
     per cent) of those whose households own livestock. It is not possible to make firm conclusions
     regarding casualty from the available data, and it may be that hunger drives a lack of livestock
     (i.e. livestock has to be sold by hungry families), or a lack of livestock leads to hunger (i.e.
     families are not able to consume dairy, etc.).

As is demonstrated in Figure 18, there were limited differences in the extent to which those

     3.4 Economic Issues

     Many XCs are the sole breadwinners for their family and face the pressure of continuing their
     income. Understanding economic issues facing XCs is crucial to supporting the DDR
     programming to increase their opportunity to obtain work and support their families. Key findings
     from this subsection include that two-thirds of XCs were only generating income from the
     military, that most have not considered migrating for work outside of the country, and that the
     vast majority have never applied for micro-credit.




     Figure 21: Generate income outside of the military / armed forces by state

     A total of 84 respondents (32 per cent) maintained that they gain income additional to that
     generated through being in the military or armed forces, with the proportions replying in the
     affirmative largely consistent across the four main states of origin, as indicated in Figure 21. An
     open ended follow-on question revealed that the means through which this extra income was
     gained included farming, fishing, tailoring, carpentry, motor repair, thatching houses, selling
     wood, and producing charcoal and alcohol. A total of 113 respondents (42 per cent) claimed
     they returned to their pre-conflict form of employment, and this was relatively consistent
     between the states.

As is indicated in Figure 26, a notably higher proportion of respondents from Western Bahr el

       3.5 Cooperatives

       The key finding from this subsection is that very few XCs had ever been a part of an economic
       cooperative. In South Sudan the concept of a cooperative is quite unfamiliar and thus the term
       is difficult to define (see Annex A). Many understand the idea of a Sanduk, which is an informal
       joint lending scheme, but does not involve a communal enterprise or business. Future iterations
       of this topic should address the definition of a cooperative and the translation into terms that are
       familiar.




       Figure 29: Membership of co-operatives by state




       Only 3 of the respondents (1 per cent) claimed to currently be a member of a cooperative, with a
       further 48 (18 per cent) stating that they formerly were involved in such associations. 16 of

3.6 Social Capital

The South Sudanese concept of family is widespread and often includes distant relatives and
close friends. The key findings from this subsection on social capital include that most XCs are
involved in one or more social groups in their communities, most identify their friends as those
of the same gender and age, and a majority of male XCs feel free to speak out in their
communities. !




Figure 30: Belonging to social groups by age group and gender




A total of 50 (19 per cent) of respondents asserted that they belonged to zero social groups,
with a further 97 (36 per cent) maintaining that they belonged to one, and 74 (28 per cent)
stating that they belonged to two. Involvement in social groups is common in South Sudan but
varies according to the location and size of the community. Male respondents were far more
likely to claim to belong to zero such groups (19 per cent) than females (6 per cent). 119
respondents (44 per cent) claimed to be on a management / organising committee for such a
group.

     Figure 31: Contact with family by state




     Figure 31 indicates that the majority of the respondents maintained contact with their immediate
     families on at least a monthly basis. This response undoubtedly reflects cell phone availability
     and network coverage, distance to places of residence, and other obstacles to maintaining
     contact.

Figure 32: Respondent ‘Types’ of Friends




Figure 32 indicates that large proportions of respondents maintained that their friends were
mostly of the same age (133 individuals, 49 per cent) and gender (160 individuals, 59 per cent),
whereas only a minority claimed that they were mostly also XCs (73 individuals, 27 per cent).
This finding may not be surprising, as South Sudanese typically have friends of their same
gender. Some XCs may have been in the armed forces since an early age and formed a
majority of their friendships within these years.

     Figure 33: Sources of assistance for economic issues by state



     Figure 33 shows that respondents maintained that they would seek assistance in the case of
     experiencing economic issues from a variety of sources, with the most common responses
     being family (78 respondents, 29 per cent), non-ex-combatant friends (59 respondents, 22 per
     cent), and ex-combatant friends (36 respondent, 14 per cent). Typically South Sudanese have
     extended family members beyond those in their immediate community, who may be a helpful
     resource if in need of financial assistance.

Figure 34: Respondent trust in categories of people




Figure 34 shows that most respondents reported to trust various categories of people, including
elders / tribal authority (238 individuals, 88 per cent), employers (181 individuals, 67 per cent),
and government employees in the security ministries (164 individuals, 61 per cent). These
findings may be due to the fact that XCs were in a position of power in which they were
entrusted with high levels of responsibility, and that this is now reflected in their attitudes toward
other individuals and institutions. As elders and tribal authorities are highly regarded in
communities, respondents may have felt that it was appropriate to claim trust in these
individuals (i.e. this may be a case of Social Desirability Bias).

     A total of 198 respondents (75 per cent) claimed that they ‘definitely’ felt free to speak out if they
     disagreed with everyone else on a certain matter, with a further 42 (16 per cent) asserting that
     this was the case only with certain subjects. This may suggest that XCs felt confident in their
     position returning to a community after participating in the armed forces and that their opinions
     should be regarded highly. Caution should be taken in interpreting these findings, however, as it
     is possible that respondents interpreted this question differently, with some understanding it to
     refer to sensitive issues of politics or security, and others perhaps taking it to mean less
     controversial subjects.

Slightly over half of the respondents (57 per cent) claimed that they had worked with others in
the place they live for the benefit of the community in the past year. While further research may
indicate what type of work their responses are in reference to, it is possible that the respondents
viewed their military service as work to benefit their communities. As shown in Figure 38, the
proportion giving this response was highest in Warrap (64 per cent) and lowest in Northern Bahr

     3.7 Empowerment

     A high level of empowerment felt by XCs can be a positive sign of reintegrating socially and
     economically in their communities. The findings presented in this subsection reveal that while
     most feel happy, and the majority feel that they can make important decisions in their lives,
     more than half asserted that the community leaders do not listen to their concerns.

     be relatively peaceful compared to other states in the region, which may be reflected in these
     answers.

a notably higher proportion of males claimed to have ‘large’ and ‘medium’ amounts of power (67

     Figure 48 indicates that the overwhelming majority of respondents (87 per cent) claimed that
     their families would be welcoming upon their return from the transitional facility. Similarly, the
     vast majority (86 per cent) felt that their communities would also be welcoming, with their being
     limited differences between the four states. This high expectation of acceptance reflects that
     most communities see XCs as war heroes, or at least that most XCs feel that this is the case.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, the study reveals a number of interesting findings with regards to specific issues
around education, economic situation, XC interests in terms of livelihoods as well as information
about relations both between XCs, and between XCs and their host communities. As such the
survey has lived up to the study objectives by providing understanding of the demographic
characteristics, livelihoods aspirations and social capital profiles of the XC’s.

The study revealed for example that levels of literacy among XCs were very low. This is
undoubtedly due to a lack of access to education during the war and a lack of infrastructure to
support these services. In terms of training, the highest interest amongst ex-combatant was for
agricultural / horticultural training and auto mechanic training. The findings also revealed that
XCs are highly likely to know other XCs returning to the same area, and that the majority will be
return to thatched roof / mud walled tukul houses. !

For many, life after the armed forces is concerned with acquiring and working land, obtaining
livestock and ensuring their family’s food security. Many are able to decrease hunger in the
household by selling crops, fishing for food and selling fish in the markets. Nevertheless,
approximately half feel that their families often go hungry. Many XCs are the sole breadwinners
for their family and face the pressure of continuing their income. The research revealed that
two-thirds of XCs were only generating income from the military, that most have not considered
migrating for work outside of the country, and that the vast majority have never applied for
micro-credit.

Very few XCs had ever been a part of an economic cooperative. In South Sudan the concept of
a cooperative is quite unfamiliar and thus the term is difficult to define (see Annex A). Many
understand the idea of a Sanduk, which is an informal joint lending scheme, but does not
involve a communal enterprise or business. Future iterations of this topic should address the
definition of a cooperative and the translation into terms that are familiar.

Most XCs are involved in one or more social groups within their communities, most identify their
friends as those of the same gender and age, and a majority of male XCs claimed to feel free to
speak out in their communities. While most XCs claimed to feel happy, and the majority felt that
they are able to make important decisions in their lives, more than half asserted that the
community leaders do not listen to their concerns. A further key finding was that most XCs felt
that they would be welcomed into the community.

         ‘post’ intervention data, providing findings that will reveal the impact of the livelihood activities
         on XCs and their communities, income and savings. As such the findings of this survey provides
         the starting point for broader level information to NDDRC for use in documenting programme
         impact in a post-pilot phase.

Annex A: Survey Recommendations
1. Instrument design

• Content: The instrument has been imported from previous research on DDR in locations in
which XCs are less likely to be viewed as returning heroes. As such, there are few questions
that specifically seek to reveal information about the extent to which these individuals are seen
in a positive light, and we recommend that the survey be tailored with this in mind.

• Length: A number of the interviews took two hours, attributable both to the length of the
instrument (containing many time-consuming open questions, as discussed below), and to a
number of sections being overly complex (for instance, Sections J and L). The reliability of the
responses is likely to reduce towards the latter stages of such interviews, and we suggest that
means are identified to reduce its duration.

• Structure: The instrument tends to skip between topics, for instance, focusing on cooperatives
in both Sections C and K. This leads to a disjointed questionnaire that perhaps creates a degree
of confusion amongst interviewees. Perhaps more importantly, we suggest that more sensitive
questions (e.g. those relating to security and personal finances) should be placed towards the
end of the instrument.

• Demographics: While the Participant ID numbers made it possible to cross-reference the data
with demographic information in the Registration Data, we strongly recommend that a limited
number of demographic variables (e.g. gender, age, state of origin, etc.) are included in the
instrument as a back-up to ensure that it remains possible to cross-correlate data (i.e. make
comparisons between these demographic groups) if certain problems are encountered with the
Participant ID variable.

• Enumerator ID: It is good practice to include an Enumerator ID in the instrument in order to
attribute any issues identified with data collection to specific individuals.

• Terminology: There are a number of cases of vague / imprecise terminology, which lead to
issues in interpreting the findings. Notable examples include the ‘moral support’ response option
to QK6 and the word ‘type’ in QK2 and QK3. This also applies to entire questions, e.g. it is
unclear if QL9 refers an individual’s ability to express disagreement over sensitive matters of
politics and security versus more mundane issues. The concept of ‘cooperatives’ was poorly
understood, as revealed by findings between questions on this topic that are illogical. On this
basis, in an effort to avoid misleading the reader, most questions on this theme have not been

                                                                                                         Final Report - Annex B
                                                                                 DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan   65
         !


         included in this report. Efforts should be made to ensure that all questions are precise, and this
         can be achieved, for instance, by (a) giving examples in brackets within questions, or (b)
         through introductory text to explain a theme.

         • Reading Response Options: To ensure consistency in the data it is necessary to provide
         enumerators with precise instructions within the instrument, for instance, regarding whether or
         not they should read out each set of response options. In certain cases this is not necessary, as
         in when the question asks about a respondent’s gender, age or state of origin. In other cases,
         precise instructions should be provided within the instrument to remind the enumerators to read
         the options, for instance, when a set of precise pre-coded responses have been decided upon–
         e.g. on themes such as frequency of contact with family members, housing type, and so on.

         • Don’t Know/ No Response Options: While instructions are provided at the bottom of the
         instrument to record ‘don’t know’ as -99 and ‘no response’ as 0, these options appeared rarely
         in the data when compared to other surveys. It is important to encourage enumerators to use
         these options, as they commonly provide an indication of whether a specific question has been
         understood or if it was deemed to be particularly sensitive.

         • Scaling Response Options: In considering perceptions of safety in QD6 the respondents
         must select between ‘safe,’ ‘neither safe nor unsafe,’ and ‘unsafe.’ Similarly, when considering
         their land in QD3 the respondents must choose between ‘secure tenure,’ ‘neither secure nor
         insecure tenure’, and ‘insecure tenure.’ To ensure greater clarity, with regard to the potentially
         confusing middle response options in particular, we recommend that a standard four-point scale
         is applied in all such questions in the instrument. Thus, for instance, in the case of QD6 this
         should cover ‘very safe,’ ‘somewhat safe,’ ‘somewhat unsafe,’ and ‘very unsafe.’

         • Open Questions: Open questions incorporated into quantitative surveys are time-consuming
         to administer (requiring the enumerators to record longer answers across large samples) and
         analyse (requiring the complex process of post-coding). They also provide inconsistent value in
         that considerable nuanced information is inevitably lost between the interview and the delivery
         of the final results (the responses to QL10.1, for instance, offered very little of substance), and
         in many cases it proves impossible to meaningfully post-code the data provided. While it is not
         recommended that all open questions are removed from the instrument, we suggest that their
         number is limited and that parallel qualitative research (focus groups and interviews) offers an
         improved means through which to obtain more nuanced data.

!


• Multiple Reponses Options: A number of questions within the instrument would have
benefitted from the respondent being able to provide multiple response options. For instance, in
responding to the question QE3.1 on why they own no livestock, the interviewees are asked to
select between ‘insecurity due to conflict,’ ‘other people occupying the land,’ ‘because of
sickness,’ ‘no space for livestock in current area,’ ‘all livestock stolen in raiding,’ ‘cannot afford to
buy,’ and ‘other.’ In practice, individuals will often not own livestock for a variety of the above
reasons simultaneously, and thus we recommend they should be structured to provide as many
responses as are relevant (i.e. as is the case with QK.6).



2. Recommendations regarding IT and programming

• Multiple Response Options: The data from the only example of a multiple-response option
question in the instrument (QK.6) was missing, and it seems likely that this is attributable to
issue with programming in the field.

• Skip Patterns: There is repeated evidence in the data of skip instructions failing to work,
presumably because of an issue with the programming. For instance, in QH1 respondents are
asked if they generate income through any means other than being in the armed forces, and if
they respond ‘no’ they should automatically be directed to skip the subsequent question that
aims to collect more detail on this additional source of finance. The failure of these skips results
in a more time-consuming instrument and the potential for confusion in the responses as the
interviewees are asked questions that do not logically follow from their previous answers.



3. Recommendations regarding the research team and fieldwork

• Female Enumerators: We strongly recommend that female enumerators are included in the
research team. During the fieldwork a number of the female respondents were reluctant to
share information on marital status with the male enumerators. This raises ethical issues in
placing respondents in an uncomfortable position, and it potentially undermines the reliability of
the data.

• Enough time testing and piloting: To ensure a smooth-running survey with the best possible
instrument and facilitation of the data collection by the enumerators, enough time should be
allowed for piloting and testing. The enumeration team should be very familiar with the data
entry and instrument before starting the data collection.

          !




          • Finalise programming in time: Further to the above recommendation, only minor edits
          should be done on the instrument / programme in the pilot phase to minimise confusion and
          increase the enumeration team’s familiarity with the process. In turn, this requires that the
          instrument should be adequately designed at the outset.

          • Clear messages to the respondents: In the ICRS reporting, some comments were made on
          the lack of focus and movements of the respondents in and out of the TF. A solid brief around
          the survey is recommended to the largest degree possible ensure focussed participation and a
          smooth process for all parties.

          • Sufficient enumerators: 8 enumerators were engaged full-time in the survey, with 3 of the 11
          enumerators playing coordination and IT roles and one working as a trainer in the afternoons.

          • Allocate time for survey participation: The classes for XCs occurred concurrently with the
          survey. This made some of the XCs either miss classes in order to be surveyed on the
          scheduled date or vice versa. The enumerators at some points have to spend time waiting to
          find XCs to survey. We recommend that a proper schedule and information is provided to
          enable respondents to participate in the survey without missing classes.

Executive Summary
1. Introduction

The National Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Commission (NDDRC) in
South Sudan is conducting a Pilot Reintegration Project in order to test its approach systems
and draw lessons from the initial activities in preparation for a large reintegration support
operation in the future. The project is supported by the Transitional Demobilization and
Reintegration Program (TDRP) of the World Bank (WB), which has contracted Adam Smith
International (ASI) in partnership with Integrity Research and Consultancy (Integrity) to
provide capacity building and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) support to the NDDRC.

Monitoring and data collection is crucial for the successful delivery of the pilot project, aiming
to draw lessons to inform forthcoming phases of the DDR programme. A significant part of
the implementation phase of the M&E component is to supervise, support and report on two
baseline surveys, one involving ex-combatants (XCs) and the other on the communities to
which they belong. This report presents the findings of the community survey and the
resulting recommendations to be used to improve subsequent studies.



2. The Community Baseline Survey

This community baseline survey constitutes an essential component of the preparation and
learning process of the NDDRC by providing information on citizen perceptions of XCs, and
various issues such as livelihood, economics
and safety within the areas they are returning
to. The baseline will be followed up with a
tracer study in 2014 to compare the situation
before and after the support operation and to
provide recommendations to the NDDRC.
Moreover surveys with XCs were undertaken
in the beginning of the pilot and is used to
inform   the   analysis   of   the   relationship
between XCs and their host communities.

The community survey instrument in South Sudan was developed by drawing on the
experience of conducting similar surveys in Uganda, Rwanda and elsewhere. Designed with
the assistance of WB consultants and drawing upon lessons learned from the XC survey
ASI/ Integrity tested this survey instrument and implemented it with the support of
caseworkers from the NDDRC.

                                                                                DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    1
         12 ICRS caseworkers were engaged and trained by ASI/ Integrity in preparation for
         administering the community survey from September 23 to October 10. The three-day
         training focused on ensuring the enumerators were comfortable with the survey tool, as well
         as with good interview practice and the standard of research ethics required for conducting
         surveys. The training also served to pilot the instrument, which was adjusted to fit the
         context and the unique needs of the NDDRC and the communities. Enumerators were
         taught how to use the tablet technology, which contained the digitalised version of the
         instrument.

         The survey was undertaken in four states where XCs are likely to return: Western Bahr el
         Ghazal, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap and Lakes. In each state the survey was
         conducted in both a rural and an urban site (with the exception of Northern Bahr el Ghazal
         where it was only administered in the urban site). A total of 115 households were randomly
         selected in each enumeration area, where the adult respondent was chosen at random
         using a specific tool. The one-on-one interview lasted approximately 40 minutes, and
         rigorous quality assurance checks were put into place by the supervisors to ensure sound
         sampling and interview methodology. A total of 811 respondents across the four states
         participated in the survey.

         Lessons from undertaking the survey identified in reports written by the four state
         supervisors, as well as during debriefing with a group of the ICRS caseworks, have been
         included in the recommendations of this report in Annex D.



         3. Summary of Findings

         A number of key findings were identified during the data analysis that speak directly to
         perception of XCs, community context and security forces/ conflict.

         Perceptions of XCs:

               • Overall, the respondents were very supportive of XCs, with 95 per cent (772 individuals)
                  asserting that they support the DDR programme.
               • A total of 54 per cent (439 respondents) maintained that most people in their community
                  treat XCs with the same amount of respect as other people of a similar age. Whilst this
                  may promote integration, it may also result in tensions if XCs feel their service should
                  allow them greater respect within their communities.




2   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
Community Context:

  • The XCs are returning to communities in which 76 per cent (612 respondents) claimed
    to feel ‘very safe’ in the areas in which they lived, compared to 3 per cent (27
    respondents) who felt ‘very unsafe.’
  • 43 per cent (345 respondents) maintained that they owned livestock, but 7 per cent (53
    respondents) said that their household ‘always’ goes hungry, with 51 per cent (414
    respondents) asserting that this ‘often’ occurs.
  • These are communities that have a sense of agency; 65 per cent (527 respondents) felt
    to ‘a large extent’ that they had the power to make important decisions that could
    change the course of their lives. This could mean that communities can and will take an
    active role in reintegration.
  • Many respondents (40 per cent) chose ‘not at all’ when asked if they think government
    and local leaders take into account concerns voiced by the community in regards to
    decisions that affect them.

  • 49 per cent (294 respondents) maintained ‘lots of trust’ in ‘government employees in the
    SPLA’ and ‘government employees in the police service’ (365 respondents or 45 per
    cent), which may speak to the positive sentiment expressed around XCs more broadly.
  • 96 per cent (776 respondents) maintained that if they had a serious argument with
    someone else living in their area they would be able to resolve the problem without
    resorting to physical violence.
  • A total of 612 respondents (76 per cent) claimed to feel ‘very safe’ in the areas in which
    they lived, compared to 27 respondents (3 per cent) who felt ‘very unsafe.’

1. Introduction
The community baseline survey is both within the M&E component of the pilot project and
also part of the M&E implementation work stream of the larger capacity building project,
collecting data from a sample of communities where XC have returned. Together with a
parallel XC survey, the community survey and the tracers for these two studies aim to:

     (i)     Understand the demographic characteristics, livelihood aspirations and social
             capital profiles of XCs and community members;

    (ii)     Document the impacts of livelihood activities on XCs and their communities;

    (iii)    Provide broader level information to NDDRC for use in documenting
             programme impacts in a post-pilot phase and methods for improving
             programme management and developing new and improved livelihood and
             capacity building products and services.

Integral to the goal of NDDRC capacity building, the community baseline survey efforts
aimed to train NDDRC staff (the ICRS caseworkers) in data collection methods, interview
techniques and community sensitisation approaches, building upon the training undertaken
before the XC baseline survey during July 2 through 4, 2013. The desired result of this effort
was to prepare a cadre of NDDRC personnel trained to implement future survey research
throughout the DDR processes.




2. Methodology
The methods designed for the XC study were pre-determined by the TDRP, and a simple
quantitative household survey was recommended. The phases of this research included:
instrument design, training, sample planning, sensitisation,
implementation (including quality assurance procedures),
analysis and reporting. In total, 811 community participants
were surveyed within the timeframe. See Annex A for a more
detailed description of the methodology.

In brief, the questionnaire (‘instrument’) was adapted from an
earlier version used in the XC survey and themes covered
included: General demographics (including martial status
and education), Livelihoods, Economics, Cooperatives, Social capital, Empowerment,
Security and Ex-combatants. Samsung Galaxy tablets running FormHub on ODK were used




                                                                                                      Final Report - Annex C
                                                                             DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    5
         and overall, the survey technology was a positive aspect of the process. Community
         members were excited to see the tablets being used.

                                                                             12 ICRS caseworkers and four survey supervisors were
                                                                             trained over three days in Wau. The training was focused
                                                                             on building the enumerators’ capacity by instilling comfort
                                                                             with the survey technology, ensuring familiarity with the
                                                                             survey, translating the questions into local languages and
                                                                             role-playing various scenarios likely to be encountered
                                                                             during the survey process. The training was highly
                                                                             interactive and hands-on, while also encouraging team
                                                                             building between the state survey teams and supervisors.

         As advised by the NDDRC, the Community Baseline Survey was undertaken in one urban
         and one rural site (with one exception) in each of the four states of Greater Bahr el Ghazal
         (Western Bahr el Ghazal, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap and Lakes). The enumeration
         areas (EAs) within the chosen payam were then selected randomly, taking into consideration
         the accessibility of the rural areas during the rainy season. Respondents were evenly
         distributed across the seven boma (115 in Akuach, 117 in Ayuang, 118 in Bagari, 115 in
         Dong Mabior, 115 in Kuajok, 116 in Mapel and 115 Matangai.).

                                                                                        Community sensitisation was a key component of
                                                                                        survey preparation and implementation, and this issue
                                                                                        was           discussed        in   detail   during   the   training.
                                                                                        Sensitisation was unique to each of the seven boma,
                                                                                        and the particulars of each location are discussed in
                                                                                        depth in Annex B: Field locations & Processes.

                                                                                        The teams reported that they were mostly well
         received by community members who were eager to participate, and indeed most
         community members wanted to be interviewed. See Annex B for descriptions of the field
         locations including an account of the sensitisation that took place in each of the seven sites.

         2.1 Limitations of the Survey

         Quantitative data of this nature is specifically not designed to collect the nuanced information
         or ‘colour’ that is achievable through qualitative research. Integrity is a strong advocate of
         mixed methods approaches and recommends that future studies should be supplemented
         by interviews and focus group discussion in order to provide additional detail in the findings.
         Please find a longer discussion of limitations of the survey in Annex C.

3. Key Findings
In line with the structure of the survey instrument, this section is broken down into the
following subsections: (a) Demographics (b) Livelihoods, (c) Economics, (d) Cooperatives,
(e) Social Capital, (f) Empowerment, (g) Security and (h) Ex-Combatants. During analysis
extensive attempts were made to identify patterns in the responses between gender, age
groups, states and urban versus rural. The most significant differences occurred between
the seven boma.

The information provided in the following
subsections demonstrates what we deem to
be the most interesting and relevant findings.
Drawing information from the supervisors and
enumerators,   attempts   have   been   made
throughout to add nuance to the survey data
and to provide hypotheses that may explain
certain findings (see the yellow text boxes).
However, as discussed elsewhere in this report, we believe that both of these aims can be
better achieved in the future through incorporating qualitative methods into the research
programme, including in particular focus group discussions and informant interviews (see
Annex D for recommendations). In addition, a number of comparisons have been made to
the findings from the XC survey (see the blue text boxes). Questions drawn from the
instrument and represented in the analysis are listed in each findings section, and a
complete copy of the community baseline survey can be found in Annex F.

3.1 Demographics

The ages of the respondents ranged from 18 to 90 (18 to 78 with one 90 year old male), and
there were 545 females in the sample compared to 266 males (Figure 1 represents
respondent gender by boma). 230 individuals were sampled in Lakes, 230 in Warrap, 234 in
Western Bahr el Ghazal and 117 in Northern Bahr el Ghazal. Within the seven boma,
between 115 and 118 individuals were sampled.




                                                                                                   Final Report - Annex C
                                                                          DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    7
         Figure 1: Respondent gender by boma

         The majority of respondents were married monogamous (65 per cent) and when asked ‘has
         your partner/ any of your partners been inherited?’ 110 individuals (14 per cent) responded
         yes and 574 individuals (71 per cent) responded no.

         Many of the respondents (380 individuals, 47 per cent) maintained they had received no
         education; 299 individuals (37 per cent) claimed primary school (P1 up to P8) and 109 (13
         per cent) claimed secondary school (S1 up to S4). Figure 2 shows this question broken
         down by rural and urban areas, whereby 155 respondents (33 per cent) and 225
         respondents (65 per cent) reported no education in urban areas and rural areas respectively.
         See Annex E for more demographic information about the respondents.1




         1
           As noted in Annex A: Methodology, the selected EAs are not intended to be representative of the four states as
         this would require a selection of considerably more EAs per state. Rather, this approach sees the selected EAs
         as ‘case studies’ that can be used for monitoring and recording changes.

From the Community Baseline Survey

QA5: Housing type (recorded by enumerator)

QB1: Who owns the housing structure you are currently living in?

QB2: Does your household have land that you grow crops on?

QB3: Is the land that you grow crops on owned by your household, rented, or is it communal?

QB4: Still thinking specifically about the land your household uses to grow crops, do you use more
land, the same amount of land, or less land compared to two years ago?

QB6: Why do you now use less land?

QB7: Does your household sell some of the crops grown on this land?

QB11: Do people in your household sometimes go hungry?




                                                                                                        Final Report - Annex C
                                                                               DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    9
          Housing type

          A total of 452 respondents claimed to live in thatch roof/ mud walled homes, while 144
          claimed grass side houses, followed by iron sheeting (134), permanent houses (68), mud/
          daub and wattle (4), apartment (1) and other (8). There were substantial variations between
          locations, for instance, with thatch roof/ mud walled homes being far more common in Dong
          Mabior, Kuajok and Matangai.

          Who owns the housing structure you are currently living in?

          As indicated in Figure 3, the majority of respondents (411 individuals or 51 per cent) claimed
          that they owned their housing structures. This response was less common in Kuajok where
          39 respondents (34 per cent) maintained that their family owned the structure, and 37
          respondents (32 per cent) stated that a spouse/ partner owned it. Female and male housing
          structure ownership was similar as 50 per cent (271) of the females sampled claimed to own
          their housing structure versus 53 per cent (140) of males.

Does your household have land that you grow crops on? Do you use more land, the
same amount of land, or less land as compared to two years ago? Why?

A total of 511 respondents (63 per cent) claimed that they had arable land for planting and
harvesting, and a vast majority (84 per cent) asserted that this was owned by their family,
rather than rented or communal. A total of 124 respondents (24 per cent) claimed that they
sold produce grown on their land. As indicated in Figure 4, a total of 322 of those who had
arable land (63 per cent) claimed to use the same quantity of land as compared to two years
ago, 91 (18 per cent) asserted that they now had more land and 97 (19 per cent) maintained
that they now had less. Of those in the latter category, 42 asserted that their reduction in
land usage was due to insufficient resources to cultivate (43 per cent), and 40 claimed that
this was because others had taken their land (41 per cent).

          Interpreting Findings on Land Cultivation

          According to the enumerators, many of those surveyed in Aweil were recent returnees from Khartoum
          so they lacked the resources to cultivate land, even if they had acquired or inherited it. In Warrap,
          participants explained that they had land but did not have machinery (such as tractors) to farm it all
          and were simply dependent on traditional means. In Lakes state, many reported that they had a lot of
          land but they did not have the human resources to work it (whether this be time or skilled labor). Many
          of the men were gone from the home for various reasons and the women did not have the ability to
          work enough in the fields. Many of the urban dwellers in Lakes travelled during harvest to cultivate
          lands outside of the town. Notably, due to insecurities in Western Bahr el Ghazal and Lakes states,
          men and youth were gone from the homes fighting or hiding or had suffered during the conflicts and
          the land was left uncultivated.

          From the Field: Rural Site – Dong Mabior Boma

          During the current harvest season, many men and women were reported to be working on the land
          owned by the family, which was often located in home villages in Northern Bahr el Ghazal or
          elsewhere. It was reported that many of the inhabitants in Kuajok and this rural site had relocated
          here from other states to access better education and socioeconomic opportunities. (It is unclear if
          this is a phenomenon of these two enumeration sites or also the wider state population.)




          Does your household have any livestock? Do any members of your household fish to
          gain food for your family?

          345 respondents (43 per cent) claimed that they owned livestock, and Figure 5 shows this
          by boma. 190 individuals (55 per cent) reported that they own livestock in rural locations,
          compared to 155 individuals (33 per cent) in urban locations. 67 respondents (8 per cent)
          maintained that they fish to feed their family, with the majority of these individuals (69 per
          cent) reporting that they sell some of the fish they catch.

Interpreting Findings on Hunger and Poverty
Given the sensitive nature of questions about hunger and poverty (e.g. QB11), caution should be taken
when interpreting findings relating to these subjects. Enumerators reported that a number of
respondents requested money for food once this question had been asked, and certain interviewees
may have exaggerated the extent to which they lacked resources with this in mind. Conversely, others
may downplay the extent of their poverty as a matter of pride. Supervisors added nuance to the
responses of the questions, citing that some families had food but were too busy to cook and so
sometimes the children would go hungry. Others explained that the “hunger gap” is a seasonal
occurrence during the cultivation season between May and July, so the question may have elicited a
different response at other times of the year. Salary delays, accessibility due to rains, and the absence
of materials to make fire were cited as other reasons for respondents answering in such ways.

From the Field: Rural Site – Dong Mabior Boma
Due to the extreme flooding taking place during the survey implementation, many men were gone with
their cattle, having been forced to search for higher ground. Overall, the impression of the rural site is
that it was more food secure than the urban site due to citizens having more cattle and fish available.
The chief of the village even offered the team a goat to roast in thanks for their visit. Most people
interviewed claimed to be dependent on goat, cows, fishing and crops. A few reported brewing alcohol
for consumption and selling at a small market situated alongside the Kuajok-Wau Road.

From the Field: Urban Site – Kuajok town, Kuaj Payam
Stagnant water, mosquitos and bushy grasses and trees contributed to the slow movement of the
teams from homes in the area that resembled a rural site rather than a typical urban locale. The urban
site was reported as being less food secure than other areas in the state.

        Do people in your household sometimes go hungry?

        53 respondents (7 per cent) claimed that their household ‘always’ goes hungry, with a further
        414 (51 per cent) asserting that this ‘often’ occurs. Figure 6 demonstrates these findings by
        boma. There was little variation between urban and rural sites (Figure 7), with 52 per cent
        (243 respondents) reporting ‘often’ in urban locations, versus 49 per cent (171 respondents)
        in rural locations. 8 per cent (36 individuals) responded ‘never’ to this question in urban

Landownership and households going hungry

On the whole, there was a slight correlation associated with landownership and households
going hungry. Specifically, respondents who claimed to own land (511 total) were less likely
than non-landowners (300 total) to maintain that their household ‘always’ or ‘often’ goes
hungry. 6 per cent (29 individuals) reported they own land and their household ‘always’ goes
hungry, versus 8 per cent (24 individuals) of non-landowners and 49 per cent (251
individuals) of landowners said their household ‘often’ goes hungry versus 54 per cent (163
individuals) of non-landowners. 40 per cent (203 individuals) of landowners claimed that
their household ‘seldom’ goes hungry versus 32 per cent (97 individuals) of non-landowners
and 6 per cent of landowners reported that their household ‘never’ goes hungry versus 5 per
cent of non-landowners. This varied among urban and rural sites; for instance, Dong Mabior
and Matangai (both rural sites) have high instances of land ownership (89 per cent, 102
individuals and 98 per cent, 113 individuals respectively) yet this did not seem to have a
positive effect on reported households going hungry in these two sites (34 per cent of
landowners’ households in Dong Mabior go hungry ‘always’ or ‘often’, 67 per cent in
Matangai).

                                                                            DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    15
          Livestock ownership and households going hungry

          Overall, there was a stronger correlation associated with livestock ownership and
          households going hungry where respondents owning livestock were least likely to maintain
          that their household ‘always’ or ‘often’ goes hungry, which suggests that food security can
          be attributed to livestock ownership. The highest percentage of those who owned livestock
          and whose households ‘often’ go hungry occurred in both the urban (Akuach) and rural
          (Matangai) sites in Lakes state with 42 per cent (48 individuals) and 56 per cent (50
          individuals) respectively.


          Comparisons with the XC Survey: Livelihoods

          The findings for households going hungry from the XC survey differed little from the community
          survey, with 21 respondents (8 per cent) from the former claiming that their household ‘always’ goes
          hungry, and a further 128 (48 per cent) asserting that this ‘often’ occurs. In the XC survey, 49 per cent
          (131 respondents) claimed they fish to feed their family, compared to 8 per cent (67 respondents) in
          the community survey. 33 per cent (89 respondents) claimed to own livestock in the XC Survey
          compared to 43 per cent (345 individuals) in the community survey.




          Livelihoods in Summary

          A majority of the respondents live in thatch roof/ mud walled homes with arable land (though
          only a small percentage sold crops grown on the land) owned by the individual. It is of value
          to note that landownership issues are going to be a concern for returning XCs, particularly if
          there are currently landownership conflicts in these communities. Returning XCs with
          (potentially) no land may be a source of frustration worth watching.

          Overall, there was a slight connection between landownership and the levels of hunger
          experienced by households as those who owned land consistently reported lower levels of
          hunger, which would suggest that food security is slightly dependent on landownership.
          There was a stronger connection between livestock ownership and households going
          hungry, suggesting that food security is related to the owning of livestock.

QC2: What do you do to make money for your family?

QC3: In your community, what is the most common way for people to make money?

QC4: Have you ever considered leaving your home to look for a job in South Sudan?

QC5: Have you ever applied for micro-credit from a financial institution?

QC9: In the near future, do you think that the economic situation will improve for your household, stay
about the same, or get worse?



Interpreting Findings on Housing Structures
The city of Kuajok in the state of Warrap was transformed from a town to a capital after peace was
declared in 2005. There is still a lesser sense of permanence in the state and town compared to other
locations, which may explain why more people live in traditional tukul mud huts than other buildings. In
Matangai there has been recent insecurity and people are hesitant to invest in building permanent
structures for fear that they their homes will be destroyed and themselves displaced.




What do you spend most of your household income on? In your community, what is
the most common way for people to make money?

703 respondents (87 per cent) claimed to spend most of their household income on food,
followed by education (7 per cent) and health (5 per cent), and this varied little between the
sites. When asked an open-ended question about what they did to earn money, responses
that were given by multiple individuals included (539 individuals responded): farming (182
respondents, 34 per cent); business (71 respondents, 13 per cent); brewing/ selling local
alcohol (57 respondents, 11 per cent); employed by government/ civil servant/ or has a
relative in this capacity (55 respondents, 10 per cent); housewife/ husband earns
money (42 respondents, 8 per cent); unemployed/ not working (39 respondents, 7 per
cent); police officer (23) respondents, 4 per cent); casual labour (23 respondents, 4 per
cent); tea maker/ tea seller (16 respondents, 3 per cent); sell firewood (13 respondents, 2
per cent); fishing (12 respondents, 2 per cent); and Driving (6 respondents, 1 per cent).
Figure 8 represents these findings.




                                                                                                              Final Report - Annex C
                                                                                     DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    17
          Figure 8: What do you do to make money for your family?

          When asked about the most common way to make money in the community, the results
          were similar, with a majority (386 respondents) stating ‘farming’ or related activities, followed
          by business (192 respondents), government/ civil servant (36 respondents) brewing/ selling
          alcohol (30 respondents) and trade of various products (13 respondents).

          Have you ever considered leaving your home to look for a job in South Sudan?
          Respondents were asked if they would ever consider leaving their home to look for a job in
          South Sudan, and 590 individuals (73 per cent) responded ‘no’ to this question. By boma,
          the highest percentage of individuals responding in the affirmative were in Ayuang (59
          respondents, 51 per cent), followed by Mabior (51 respondents, 44 per cent), Kuajok (42
          respondents, 37 per cent), Bagari (21 respondents, 18 per cent), Mapel (17 respondents, 15
          per cent), Matangai (15 respondents, 13 per cent) and Akuach (15 respondents, 13 per
          cent).




18   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
Interpreting Findings on Sources of Income
In Dong Mabior many respondents were reliant upon welding activities and metal works, which was
not the case in rural areas. The small market situated alongside the main Kuajok Wau road is used by
the community for exchanging local products. However, the consumption of these products, including
charcoal, fish and meat, appeared to be high in the urban areas. Most of people interviewed claimed
to be depending on goat, cows, fishing and crops, although a few intended to brew locally made
alcohol. Some of the children in the urban areas were seen collecting empty bottles for recycling.

From the Field: Rural Site – Mapel Boma
Mixed subsistence farming and livestock rearing were mainly practised, with most families also
engaged in brewing and selling of traditional alcohol, haragi. Small-scale businesses were engaged in
selling groundnuts, charcoal, firewood, bread, tea and okra.




Have you ever applied for micro-credit from a financial institution?

Only 31 respondents (4 per cent) claimed to have ever applied for micro-credit from a
financial institution, and 81 per cent of these individuals maintained that their application(s)
had been successful. These findings varied little across state, gender, age and marital
status.



Interpreting Findings on Micro-Credit
Most respondents had never applied for micro-credit. The enumerators felt that these individuals
simply did not think that they would be approved for this form of loan and so it was not worth applying.
This applied in particular to those who are currently jobless, women and those without a stable salary.
Many of the respondents did not know of any options for microcredit in their communities or nearby. In
Lakes many women were aware of the BRAC micro-loan NGO, but people reported that this offered
very little money, only to women and only reached the urban areas.




In the near future, do you think that the economic situation will improve for your
household, stay about the same, or get worse?

440 respondents (54 per cent) believed that in the near future the economic situation for
their household will ‘improve,’ compared to 73 (9 per cent) who maintained it will ‘get worse.’
Figure 9 demonstrates the findings from this question by boma, with respondents from Dong
Mabior (20 respondents, 17 per cent), Kuajok (21 respondents, 18 per cent) and Matangai
(17 respondents, 15 per cent) tending to be less optimistic by answering ‘worse’ versus
Akuach (9 respondents, 8 per cent), Ayuang (2 respondents, 2 per cent), Bagari (1
respondent, 1 per cent) and Mapel (3 respondents, 3 per cent).




                                                                                                              Final Report - Annex C
                                                                                     DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    19
         Figure 9: Perception of household economic situation in near future by boma


         Interpreting Findings on Expected Economic Changes
         Many respondents felt that their economic situation would improve in the future. The enumerators
         noted that people did feel hopeful that life would improve with South Sudan’s independence, enrolling
         more of their children in school and the arrival of more humanitarian or development organisations.

         Due to a programming error, there was a skip on QC5 (which questioned whether respondents had
         applied for micro-credit) that unfortunately was directed to QC9, causing data to go uncollected for
         QC7 and QC8. Luckily, data gathered from other questions, QB11 and the remaining QCs, has
         yielded similar information.



         Comparisons with the XC Survey: Economics
         83 per cent of respondents in the XC Survey felt that their economic situation would improve in the
         near future, compared to 54 per cent in the Community Survey. Amongst those responding positively
         to this question in the XC Survey, the largest proportion attributed this to their DDR training, with
         others stating that this expected change was contingent upon the government providing jobs. It is
         important to take into consideration possible gaps in XCs’ expectations, noting that if expectations are
         not met, this could lead to frustration and anger.

         A total of 85 respondents (32 per cent) in the XC Survey maintained they gain income additional to
         that generated through being in the military. The means through which this extra income was gained
         were varied, and included farming, fishing, tailoring, carpentry, motor repair, thatching houses, selling
         clothes, and wood and producing charcoal and alcohol. A total of 113 respondents (42 per cent)
         claimed they returned to their pre-conflict form of employment.

         In both surveys, the number of respondents who had applied for a micro-credit loan was very low (31
         respondents 4 per cent in the Community Survey and 7 respondents, 3 per cent in the XC Survey). It
         is worth investigating other means of gaining financial capital.




20   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
Economics in Summary

Those surveyed were generally optimistic about their future economic situations and most
were unwilling to leave their homes in search of jobs elsewhere in South Sudan. There is a
high frequency of households going hungry ‘often’, which would suggest that the economic
situation at present is not as positive.

The integration of returning XCs who have learned trade skills into these communities brings
into question what this integration will involve in terms of affecting the communities and
labour markets on the macroeconomic and microeconomic levels. On the micro level, how
will this integration impact individuals and individual setting up companies? On the macro
level, how will this impact overall employment rates? If XCs and others are not relying on
micro-credit loans for capital to start businesses, then it is worth investigating other means of
gaining capital.



3.4 Cooperatives


From the Community Baseline Survey

QD1: Have you heard of any economic cooperatives operating in your local area?

QD2: To what extent do you feel that you are familiar with the type of work that economic
cooperatives do, and how they are organized?

QD3: Are you currently a member of an economic cooperative?

QD4: What type of economic cooperative is this?

QD5: Were you a member of an economic cooperative previously?

QD6: What type of economic cooperative was this?

QD7: Why did you stop being a member of the economic cooperative?

QD8: Do you feel that through your membership of an economic cooperative your household
benefited economically a lot, a little, or not at all?




Have you heard of any economic cooperatives operating in your local area? Are you
currently a member? Previously? Why did you stop being a member?

458 (57 per cent) respondents claimed to have heard of economic cooperatives operating in
their local area, and 286 respondents (35 per cent) felt that they were familiar with the type
of activities undertaken by these cooperatives. A total of 178 respondents (22 per cent)
asserted they were previously part of a cooperative, compared to only 64 (8 per cent) who

                                                                                 DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    21
        responded they were currently members. When asked why the respondent ceased their
        membership, 48 per cent claimed a ‘lack of capital,’ as seen in Figure 10.




        Figure 10: Reasons for leaving cooperatives




        Case Study of a Self-Started Cooperative
        There was one notable example of a self-started cooperative in the rural site of Lakes state in which
        five widowed women began an agricultural cooperative. They grew vegetables, groundnuts and
        cowpeas using traditional tools. They had been introduced to the concept from an Indian neighbour
        who they had observed. The women did not know that this was a cooperative, per se.




        Interpreting Findings on Cooperatives
        The concept of a cooperative was lost on many interviewees despite considerable efforts by the
        enumerators to explain the principle. The enumerators reported that this concept is quite foreign to
        most communities, especially those in the rural areas. Occasionally the Dinka word “akut” or “meetcin”
        (literally meaning “join hands”) was used to describe these arrangements, and perhaps this word can
        be used for future surveys. In addition, it was reported that some of the cooperative questions mislead
        respondents into thinking that they were going to be invited to join a cooperative or lent money as a
        result of their participation. This may be because participants are used to needs assessments taking
        place in communities that are followed by some project.

Comparison with the XC Survey: Cooperatives
Only 3 of the respondents in the XC survey (1 per cent) claimed to currently be a member of an
economic cooperative, compared to 64 respondents (8 per cent) in the Community Survey. Since the
XCs were involved in the military in recent years, it is understandable that they were less likely to
have had a chance to participate in a cooperative.

6 individuals in the XC survey further specified that they were/ had been involved in Sanduk. A total of
84 respondents (69 per cent) maintained that they would be interested in working in a cooperative,
although caution is generally required with such questions given that the extent to which this is likely
to translate into reality is debatable.




Did your household benefit economically from your membership in an economic
cooperative?

As indicated in Figure 11, amongst those who are current/ former members of economic
cooperatives, 99 (41 per cent) claimed that their household ‘benefited a lot economically’ as
a result of this membership, with 125 respondents (52 per cent) maintaining that they
‘benefited a little economically’ and 15 respondents (6 per cent) asserting that they ‘did not
benefit economically’.

         Cooperatives in Summary

         There has been an obvious decline in community member involvement in economic
         cooperatives given the data listed above, which could largely be attributed to a lack of
         capital. Reintegration support activities should be delivered in partnership with local
         organisations and ministries such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Cooperatives and
         Rural Development in order to build capacity and enhance service delivery. Cooperatives
         can enhance socioeconomic development with their effect on reducing poverty and
         increasing employment opportunities.2

From the Community Baseline Survey

QE1: What kind of social groups or committees are you aware of in your community?

QE2: Which of these are you a member of? (Women, youth, religious, veterans, community, sports,
other)

QE3: Of your friends, how many are ex-combatants? By that I mean how many are former members
of the SPLA, police, wildlife forces, fire brigade, prison services, and other armed groups?

QE4: If you encounter an economic problem, whom would you first turn to for help?

employees in the SPLA, government employees in the police service?




Which kind of social group or committee are you a member of?

A total of 668 respondents (82 per cent) maintained that they belonged to at least one social
group. As demonstrated in Figure 12, the most common types were religious (299
respondents or 37 per cent), for women (212 respondents or 26 per cent), youth (137
respondents or 17 per cent) and community (152 respondents or 19 per cent). Specific
groups that were listed in ‘other’ included Akonbuoi women, education, student association,
Women’s BRAC (micro-loan sharing scheme) and dance. 681 respondents (84 per cent)
claimed to be aware of at least one type of social group or committee in their community.




                                                                                                             Final Report - Annex C
                                                                                    DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    25
          Figure 12: Membership of social groups and committees




          Of your friends, how many are ex-combatants?

          Approximately half of the respondents (399 individuals, 49 per cent) claimed that none of
          their friends were XCs (this was specified as being former members of the SPLA, police,
          wildlife forces, fire brigade, prison services and other armed groups). Figure 13 shows that
          this response was less common in Bagari and Mapel. Excluding Bagari and Mapel, Kuajok
          had the highest number of respondents who claimed that ‘none’ of their friends are XCs (83
          individuals, 72 per cent), followed by Dong Mabior (75 individuals, 65 per cent), Matangai
          (67 individuals, 58 per cent), Ayuang (65 individuals, 56 per cent) and Akuach (58
          individuals, 50 per cent).


         Interpreting Findings on Friendships with XC
         Bagari and Mapel have many more XCs than the other selected field sites. The selected boma in the
         latter was located in close proximity to the military barracks, thus this seems to be the most likely
         explanation for the findings on friendship with XC.

         The data on friends who are XCs should be taken with a degree of caution, as it was noted from the
         field that the definition of friendship varied depending on the translation. Furthermore, the notion of
         friendship is most often interpreted in South Sudan as a serious bond for life. When asked how many
         of their friends are XCs, respondents might consider fellow XCs as coworkers or colleagues rather
         than friends.

Comparisons with the XC Survey: Social Capital
6 per cent in the XC survey maintained they belonged to one social group focussed upon sports,
games, dancing, cultural activities and so on, compared to 83 per cent who were part of at least one
social group in the community survey. Since XCs have likely been living in the barracks and outside of
a typical community, it is expected that they had less exposure to social groups than the average
civilian living in a typical community.

From the XC Survey, large proportions of respondents maintained their friends were mostly of the
same age (133 individuals, 49 per cent) and gender (160 individuals, 59 per cent), and only a minority
claimed that they were mostly also ex-combatants (73 individuals, 27 per cent). This percentage was
lower in the Community Survey—14 per cent of respondents (117 individuals) reported that ‘most’ of
their friends are XCs.




If you encounter an economic problem, whom would you first turn to for help?

A majority of respondents (425 respondent, 52 per cent) claimed that if they encountered
economic problems they would turn to family for help, followed by friends (13 per cent),
Sanduk (3 per cent), community leaders (2 per cent) and religious institutions (2 per cent).
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they would seek assistance from a micro-lending
institution or a cooperative.

         Interpreting Findings on Sources of Assistance during Times of Need
         Family is a strong cultural concept among most communities in South Sudan. Specifically in Dinka
         culture, proverbs or parables abound about the importance of cultural and familial ties. This cultural
         norm explains why most would go to their family for financial help before turning to friends or another
         institution.




         Extent of trust

         Most respondents reported to trust various categories of people, including 294 respondents
         (49 per cent) claimed to have ‘lots of trust’ in ‘government employees in the SPLA’ and 365
         respondents (45 per cent) regarding ‘government employees in the police service.’ Figure 14
         demonstrates these findings.

         There were widespread variations in levels of trust in categories of people between female
         and male respondents. Females had less trust overall. For instance, Figure 15 demonstrates
         discrepancies between male and female respondents and having ‘lots of trust’ in categories
         of people. It is not surprising that the highest percentage of trust for males was in ‘men who
         are your age mates’ (66 per cent, 175 respondents) and likewise for women ‘women who
         are your age mates’ (56 per cent, 304 respondents. The percentages of ‘lots of trust’ differed
         in regards to community elders (48 per cent for females, 61 per cent for males), people you
         work with (44 per cent for females, 63 per cent for males), teenagers (24 per cent for
         females, 38 per cent for males), government employees in the SPLA (41 per cent for
         females, 63 per cent for males) and government employees in the police service (37 per
         cent for females, 60 per cent for males).

          If you disagreed with what everyone else in your area agreed on, would you express
          your opinion in public?

          A total of 479 respondents (59 per cent) claimed ‘mostly yes’ that they would express their
          opinion in public if they disagreed with what everyone else in their area agreed on compared
          to only 126 respondents (16 per cent) who claimed ‘mostly no’ to this question. There was
          no significant variation with this response in females versus males, but there was variation
          amongst the seven boma where it seems that respondents in Ayuang felt significantly less
          comfortable expressing their opinions in public; 32 per cent (37 respondents), answered
          ‘mostly yes’ to this question versus the other six boma where on average, respondents
          answered in this way over 63 per cent of the time.



          Social Capital in Summary

          It is important to note that financial support in South Sudan is often linked to social capital. In
          this regard, understanding XCs from this perspective may help anticipate potential problems
          XCs may face in obtaining funds needed to start businesses and weather difficult financial
          periods. The concept of family within communities in South Sudan is extremely important,
          and the data show that within the XC community and the community as a whole, social
          groups/ committees are commonplace. This raises the issue of XCs returning to
          communities that might have developed different social structures and brings into question
          how they will cope with this.

          From the Community Baseline Survey

          F1: To what extent do you feel that you have the power to make important decisions that can change
          the course of your life?

          F2: In the past year, how often have you joined other people to express concerns to government
          officials or local leaders on issues benefiting the community?

          F3: To what extent do you think that local government and local leaders take into account concerns
          voiced by your community when they make decisions that affect you?




30   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
To what extent do you feel that you have the power to make important decisions that
can change the course of your life?

527 respondents (65 per cent) felt to ‘a large extent’ that they had the power to make
important decisions that could change the course of their lives. This varied only slightly
between males (72 per cent, 191 respondents and females (72 per cent, 336 respondents)
and respondents were slightly more confident about their ability to make these decisions
amongst urban locations (319 individuals, 69 per cent) versus rural (208 individuals, 60 per
cent). This confidence was the highest in Bagari (95 per cent, 112 individuals), followed by
the other six boma that answered in this way between 48 and 74 per cent of the time, the
lowest of which was Dong Mabior (56 respondents).

In the past year, how often have you joined other people to express concerns to
government officials or local leaders on issues benefiting the community?

When asked how often in the past year they have joined other people to express concerns
to government officials or local leaders on issues benefitting the community, the majority (72
per cent) answered ‘never.’

A total of 57 respondents (7 per cent) claimed to have joined other people more than five
times in the past year, 95 (12 per cent) had participated in such activities between 2 and 5
times and a further 58 (7 per cent) had undertaken such acts once.

To what extent do you think that local government and local leaders take into account
concerns voiced by your community when they make decisions that affect you?

Furthermore, as indicated in Figure 16, many respondents (40 per cent) claimed ‘not at all’
when asked if they think local government/ leaders take into account concerns voiced by
their community. Figure 17 represents this question by boma, whereby in Akuach 63 per
cent (72 individuals) responded ‘not at all’, 25 per cent (29 individuals) in Ayuang, 44 per
cent (52 individuals) in Bagari, 23 per cent (26 individuals) in Dong Mabior, 44 per cent (50
individuals) in Kuajok, 41 per cent (48 individuals) in Mapel and 42 per cent (48 individuals)
in Matangai.


Comparisons with the XC Survey: Empowerment
In the XC and the Community Surveys, the majority of respondents (65 per cent in both instances) felt
that they had the power to make important decisions that could change the course of their lives. A
total of 10 per cent from the XC Survey had joined others on five or more occasions to express their
concerns about community issues to official or local leaders over the past year, and 34 per cent
believed that officials and local leaders take such voiced concerned into account ‘a lot’, with a further
48 per cent claiming that they did so ‘a little.’




                                                                                                                Final Report - Annex C

Empowerment in Summary

Overall, the data show that to a large extent the community members felt empowered to
make important decisions and voice their opinion even if it disagreed with the rest of the
community, yet there was an obvious discrepancy with how this would play out publically. A
majority felt that local leaders and government did not take concerns voiced by the
community into account, but there seemed to be little movement in the way of individuals
grouping together to express issues benefitting the community.



3.7 Security


From the Community Baseline Survey

QG1: How safe do you feel now in the area where you live?

QG2: If you and someone else in the area you live were to have a serious argument, would you be
able to resolve the problem without resorting to physical violence?

QG3: Do you think that having ex-combatants living in a community makes it safer, makes no
difference to safety, or makes the community less safe?

                                                                                 DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    33
          How safe do you feel now in the area where you live?

          A total of 612 respondents (76 per cent) claimed to feel ‘very safe’ in the areas in which they
          lived, compared to 27 respondents (3 per cent) who felt ‘very unsafe.’ As is demonstrated in
          Figure 18, perceived insecurity was higher in Akuach, Matangai and Ayuang than in the
          other four boma.


          Comparisons with the XC Survey: Security
          81 per cent of the respondents in the XC survey claimed to feel safe in their areas of residence, and
          76 per cent answered similarly in the community survey. 90 per cent of those from the XC survey
          claimed that they would be able to resolve serious arguments with other local residents without
          resorting to the use of violence, compared to 96 per cent in the community survey. 74 per cent of
          respondents in the XC survey asserted that violence would never occur between ex-combatants and
          civilians on the basis of differences between these groups.



          Interpreting Findings on Perceived Safety
          As noted in the enumeration site descriptions, Akuach and Matangai bomas are located in an area of
          Lakes state that has faced recent periods of fighting and insecurity between Dinka clans. This may
          explain why civilians feel less secure. Enumerators could not explain why people felt this way in
          Ayuang as it is reported to be a very peaceful area.

          XCs in particular are somewhat less likely to feel they can resolve conflicts without violence, yet the
          findings from the XC Survey and the Community Survey suggest significant goodwill and a desire to
          promote peaceful conflict mitigation.




          If you and someone else in the area you live were to have a serious argument, would
          you be able to resolve the problem without resorting to physical violence?

          The vast majority of respondents (776 individuals, 96 per cent) claimed that if they had a
          serious argument with someone else in their area they would be able to resolve the problem
          without resorting to physical violence.


          Interpreting Findings on Perceived Safety
          The question on whether respondents are likely to resort to violence if they became involved in serious
          arguments (QG2) is particularly susceptible to Social Desirability Bias, delivering results that may
          partly reflect the desire of respondents to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed favourably.
          This may be particularly true in an area like Bagari, where tribal relations are volatile. In reality many of
          the families interviewed are likely to have taken part in the violent conflict between the Balanda and the
          Dinka nine months prior. It is possible that more reliable responses may be achieved through
          depersonalising the question through removing the term ‘you’ and referring instead to the likelihood
          that ‘community members’ will resort to violence.




34   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
Do you think that having XCs living in a community makes it safer, makes no
difference to safety, or makes the community less safe?

A total of 362 respondents (45 per cent) asserted that the presence of XCs in a community
makes no difference to local safety, followed by 302 respondents (37 per cent) who
maintained that they make the community ‘safer.’ Figure 19 shows this broken down by
boma where respondents felt the least safe about XCs in Akuach (26 individuals, 23 per
cent), followed by Matangai (17 individuals, 15 per cent), Kuajok (10 individuals, 9 per cent),
Ayuang (9 individuals, 8 per cent), Dong Mabior (4 individuals, 4 per cent), Bagari (3
individuals, 3 per cent) and Mapel (1 respondent, zero per cent). This had no significant
variation between genders.




Figure 19: Perceived safety as a result of ex-combatants by boma




Security in Summary

In general, community members felt secure in their locations. Insecurity in Akuach and
Matangai was relatively higher, which could be the result of recent bouts of fighting between
Dinka clans in these boma. This type of data will be important to monitor in the future as this
will prove a good indication of reintegration of XCs and communities feeling safe.

              Interpreting Findings on Ex-Combatants (1)
              President Salva Kiir was present in Rumbek on the first day of the survey. He addressed people about
              the upcoming DDR Programs in all ten states and urged the entire nation to support the reintegration
              of XCs in their communities. This may have influenced some of the responses to questions on XCs. It
              was reported that almost all people from Rumbek and the surrounding areas attended or heard about
              the President’s speech, and so this message may have spread quickly and have been fresh in the
              minds of respondents during the survey. Likewise, other states observed and heard similar messages
              from the President in the week following the DDR pilot graduation, which coincided with the survey
              process.

              From the Field: Urban Site – Kuajok town, Kuaj Payam
              The urban community surveyed was well aware of DDR because of their close proximity to the state
              commission office. The state NDDRC office informed the team that 735 XCs have been registered for
              reintegration and that the group have been provided with training skills in agriculture, animal
              husbandry, auto mechanics, electrical plumbing and masonry.

              From the Field: Rural Site – Mapel Boma
              The area has a mixture of tribes due to the nearby military influence, with Dinka represented in the
              highest number. Many of the residents were employed by the SPLA, with a relatively high number of
              XCs (approximately 61) within the community. As Mapel is a predominantly military area, there are
              many more training and employment opportunities for XCs than in other areas.




36   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
How many XCs have returned to this community in the past two years?

302 respondents (37 per cent) claimed that in the past two years there have been no XCs
returning to their communities, compared to 99 respondents (12 per cent) asserting that
there had been ‘many.’ Figure 20 demonstrates that there is substantial variance between
boma, with respondents from Bagari and Mapel far more likely to claim that ‘many’ or ‘a few’
had returned.




Figure 20: Ex-combatants returned to the community by boma




How accepting have people in your community been of XCs when they return?

Excluding the ‘don’t know’ and ‘no response’ options, Figure 21 shows that the
overwhelming majority of respondents (591 respondents or 73 per cent) claimed that
community members have been ‘very’ or ‘somewhat accepting’ of returning XC in all
locations. This varied little between urban and rural sites and between genders.




                                                                                                       Final Report - Annex C

         Figure 21: Acceptance of ex-combatants by boma


         Interpreting Findings on Ex-Combatants (2)
         Enumerators and supervisors reported that there is a common sense among communities that SPLA
         XCs are war heroes who led the country to independence. They report that people feel that XCs fought
         the war, helped people gain freedom and that they are to be honored and appreciated. In Lakes state,
         certain community members expressed that the XCs can provide added protection from the
         government or from other conflicting parties. Many XCs are seen as people who can bring something
         with them to their communities—knowledge, skills, information from the rest of their country and the
         know-how to fight and protect themselves and others.




         Do you think that XCs find it harder, same or easier than other people of the same age
         to get a job? Why?

         When asked how difficult it is for XC to find employment compared to others of the same
         age, 224 individuals (28 per cent) asserted that it was ‘easier’ and 213 (26 per cent)
         maintained it was ‘harder’. Among those claiming the latter, the most common explanation
         was a lack of education or training. There was a slight variation between urban and rural
         sites; 29 per cent (136 individuals) in urban sites maintained that XCs find it ‘harder’ than
         other people of the same age to get a job versus 22 per cent (77 individuals) in rural sites.




38   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
Interpreting Findings on Ex-Combatant Employment Prospects (1)
Enumerators noted that some respondents felt XCs would have an easier time obtaining employment
as they were considered to be ‘liberators,’ as they had developed skills through the DDR programme,
and as they were more ‘civilised’ having spent time outside of their home village. Some thought they
would find jobs in the government since they were connected to the state through the SPLA.
Alternatively, some felt that they would have a harder time finding work as the skills they learned in
vocational training (welding, carpentry) may not be overly applicable to the available opportunities.




Do you feel that most people in this community treat XCs with more respect, the same
amount of respect, or less respect than other people of similar age?

A total of 439 respondents (54 per cent) maintained that most people in their community
treat XC with the same amount of respect as other people of similar age, with 300 (37 per
cent) claiming ‘more respect.’ A total of 772 (95 per cent) asserted that they support the
DDR programme. 752 (93 per cent) claimed that they think most people in their community
support vocational training as part of the program. A total of 618 respondents (72 per cent)
maintained that community members were not jealous of XCs because of the training/
reintegration assistance and salary.


Interpreting Findings on Ex-Combatant Employment Prospects (2)
The supervisors and enumerators reported that the question on XC employment prospects upset a
number of respondents, as it was interpreted that XCs may obtain jobs before civilians. Employment is
a cause of heightened concern and it was expressed that people may have been more concerned after
the survey that XCs may return to the areas on this basis.




Do you feel that some community members are scared of XCs?

When asked if certain community members are scared of XCs, the majority of respondents
(618 individuals, 81 per cent) answered ‘no.’ A higher percentage of men (87 per cent, 230
respondents) answered ‘no’ to this question than women (78 per cent, 423 respondents) and
this question varied across the seven sites; for instance, the highest percentage of those
answering ‘no’ to this question occurred in Bagari (114 respondents, 97 per cent), followed
by Mapel (108 respondents, 93 per cent), Ayuang (98 respondents, 84 per cent), Dong
Mabior (91 respondents, 79 per cent), Kuajok (97 respondents, 84 per cent), Akuach (81
respondents, 70 per cent) and Matangai (64 respondents, 56 per cent). Findings between
genders within each boma were similar to the overall findings on gender relating to this
question.

        How often is there violent conflict in the area you live between ex-combatants and
        civilians?

        763 respondents (94 per cent) claimed that there is ‘never’ violent conflict between XCs and
        civilians in the area they live, and this varied little by location, as demonstrated in Figure 22.

        104 respondents (13 per cent) claimed that they were current/ former member of the armed
        forces. 102 of these individuals (98 per cent) reported that they have not gone through a
        formal DDR process. The most common group that these individuals belonged to was the
        SPLA (54 per cent), followed by the police (24 per cent) and SAF (11 per cent). A total of 43
        of the 104 individuals (41 per cent) reported that they had told others they were currently/
        formerly in the armed forces, and only 4 (9 per cent) claimed that they subsequently
        regretted this act.

Comparison with the XC Survey: Ex-combatants
87 per cent of respondents in the XC survey claimed that families would welcome them once they
returned from the Transitional Facility. Furthermore, a total of 86 per cent claimed that communities
would be ‘totally’ accepting of them once they return, and 73 per cent responded similarly in the
community survey.

36 per cent (98 individuals) of respondents from the XC survey maintained that it was more difficult
for XC to obtain employment, compared to 26 per cent (213 individuals) in the community survey.
Amongst those replying in the affirmative to this question, the most common explanation was a lack of
education or training in both surveys.



Ex-combatants in summary

Community members on the whole have been accepting of returning XCs and a common
perception observed in the field was that the XCs were often treated with respect and
appreciation. Overwhelmingly respondents agreed that members of the community are not
scared of the XCs.

Most felt that it was not harder for XCs to gain employment and this differed slightly from
those results found in the XC Survey, which might suggest inconsistent between community
perceptions and what is actually happening.

           4. Conclusion
           This community survey, the parallel XC survey, and the respective tracers for these studies
           are undertaken to (a) understand the demographic characteristics, livelihood aspirations and
           social capital profiles of XCs and community members, (b) document the impacts of
           livelihood activities on ex-combatants and their communities, and (c) provide broader level
           information to NDDRC for use in documenting programme impacts in a post-pilot phase, and
           methods for improving programming, by adjusting livelihood and capacity building products
           and services. While the latter two objectives will be met through the tracer studies, this
           specific community study directly contributes to the understanding of community members.

           While the themes covered in this survey were wide-ranging, key findings included:

           XCs and DDR:

                 • Overall, the respondents were very supportive of XCs, with 95 per cent (772 individuals)
                    asserting that they support the DDR programme.
                 • A total of 54 per cent (439 respondents) maintained that most people in their community
                    treat XCs with the same amount of respect as other people of a similar age. Whilst this
                    may promote integration, it may also result in tensions if XCs feel their service should
                    allow them greater respect within their communities.

           Community context:

                 • The XCs are returning to communities in which 76 per cent (612 respondents) claimed
                    to feel ‘very safe’ in the areas in which they lived, compared to 3 per cent (27
                    respondents) who felt ‘very unsafe.’
                 • 43 per cent (345 respondents) maintained that they owned livestock, but 7 per cent (53
                    respondents) said that their household ‘always’ goes hungry, with 51 per cent (414
                    respondents) asserting that this ‘often’ occurs.
                 • These are communities that have a sense of agency; 65 per cent (527 respondents) felt
                    to ‘a large extent’ that they had the power to make important decisions that could
                    change the course of their lives. This could mean that communities can and will take an
                    active role in reintegration.
                 • Many respondents (40 per cent) chose ‘not at all’ when asked if they think government
                    and local leaders take into account concerns voiced by the community in regards to
                    decisions that affect them.




42   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
Security:

  • 49 per cent (294 respondents) maintained ‘lots of trust’ in ‘government employees in the
   SPLA’ and ‘government employees in the police service’ (365 respondents or 45 per
   cent), which may speak to the positive sentiment expressed around XCs more broadly.
  • 96 per cent (776 respondents) maintained that if they had a serious argument with
   someone else living in their area they would be able to resolve the problem without
   resorting to physical violence.
  • A total of 612 respondents (76 per cent) claimed to feel ‘very safe’ in the areas in which
   they lived, compared to 27 respondents (3 per cent) who felt ‘very unsafe.’

                                                                             DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    43
           Annex A: Methodology
           1. Instrument Design

           The instrument was adapted from an earlier version used in the XC survey, with advice on
           changes being sought from the NDDRC, World Bank and ASI. The themes of the instrument
           covered:

                       • General demographics (including martial status and education)
                       • Livelihoods
                       • Economics
                       • Cooperatives
                       • Social capital
                       • Empowerment
                       • Security
                       • Ex-combatants

           The piloting of the instrument was done on the second day of the enumerator training with
           some staff of the Wau UN community. Additional edits were then made, taking into
           consideration feedback from the enumerators and the additional contextual knowledge
           garnered during the training. It is worth mentioning however, that because of the challenges
           with the instrument that occurred in the XC Survey, the team discussed the questions
           carefully in advance of the training with the NDDRC team and made continued adjustments
           based on the recommendations provided during meetings. In total, 811 community
           participants were surveyed within the timeframe.



           2. Technology

           Integrity worked with a professional programmer to digitalise the survey to be uploaded on
           Samsung Galaxy tablets running FormHub on ODK, which had the following benefits:

                       • Minimise the costs associated with administering surveys (saves on printing costs
                          and minimises time);

                       • Minimise data entry errors;

                       • Upload data in real time (if internet is available) and compile in Excel for analysis.

           Very few issues were reported from the use of the tablets. Some cons included time spent
           programming the instrument, internet connectivity, battery power and the possibility of theft
           or damage but individuals were able to work through these issues.




44   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
Enumerators were encouraged to take photographs with the tablets at their discretion and
survey teams reported no technical issues with the tablets in the field. Supervisors uploaded
on the weekends at the state offices of the NDDRC with special permission from the
officials. In lieu of internet access, supervisors also reported their data collection numbers
via SMS to the field coordinator in Wau and senior survey supervisor in Juba.



3. Training

The senior survey supervisor led the training of 12 ICRS caseworkers and four survey
supervisors over three days in Wau. The field survey coordinator assisted in the training of
the technology. The enumerators had executed the prior XC Survey and thus had been
briefed about the research and were therefore familiar with the objectives and type of
questions. Moreover, the ICRS team has been involved in similar studies and was well
equipped to undertake data collection for this project.

The training was highly interactive and hands-on, while also encouraging team building
between the state survey teams and supervisors. The enumerators were encouraged to ask
questions, seek clarifications, challenge certain survey questions and discuss cultural
attitudes that may have positive or negative effects on the survey procedure. Integrity
allowed for ample feedback throughout the training, and day three provided additional time
allotted to the specific needs and gaps of individual enumerators.



4. Sample Planning

Northern Bahr el Ghazal only one urban site was surveyed due to the low number of XCs
returning to this state. The state offices of the NDDRC selected the payams in which the
research was undertaken purposefully with assistance from the relevant ASI state mentors
and the national commission in Juba. The criteria for selection were based on the number of
XCs anticipated returning to those locations.


The Sampling Approach and Implications for the Findings

It is necessary to note that the selected EAs are not intended to be representative of the four states.
Representativeness would require the selection of considerably more EAs per state, far beyond the
resource constraints of this project. The approach adopted for this research meets the project
objectives through treating the selected EAs as ‘case studies,’ with the intention being to monitoring
the extent to which findings change in each of these seven locations over time.




                                                                                                                 Final Report - Annex C
                                                                                        DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    45
          Within each of the EAs, all households were mapped and numbered using chalk with the
          permission of the homeowners. 115 households were then chosen at random in each EA
          using a specifically designed tool that selects these as a function of the total number listed in
          these locations. The respondent within each household was randomly selected from those
          above the age of eighteen years, using a Kish Grid approach.3 If the selected respondent
          was not available during the first visit, the enumerators were instructed to return on one
          further designated occasion. If the respondent was still unavailable, the enumerators would
          proceed to the household to the right of the originally chosen home (double-checking that
          this was not a pre-selected household), using it as a substitute. The target numbers were
          achieved within the given time period, with enumerators averaging seven interviews per day.

          There were a total of 811 respondents—545 females and 266 males, ranging in age from 18
          to 90 with an average age of 33. 465 respondents were surveyed in urban sites and 346 in
          rural sites, and respondents were evenly distributed across the seven boma (115 in Akuach,
          117 in Ayuang, 118 in Bagari, 115 in Dong Mabior, 115 in Kuajok, 116 in Mapel and 115
          Matangai.). See Annex E for more demographic information about the respondents.



         Kish Grids and Gender Bias in the Sample

         As is indicated in Annex A, there was a notable bias towards females (545) over males (266) within the
         sample. Kish Grids are commonly deemed to be the ‘weakest link’ in household surveys in
         environments such as South Sudan due to their complexity, leading to failures in the selection process
         at the doorstep. Nevertheless, Kish Grids are routinely used as they represent the best available
         approach. However, such failures typically result in samples that are biased towards males as head-of-
         households often assume responsibility for representing their families irrespective of whether or not
         they were selected though the Kish Grid.

         Indeed, in our judgement the Kish Grids worked as intended during the course of this research (with
         Matangai boma being a partial exception, as is discussed below, due to the issues relating to the
         disarmament campaign), and the bias towards females came about due primarily to there being a
         substantially greater female population in the field sites. While this trend occurs in many parts of the
         country, specific drivers of gender imbalance in the field locations included:

              • Warrap – Many of the residents were living as migrants for schooling and work from other states,
              notably Northern Bahr el Ghazal. Because it was the harvest season, many men had travelled back
              to their home villages in other locations to work in the fields for one to two months. In addition, due to
              extreme flooding, many men were absent with their cattle, having been forced to move to higher
              ground.

              • Northern Bahr el Ghazal – It was reported that the men had either gone to Juba seeking work or
              were in the cattle camps for extended periods of time.



          3
            Kish Grids are applied as the standard technique through which to randomly select respondents within
          households. This process usually involves using a pre-designed tool to select a respondent as a function of (a)
          the number of household members (18+) and (b) the questionnaire sheet number. However, as this survey relied
          upon tablets (i.e. rather than paper questionnaires that can be easily numbered) the approach was adapted so
          that the household number established during the mapping phase replaced the sheet number.




46   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
 • Western Bahr el Ghazal – A number of men had lost their lives in the recent tribal conflict, and
 others had picked up arms and were hiding or fighting in the bush, as reported by the enumerators.

While there is a degree of ambiguity, in most of these instances the males are absent for sufficiently
long periods of time, so they do not qualify as household members using standard definitions relating
to sleeping/ eating within the selected locations. In any case, the implications of this gender imbalance
for the findings are limited as this bias was relatively consistent between locations, with the exception
of Ayuang where there were actually marginally more men (62 males compared to 54 females), thus
not undermining the ability to draw comparative conclusions across these sites. More importantly,
however, the gender of the respondent had only a trivial impact upon the responses given to the vast
majority of questions, or, put another way, males and females tended to respond in a very similar
manner, and thus the bias likely had only a minimal impact on the results.




5. Sensitisation

Due to the sensitive nature of DDR and the diversity of communities where implementation
was planned, a process of explanation and introductions is a necessary stage for the survey.
This is referred to as ‘sensitisation.’ Household surveys can be quite intrusive, therefore
gaining support from community members, appropriate officials and local leaders is essential
to have access in the communities. Likewise, in areas where conflict and tension are
present, the survey teams require a certain level of security and access that is best
facilitated by local law enforcement or tribal leaders.

Community sensitisation was a key component of survey preparation and implementation,
and this issue was discussed in detail during the training. Awareness raising and
introductions were conducted on many levels, from the state offices of the NDDRC to the
local chiefs. Sensitisation often included the explanation of the survey and its purpose in
gathering the opinions of community members about XCs in regards to:

        •      How are XCs received in the community;
        •      Relationship and integration into the community;
        •      Livelihoods;
        •      Their contribution to community development.

There is a possibility that sensitisation could have created a bias among respondents. If
community members feel as though the interview is highly important, as communicated by
their elders and leaders, they might tend to give more of a tailored or expected response,
usually on the positive side. A possible way to mitigate this in the future is for leaders to
explain to communities that it is essential that we garner honest responses, which will be
kept confidential, as these will lead to improvements in the DDR processes. Annex B
discusses the specific sensitisation processes that occurred in each of the seven sites.




                                                                                                               Final Report - Annex C
                                                                                      DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    47
          6. Implementation

          Some teams had to go through the local government, while others relied on tribal authorities.
          The team in Kuajok was required to gain the cooperation of local law enforcement to allow
          for their passage into the EA. Introduction letters from the NDDRC and the accompaniment
          of personnel from the state offices of the NDDRC played a crucial role in teams gaining
          access to the communities.

          Once support was gained from the appropriate individuals, teams reported that they were
          mostly well received by community members who were eager to participate, and indeed
          most community members wanted to be interviewed. There seemed to be no objections to
          their homes being numbered with chalk during the mapping period. Survey teams were
          required to explain the procedure and purpose of random selection. Sometimes community
          members complained that their households were skipped during the interviews and blamed
          local authorities for discrimination. This required intervention from the supervisors and
          leaders to explain the professional methodology. Occasionally, community members were
          confused on what they should expect as a result of the survey, such as future projects or
          assistance, and the enumerators had to explain that no direct project would result from their
          participation or the answers gathered, but rather that the responses would potentially help
          improve the DDR processes.


          Quality Assurance in the Field

          With the objective of ensuring rigour, during the fieldwork the supervisors were responsible for:

          • Monitoring: 10 per cent of the interviews were monitored by the field supervisors in their entirety.

          • Back-checking: 15 per cent of interviews were ‘back-checked’ within 24 hours, a process involving
          the supervisor returning to the household to ensure that the answers were recorded correctly.

          • Examination of responses: All survey entries were examined shortly after interview completion by
          the supervisors to check for similar answers, unexpected responses and other potential anomalies.



          All survey teams faced the daunting task of traveling house to house during the rainy
          season. This was a challenge during the sensitisation, mapping and surveying procedures.
          Rain erased many of the chalk number markings on the homes, making the task additionally
          difficult. Some urban boma were more rural in character even though they were located in
          the urban state capital. The layout of the boma determined the distance enumerators walked
          between homes and the environment they had to travel within. There were many reports of
          torrential rains, extreme mud, stagnant water and difficult walks. The teams required
          gumboots and plastic sleeve covers for their tablets and papers and occasionally had to




48   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
pause work during heavy rains so as not to expose the participants or their survey
equipment to the water.

Enumerators approached the homes and conducted the formal introductions and gained
consent to proceed with the selection and interviews. Occasionally, participants asked for
something in return for their time and cooperation. Enumerators attempted to manage
expectations from the beginning and used practiced techniques to avoid this type of
reaction. It was reported by team members in Aweil that they were so welcomed into the
homes that many offered them drinking water. In the rural Warrap site, the boma was so
enthusiastic towards the arrival of the team that the offered a goat to roast upon completion
of the survey exercise.

           Annex B: Field Locations & Processes
           1. Lakes State

           1.1 Urban Site – Rumbek town, Akuach Boma

           The urban enumeration site was the settlements along Rumbek Wulu road around the area
           of the Rumbek State Assembly, 500 metres from Rumbek market centre south, in a boma
           known as Akuach. The people are mostly Dinka and the mother tongue was used
           predominately during the surveys, with occasional use of Arabic. The area was typically
           urban, simplifying the mapping and survey process.

           For sensitisation the teams met with the state office of the NDDRC, the director of CID,
           payam director, local chiefs and payam security personnel. President Salva Kiir had visited
           Rumbek the day of the survey start. He spoke to the people about peaceful DDR and
           encouraged their participation in reintegration efforts. This may have affected the survey
           findings, as people were very willing to take part and responded very positively about their
           perceptions of XCs.

           1.2 Rural Site – Matangai Boma

           The rural enumeration area was in the village settlements along Rumbek Cueibet, Wau
           road, 11km north of Rumbek town, in a boma called Matangai. Dinka is the dominant tribe in
           the area, with all surveys conducted in the native language. There was a recent intra-ethnic
           conflict in Matangai between two Dinka clans, the people from Cueibet and those from
           Rumbek. Many people were killed last year in these clashes and though much of the fighting
           has stopped, the situation remains tense and there is a sense of distrust.

           A unique phenomenon emerged in this area caused by the current controversial state
           politics in Lakes. Some of the controversial policies of the governor of Lakes state have
           included a civic disarmament initiative where citizens are being stripped of weapons by local
           authorities. Upon hearing that a team connected with the DDR processes was to be arriving
           in the village, many of the men fled to nearby hiding places, thinking that our team was
           coming to take away these arms. These men hid in the bush nearby or within their homes.
           The enumerators often observed this behaviour but had difficulty convincing these men or
           their families that they were not there to disarm them.

           Sensitisation was conducted with the payam director, local chiefs and payam security. A
           meeting was also held with the director of CID upon his request to learn more about the
           survey process.

2. Northern Bahr el Ghazal State

2.1 Urban Site – Aweil town, Ayuang Boma

Only one site was chosen in Northern Bahr el Ghazal, due to the comparatively low numbers
of XCs reintegrating in the state. The urban site was located in Aweil town, in the western
part of the city, in a boma called Ayuang. Ayuang is the largest boma in the town, situated
near Aweil TV, bordering Malou Aweer in the northwest, Zirah in the northeast and Mathiang
in the south. The tribal makeup is dominantly Dinka, with interviews being conducted in the
native language and Arabic. The area is peaceful, the teams were warmly received, and
there was no pushback from officials or community members.

Sensitisation took place with the staff of the state NDDRC offices, the town mayor, the
payam administrator and deputy. The team felt pressure to provide a minimal stipend to the
officials to compensate for their time and efforts. The deputy payam administrator assisted
with the mapping and sensitisation of the community members. Other surveys and
assessments had been implemented in the area prior and community members were
curious as to whether a project would follow.



3. Warrap State

3.1 Urban Site – Kuajok town, Kuaj Payam

The urban enumeration site located in western Kuajok town was in the Kuaj North payam in
two areas called Gumel and Majak-Amal. The community is located near the Ministry of
Information, Police station on new Khartoum Road and St. Bakita Primary School and
Church. In the midst of the rainy season, Kuajok town was experiencing heavy flooding
which created access and logistical problems for the teams. Due to stagnant water,
mosquitos and bushy grasses and trees, movement was slow.

The sensitisation process began with the state NDDRC office, the payam local authority and
the Mayen Gumel policemen. The Warrap Police Commissioner used an existing
communication system in the town to inform the law enforcement agencies in the area that
the survey team would be working and to provide necessary support.

3.2 Rural Site – Dong Mabior Boma

The chosen rural enumeration site was located in Yithliet Village of Gogrial West County
along the Wau-Kuajok Road, in a boma called Dong Mabior. The team had difficulties
marking the homes during the mapping due to constant rains and flooding.




                                                                                                    Final Report - Annex C
                                                                           DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    51
          Sensitisation was conducted with the payam administrator who assigned one community
          member to move with the team during the mapping and data collection process.



          4. Western Bahr el Ghazal State

          4.1 Urban Site – Wau town, Bagari Boma

          The original chosen site was deemed inaccessible after the first attempt at mapping.
          Stagnant water, sparse population and households between 200-300 metres apart created
          obstacles that would have prevented the team from accomplishing their targets in the
          designated timeline. The replacement urban site was located in Ngomba B village in Bagari
          boma. The area was swampy with thick forests, vast pieces of unutilised land and other
          lands cultivating groundnuts. Roads were inaccessible due to heavy rains and residents
          waded through stagnant water without shoes carrying their bicycles. Charcoal burning was
          reported as one of the main income generating activities for men and teenagers in the area.

          The Balanda tribe dominates the area. A community leader accompanied each of the
          enumerators during the initial period to eliminate suspicion from the residents who may have
          had concerns relating to recent insecurity. The chiefs took responsibility for marking homes
          that were uninhabited at the time of the initial visit. The community leaders required lunch
          and water to be purchased for them daily. A majority of the residents were women and
          children due to a high number of male casualties during a tribal war between the Balanda
          and Dinka last December and tensions remain high. The three Dinka enumerators were met
          with a degree of suspicion on occasions, and the team required the intervention of the
          community leaders to ease the concerns of the community members. Overall, the
          participants were willing to be interviewed, especially the women and older men who felt that
          participating would lead to positive change for the community.

          Sensitisation was conducted with the state NDDRC office, the state National Bureau of
          Statistics, and with county chiefs and other community leaders.

          4.2 Rural Site – Mapel Boma

          The original rural site chosen by the state NDDRC office was deemed unfit because of a
          small population and a long distance between houses, which would have staggered
          fieldwork. In consultation with the NDDRC, Mapel was chosen as a suitable substitution.
          Mapel is located 75km or a 2.5-hour drive from Wau town and borders Mapel SPLA training
          college and armed forces barracks. Due to the location of the SPLA facility, responses from
          this area may have a unique perspective on the DDR process and XCs.




52   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
Sensitisation was conducted with the Mapel payam administrator, the village chief and two
assistant chiefs who cautioned against trespassing through the military barracks. They also
warned the team about the frequent drunk and armed soldiers in the village and ensured
that an official was present for the mapping exercise.




                                                                                                    Final Report - Annex C
                                                                           DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    53
           Annex C: Limitations of the Survey
           All survey data must be treated with caution, as certain interviewees may be tempted to
           provide false or misleading responses. In particular, Social Desirability Bias, the tendency of
           respondents to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed favourably by others, is a
           repeated and somewhat unavoidable concern.4 In addition, as is discussed in more detail in
           the analysis section of this report, some informants viewed research team members as
           potential gatekeepers of material support and thus may have misrepresented their personal
           circumstances. Community leaders should be encouraged to promote honest feedback in
           future iterations of the survey to help in addressing Social Desirability Bias.

           As noted in Annex D: Recommendations, with quantitative data alone, it is difficult to gain
           nuanced information. This can be achieved by applying a mixed methods approach involving
           qualitative and quantitative research.

Annex D: Survey Recommendations
One of the objectives of the study was to propose recommendations for future phases of this
research.   While   a   key   objective    of   this   research   is   to   identify   programmatic
recommendations (i.e. that relate directly to DDR), these will only really be possible during
later waves of research that are able to identify impacts of the programme and the general
reintegration processes. Thus, the recommendations relate only to methodology, sampling,
instrument design and research implementation. We suggest future surveys implanted by
the NDDRC consult these recommendations in the planning stages.



1. Methodology

Quantitative data of this nature is specifically not designed to collect nuanced information
that could be hugely beneficial to a research programme of this nature to add a certain
'colour' only achievable through qualitative research. Integrity is a strong advocate of mixed
methods approaches and recommends that future studies should be supplemented by
interviews and focus group discussion in order to provide additional detail in the findings.

In particular, qualitative research can:

   • Add nuance to the survey data
   • Provide hypotheses that may explain certain findings

We believe that both of these aims can be better achieved in the future through
incorporating mixed methods into the research programme, including in particular focus
group discussions and informant interviews. Interviews and focus groups provide a far more
suitable means through which to generate the detail provided by open questions.



2. Sampling

• Kish Grids: There was a bias in the sample towards females. While this may be partly
attributable to issues with the Kish Grids (in particular in the case of Matangai, as previously
discussed), for the most part this occurred because females were numerically dominant in
the field sites. There may be a temptation to revise the methods at the doorstep in light of
the limited number of males within the sample, but we argue against this measure as:

   1. This would undermine the representativeness of the sample (i.e. there ought to be
       more females in the sample).




                                                                                                            Final Report - Annex C
                                                                                   DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    55
                  2. Changes in the methods would undermine the extent to which rigorous comparisons
                         will be possible with subsequent waves of data.

                  3. The impact of the numerical superiority of women in the sample is seemingly minimal
                         in that the responses to most questions were not dependent to any great extent upon
                         gender.

          The ongoing use of the Kish Grid technique is recommended to provide consistency in
          methods so that future comparative analysis is possible.



          3. Instrument Design

          • Open Questions: Open questions within quantitative surveys are time-consuming to
          administer (requiring the enumerators to record longer answers across large samples) and
          analyse (requiring the complex process of post-coding). They also provide inconsistent value
          in that considerable nuanced information is inevitably lost between the interview and the
          delivery of the final results, and in many cases it proves impossible to meaningfully post-
          code the data provided. However, this is certainly not to suggest that open questions are
          without value, and we feel that good balance was struck in this instrument. More broadly,
          however, it is suggested that qualitative research should accompany quantitative surveys as
          interviews and focus groups provide a far more suitable means through which to generate
          the detail provided by open questions. These qualitative methods would be used in addition
          to the quantitative surveys administered with limited open-ended questions.

          • Skip Patterns: Given repeated evidence in the data of skip instructions failing to work,
          ensure the instruments are correctly programmed by allowing more time for the pilot and
          making minor changes to the tool prior to conducting data collection in the communities.

          • Explaining Concepts: Enumerators felt that many questions lacked a gentle introduction
          to the concept prior to the questioning. This was applicable in particular to the concept of
          cooperatives, which was generally poorly understood.

          • Sensitive Phrasing: This was especially true of the questions surrounding poverty, where
          it may have been construed as impolite in Dinka culture to forwardly ask questions on this
          theme. Therefore, in future surveys, additional time may needed with the enumerators
          translating and back translating questions and certain specific concepts so that they feel
          comfortable addressing these topics in a culturally-sensitive.




56   SECTION III: Adam Smith International - Consultancy to Implement Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation
From the Community Baseline Survey: Recommendations

QH2: Amendment: The current question on community acceptance of XC (QH2) is somewhat
undermined through implicitly assuming that XC had returned to each of the boma. In future iterations
of this research QH2 should be preceded by an additional question specifically asking if XC had
returned, and then a ‘skip’ instruction can be introduced into the instrument so that those responding
in the negative will not be asked about how they are accepted. As it is phrased the current preceding
question cannot serve this function as it asks about returnees specifically within ‘the past two years.’




4. Survey Implementation

• Transport: Relying on UN flights can be problematic. It is necessary to have a window of
flexibility for supervisors and enumerators traveling to the states. Road transport should be
planned for as a backup when feasible and safe.

• Rainy Season: The rainy season should be considered when planning such surveys as
adverse weather can make it difficult to move between homes and towns. Additionally, men
may be gone to their home lands during the harvest or seeking higher grounds for their
cattle or in cattle camps. January would be an ideal time for this research.

• Sensitisation: Ample time should be allowed for the sensitisation process with appropriate
authorities (i.e. local government, law enforcement, tribal authorities, chiefs, etc.), and time
should also be allowed for the necessary procedures to collect letters and authorisation.

• Mapping: Ample time should be allocated for the mapping process, considering the natural
obstacles that often exist. More broadly, the environmental challenges of selected EA should
be considered in advance, e.g. teams trekking from households may need gum boots and
equipment to protect their material. Occasionally, teams requested motorcycles to go from
home to home when they were particularly far apart.

• ID Badges: The enumerators should have ID badges that are worn at all times and carry
introduction letters to present during sensitisation or to authorities.

• Research Team Composition: The dominant language of the EA should be a key
consideration in the makeup of the research team. Not all respondents speak Arabic or
Dinka, and the presence of team members from certain ethnic groups can cause issues in
certain locations (see the profile on Bagari in Annex B, section 4.1).

• Technological Considerations: Internet is difficult to find in most states. Backup USB
modems can be used with some reliability. Likewise, electricity is unpredictable so backup
batteries and extension cords can be used to charge multiple tablets with one power outlet.

                                                                                       DDR Pilot Reintegration Project in South Sudan    57
          • Pre-Prepared Scripts: A process should be established for managing expectations within
          households visited. Specifically, this will help prepare members of the research team to
          better explain that this survey is not going to be followed by specific projects aimed to assist
          the communities in which the research took place.
