Foreword
Hydropower has a well-established role in the energy sector and support for further development of this
energy resource is very important, especially in developing countries. Hydropower is a vital renewable
energy resource and for many countries it is the only renewable energy that has the potential to expand
access to electricity to large populations. Yet it remains underdeveloped in many countries, especially in
Africa, where less than 10 percent of hydropower potential has been tapped.

Executive Summary
Worldwide, hydropower is a crucial power supply option for several reasons. First, it is a renewable

energy resource that can contribute to sustainable development by generating local, typically inexpensive
power. Second, hydropower reduces reliance on imported fuels that carry the risks of price volatility,
supply uncertainty and foreign currency requirements. Third, hydro systems can offer multiple co-benefits
including water storage for drinking and irrigation, drought-preparedness, flood control protection,
aquaculture and recreational opportunities, among others. Finally, hydro can allow more renewables—
especially wind and solar—to be added to the system by providing rapid-response power when intermittent
sources are off-line, and pumped energy storage when such sources are generating excess power.

This chapter describes transformations that occur when the energy stored in water is harvested; it
provides a short historical review of how hydropower technology has evolved; it discusses the future
of hydropower; it lists factors that might inhibit hydropower development.

3.1 Energy conversion: from water to power                           Figure 3-1: The water cycle
Hydropower is considered a renewable form of energy because
it is based on solar energy that drives the hydrologic cycle (see
Figure 3-1). The hydrologic cycle refers to the following process:
the sun heats water (about 97 percent from oceans); water
evaporates; rising air currents transport water vapour to the
upper atmosphere where lower temperatures condense vapour
into clouds. Air currents move the clouds around the globe and
eventually, water falls as precipitation. Through this process,
water can reach altitudes higher than sea level.
      Gravity causes water to descend from higher elevations
creating opportunities to harness water energy—gravitational
energy from falling water and kinetic energy from flowing water.
The amount of kinetic energy available from water flow depends
on the height from which the water drops, the angle of the slope,
and the volume of water per unit of time, i.e., the discharge.
      The energy of flowing water is harnessed by turbines, which
                                                                     Source: United States Geological Survey

Each hydropower plant is custom-designed, a one-off project that aims to achieve optimal power
plant flow conditions. Consequently, each plant is precisely designed and constructed to respond to
its surrounding topography, existing hydrological regime, prevailing environmental and social (E&S)
constraints, and existing infrastructure, among other boundary conditions.

the amount of time required for that size of particle to settle                    Figure 4‑16: Typical tunnel cross section
within the sand trap boundaries. This requires an estimate of
the deposition velocity of a particle of a given diameter and
the transfer velocity, which is assumed to be equal to the flow
velocity. The determination of the deposition velocity is based on
approaches that are reported in the technical literature.
     Sand trap cost is largely determined by the volume of
concrete required to build it; therefore the main parameters are
particle size to be eliminated and the design discharge of the HPP
scheme, which determine sand trap size and cost.
     The sediment that settles in the sand trap is removed by
opening a flushing gate so the water flow can transport the
sediment back to the river.
     A sand trap is usually omitted in large storage schemes
because in reservoirs sediment may have time to settle, depending
on water volume. In run-of-river projects most sediment remains
in the water flow up to the turbines, making a sand trap essential

    Flow velocity should be higher than 1.0 m/s to avoid
sediment deposition if no sand trap is installed upstream;
omission of a sand trap may reduce conveyance capacity.
However, channel flow velocity should be less than 1.5 m/s to
avoid head losses and damage to the canal structure. To prevent
water level fluctuations and consequent overtopping of the
banks, a freeboard (vertical distance between the designed water
surface and the top of the canal wall or bank) must be included
in canal dimensions. Minimum freeboard for lined canals is
about 10 cm, and for unlined canals, about one-third of designed
water depth with a minimum of 15 cm.

      Another common classification of hydro turbines is based
on their principle of operation—impulse or reaction type—that
describes how the turbine transforms potential water energy into
rotational mechanical energy.
      The rotor of the reaction turbine is fully immersed in
water and is enclosed in a pressure casing. The runner blades
are profiled so that pressure differences across them impose
lift forces, just as on aircraft wings, which cause the runner to
rotate. Two main types of reaction turbine are the propeller
(with Kaplan variant) and Francis turbines.
      In contrast, an impulse turbine runner operates in air, driven
by a jet (or jets) of water. Three main types of impulse turbine       Source: Verband der Elektrotechnik (VDE)

are in use: the Pelton, the Turgo, and the Crossflow.

          The Crossflow turbine or Banki-Michell turbine has a

                                                                           Germany)
     ‘slats’ joining the two disks. Water flows transversely through the
     turbine, entering at the edge and emerging on the opposite side
     thereby generating additional energy.
     Reaction turbines
     Reaction turbines use the water flow to generate hydrodynamic
     lift forces that propel the runner blades. Reaction turbines have
     a runner that always functions within a completely water-filled
     casing.
           Reaction turbines have a diffuser known as a ‘draft tube’
     below the runner through which the water discharges. The draft
     tube decelerates the water discharge and reduces static pressure
     below the runner, thereby increasing effective head.
           The propeller turbine (Figure 4‑21) is an axial-flow turbine
     with a propeller-like runner and three to six runner blades,
     depending on designed head. The runner operates like a reverse
     boat propeller. Various configurations of propeller turbines exist;

          Adjustable guide vanes can vary the flow admitted to the
     runner. The Kaplan turbine is a type of propeller turbine with
     adjustable runner blades as well. The mechanical equipment
     for adjusting turbine blades and guide vanes increases costs but
     improves efficiency over a wide range of flows. Double regulation
     of turbines is a feature now widely used for river installations
     with significant flow variations during an average year.

potential energy generation depends mainly on available flow and hydraulic head provided by topography.
The amount and characteristics of water discharge at a potential HPP site are evaluated using hydrological
analysis (see Section 7.1). Results from the hydrological analysis, topographical data, and efficiencies of
various HPP structures are used to quantify potential energy generation (see Section 7.2).

7.1.1 The catchment area
The catchment area (also referred to as drainage basin or
watershed) is the surface of the earth that is occupied by a
drainage system, consisting of a surface stream or a body of
impounded surface water together with all tributary surface
streams and bodies of impounded surface water (Figure 7-1).
    The catchment area is an important parameter to identify
the available discharge at a specific location. Available flow, its
characteristics, and head are important parameters to determine
HPP potential energy output.
    Typically, the water authority can provide measured
discharge data for primary rivers and streams. Discharge data are
unavailable for secondary rivers, since the discharge at a future
intake location is not directly measured.

     determined using this method, the value is compared to the MQ
     at the next gauging station and the correlation is determined,
     then historical hydrological data can be transposed to the intake.

     depends on (a) the accuracy of data used to prepare the function;

size, location, and characteristics according to how they are covered in the national legal framework. For
example, Kazakhstan’s regulations governing grid connection have shorter deadlines for projects below
5 MW; in Serbia, procedural distinctions exist based on project size because balancing responsibilities
differ according to plant capacity (< or > 5 MW). In Montenegro and Macedonia, procedures are shorter
for smaller projects because the developer obtains construction permits from the municipality, not the
ministry [Merle-Beral 2015].

In all countries, HPP authorization requires multiple permits,                regional development or the ministry of natural resources (land/

                                         Grid connection agreement (for on-grid projects). Legislation in many countries stipulates a mandatory
                                         interconnection of RE plants to the national grid; grid companies are legally obliged to develop preferential/
                                         simplified/standardized procedures for connecting RE plants. These procedures may be described in the grid

                                         Power purchase agreement (PPA). PPAs with renewable energy plants often include special conditions, such as
                                         mandatory off-take, take-or-pay conditions, or guaranteed dispatch/deemed generation clauses.

                                         of privileged producers (to become eligible for support) when the development process ends, after having
                                         obtained the plant operation permit; however, they may get a preliminary status of privileged producer earlier,
                                         usually with construction permit.

                                         Procedures to prove compliance with local content requirements (if applicable). Several countries make local
                                         content requirements a condition for granting public support. However, the absence of clear rules on how local
                                         content is calculated, reported, monitored and verified, creates substantial uncertainty for investors and can
                                         jeopardize the whole support system and deter projects. For example, in Ukraine, local content requirement
                                         stipulated in primary legislation could not be applied for a long time because implementing regulations had not

                                         Certification for equipment used. e.g., in Brazil, all technology used for construction of RE plants requires
                                         certification from the Brazilian INMETRO (Instituto Nacional de Metrologia, Qualidade e Tecnologia). This

     	   The Equator Principles obligate signatory financial institutions to implement a
         set of principles in their internal environmental and social policies, procedures
         and standards for financing of projects. This means that the signatories
         will refuse financing to projects. This means that the signatories will refuse
         financing to projects that do not respect these principles.
         Concerning the environmental standards under which a project shall be
         planned and implemented according to an Environmental Assessment, as

     Deterioration of Water Quality

     Damming rivers can reduce water quality due to lower                  Water pollution control measures (such as sewage treatment plants or

Fish and Other Aquatic Life

Hydroelectric projects often have major effects on fish and             Managed water releases may be needed for the survival of certain fish species

(and fisheries) by increasing the area of available aquatic             trap-and-truck operations) aim to help migratory fish move upriver past a dam
habitat. However, the net impacts are often negative because            but are usually of limited effectiveness due to the difficulty of ensuring safe

Loss of Cultural Property

Cultural property, including archaeological, historical,                Structures and objects of cultural interest should be salvaged wherever feasible

Greenhouse Gases

Greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane) are released              Greenhouse gas releases from reservoirs can be reduced with a thorough salvage
into the atmosphere from reservoirs that flood forests and other        of commercial timber and fuel wood. However, this rarely happens due to (a)

Greenhouse gases are widely considered to be the main cause

reservoirs flood relatively little forest or other biomass.
Moreover, most such hydro projects generate sufficient
electricity to more than offset the greenhouse gases that would
otherwise have been produced by burning fossil fuels (natural
gas, fuel oil, or coal) in power plants. However, some projects
that flood extensive forest areas, such as the Balbina Dam in
Amazonian Brazil, appear to emit greenhouse gases in greater
amounts than would be produced by burning natural gas for
many years of comparable electricity generation.

oriented protocols for HPP developments.
     Hydropower projects have an impact on climate change, and
are impacted by climate change, as summarized in Box 12-2.
     Many existing HPP technologies are mature and well
understood, and ongoing developments can ensure continuous
improvement of future HPP developments that will incorporate
such innovations as integrated river basin management,
resource-efficient tunneling, silt erosion resistant materials,
and increasingly fish-friendly turbines [Kumar et al.]. Despite
improved technologies, future HPP projects will continue
to require a rigorous and cost-effective approach to identify
and manage E&S impacts throughout the project cycle, using
verifiable means.

Capital and O&M Costs
Assessing the financial viability of a hydropower project requires estimates of capital costs (CAPEX) and
operating and maintenance costs (OPEX), plus estimates of the energy yield and associated tariff (see
                                                                                                                                  13
also Section 14.1.2 below). Since this initial assessment helps the developer or investor decide whether to
proceed with the project, detailed and precise information on cost structure and cost level for individual
plant items provides a better basis for the decision.

     Table 13-8 shows that the LCOE of the HPPs analyzed have
a comparatively wide range. The lowest value is 1.6 cent/kWh
and the highest 8.3 cent/kWh, a factor of more than five between
lowest and highest. The lowest value of 1.6 cent/kWh is for the
largest plant with a total installed capacity of 1,200 MW, fully
demonstrating economies of scale. However, economies of scale
are generally not applicable, as the second lowest LCOE value
is found for a small plant with an installed capacity of only
15 MW. The highest LCOE is observed for an HPP of similar
size to the second lowest. The LCOE of these two plants vary by
a factor of >3.
     Average LCOE is 5.4 cents/kWh and the median is 6 cents/
kWh. The mean 50 percent of the LCOE is in a narrow range
from 4.2 cents/kWh to 7 cents/kWh. However, the range for the
mean 75 percent is considerably wider between 2.9 cents/kWh to
7.5 cents/kWh, demonstrating the great variety among plants in
average generation costs.

     [
          This example will describe the derivation of the LCOE for a hydropower project, using the following variables as inputs:
          •	 Annual power generation: 342 GWh per year
          •	 Installed capacity: 66 MW
          •	 Investment costs (CAPEX): US$165 million
          •	 O&M costs: 1.2 percent of CAPEX per annum
          •	 Construction period: 4 years with equal cost disbursement
          •	 Lifespan: 60 years

          On the basis of the table above the net present value regarding total costs (CAPEX+OPEX) can be calculated with a discount rate of 10 percent according to the
          following:
                          64
                              Total costs t
          NPVCosts = ∑                   t
                                            = 144.32 m$ 	  
                          t =1 (1 + 10%)

          Similarly the net present value for the electricity generation can be calculated according to the equation below:

                          64
                             Generation t
          NPVGen . = ∑                   t
                                           = 2328.23 GWh
                         t =1 (1 + 10 %)


          Once net present values have been derived, the levelized unit costs or long run marginal costs can be derived:

                                  NPVcos ts
          LUC = LRMC =                      = 0.06 *100 = 6$cent / kWh

      15.2 Financing options                                                          Figure 15-1: Project vs. corporate finance

      This section discusses financing options for hydropower projects.
      15.2.1 Project vs. corporate finance
           Corporate finance. A lending institution offers financing
      to corporations that will implement the hydro project and
      assume responsibility for debt servicing—interest and capital
      repayments. The lender focuses on the corporation’s ability to
      service the interest and repay or refinance the debt.
           Project finance. The focus is hydro project bankability
      because the project, or the project-company will rely on project-
      generated cash flow alone to cover lender obligations. Under
      this scheme, project assets may serve as collateral to reduce
      lender risk. For example, sales agreement proceeds (off-take
      agreements), or shares pledged in the project company or that
      project physical assets could become the property of the lender in
      case of repayment default.
           Figure 15‑1 highlights key differences between project and
      corporate finance.
           The key advantage of project finance is that it limits investor
      exposure to the project assets and safeguards their other assets.
      The opposite is also true; if project investors go bankrupt, the
      project company is not affected.
           A corporate finance scheme could be beneficial if a project
      has small capital requirements and high financial viability,
      despite the difficulty of estimating cash flows.
      15.2.2 Key Players
      Figure 15‑2 presents the key stakeholders in HPP project finance.
          The cast of players varies depending on HPP complexity, but
      usually includes the following:
          •	 Sponsors or SPV shareholders. A Special Purpose Vehicle
             (SPV) is established by the investors. The majority
             shareholder is usually the main sponsor who is running the
             project.

  The graph above shows that the longer the debt tenor, the closer the tariff will
  be to the levelized tariff. Therefore, hydropower investments should be seen
  as long-term investments and possibly long tenor debt should be sourced to
  keep tariffs at bay. The high tariffs that result from short tenor debt make hydro
  projects unattractive due to decreased economic viability.
