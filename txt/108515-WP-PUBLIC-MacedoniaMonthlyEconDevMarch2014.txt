0.4 percent in 2012, real GDP accelerated to 3.1
percent in 2013, driven by a buoyant construction         3

sector. Construction expanded by 32.7 percent (y-o-       2
y), contributing 1.8 percentage points to overall
                                                          1
growth. It was driven by an acceleration of private
and public investments, such as the “Skopje 2014”         0

project and the Corridor X highway. Industry, i.e.        -1
mining and manufacturing, grew by 4.9 percent (y-o-               Q1 2013         Q2 2013             Q3 2013          Q4 2013            2013

points to real GDP growth.

Construction      as    well as    transport   and
communication also contributed significantly –
about half - to employment growth. Agriculture was
a key driver of job creation, although contributing
little to real GDP growth, pointing to low labor
productivity in the sector.

The labor market continued to strengthen, but youth
unemployment is still very high. The unemployment
rate decreased from 31.0 percent in 2012 to 29.0
percent in 2013 according to the Labor Force Survey
of the State Statistical Office. Youth unemployment
declined from 54.0 percent in 2012 to 51.9 percent in
                                                          60%                            Unemployment rate
2013, but is still among the highest in Europe. The
female labor force particpation rate increased from       50%

44.0 percent in 2012 to 45.9 percent in 2013 and the      40%
female employment rate climbed from 30.7 in 2012
                                                          30%
to 32.8 in 2013. Unemployment fell            among
individuals with secondary education (which               20%

represent almost half of the labor force), but            10%
increased among those with primary education or less       0%
and for those with university degrees.                               2008         2009         2010             2011         2012            2013
