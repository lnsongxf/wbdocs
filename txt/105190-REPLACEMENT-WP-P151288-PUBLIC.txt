Executive Summary
i.	     The Government of Uzbekistan (GoU) has recently adopted a policy to mechanize the cotton
        harvest as part of its drive to modernize the agricultural sector. Under Uzbekistan’s state-order
        system it is compulsory for many farmers to grow cotton. They are contractually obligated to produce
        stipulated quantities that are annually set by the government, and must sell these to the GoU at a
        price fixed by the government. Almost all cotton in Uzbekistan is harvested by hand, even though
        mechanization existed during the Soviet period. An estimated 2.2–3 million people were involved in
        at least some aspect of the cotton harvest during 2014. While cotton harvest mechanization might
        reduce the need for state-mobilized labor for manual cotton picking, it is unclear what impact it may
        have on those for whom the cash earned from picking cotton is an important part of their livelihood.

ii.	    This report presents the findings of a social impact assessment on cotton harvest mechanization.
        The study aimed to (i) to assess the ex ante social impact of the policy to mechanize cotton harvesting
        on cotton pickers and vulnerable private farmers; and (ii) to identify ways to mitigate the policy’s
        potential negative impacts on these groups and to make these reforms more acceptable to them.
        The assessment is based on the collection and analysis of qualitative data and two background
        studies. Data were gathered in four regions that vary in terms of labor scarcity, area of land under
        cotton, cotton production conditions, and experience with mechanization.

iii.	   Findings suggest that daily earnings from cotton picking are above rural daily wage rates for
        women only when they pick cotton on high-yielding farms (with more than 2.5 tons of raw cotton
        per ha), and in particular during the first and second passes. On these farms and during these early
        passes, picking productivity is high, as many cotton bolls are open within a given area. Pickers are
        able to pick 100 kg of raw cotton per day and earn about US$10 per day.

iv.	    On the lower yielding farms—which are often more remote—it takes more time to pick a particular
        amount of cotton, and local pickers are less keen to work there. Farmers in charge of these lands
        have trouble finding local pickers. In an attempt to attract local pickers, farmers pay 35 to 65 percent
        more per kg of picked cotton than better-off farmers, but this is not enough to attract harvesting
        labor. They depend on people brought in by the state from outside the area to harvest their fields.
        These laborers tend to be civil servants or factory workers; they are reportedly unmotivated and
        not very productive. The third and fourth passes can be important for farmers to meet the state-
        mandated cotton production quota, also on the less remote and higher yielding farms.

v.	     Given that harvesting labor is scarcest on the more remote and low-yielding cotton farms, farmers
        who manage these plots would in principle be in most need of harvest mechanization. In addition,
        mechanization on these farms would reduce the need for state-mobilized harvesting labor. However,
        cotton cultivation on these plots tends to have low or even negative returns, and cotton would not
        necessarily become an attractive and profitable crop for them even if mechanization reduced their
        harvesting costs.

vi.	    Cotton picking has several advantages compared to other daily agricultural wage labor. Pickers
        are paid in cash and almost immediately after work is completed, usually every two to five days
        during the season. Farm labor, on the other hand, is typically paid in kind. According to women
        who participated in the study, the money earned from picking cotton is spent on livestock, school
        uniforms, books, other school equipment for children, weddings, winter preparations, and dowries.

vii.	   Cotton pickers across all sites believed that cotton harvest mechanization will negatively impact
        their livelihood. Respondents were worried that mechanization will negatively affect daily wages
        for other agricultural work. Female cotton pickers were particularly concerned. Alternative cash-
        earning opportunities outside the agricultural sector are very limited, especially for women. Young
        male study respondents (aged 20–25 years old) were more hopeful that mechanization might open
        up new job opportunities for them.

                                                      8
viii.	       Farmers in all four regions claimed that mechanization will offer important advantages in terms
             of managing the harvesting process and completing the harvest on time. They claimed it is easier
             to manage one machine and one driver than 100 cotton pickers. In areas where labor is scarcest,
             farmers viewed mechanization most positively. Even if machine harvesting reduces the quantity and
             quality of cotton harvested, the advantages would still outweigh the costs, farmers in these areas
             claimed.

ix.	         However, farmers expressed concern over both the quality of harvesting machines on the market
             and the current lack of knowledge about the new initiatives for cotton harvest mechanization.
             Farmers also claimed that not all their plots would be suitable for mechanized cotton harvesting.
             Farmers in Syrdaryo and Karakalpakstan suggested that cotton ginnery plants (CGPs) be in charge
             of managing the machines. Respondents suggested that training and seminars about mechanized
             farming be organized for farmers as well as hokimiyat officials, machine and tractor parks (MTPs),
             and CGPs.

x.	          Cotton pickers in all sites suggested that mechanization will allow schools and local hospitals to
             remain open during the cotton season. Government employees (teachers, doctors) and students
             will no longer need to pick cotton.

xi.	         In Fergana region, participants suggested that the government and banks offer special loans to
             local entrepreneurs who want to train people in certain skills and then employ them. Microloans
             for women to purchase livestock were also seen as an attractive way to cushion the negative social
             impact of mechanization. Cotton pickers and mahalla leaders suggested that existing social assistance
             programs would not be suitable to compensate vulnerable and other low-income households for
             the income lost from cotton picking.

xii.	        The study recommendations include a number of short-term measures to mitigate the negative
             social impacts of cotton harvest mechanization. We also propose a set of reform measures that
             would have an impact in the medium term.

xiii.	       Short-term measures include: (i) establishing a public works program that can provide alternative
             income-earning opportunities for rural women; and (ii) improving the accessibility of labor market
             management information systems—which provide information on labor demand, shortages,
             surpluses, fees, and wage rates across regions—and strengthening public employment centers.

xiv.	        Medium-term reform measures include: (i) liberalizing crop choice and allowing farmers who
             currently grow cotton in less suitable areas to switch to more remunerative farm activities1; (ii)
             adopting measures to further support farmers engaged in high value activities (such as horticultural
             or livestock production) that can create alternative income-earning opportunities for rural women;
             (iii) supporting smallholders (dehkans) to raise the productivity of their plots and enhance the quality
             and value of their harvests; and (iv) developing a support program that enables rural women to start
             and develop small businesses through access to microfinance, technical training, and child care.

xv.	         To ensure a smooth rollout of the mechanization process, different business models for cotton
             mechanization should be piloted to test the efficacy, impact, and alternative arrangements for
             ownership, leasing, and contract service provision. In addition, training courses should be organized
             to facilitate the emergence of contract service businesses and alert the banking community to the
             potential of this as a recurring business model.

Overview
Introduction
xvi.	     The Government of Uzbekistan (GoU) has recently adopted a policy to mechanize the cotton
          harvest. This policy is part of a broader government strategy to modernize the agricultural sector
          and reduce production costs. Mechanization also helps address the large seasonal peak in labor
          demand for manual cotton picking and reduce the need for state-mobilized labor. In the past, the
          latter has led to an outcry from nongovernmental organizations and calls to boycott cotton produced
          in Uzbekistan.

xvii.	    Mechanization of the cotton harvest might accelerate a further reduction in the demand for
          labor in rural areas, and it is unclear what impact it may have on the livelihoods of those who pick
          cotton. While mechanization may have positive economic and social effects, especially if combined
          with additional sector reform measures, it is possible that some households may suffer, as the cash
          earned from picking cotton is an important source of their seasonal and even annual cash income.
          In Uzbekistan, the majority of cotton pickers are women, and they may be the group that is most
          impacted by mechanization. Also, the extent of support for mechanization among farmers remains
          unclear. Despite the government decision to mechanize the cotton harvest, it cannot be assumed
          that this is an optimal solution for all farmers.

xviii.	   This report presents the findings of a social impact assessment on cotton harvest mechanization.
          The study has the following objectives: (i) to assess the ex ante and social impact of the policy to
          mechanize cotton harvesting in Uzbekistan on cotton pickers and vulnerable private farmers; and
          (ii) to identify ways to mitigate the policy’s potential negative impacts on these groups and to make
          these reforms more acceptable for them. More specifically, the assessment aims to:
          •	          prepare a socioeconomic profile of local rural population groups that currently pick cotton,
                      and of farmers engaged in cotton cultivation;
          •	          assess livelihood alternatives for female and male cotton pickers; and
          •	          gather cotton farmers’ views and concerns regarding the mechanization of cotton
                      harvesting, as well as their suggestions for how these concerns can be addressed.

          The report aims to provide recommendations that can help ensure that cotton harvest mechanization
          is undertaken in a socially responsible manner.

xix.	     The assessment is based on the collection and analysis of qualitative data and two background
          studies. Qualitative data were collected via 20 focus group discussions (FGDs), 20 in-depth
          interviews, and eight case studies. Eight focus groups were held with people who pick cotton and
          twelve were conducted with cotton farmers. The 20 in-depth interviews were carried out with local
          village leaders, local government representatives, and organizations involved in cotton harvesting,
          processing, and mechanization.

xx.	      Data were collected in four regions that varied in terms of labor scarcity, area of land under
          cotton, cotton production conditions, and experience with mechanization. The selected regions
          were Karakalpakstan, Jizzakh, Syrdaryo, and Fergana region. Separate focus groups were held
          with farmers that lived far from and close to population centers. Focus groups were also divided
          up between large and small farms and those with good and poor cotton production conditions.
          While the research approach enabled us to obtain useful and rich insights into the experiences and
          perspectives of cotton pickers and farmers on the topic at hand, the sampling of the research sites
          and respondent groups was done in a purposive manner and does not allow us to present findings
          that are statistically representative of all cotton pickers and farmers in the country. Two background
          studies were conducted. These included a review of international experiences with cotton harvest
          mechanization and an analysis of the rural labor market in Uzbekistan.


                                                       10
Background
xxi.	       Almost all cotton in Uzbekistan is harvested by hand, even though mechanization existed during
            the Soviet period. An estimated 2.2–3 million2 people were involved in at least some aspect of
            the cotton harvest during 2014. This represents about 7 percent to 10 percent of the country’s total
            population and about 14 percent to 20 percent of the work force. Total gross earnings by workers
            harvesting cotton were estimated to be between US$250–$300 million in 2014, depending on the
            exchange rate.3

xxii.	      Under the state-order system farmers often have no choice but to grow cotton. They are
            contractually obligated to produce stipulated quantities that are set annually by the government,
            and must sell these to the GoU at a price fixed by the government. The quota are based on ball
            bonitet, a score that reflects biophysical production conditions for cotton. Farmers who fail to meet
            the assigned quota may be unable to pay back their loans and could lose their land.

xxiii.	     The employment rate4 of those between 16 and 64 years old is relatively low compared to other
            transition countries. According to Ajwad et al. (2014), only 55 percent of that group was employed,
            meaning they had a job defined as having conducted paid work (in the formal or informal sector) in
            the two weeks prior to the survey, compared to 60 percent to 68 percent of other Eastern Europe
            and Central Asian economies. According to the same survey, 34 percent of those employed are
            self-employed. Entrepreneurship in Uzbekistan is dominated by microenterprises that operate in
            the services sector. About 70 percent of all self-employed individuals do not employ any additional
            workers. Economic policies in recent years have supported the growth of capital-intensive industries
            that have a positive impact on GDP and productivity of the national economy, but that generate
            relatively few new jobs. The female employment rate is particularly low (see Figure O.1).

Review of international experience
xxiv.	       The percentage of world cotton production harvested by machines was about 29 percent in 2013–
             2014 and has not changed over the past 15 years. All or nearly all of production was machine
             harvested in Australia, Brazil, Greece, Israel, South Africa, Spain, and the United States. In Argentina,
             Bulgaria, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, and Turkey, between 60 and 90 percent of production was
             harvested by machines. In China, 9 percent of total production in 2013–2014 was harvested by
             machine (up from 5 percent in 1998–1999).

xxv.	        There are many advantages to handpicking cotton—higher quality, higher yields, and less trash
             enters the harvested cotton. Handpicked fields can be harvested repeatedly when additional bolls
             mature, but only once or twice by machine when most of the bolls have matured. For a second
             or third picking, the cost of fuel and operator time tends to be greater than the value of cotton
             harvested.

xxvi.	       A review of international experiences6 suggests that every country that has adopted mechanical
             harvesting techniques did so primarily because of labor scarcity. When labor costs rise, mechanized
             harvesting becomes more economical. In Greece and Turkey, mechanization reduced the costs
             associated with harvesting as a share of total cotton production costs by about half. Additional
             reasons for mechanizing cotton harvesting have been to (i) reduce contamination7, particularly in
             Turkey; and (ii) shorten harvesting time.

xxvii.	      Introducing mechanical harvesting has always been a decades-long process. In Greece, this process
             took place very gradually over a 15-year period. In Turkey, it took 20 years.8 New varieties must
             be developed that have (i) a more limited plant width; (ii) bolls that form at least 15 centimeters
             above the ground to enable machinery access; (iii) reduced hairiness; and (iv) exhibit uniform plant
             maturity so that at least 80 percent of potential bolls are open and ready to be picked at the same
             time. Plant breeders indicate that at least eight years are needed to optimize local varieties for
             machine harvesting.

xxviii.	     The operating rate of harvesting machines is initially much lower. It is estimated that the operating
             rate for the first few years is only about 60 percent, because of the time spent maintaining and
             adjusting the machinery and moving between fields. As farmers and machine operators gain
             experience, the operating rate of the machines rise.9

xxix.	       Machine harvesting tends to reduce the labor associated with harvest operations by 80 to 90
             percent. Approximately 1.2 hours of labor per hectare are required with mechanical harvesting.
             Demand tends to increase for experienced machinery drivers and mechanics, and labor is still
             required to transport seed cotton to gins. Women tend to be disproportionately negatively
             affected by mechanization of harvest activities. Governments tend to encourage mechanization.
             As a result, little thought has been given to the impact of harvest mechanization on rural laborers.
             In Greece, Turkey, and Argentina, most rural workers displaced by the introduction of mechanical
             harvesting either found jobs in cities or returned to other available agricultural jobs. Men tried
             to find alternative seasonal agricultural employment, while women often returned to traditional
             household responsibilities. In Turkey, displaced workers shifted to other agricultural sectors and
             continued to migrate seasonally in search of employment



6. A review of international experiences with cotton harvest mechanization (Townsend, 2015).
7. Contamination is when nonplant material (jute, polypropylene from fertilizer bags, rocks, dirt, and headscarves and other clothing) inevitably gets
caught up in huge heaps of seed cotton as a result of millions of pairs of hands being involved.
8. A very strong recommendation derived from the experience in Turkey is that delegations of Uzbek farmers and ginners should be organized to visit
Turkey and Greece to observe mechanical harvesting and related operations.
9. Greek researchers and government officials with experience dating back to the 1980s emphasize the importance of training farmers and ginners on
how to adapt to machine picking. Experts in Greece interviewed for this study suggested that Uzbekistan embark on a robust program of seminars,
farm meetings, and ginner training sessions with experts from countries that already machine pick.

Findings
Cotton-harvesting practices in Uzbekistan

xxx.	        Study respondents report that cotton is normally picked in three passes. This is to make sure
             that only open bolls are picked and not left in the sun for too long. Also, harvesting should be
             completed before the first autumn rains, as wet cotton bolls quickly degrade in quality. The first
             pass starts when around 75 percent of cotton bolls are open. After around 10 days or so, more bolls
             are open and the second round of picking starts. The third round starts after another 10 days or
             more. Participants in our study stated that if bolls stay open in the field too long, their color might
             change and their fibers shrink. Usually, when a cotton-picking “brigade” has completed one pass for
             a farmer, it moves to another farm and returns later for the second pass on the first farmer’s fields.

xxxi.	       In each district, a cotton-picking committee (pahta shtab)10 is established to organize, coordinate,
             and monitor the process of picking cotton. Farmers submit requests for cotton pickers to the shtab.
             Mahalla offices start recruiting cotton pickers by taking down names and ID numbers of people in
             each village who want to participate. Contracts are signed. The mahalla offices submit these lists to
             the cotton shtab and then form brigades of pickers. Each brigade consists of 100–150 people and is
             appointed a leader (usually a representative of the mahalla), a weigh man (someone who weighs
             how much cotton each person picks), a nurse, and an accountant. The shtab drafts a schedule of
             when and for which farmers the brigade will pick cotton. The shtab is responsible for documenting
             the amount harvested and for solving conflicts between farmers and pickers.

xxxii.	      Local pickers said they are keen to harvest cotton during the first two passes, when open cotton
             bolls are plentiful and picking productivity is high. Toward the end of the season, however, when
             sometimes a third or even a fourth pass is conducted, their interest drops significantly. There is
             not much cotton left in the field at this point; instead of up to 100 kg a day, a worker can now pick
             only 10–20 kg per day. Because the fee per kilogram is set by the government and remains the same
             throughout the harvest, the amount a picker can earn in a day on average drops by more than five
             times, and the effort per kilogram of picked cotton increases. By this time, a significant number of
             local pickers leave their brigades and farmers and, according to study respondents, pahta shtabs
             have to rely on people that are brought in from urban population centers to pick the cotton.

                           “During the first picking mothers-in-law with daughters-in-law and toddlers come.
                           Everybody comes with the families. And during the second and the third picking nobody
                           comes.”
                                                                         —farmer, Bagdad District, Fergana region

                           “For the first pass, people pick up to 100 kg of cotton per day, but for the second picking
                           less than 50 kg per day, and for the third pass they pick 30 kg of cotton in a day. They pick
                           less and they earn much less money—about 5–6 thousand per day, people don’t want to
                           come for this money. … Therefore it is necessary to make the higher fees for the second
                           and third passes. For example, 200 Soum, 300 or 400 Soum per kg, then more people will
                           come for the third picking.”
                                                                             —farmer, Bagdad District, Fergana region

xxxiii.	     Farmers with cotton fields that are far from population points (50–120 km) claimed to have
             difficulty attracting villagers to pick cotton, also because their yields tend to be low. Instead they
             rely on poorly motivated pickers from outside the area, such as those brought in from urban areas
             by government organizations. Local pickers are the least motivated to pick cotton for this group
             of farmers (see below). These farmers were said to provide poor working conditions, with water,
             lunch, and work equipment insufficiently available for pickers. Secondly, the yields and the quality
             of cotton on these fields tend to be low, making it unattractive to local pickers.
10. According to the Federation of Trade Unions in Uzbekistan the authority of the pahta shtab is limited; a legal framework is in place to regulate labor
relations, protect workers, and solve labor conflicts.

                                                                           13
                     “There is a significant amount of land with low water availability. Because of that many
                    farmers were not able to meet the cotton production quota, had no profit, and were unable
                    to pay off their state loan.”
                                                                         —farmer, Pakhtakor District, Jizzakh

xxxiv.	    Pickers from outside the area are referred to as hasharchi. These are arranged by the shtab,
           which approaches different organizations in the district, other districts, or even other regions to
           ask them to bring cotton pickers to their area. These pickers were said to include government
           employees, factory workers, and students (older than 18). The shtab organizes these pickers into
           brigades, includes them in cotton-picking schedules, and helps arrange their accommodation and
           transportation.

xxxv.	     Farmers claimed that pickers who are brought from outside the area were less qualified, less
           experienced, and less keen to pick cotton than pickers from the local area.

                    “150 students picked only 900 kg per day in my field. That is 6 kg per person. And I was able
                    to get only Soum 400 per kg for it since it was fourth grade cotton.”
                             —farmer with fields far from population centers, Bagdad District, Fergana region

                    “Some hasharchi (government workers and students) have never seen cotton before and
                    are not keen to work hard. Local pickers are motivated to pick cotton because they are
                    interesting in getting income.”
                        —farmer with poor soil conditions, Pakhtakor District, Jizzakh, FGD with farmers with
                                                                                             poor soil quality

xxxvi.	    In many cases, those brought from outside to pick cotton were said to pay locals to conduct the
           task on their behalf.

                    “Conflicts happens only when hasharchi (people brought in from other areas) start enticing
                    local pickers that already work for certain farmers to pick cotton on their behalf. They pay
                    local pickers up to Soum 500 per kg of cotton. As a result local pickers leave farmers for
                    which they were picking cotton who then lose their brigades.”
                                                                           —farmer, Pakhtakor District, Jizzakh

xxxvii.	   Local government officials and leaders interviewed for our study estimated that between 14 and
           20 percent of the district population was involved in picking cotton in 2014. Of these, 70 percent
           to 85 percent were said to be from rural areas, and about one-third (Bayaut District, Syrdaryo)
           to four-fifths (Beruniy District, Karakalpakstan) of all pickers were from local communities. Local
           pickers are mostly female and typically between 20 and 40 years old.

Cotton-picking benefits and available alternatives

xxxviii.	 Participants in focus groups with local rural cotton pickers were asked what different wealth
          groups exist in their community and roughly what proportion of each group is involved in picking
          cotton. In all four regions, respondents claimed that three groups could be found in their area:

           •	       Wealthy households, comprising between 10 and 15 percent of the local population.
                    Typically, 20 percent to 50 percent of members from this group pick cotton, mostly to help
                    their relatives who are cotton farmers meet the state quota.
           •	       Middle-income households, about 70 percent to 80 percent of the rural population. This
                    includes government workers, teachers, doctors, dehkans who sometimes rent land from
                    farmers, and daily wage laborers in the agricultural and industrial sector. Most of these
                    households have members who pick cotton.
           •	       Vulnerable households (5 percent to 15 percent of the population). Many of these

                                                       14
                     have lost a breadwinner or have a household member with a disability. Fifty to eighty
                     percent have members who pick cotton. However, the total number of hours worked in
                     cotton fields tends to be lower for this group than for middle-income households. Some
                     households in this group have no members who can pick cotton due to old age or poor
                     health.

xxxix.	   During the beginning of the cotton harvest in September, agricultural day workers face competing
          demand for work on their own kitchen gardens, and cotton picking likely takes place at the
          expense of work on cotton pickers’ own fields (see Figure O.2). In particular, in Fergana region,
          labor demand for harvesting farmers’ horticultural crops is also high from July to September, which
          exacerbates labor shortages during that period. In Jizzakh, where farmers mostly grow wheat and
          cotton, the overall demand for agricultural laborers seems to drop in August; this makes local
          laborers available for part-time work picking cotton.

xl.	      Work opportunities outside the agricultural sector are very limited, especially for women.
          According to Ajwad et al. (2014), in 2012–2013 average wages in Uzbekistan (excluding Tashkent
          region) were around Soum 300,000–320,000 per month for women and Soum 500,000–600,000 for
          men, demonstrating substantial gender wage gaps.

xli.	     On average, one local picker was said to work on the cotton fields between 42 and 60 days per
          season. Most of these days (20–30) are typically spent picking cotton in September during the first
          pass, when cotton is easiest to pick and more can be picked in a day (and thus yield higher earnings).
          In October, during the second pass, there is less cotton in the field, and even less during the third
          (and sometimes fourth) pass. Local pickers report it is difficult to earn enough during these last
          picking rounds (see Table O.1). The last column of Table O.1 shows the average wage rate for rural
          Uzbekistan for work outside the cotton sector. As shown, only earnings during the first and second
          pass can compete with the rural wage rate.

xlii.	       Only during the first pass is income from cotton picking higher than the annual average daily wage
             rate for women. During the second pass they are similar (see Table O.1). Picking productivity after
             the first pass is lower, but the cotton-picking fee fixed by the state remains the same across all passes
             and all parts of the country (irrespective of labor scarcity). In 2014 cotton pickers were paid Soum
             217 per kg of raw cotton (US$0.72–0.86). To attract workers, farmers give pickers cooking oil as an
             additional bonus and motivation, provided pickers meet a daily quota. Pickers who participated in
             our focus groups claimed they received on average 14 to 28 liters of oil per season. The cooking
             oil bonus can add 10 percent to 18 percent to a cotton picker’s income. According to those who
             participated in our study, cotton pickers typically earn between Soum 600 and 1,500 per person per
             season, which is equivalent to US$200–600.

xliii.	      Focus groups with pickers suggested that the share of cotton-picking income in their total annual
             income tends to be higher for rural middle-income households (up to 20 or sometimes even 30
             percent) than for the most vulnerable in rural communities (around 10 percent). Rural middle-
             income households might have several members who pick cotton and who work the whole day
             (from 6 am to 4 pm) in the field; they are motivated to earn as much cash as possible. In contrast,
             vulnerable households often consist of pensioners or women with small children who can only work
             half a day, and, due to health issues, cannot pick much cotton.

xliv.	       Cotton picking has several advantages compared to other daily agricultural wage labor. Pickers
             are paid in cash and almost immediately after work is completed, usually every two to five days
             during the season. In contrast, permanent farm workers usually are paid in kind in the form of the
             harvest product (for example, wheat), or they might be given a piece of land on which to grow
             secondary crops. Even if a farmer pays workers in cash, they might be paid two to three months
             later, after the farmer has sold the harvest. Picking cotton enables workers, especially women, to
             significantly contribute to their household budget.




                                                                     16
xlv.	     Pickers said they spend the money earned from picking cotton on livestock, school uniforms,
          books, and other school equipment for children, weddings, winter preparations, and dowries.
          Rural middle-income households who participated in focus groups in Tashkent region regarded
          picking cotton as a good way to earn extra money without making others think they are in need of
          extra cash.

Types of cotton farmers and their harvesting costs

xlvi.	    Participants suggested that cotton farmers in the area can be divided into three groups: well-off
          farmers, middle-income farmers, and vulnerable cotton farmers.

          •	       Well-off farmers were said to comprise about 10 percent to 20 percent of all cotton
                   farmers in all five sites. These farmers are also referred to as “golden” farmers. The
                   main characteristic of this group is that the revenue earned from their farms exceeds the
                   expenses, and thus they manage to make a profit from cotton farming. Their farmland is
                   close to population points and has good-quality soil (ball bonitet is 60–65 points). Their
                   income is obtained from producing different types of crops; in addition to wheat and
                   cotton, they also grow horticultural crops and keep livestock. Their farm size varies from
                   80 ha to 100 ha. They tend to have high yields and produce up to 150 percent of their
                   state-mandated cotton production quota. Well-off farmers were said to have access to a
                   reliable source of good-quality irrigation water and the highest yields: 3–3.5 tons of raw
                   cotton per ha. Finally, they incur relatively modest costs and their debt is low.
          •	       Middle-income cotton farmers represent around 50 percent to 60 percent of all cotton
                   farmers in the five sites. They make little profit from cotton due to variable yields and
                   high production costs. While these farmers were said to usually meet the state production
                   quota, their yields are lower due to poorer soil quality and the more remote location of
                   some of their plots, as well as more constrained access to irrigation water.
          •	       Vulnerable farmers, also referred to as “lagging” or “bankrupt” farmers, comprise
                   between 20 and 30 percent of all cotton farmers in the studied districts, according
                   to respondents. Focus group participants in Syrdaryo and Karakalpakstan claimed that
                   farmers in this group struggle to meet the state production quota for cotton and have
                   no free capital to invest in their farm. The gross value of their harvests tends to be lower
                   than the expenses they incur and they have trouble repaying their debts to suppliers and
                   banks. Respondents claimed that limited access to water is an important factor in this
                   group’s poor yields. Their plots are often located near the end of the canal, so they receive
                   less, poorer-quality water than farmers upstream. Moreover, they rely on pump irrigation
                   (except those in Jizzakh) and thus incur electricity expenses. Poor access to irrigation
                   water is said to result in shorter cotton plants, which reportedly causes problems for the
                   cotton-harvesting machines that are currently on the market. The cotton yields of this
                   group was said to be low: 1.5–2 tons of cotton per ha. Moreover, the quality of the cotton
                   tends to be poorer than that of other farmers. The cotton fields of vulnerable farmers are
                   located far away from population points (50–120 km), which reportedly makes it difficult
                   for them to attract villagers to pick cotton. Vulnerable farmers were said to therefore rely
                   on poorly motivated pickers from outside the areas, such as those brought in from urban
                   areas by government organizations.

xlvii.	   In an attempt to attract local pickers, vulnerable farmers pay up to 35 percent to 65 percent more
          per kg of picked cotton than better-off farmers, but this is not enough to attract local workers.
          The higher labor costs these farmers incur reflect workers’ higher transportation costs, the costs of
          providing more frequent meals, higher bonuses, workers’ lower productivity, and, in Karakalpakstan,
          higher fees per kilogram paid to attract workers.

Impact of harvest mechanization on cotton growers

xlviii.	   Overall, farmers in all four regions claimed that mechanization will offer important advantages in
           terms of managing the harvesting process and completing the harvest on time. They claimed it is
           easier to manage one machine and one driver than 100 cotton pickers. They stated that a machine
           can harvest the same amount of cotton in an hour that 50–100 pickers can collect in one day. If
           mechanized, the harvest can be completed in one month instead of the current two to three. This
           implies it can be completed before the onset of the rainy season in October/November, preventing
           the rain from impairing the cotton’s quality and its sale price. Completing the harvest early will also
           allow farmers to sow wheat earlier, raising its yield.

xlix.	     Farmers in Syrdaryo and Jizzakh, where labor is scarcest, and farmers whose farms are located
           away from population centers are most positive about mechanization. Even if machine harvesting
           reduces the quantity and quality of cotton harvested, the advantages would still outweigh the
           costs, farmers in these areas claimed. Farmers in Jizzakh and Syrdaryo who have experience with
           mechanized harvesting claim it can save up to 50 percent of the cotton-harvesting costs.

I.	        However, farmers in Jizzakh and Syrdaryo—where a portion of the cotton harvest is already
           mechanized—claimed that not all their plots would be suitable for mechanized cotton harvesting.
           This includes, for example, those plots that have irregular shapes or are rugged in the corners.
           Currently, farmers have to follow the state order to grow cotton on these fields. They claimed that
           because machines will not be able to harvest cotton on such plots, these fields should be used to
           grow high-profit secondary crops instead.

Ii.	       Discussions with farmers in Jizzakh revealed that plots that have less irrigation water available
           to them produce cotton plants of insufficient height for machine harvesting. According to these
           farmers, such plots could instead be used to grow vegetables, horticultural, or fodder crops, which
           require less water than cotton.

Iii.	      The quality of harvesting machines on the market led to heated discussions among farmers from
           Syrdaryo and Jizzakh who had some experience with machines. Many blamed their poor quality
           and low-grade cotton on the harvesting machines. Farmers in Syrdaryo, Jizzakh, and Karakalpakstan
           also had a number of concerns regarding the quality of harvesting machines on the market.

Iiii.	     The current lack of knowledge about the various issues surrounding cotton harvest mechanization
           is a concern for farmers. They would like to know more about what machines are on the market,
           the costs involved, the implementation process of mechanization, and the required adjustments to
           land preparation and sowing practices.

Iiv.	      During focus groups, farmers also raised the importance of adjusting agronomic practices of
           cotton cultivation for machine harvesting. They claimed that cotton should be planted in rows 0.9
           meters apart to accommodate a harvester’s wheels. Most farmers participating in focus groups in
           Karakalpakstan and Fergana region said they currently plant in rows 0.6 meters apart, which is most
           suitable for manual cotton picking.

Iv.	       Farmers who want to mechanize their harvest prefer to lease the machines instead of renting
           them from machine and tractor parks (MTPs). Farmers were worried that if MTPs are in charge of
           managing the harvesters, they might charge farmers for the machines without being responsible
           for the quality of the harvested cotton. They also raised concerns about having to wait a long time
           to get a machine.

Ivi.	      Farmers with remote, poor-quality land that has limited access to irrigation water—often the
           most vulnerable farmers—have the most difficulty finding pickers. Mechanization of these cotton
           fields would reduce the need to bring in cotton pickers from outside the area. However, study

                                                        18
          participants in all districts claimed that vulnerable/lagging/bankrupt farmers, who represent 10
          percent to 20 percent of all farmers in selected districts, will have the most difficulty mechanizing
          their cotton harvest. In particular, these farmers cannot afford to buy or even rent these machines.
          This group usually does not even have enough resources to take care of all agricultural procedures
          to grow cotton on time. Cotton production on fields of these farmers tends to have low or even
          negative returns and cotton production would not necessarily become the most remunerable crop
          for them even if mechanization would reduce their harvesting costs.

Ivii.	    Well-off and middle-income farmers said they would prefer to lease harvesting machines, as
          buying them would be too expensive. An important issue for them is the availability of spare
          parts. Farmers in Jizzakh and Karakalpakstan suggested group loans should be provided to two or
          three farmers so they could purchase machines. However, that option was said to work only for
          well-off and middle-income farmers.

The impact of harvest mechanization on cotton pickers

Iviii.	   Cotton pickers across all sites believed that cotton harvest mechanization will negatively impact
          their livelihood. Female cotton pickers were particularly concerned. Male focus group participants
          were more positive about the effects of mechanization. They claimed that if there are fewer jobs
          for cotton pickers, they will work longer hours on their tomorka (kitchen garden) or will do some
          other daily wage job—for example, work for dehkans that grow horticultural crops or vegetables.
          Moreover, young male participants (aged 20–25 years old) claimed that mechanization would open
          up new job opportunities for them.

Iix.	     In districts where labor is scarce (such as those in Jizzakh), cotton pickers were concerned that
          mechanization can negatively affect daily wages for other agricultural work. Right now, due to high
          labor scarcity and significant demand for cotton pickers, and the fact that other crops (vegetables,
          horticultural crops) need to be harvested at the same time as cotton, farmers have to pay higher
          wages to harvest vegetables and other horticultural crops.

Ix.	      Cotton pickers in all sites suggested that mechanization will allow schools and local hospitals to
          remain open during the cotton season. Government employees (teachers, doctors) and students
          will no longer need to pick cotton (especially in remote areas where locals do not want to pick
          cotton).

Solutions suggested by study participants

Ixi.	     Farmers in Syrdaryo and Karakalpakstan suggested that the cotton ginnery plants (CGPs) be in
          charge of managing the machines. A CGP can hire the machine operators and deduct the cost of
          the services from the payment the CGP owes farmers. According to farmers, CGPs will take better
          care of the machines than MTPs. Harvesting arrangements and the payment process will be easier
          for farmers. Farmers in Syrdaryo suggested that CGPs charge vulnerable farmers a lower tariff. MTPs
          currently charge farmers the same fee in all study districts: Soum 177,000 per ton of raw cotton.

Ixii.	    Respondents also suggested that training and seminars on mechanized farming be organized for
          farmers as well as hokimiyat officials, MTPs, and CGPs. Experimental farms should be established
          in each district to showcase the advantages of mechanization and teach farmers how to grow cotton
          in a way that is conducive to machine harvesting.

Ixiii.	   Female pickers suggested and supported the idea of organizing and developing local-level skills
          trainings for women. Female pickers said they are aware such courses (in tailoring, baking, or
          nursing) exist in the district they would like to attend, but that these are only offered in urban areas.

Ixiv.	    In Fergana region, participants suggested that the government and banks offer special loans to

                                                       19
             local entrepreneurs who want to train people in certain skills and then employ them. Microloans
             to purchase livestock and poultry were also seen as an attractive way to cushion the negative social
             impact of mechanization.

Ixv.	        According to cotton pickers and mahalla leaders, existing social assistance programs would not
             be suitable for transferring funds to vulnerable and other low-income households to compensate
             them for the income lost from cotton picking. There is a strict quota on the number of households
             that can be eligible for social assistance, resulting in limited coverage of vulnerable households. In
             visited areas, the quota was at least 50 percent lower than the number of vulnerable households.
             In addition, middle-income households lose the most income from harvest mechanization, yet they
             are not eligible for social assistance. Finally, it would be difficult for local government bodies to
             identify households that lost the most income due to mechanization.

Recommendations
Ixvi.	       This social impact assessment has identified two vulnerable population groups that are involved
             in the cotton production process. These are: (i) women who are engaged in cotton picking and
             have few alternative cash income–earning opportunities; and (ii) farmers who grow cotton under
             less favorable production conditions. The recommendations presented below follow from the
             analysis of the collected data and aim to address the needs of both of these groups to make sure
             the mechanization process is successful and generates benefits for all population groups.11

Short term mitigation measures

Ixvii.	      The government could consider instituting a public works program. Such a program could focus on
             improving rural infrastructure (roads, canals) to increase farm productivity, while at the same time
             providing alternative income-earning opportunities for needy households that are no longer able to
             earn income from picking cotton following mechanization.

Ixviii.	     Options should be explored for organizing contract labor teams that consist of skilled and effective
             workers who can compete with mechanized harvesting or find niches for cotton-harvesting work,
             such as premium cotton for cotton seed, small fields, or cotton fields in remote areas. Picking fees
             should be liberalized so that farmers are free to pay wages needed to attract such laborers.

Ixix.	       Labor market management information systems that provide information on labor demand,
             shortages, surpluses, fees, and wage rates across regions should be made accessible. Such
             information, together with more flexible wage rates, will make workers more likely to voluntarily
             travel from labor surplus to labor deficit areas when wage incentives are present.

Medium term reform measures

Ixx.	        There is a need to liberalize farming and allow farmers that currently grow cotton in areas that
             are less suitable for that crop to switch to more remunerative farm activities that raise land and
             labor productivity and use less water. The latter is important in areas where abundant irrigation
             water is not easily available.12

Ixxi.	       Measures to further support farmers engaged in high value activities such as horticultural or
             livestock production that have a higher labor productivity (in Soum per day) than cotton, and
             thus enable farmers to pay workers attractive daily fees, would be important. At the same time,
             support to smallholders (dehkans) to raise the productivity of their plots and enhance the quality
             and value of their harvests would be needed. This would require better integrating smallholder

11. It should be noted that the government is already undertaking various measures to diversify agriculture and generate income-earning opportunities
for the rural population outside the cotton sector.
12. To some extent this is already happening in the country and this is further promoted through policies issued in 2015.

                                                                        20
           in the value chains of their products to enable them to tap into higher value markets and meet
           product preferences of middle and high income consumers. Training, which can be facilitated by the
           employment centers, can help facilitate the shift to high value added activities.

Ixxii.	    Structural barriers that prevent rural women who currently pick cotton from accessing formal
           employment or engaging in alternative income-earning activities should be identified and tackled.
           Measures could for example include those that enable rural women to start and develop their small
           businesses through access to micro-finance, technical training, and child care. Livestock production
           and agro-processing could be relevant activities in this respect.

Ixxiii.	   Agronomic research is needed to produce cotton varieties that are not only well suited to the
           range of Uzbek growing conditions, but that also reduce the number of cotton-picking passes.
           This will help ensure that mechanized picking is economic and efficient, and put in place a more
           efficient hand-picking process that enhances cotton pickers’ productivity and income.

Ixxiv.	    Mechanizing the cotton harvest requires further on-farm field testing of different harvesting
           machines and machine design options. Such field tests should take place under the different
           cotton-growing conditions that currently exist in Uzbekistan, including the most and least favorable
           conditions. This will help ensure that the mechanization needs of marginalized farmers that grow
           cotton under difficult conditions—such as low reliability of irrigation water, low soil fertility or highly
           salinized soils, and low availability of labor—are also addressed.

Ixxv.	     Different business models for mechanizing the cotton harvest should be piloted to test the
           effectiveness, impact, and alternative arrangements for ownership, leasing, and contract service
           provision (such as cotton harvested by a contractor), and to address the needs of smaller-scale
           farmers and farmers with remote fields. In addition, training courses should be organized to facilitate
           the emergence of contract service businesses and alert the banking community to the potential of
           this as a recurring business model.

           to actively engage with the research findings around cotton harvest mechanization and explore
           new ways forward. It is important to hear the voices of stakeholders affected by cotton harvest
           mechanization and involve them in an action plan to address possible negative social impacts; doing
           so will ensure these are based on realities on the ground.

           the program and ensuring all vulnerable households are covered.

1. Introduction
1.	   The GoU has recently adopted a policy to mechanize the cotton harvest. The goal is to have 70
      percent of the cotton grown in Uzbekistan harvested by machines by 2020. This policy is part of a
      broader government strategy to modernize the agricultural sector and reduce production costs. It is
      also a response to growing international concerns and calls to boycott cotton produced in Uzbekistan
      due to continued state-sponsored mobilization of adult labor and the previously common practice
      of mobilizing children to pick cotton.

2.	   Mechanizing the cotton harvest might accelerate a further reduction in the already low demand
      for labor in rural areas, and it is unclear what impact it may have on the livelihoods of those who pick
      cotton. While mechanization may have positive economic and social effects, especially if combined
      with additional sector reform measures, it is possible that some households may suffer, as the cash
      earned from picking cotton is an important source of their seasonal and even annual cash income.
      Losing this income source is likely to hurt their livelihood, especially if alternative income-earning
      opportunities are limited. This is particularly likely for women, some of whom reportedly rely on
      cotton picking as an important seasonal livelihood activity. Cotton farmers might also be negatively
      affected, as mechanization might be unaffordable for the poorest and most indebted among them.

3.	   Replacing cotton cultivation with more remunerative alternatives that are also labor intensive—
      such as horticultural crops—will generate new employment opportunities for cotton pickers.
      These may offset some of the income-earning opportunities that will be lost due to cotton harvest
      mechanization. However, it is not immediately clear whether the employment opportunities that
      crop diversification will generate will be accessible to the vulnerable households that are most
      affected by mechanization.

4.	   The likely impact of cotton mechanization on the livelihoods of cotton-harvesting laborers is
      poorly understood. Similarly, little is known about the impact of mechanization on different types
      of cotton farmers. Such information is important for designing policy and operational measures
      that will ensure cotton harvest mechanization reforms will not be undertaken at the expense of the
      most vulnerable sections of the population.

5.	   This report presents the findings of an SIA about cotton harvest mechanization. The study
      has the following objectives: (i) to assess the ex ante and social impact of the planned cotton
      mechanization policy in Uzbekistan on farm workers and vulnerable private farmers; and (ii) to
      identify ways to mitigate the policy’s potential negative impacts on these groups and to make these
      reforms more acceptable for them. The assessment aims to obtain an in-depth understanding
      of the needs, attitudes, grievances, and perspectives of different stakeholders involved in cotton
      production on the mechanization process across a range of circumstances. Specifically, the social
      impact assessment aims to:

      •	        Prepare a socioeconomic profile of local rural population groups that currently pick
                cotton, and of farmers engaged in cotton cultivation. This involved identifying what
                local wealth groups exist in selected research sites and obtaining subjective estimates
                of proportions of the income of each of these groups that is earned from cotton picking.
                Similarly, local cotton farmers were divided into wealth groups, and for each of these
                typical characteristics and constraints for mechanization were identified.
      •	        Assess the livelihood alternatives for female and male cotton pickers. The analysis
                considered the local labor market situation and alternative income-generating
                opportunities of these population groups during the cotton harvest. Assessing gender
                differences was an important focus.
      •	        Gather views and concerns of cotton farmers regarding mechanization as well as on
                what can be done to address these concerns. While the mechanization of cotton
                harvesting might have considerable benefits for cotton growers, there are risks and

                                                   22
               uncertainties that may need to be addressed regarding uptake and sustainability of the
               mechanization initiative, especially for more vulnerable farmers. Better-off and poorer
               farmers’ perceptions of these issues were gathered across sites with low and high labor/
               land ratios.

Methodology
6.	   The assessment is based on the collection and analysis of qualitative data from 20 focus group
      discussions and 20 in-depth interviews. Eight focus groups were held with people that pick cotton
      and 12 with cotton farmers. Each focus group included 8–10 participants and typically lasted between
      two and three hours. Focus groups were conducted separately with female and male participants
      (see Pictures 1 and 2). In total, 80 cotton pickers and 95 farmers participated in the discussions.

7.	   The 20 in-depth interviews were held with local village leaders, local government representatives,
      and with organizations involved in cotton harvesting, processing, and mechanization. This included
      representatives of hokimiyat cotton committees (pahta shtabs), community leaders, cotton ginnery
      officials, local mechanization experts, and representatives from MTPs. The average duration of one
      interview was 1 hour and 30 minutes. In addition, eight mini case studies were conducted—four
      with cotton farmers and four with vulnerable cotton pickers. A case study interview lasted two to
      four hours.

8.	   A local research firm conducted the fieldwork between December 12, 2014, and January 15, 2015.
      Group discussions and interviews were conducted in Uzbek and were based on detailed discussion
      and interview guides that were prepared by the World Bank task team. All field team members
      went through several days of training provided by an international consultant to become familiar
      with the interview guide and the focus group discussion guide. This was followed by a pilot test of
      the methodological tools, which was carried out in Urtachirchik district (Tashkent region) November
                                                 23
       18–21, 2014. Following the pilot, methodological tools were finalized and the team underwent
       additional training. Audio records were used to produce full transcripts in Russian of all discussions
       and interviews.

9.	    An international consultant worked closely with the research firm to provide additional quality
       control. After completing each round of data collection, the field team sat down with the consultant
       to review key findings and discuss difficulties in data collection. After all data had been collected, a
       final meeting was held with the field team to summarize key findings and how these varied across
       research sites. The World Bank task team produced the draft report with inputs from the local
       research firm.

10.	   Focus group discussions with cotton pickers covered the following topics, among others:

       •	        socioeconomic characteristics of cotton pickers and the importance of cotton picking to
                 their livelihood
       •	        typical amount earned from cotton picking in a day and factors that cause variation
       •	        incentives for people to pick cotton compared to other income-earning opportunities
       •	        expected impact of cotton harvest mechanization on their livelihoods, what can be
                 done to mitigate the expected impact, and the availability of alternative income-earning
                 opportunities
       •	        skill training or other programs/services in the area that could help cotton pickers transition
                 to alternative income-earning opportunities
       •	        existing social assistance programs and their potential role to transfer funds to cotton
                 pickers who lose their income

       A list of the research questions is presented in Appendix 2. The complete field research guide for
       discussions with cotton pickers is shown in Appendix 3.

11.	   Focus group discussions with cotton farmers and/or farm managers revolved around issues such as:

       •	        difficulties faced by different types of cotton farmers in obtaining sufficient cotton-picking
                 labor
       •	        advantages and disadvantages of the cotton harvest mechanization
       •	        different types of cotton farmers that can be distinguished and for which of these harvest
                 mechanization will work well or less well
       •	        policy measures and support services needed to make cotton harvest mechanization work
                 for farmers of all income groups, including the most vulnerable

       The field research guide for discussions with cotton growers is presented in Appendix 4.

12.	   Key informant interviews included the following questions, among others:

       Interviews with heads of mahallas and cotton committees (pahta shtabs)

       •	        How does recruitment take place and what is the role of the mahalla?
       •	        What types of people are particularly keen to pick cotton? What alternatives do they have?
       •	        What are the advantages and disadvantages of cotton harvest mechanization and who are
                 its likely winners and losers?
       •	        What are possible mitigation measures for those negatively affected?

       Interviews with cotton ginnery officials and mechanization experts

       •	        For what types of cotton farmers will harvest mechanization work well and for what types
                 will it work less well?
       •	        What policy measures and support services are needed to make cotton harvest
                 mechanization work for farmers of all income groups, including the most vulnerable?
       •	        What can make it easier for farmers to have their cotton harvested in time?

                                                    24
13.	        The eight mini case studies collected the life stories of cotton growers and pickers; important life
            events; the importance of cotton picking/growing in their livelihoods; the expected impact and
            desirability of mechanization; and what they believe should change to make mechanization work
            for low-income laborers and farmers. Mini case studies with cotton growers also gathered detailed
            estimations of costs and returns for growing cotton and alternative crops.

14.	        Two background studies were commissioned for this assessment. These included (i) a review of
            international experiences with cotton harvest mechanization focusing on Argentina, Greece, and
            Turkey;13 and (ii) an analysis of the rural labor market situation in Uzbekistan, using the data from
            the 2013 Central Asia Labor, Skills, Migration and Consumption Survey.14

Sampling

15.	        Data were collected in four regions that varied in terms of labor scarcity, area of land under cotton,
            suitability for cotton production, and experience with mechanization. This was done to enable a
            comparison of findings across a range of conditions that are typical for Uzbekistan. The selection
            process was based on official statistics and information gathered from local experts. The following
            regions were selected, each of which represented different conditions:

            •	            Jizzakh—high labor scarcity and high proportion of land under cotton
            •	            Syrdaryo—medium labor scarcity and relatively high extent of mechanization
            •	            Fergana region—low labor scarcity, high proportion of land under cotton, and limited
                          mechanization
            •	            Karakalpakstan—high labor scarcity

            The research firm collected data on the different districts in each of these four regions in order
            to select the ones that would best fit the selection criteria. One district was selected in each
            region except in Karakalpakstan, where two districts were chosen to ensure sufficient coverage of
            the mechanization pilot in a World Bank project. The characteristics of the selected districts are
            presented in Table 1.

16.	       Farmers who were invited to participate in the focus groups were selected so as to ensure a broad
           range of cotton production conditions were covered in the overall sample (not necessarily within
           each district). This implied that focus groups were held with farmers that either grow cotton on low-
           quality soil (ball bonitet below 50) or on high soil quality (ball bonitet above 50), and with farmers
           with either small farms (less than 30 ha) or large farms (more than 60 ha). Also, we chose farmers
           whose fields were either close to population centers (less than 5 km) or whose farms were more
           remote (more than 5 km from population centers). See Table 2 for an overview of the characteristics
           of farmers and cotton pickers who participated in focus groups.

Note: Sampling aimed to ensure different production conditions were covered across all districts, not necessarily within each district.

           Focus groups with cotton pickers were held with working-age adults who, during the 2014 season,
           harvested cotton for a significant amount of time and for whose household cotton picking is a
           significant source of income. Separate focus groups with male and female cotton pickers were
           conducted in each region (see Table 2). Also in each region, two mini case studies were conducted,
           one with a farmer and one with a cotton picker. This included farmers that used cotton-harvesting
           machines in 2014.


                                                                 26
17.	         The study has a number of limitations. The sampling methodology was “purposive”— the sites
             that were selected and the growers and pickers who participated in the discussions were chosen
             to represent a wide range of cotton production conditions in Uzbekistan. This enabled us to
             gather a rich set of experiences and the views of those who are directly affected by cotton harvest
             mechanization. Findings are strongly embedded in their local context. However, data were not
             gathered through a probabilistic random sample survey, and thus the people who participated in
             the study do not necessarily represent the wider population—or subgroups of the population—in
             a statistical sense. It is therefore not possible to extrapolate the study’s findings to the country as
             whole in a statistically robust manner, or assess how common the findings are among all cotton
             pickers or growers. In addition, the quantitative data collected for the study—such as yields and
             production costs—are based on what was told to the survey team by study participants and not on
             direct measurement in the field or verification of administrative records.

18.	         The rest of the report is organized as follows. The remainder of this chapter provides background
             information about the cotton sector in Uzbekistan and summarizes the labor market situation.
             Chapter 2 presents an overview of the international experience with cotton harvest mechanization
             and its social impact. Chapter 3 briefly describes cotton-harvesting practices in the country based on
             the findings of the field research. Chapter 4 discusses the research findings regarding the benefits of
             cotton picking as compared to available wage-earning alternatives. This is followed by a presentation
             of the different types of cotton farmers that can be distinguished and the harvesting costs these
             groups were said to incur (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 explores the potential effect of mechanization
             on cotton growers and pickers. Chapter 7 summarizes possible measures that are needed to make
             the cotton harvest mechanization a success for all stakeholders. Chapter 8 offers conclusions and
             recommendations.

Background: Cotton production in Uzbekistan
19.	         Uzbekistan is one of the largest producers of cotton in the world. It produces between 800,000
             and 1 million tons of lint per year, which represents about 4 percent of the world’s total. Uzbekistan
             ranked sixth in world output and fifth in terms of global exports of cotton in 2012.15 Official annual
             state revenues from cotton exports amount to over US$1.6 billion. Cotton remains the country’s
             second-most important crop in terms of area of cultivation and has great (albeit declining) political,
             economic, and cultural significance. Together with wheat, another state-mandated crop, cotton
             occupies about 80 percent of the cultivated agricultural area.16 Per capita gross national income
             (GNI) in 2014 was US$2,090.17 As of 2011, agriculture accounted for 19.1 percent of GDP and 25.9
             percent of labor force participation.

20.	         Almost all cotton in Uzbekistan is harvested by hand, and an estimated 2.2–3 million people were
             involved in some aspects of the cotton harvest during 2014 (see Figure 1, and see appendix 1 for
             an explanation of the calculation method used). This represents about 7 percent to 10 percent of
             the population of Uzbekistan and about 14 percent to 20 percent of the work force. Total gross
             earnings by workers harvesting cotton were estimated to be between US$250–$300 million in 2014,
             depending on the exchange rate.18




15. According to GoU estimates, the country is ranked third in global export of cotton (World Bank, 2012, 2015).

21.	        About 30 percent of all cotton produced globally in 2011 was harvested by machine, while in
            Western countries the proportion is 90 percent or higher. At present, nearly all cotton produced
            in Uzbekistan is handpicked, even though mechanization existed during the Soviet period. The
            reasons for this are rooted in (i) traditional practices of manual cotton picking that trace back
            generations; (ii) strong cultural beliefs in the high quality and value of manually picked cotton; and
            (iii) earlier failed attempts to mechanize after independence. Uzbek farmers take pride in the fact that
            the cotton produced in their country is highly valued worldwide. Additionally, earlier failed attempts
            to mechanize cotton harvesting led to high costs yet produced few results due to inappropriate
            equipment. Poor servicing and repair facilities only further discouraged new attempts to introduce
            automated harvesting and reinforced belief in the importance of picking cotton manually.

22.	        The availability of rural labor diminished when, following the dissolution of the state-controlled
            collective farms, and in the absence of other industries to absorb rural labor, there was massive
            labor migration to cities in Uzbekistan and abroad, primarily Russia and Kazakhstan.19 The
            reallocation of agricultural land to large farms with fewer opportunities for permanent employment
            for many, in turn, resulted in labor shortages on private farms, especially during the growing season.

23.	        Cotton growers are said to be unable to mobilize sufficient seasonal workers to meet their peak
            labor demands during the cotton harvesting season because of low cotton-picking wages set
            by the government and the low available liquidity (cash) in the economy to pay workers. Faced
            with demanding state procurement quotas for cotton, the diminished size of the available labor
            force, and insufficient incentives for workers to pick cotton, farmers depend on local, regional, and
            national authorities to mobilize cotton-picking labor for their harvests.

24.	        The key reasons for state authorities to mobilize cotton-harvesting labor is ostensibly the “state-
            order system” within a context of increasing peak labor shortages in rural areas. Farmers who
            lease land that has been designated by the state for cotton production are contractually obligated
            to produce stipulated quantities of cotton. The government sets these production quotas annually,
            and farmers must sell the cotton to the state at a price fixed by the government. Farmers who fail
            to meet their assigned quota may incur considerable financial penalties and lose their land. The
            uncertainty surrounding their land tenure is likely to be reflected in the limited number of farmers
            who invest in new machinery or land improvement.20 Local government (hokimiyat) officials are
            personally responsible for ensuring that quotas are met, and may face grave consequences if their
            localities fail to meet the assigned quota. Government pressure to meet production quota cascades
            down the bureaucracy, from the national level to local hokimiyats and mahallas.

25.	         While the practice of using children to pick cotton has declined, there are allegations that
             individuals over the age of 18 have been mobilized to harvest cotton. University students and civil
             servants, including teachers, doctors, nurses, and police officers have been taken to the fields in
             the last several years. Civil servants and even employees of private firms are often mobilized to pick
             cotton during the 20–30 days of the peak harvesting season.21 Reportedly, during the 2012 cotton
             harvest, 15 percent to 20 percent of all government employees were working in the cotton fields at
             any given time.22 People who refuse to participate in the cotton harvest may be subject to sanctions.

26.	         Mechanization may have positive economic and social effects, especially if combined with
             additional sector reform measures. If successfully implemented and especially in combination
             with higher cotton-picking fee policies, an accelerated mechanization effort is expected to have an
             overall positive impact by minimizing the need to mobilize or coerce labor to pick cotton. However,
             mechanization may also further reduce demand for labor in rural areas and lead to negative impacts.

27.	         To date, the importance of cotton picking as a source of seasonal cash income for agricultural
             laborers in cotton growing areas has been poorly understood. More broadly, in Uzbekistan there
             is no information on which population groups in rural and periurban areas are the most vulnerable,
             or what their characteristics and income sources are. This lack of knowledge hampers the design of
             measures that can cushion such at-risk groups from the potential negative effects of policies that
             might be adverse for them, such as the policy to mechanize cotton harvesting. It also inhibits the
             proposal of alternative livelihood measures. Also, mechanization is unlikely to replace all manual
             work for cotton picking, but little is known about the cotton-picking wage levels at which the
             voluntary supply of laborers and their incomes might be maintained or even increased.

28.	         In Uzbekistan, the majority of workers tending the fields are women, and they may be the group
             that is most impacted by mechanization. There is an increasing feminization of the agricultural
             sector in Uzbekistan due to the growing outmigration of men to urban centers and abroad in
             search of employment. Women are the main cotton pickers, and thus mechanization threatens to
             eliminate jobs that are largely carried out by women. Moreover, new jobs that may be created by
             mechanization may require skills that women lack.

29.	         It is expected that other measures that comprise an integral part of moving away from current cotton
             production policies—such as crop diversification—will generate new employment opportunities
             that may offset some of the income-generating opportunities eliminated by mechanization. The
             GoU is increasingly pursuing a policy of crop diversification to ensure food security and to increase
             land and water productivity. The horticultural crops that are replacing cotton offer much higher
             economic returns. However, the opportunities that this diversification generates for cotton pickers
             are as of yet unclear. Careful monitoring is needed to ensure that these opportunities are equally
             accessible to the most vulnerable segments of the population and that there are no adverse direct
             or indirect effects on these population groups.

30.	         Support for mechanization is likely to vary among different types of farmers. Despite the government
             decision to mechanize the cotton harvest, it cannot be assumed that this is an optimal solution for
             all farmers. Under the current cotton sector policies, farmers benefit from a supply of laborers
             below market cost. For smaller and less well-off farmers, mechanization might be unaffordable
             and support services inadequate. Given that cotton production is not a profitable undertaking for
             all farmers, economic incentives for them to mechanize might vary, and mechanization may not
             necessarily be their preferred option. All this of course depends on the availability of labor and
             terrain conditions for mechanization.

                                                                        29
31.	         Attempts to reduce the negative social impacts of mechanizing cotton harvesting will take place in
             a suboptimal agricultural policy environment, given that the cotton subsector experiences strong
             government interference. The current policy environment constrains the development of the
             agricultural sector and the improvement of the lives of people who depend on it for their livelihood.
             This study attempts to identify ways to reduce the poverty and social impacts of mechanizing cotton
             harvesting in a “third-best” agricultural policy environment. The “first-best” situation would be to
             allow farmers to choose the crops they grow and thus whether they would grow cotton (allowing
             “freedom to farm”). A “second-best” policy environment would be one that better takes into
             account the regional differences regarding labor availability and agroclimatic and soil conditions
             when selecting areas where farmers are mandated to grow cotton.

32.	         At any given time, a combination of three modes of cotton harvesting may exist; this depends on
             circumstances that differ across regions. The three modes are machine harvesting (currently very
             low); laborers that are recruited locally to pick cotton; and labor that is mobilized by the state and
             brought in from outside areas. The share of machine harvesting in the total harvesting effort is likely
             to be directly related to the level of the cotton picking fee—a higher rate will provide farmers with
             more incentive to replace expensive labor with machines. The share of machine harvesting is likely
             to be inversely related to the level of rural labor scarcity—more available local labor would reduce
             the need for mechanization. The share of voluntary labor is expected to be positively correlated
             with (i) the level of the cotton-picking fee; (ii) picking productivity, which is linked to the cotton
             yield; and (iii) local labor availability. Given the pronounced regional differences in labor availability,
             the situation therefore varies from one region to another.

Background: The rural labor market situation
33.	         Aspects of reforms in agriculture and in its cotton subsector should be analyzed in the context
             of overall trends in population dynamics and in the labor market. By early 2014, the Republic of
             Uzbekistan’s total population was estimated to be 30.5 million (compared to 24.5 million in 2000),
             of which approximately 49 percent was located in rural areas.23

34.	         Agriculture remains the second major branch of the economy, by the number of employed
             population; 3.1 million, or 27 percent of the total employed. Approximately 28.5 percent of
             female labor and 25.5 percent of male labor is engaged in agriculture. Meanwhile, 17 percent of the
             employed population works in industry and 56 percent in the service sector.24

35.	         The 2013 World Bank/GIZ Uzbekistan Jobs, Skills, and Migration survey suggests that 24 percent of
             the working age population that conducted paid work were engaged in agriculture and fishing.25
             This includes 35 percent of women and 19 percent of men in those age groups. In rural areas,
             construction remains the second-largest sector of the economy. It provides employment to 20
             percent of the rural working-age population (predominantly males), followed by education services
             at 15 percent of the rural employment (predominantly females).

36.	         During the 2000s, Uzbekistan’s economy diversified from agriculture to industry and services,
             cutting the importance of agriculture in GDP in half, to about 18 percent of GDP. The share of
             agricultural exports has fallen from about 45 percent to about 10 percent over the same time
             period, while exports of fuels and chemicals have largely replaced the agricultural share. Taken as
             a whole, agriculture constitutes a small and declining share of Uzbekistan’s national income. Even
             so, it is an important source of income for the 4.7 million households that operate dehkan farms
             (smallholders in rural and disproportionately poor communities).26
23. The country’s last population census was conducted in 1989, and the population data are calculated based on the number of births and deaths and
estimates on migration. According to data from the State Committee on Statistics (2012), the earlier estimate of the rural population at 64.2 percent
in 2008 was adjusted to 48.3 percent in 2009 (and 48.8 percent in 2011).

                                                                        30
37.	        The employment rate27 of the population between 16 and 64 years old is relatively low compared
            to other transition countries. According to the World Bank/GIZ Uzbekistan Jobs, Skills, and Migration
            Survey 2013, only 55 percent of that age group was employed, meaning they had a job that was
            defined as having conducted paid work (in the formal or informal sector) in the two weeks prior
            to the survey, compared to 60 percent to 68 percent of other Eastern Europe and Central Asian
            economies (see Table 3). In part, this can be explained by the low official retirement age of 60 for
            males and 55 for females. Mothers with more than three children can retire even earlier. According
            to the 2013 World Bank/GIZ Uzbekistan Jobs, Skills, and Migration Survey, 34 percent of those who
            are employed are self-employed. Entrepreneurship in Uzbekistan is dominated by microenterprises
            that operate in the services sector. About 70 percent of all self-employed individuals do not employ
            any additional workers. Economic policies in recent years have supported the growth of capital-
            intensive industries that have a positive impact on GDP and the national economy’s productivity,
            but generate relatively few new jobs.

39.	        Especially for women, disparities in employment across different parts of the country are very
            large (see Figure 3). The employment rate for women was as low as 31 percent in the center of the
            country and 32 percent in the eastern part, but 51 percent in regions in the country’s west. Among
            men, the employment rate equaled between 70 percent in the center and 76 percent in the east
            and southwest. Low employment rates for women makes the mechanization of cotton harvesting
            potentially challenging from a social point of view. The gap in average earnings between urban
            and rural population is relatively modest, especially during the growing season, but females earn
            significantly less than males (see Chapter 3).

40.	        Uzbekistan has maintained more than a million migrants in recent decades, fluctuating from
            1.6 million in 1990 to over 2 million in 2012–2013. Among youth, migration rates are particularly
            high—one in three males between the ages of 20 and 24 is a migrant, according to the World Bank/
            GIZ Uzbekistan Jobs, Skills, and Migration Survey. These high migration rates stem from deficiencies
            in the domestic labor market.30 Southern Kazakhstan receives a substantial influx of temporary low-
            waged migrants—cotton pickers from Uzbekistan.

41.	        According to the 2013 World Bank/GIZ Uzbekistan Jobs, Skills, and Migration Survey, 34 percent
            of those who are employed are self-employed. Entrepreneurship in Uzbekistan is dominated
            by microenterprises that operate in the services sector. About 70 percent of all self-employed
            individuals do not employ any additional workers, and another 21 percent employ fewer than
            five additional workers. While perhaps the overall job creation rate has kept pace with population
            growth, it has largely been achieved as a result of the growth in informal activities, including in
            subsistence agriculture and outmigration of population.

2. International experience with cotton harvest mechanization
and its social impact31
42.	         The percentage of world cotton production harvested by machines was about 29 percent in 2013–
             2014 and has not changed over the past 15 years. All or nearly all of production was machine
             harvested in Australia, Brazil, Greece, Israel, South Africa, Spain, and the United States. In Argentina,
             Bulgaria, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, and Turkey, between 60 and 90 percent of production was
             harvested by machines. In China, 9 percent of total production in 2013–2014 was harvested by
             machine (up from 5 percent in 1998–1999). Iran and Paraguay also reported small percentages of
             machine harvesting as of 2013. Machine harvesting is not used in India even though production has
             expanded there by 4.5 million tons over the past 15 years. While there was no mention of machine
             harvesting in Uzbekistan in the 2014 report of the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC),
             it is believed that a few machines were used on 1 percent to 2 percent of the crop.32 This is down
             from the estimated 5 percent that was harvested mechanically in 1998–1999 using machines that
             survived from the Soviet era.
43.	         This chapter looks at three country case studies—in Greece, Turkey, and Argentina—to review
             their experience with cotton harvest mechanization. These countries share certain economic and
             agroeconomic characteristics with Uzbekistan and mechanized their cotton harvests relatively
             recently.
44.	         There are many advantages to handpicking cotton—higher quality, higher yields, and less trash
             enters the harvested cotton. Handpicked cotton tends to be higher quality, as machine spindles
             tend to break fibers and create little knots, reducing the quality. Yields are about 10 percent higher
             in handpicked fields because every mature boll is harvested by hand, while many are missed by
             machines. Handpicked fields can be harvested repeatedly when additional bolls mature, but only
             once or twice by machine when most of the bolls have matured. For a second or third picking, the
             cost of fuel and operator time tends to be greater than the value of cotton harvested. Handpicked
             cotton has less trash, which is plant material inadvertently caught in the harvesting machinery. An
             additional advantage of handpicked cotton is that cotton plant varieties do not need to be uniform
             in height; similarly, the maturity of cotton that is handpicked does not need to be uniform. Also,
             defoliants are not required, and machines do not need to be purchased and maintained.
45.	         Every country that has adopted mechanical harvesting techniques did so primarily because
             of labor scarcity. When labor costs rise, mechanized harvesting becomes more economical. In
             Argentina, machine harvesting is about one-fourth less expensive than handpicking. In Greece
             and Turkey, mechanization reduced the costs associated with harvesting as a share of total cotton
             production costs by about half. In Greece, the labor associated with cotton picking represented
             one-fifth to one-fourth of the total cost of cotton production in the 1970s, but harvesting costs
             currently represent about one-tenth of the cost of production.33 Mechanization also reduced the
             time needed for harvesting and transporting seed cotton to gins from 70 person-days per hectare to
             20 person-days. Mygdakos reported that as of 1995 producers reported that mechanical harvesting
             reduced harvest costs in absolute terms by half.
46.	         Additional reasons for mechanizing cotton harvesting have been to (i) reduce contamination,
             particularly in Turkey; and (ii) shorten harvesting time. Contamination is when nonplant material
             (jute, polypropylene from fertilizer bags, rocks, dirt, and headscarves and other clothing) inevitably
             gets caught up in huge heaps of seed cotton as a result of millions of pairs of hands being involved.
             Mechanized harvest operations are also much faster. A hectare of cotton in Uzbekistan requires
             between 400 and 500 person-hours of labor to harvest by hand34 but only a couple of hours by
             machine, which is an important consideration if snow or heavy rain is anticipated.

                                                                        33
47.	         Introducing mechanical harvesting has always been a decades-long process. In Greece, this process
             took place very gradually over a 15-year period. In Turkey, it took 20 years.35 Agricultural technology
             is not modular, meaning one component cannot simply be swapped out of the production system
             for another, leaving other components unchanged. New varieties must be developed on which
             fruiting nodes occur on the main stem rather than on branches, thus limiting the width of plants.
             Varieties must be developed with bolls that form at least 15 centimeters above the ground to enable
             machinery access. Plants’ hairiness (which impedes spindle picking) must be reduced. Varieties
             must be developed that exhibit uniform plant maturity so that at least 80 percent of potential bolls
             are open and ready to be picked at the same time. Plant breeders indicate that at least eight years
             are needed to optimize local varieties for machine harvesting.

48.	         Machine harvesting also requires more defoliants and lint cleaners. Depending on the differences
             between daytime high and nighttime low temperatures, defoliants might be needed to induce
             leaf drop. Also, as mentioned, machine picking will result in more trash. Therefore, precleaners
             (sometimes called lint cleaners) are needed at gins, and the weight of seed cotton per ton of lint
             will increase, resulting in higher costs for transporting seed cotton to gins. Gins will also have more
             gin trash to dispose of.

49.	         The operating rate of harvesting machines is initially much lower. It is estimated that operating rate
             for the first few years is only about 60 percent, because of the time spent maintaining and adjusting
             the machinery and moving between fields. As farmers and machine operators gain experience, the
             operating rate of the machines rise.36

50.	         Machine harvesting tends to reduce the labor associated with harvest operations by 80 to 90
             percent. Approximately 1.2 hours of labor per hectare are required with mechanical harvesting.
             Demand tends to increase for experienced machinery drivers and mechanics, and labor is still
             required to transport seed cotton to gins. With mechanization, job opportunities (as machinery
             operators) open for all workers, including women. Mechanically harvesting cotton requires
             operating machinery very precisely to avoid running over rows of plants, moving too fast or too
             slow, or setting the picker heads too high or too low. There is anecdotal information that women
             more carefully operate the machinery than men and so are preferred by some farm owners.

51.	         Women tend to be disproportionately negatively affected by mechanization of harvest activities.
             Many men are able to transition to jobs involving harvesting equipment maintenance or operation;
             transporting and storing seed cotton; and ginning. Generally speaking, women are not employed
             in such positions, and cultural practices and gender roles may prevent them from taking such
             employment.

52.	         Governments tend to encourage mechanization. As a result little thought has been given to the
             impacts of harvest mechanization on rural laborers. In Greece, Turkey, and Argentina, displaced
             workers did not receive any compensation or adjustment assistance. Governments introduced little
             or no support programs targeted toward rural workers displaced by mechanization. There were
             general social welfare programs targeted toward rural households. In the three countries, most
             rural workers displaced by the introduction of mechanical harvesting either found jobs in cities
             or returned to other available agricultural jobs. Men tried to find alternative seasonal agricultural
             employment, while women often returned to traditional household responsibilities. In Turkey,
             displaced workers shifted to other agricultural sectors and continued to migrate seasonally in search
             of employment.




35. A very strong recommendation derived from the experience in Turkey is that delegations of Uzbek farmers and ginners should be organized to visit
Turkey and Greece to observe mechanical harvesting and related operations.
36. Greek researchers and government officials with experience dating back to the 1980s emphasize the importance of training farmers and ginners
on how to adapt to machine picking. Experts in Greece interviewed for this study suggested that Uzbekistan embark on a robust program of seminars,
farm meetings, and ginner training sessions with experts from countries that already machine pick.

                                                                        34
3. Cotton-harvesting practices in Uzbekistan
53.	   This chapter presents a description of the cotton-harvesting process in Uzbekistan based on the
       information provided by study respondents in each of the five research sites. It discusses key
       actors, interactions among them, and difficulties in hiring labor and organizing the cotton-picking
       process in the selected regions.

54.	   For most tasks, farmers were said to use either permanent farm laborers, temporary workers from
       local villages, or machines. However, for cotton harvesting there is a need to also mobilize pickers
       from nearby urban areas and from other districts and regions. Cotton farmers who participated in
       the focus groups across the five sites revealed that machines typically plow, sow, and apply fertilizer
       and pesticides. Farmers either own these machines or rent them from the MTPs. Irrigating the
       fields was said to be done by full-time farm workers, while for weeding farmers rely on temporary
       workers from local villages, usually women. The harvest is the most labor-consuming activity of
       the cotton production process. Focus groups with farmers suggested that between 40 and 150
       pickers are needed to pick 1 ha of cotton field in one day. Pickers from local villages or farmers’ own
       workers pick cotton much faster than those brought in from other areas. Every farmer has a cotton
       cultivation schedule with a timeline for each activity. This schedule is approved and monitored by
       the hokimiyat.

55.	   Farmers indicated that they are assigned a cotton production quota by the government. This is
       based on a composite indicator (the ball bonitet) for each of their plots that reflects production
       conditions. The indicator is based on the soil’s chemical composition, the average precipitation in
       the area, and the availability of irrigation water. Based on the quota, farmers can receive a low-
       interest loan from government banks to cover the costs of cotton production, at an annual interest
       rate of 3 percent. The loan has to be paid off after the cotton harvest is sold to the ginnery. If a
       farmer fails to meet the quota, his/her income from cotton cultivation might be insufficient to pay
       back the loan. In such a case, the farmer will need to cover the loan from income earned from sales
       of other crops, or pay it off the following year. If a farmer fails to meet the quota several years in a
       row, he or she might become bankrupt and the bank can confiscate his/her property. If farmers do
       not have a “valid” excuse for not meeting the quota—such as poor weather conditions or irrigation
       water shortages—the land will be allocated to another farmer.

                 “There is a significant amount land with low water availability. Because of that many
                 farmers were not able to meet the cotton production quota, had no profit, and were
                 unable to pay off their state loan.”
                                                                   —farmer, Pakhtakor District, Jizzakh

                 “The many farmers in this area who have been unable to meet the cotton production
                 quota saw their land put up for auction. Household goods, car, agricultural machinery and
                 livestock were also sold to allow the state bank to recover its loan. However, these farmer
                 are allowed to keep their house.”
                                                                         —farmer, Bayaut District, Syrdaryo

56.	   Those who participated in the mini case studies claimed that farmers who have met the production
       quota sometimes give the cotton to their neighbors who have had trouble meeting it. One farmer in
       South Karakalpakstan claimed that if a farmer sells more cotton to the ginnery than the production
       quota, he/she will receive additional benefits in the form of cotton oil and cotton cake (compressed
       cotton seed used to feed cattle).

             “We keep harvesting cotton even if we have already met the quota. The cotton of the first and
             second grade I sold to the cotton ginnery plant. The cotton of the third and fourth grade I give
             to other farmers who could not meet the quota.”
                                                                       —farmer, Pakhtakor District, Jizzakh

                                                    35
                    “If I was supposed to harvest 300 tons of cotton but submitted 312 tons, for the extra cotton
                    the cotton ginnery plant provide me cotton oil and cotton cake. It is done by the decree of our
                    President … If I submitted an extra 12 tons, then the CGP will provide me 120 kg of cotton oil
                    and 3 tons of cotton cake. Because of that we are interested in exceeding the quota.”
                                                                        —farmer, Beruniy District, Karakalpakstan

57.	        The cotton harvest was said to usually start in the first week of September and end mid-November.
            The cotton is normally picked in three passes, according to study respondents. The first pass
            starts when around 75 percent of cotton bolls are open. After around 10 days or so, more bolls are
            open and the second round of picking starts. The third round starts after another 10 days or more.
            Participants in our study stated that if bolls stay open in the field too long, their color might change
            and their fibers shrink. Usually, when a cotton-picking brigade has completed one pass for a farmer,
            it moves to another farm and returns later for the second pass on the first farmer’s fields.

58.	        There are large price premiums for high-quality cotton. The cotton that the ginnery (the CGP)
            receives from the farmers is assessed and then classified into one of five grades. The first grade is
            the best quality, the fifth grade the worst. The higher the quality of the raw cotton, the higher the
            prices that farmers receive. Table 4 shows the prices ginneries across the country paid farmers in
            2014 for raw cotton.

59.	        According to a representative of a Fergana region cotton ginnery plant, 1 ton of raw cotton (seed
            cotton), provides 330 kg of cotton fiber, 510 kg of seeds, 60–70 kg of cotton fiber, dust, and dirt.
            The quality and sale price of the cotton fiber and cotton depend on the grade of the raw cotton used
            to produce it. The ginnery was said to be able to sell 1 ton of first-grade cotton fiber for Soum 4
            million, while the cotton ginnery plant is paid Soum 3.8 million for the second-grade fiber, and Soum
            2.95 million for the fifth grade (see Table 4). Cotton seeds are also graded and the price depends on
            the quality (see Table 4). The costs involved in processing 1 ton of raw cotton was said to be Soum
            0.75 million. This covers salary, gas, electricity, and diesel oil.

60.	        Respondents claimed that in order to produce the best quality of cotton fiber and cotton seeds,
            it is important that the harvesting process meets a number of criteria. These include: (i) cotton
            should be picked in passes to make sure only open bolls are picked, while making sure open balls
            are not left in the sun for too long, (ii) harvesting should be completed before the first autumn rains
            as wet cotton loses quality fast, and (iii) the cotton should be clean and not contain a high amount
            of leaves or dirt.

Roles and responsibilities
61.	        According to local government representatives and community leaders interviewed for this study,
            planning for the cotton-picking campaign starts in late July or early August. The hokimiyat of the
            district establishes a cotton-picking committee (the pahta shtab). Usually, the committee includes

                                                                    36
       representatives of the hokimiyat, mahalla offices, the Village Assembly of Citizens (VAC), Vodhoz,
       cotton ginnery plants, police stations, and so on.

62.	   The local pahta shtab organizes, coordinates, and monitors the process of cotton picking at the
       district level. When the shtab is established, farmers submit requests for pickers. At the same time,
       mahalla offices start recruiting cotton pickers and make lists of names and ID numbers of people in
       each village who want to pick cotton. Contracts are signed. The mahalla offices submit these lists
       to the shtab and start forming brigades of pickers. Each brigade consists of 100–150 people and is
       appointed a leader (usually a representative of the mahalla), a weigh man (someone who weighs
       how much cotton each person picks), a nurse, and an accountant. The shtab subsequently drafts
       a schedule of when and for which farmers these people will pick cotton. Usually, people from one
       village join a single brigade. The brigades then pick cotton on the land of three or four farmers
       whose fields are nearby. The shtab is responsible for documenting the amount of cotton harvested
       and solving conflicts between farmers and pickers.

63.	   Respondents in all five sites claimed that pickers from local areas were only able to meet part
       of the demand for manual cotton pickers. As a consequence, the shtab needs to arrange for
       pickers from outside the area. These are referred to as hasharchi. The shtab approaches different
       organizations in the district, other districts, or even other regions to ask them to bring cotton pickers
       to their area. These pickers were said to include government employees, factory workers, and
       students (older than 18). In Syrdaryo, soldiers were also said to be involved in the cotton harvest.
       The shtab organizes these pickers into brigades, includes them in the cotton-picking schedules, and
       helps arrange their accommodation and transportation.

64.	   Farmers must arrange for the raw cotton to be transported to the CGP. At the end of each day
       they visit the ginnery to confirm the amount of raw cotton delivered. Mahalla leaders and heads
       of brigades are responsible for monitoring the quality of the work and the work conditions. Mahalla
       offices also mediate in the signing of contracts between farmers and pickers. Mahalla leaders who
       participated in our study claimed that mahalla offices sign contracts with farmers on behalf of
       pickers. Pickers from Fergana said that the contract states that farmers must provide pickers with
       lunch and transportation.

65.	   Pahta shtab members and community leaders stated that each cotton picker is required to meet
       a quota of 50–60 kg of raw cotton per day. Workers reported being monitored and encouraged to
       meet the quota, but local pickers generally meet or even exceed the quota. According to farmers
       who are located far from population centers and who participated in focus groups in Jizzakh, the
       pahta shtab gives brigades of pickers who are brought from other areas (hasharchi) a picking quota.
       The head of the brigade then divides this amount by the number of pickers and tries to make sure
       each picker meets the quota. The heads of those brigades were said to sometimes scold those
       pickers who do not meet their quota.

66.	   According to local experts in each research site, local communities provide only 35 percent to 70
       percent of all cotton pickers in the district. The proportion of pickers from outside was highest in
       Bayaut District (Syrdaryo), where pickers from urban areas and employees from different types of
       government or private institutions represent 65 percent of all pickers. The proportion of outside
       pickers was lowest in Beruniy District (Karakalpakstan) and Bagdad District (Fergana), where pickers
       from local rural communities represent more than 65 percent of all pickers.

67.	   As mentioned, farmers claimed they rely on pickers brought in from outside the area for a
       significant proportion of their labor. This is in part due to competing demands for local workers
       during the harvest season. High water availability in Bayaut District (Syrdaryo) has led to high
       agricultural productivity there and a high demand for agricultural labor during the growing and
       harvesting season. This district produces a large amount of cotton (17,000 tons per year), while

                                                    37
       labor tends to be scarce; there is high demand for agricultural workers to harvest “secondary” crops
       (rice, corn, vegetables). As a consequence, cotton pickers were needed from outside the area. Even
       in Bagdad District (Fergana), which has relatively high labor availability, farmers have to rely on
       pickers from outside the area. This particularly the case for the third or even fourth passes, which
       were said to draw few local pickers because of the low productivity at that point in the harvest.
       Pictures 3 and 4 show cotton pickers in Fergana region.

68.	   Members of the local community were said to be more motivated to pick cotton since they
       regard it as an important source of income. In contrast, farmers claimed that pickers brought in
       from outside the area were less qualified, less experienced, and less keen to pick. Focus group
       discussions with pickers from local communities claimed they were able to pick 60–100 kg of raw
       cotton per day. These pickers were said to be experienced agricultural workers and able to make
       sure they work mostly on nearby farmers with good production conditions and high yields. However,
       farmers claimed that pickers brought in from outside the area pick on average only 20–40 kg of
       raw cotton per day. Farmers from Syrdaryo estimated that a brigade of 100 pickers from the local
       community could pick 10 tons of raw cotton per day, while pickers who have been mobilized from
       urban areas manage to pick less than half that amount (only 4–5 tons of raw cotton per day).

                “Hasharchi leave too much in the field. As a consequence the government commission
                does not give us permission to remove the cotton stalks.”

                “150 students picked only 900 kg per day in my field. That is 6 kg per person. And I was able
                to get only Soum 400 per kg for it since it was fourth grade cotton.”

                 “Some hasharchi have never seen cotton before and are not keen to work hard. Local
                 pickers are motivated to pick cotton because they are interested in getting income.”
                 —farmer with poor soil conditions, Pakhtakor District, Jizzakh, FDG with farmers (low soil
                                                                                                   quality)

69.	   Some respondents stated that in many cases those who are brought in from outside the local
       area to pick cotton may pay locals to conduct the task on their behalf. Respondents conveyed that
       these people sometimes hire local community members to pick cotton for them, and pay them
       substantially more (for example, 50 percent more) than the set price, and then submit the cotton as
       if they had picked it themselves. Or, local pickers pick cotton under the name of someone who came
       or was supposed to come from another area (a government employee, factory worker, or student).
       One of the study respondents in Jizzakh said that a local picker can pick 120 kg in a day, submit 100
       kg of it (if a picker submits 100 kg a day, he/she gets a bonus of 1 liter of cotton oil), and sell another
       20 kg to a picker from an urban area at a higher price than he/she would normally get.

                 “Conflicts happen only when hasharchi start enticing local pickers that already work for
                 certain farmers to pick cotton on their behalf. They pay local pickers up to Soum 500 per
                 kg of cotton. As a result local pickers leave farmers for which they were picking cotton who
                 then lose their brigades.”
                                                                           —farmer, Pakhtakor District, Jizzakh

                 “People from Tashkent region arrived to help. But some of them are not employees of
                 organizations sent to pick cotton, but are people hired by these employees to replace
                 them. For example, if one kilogram of cotton costs Soum 200, they pay Soum 300 for it.”
                                                               —remote farmer, Pakhtakor District, Jizzakh

70.	   Local pickers are keen to harvest cotton during the first two passes, when open cotton bolls are
       plentiful and picking productivity is high, according to pickers who took part in focus groups. Since
       workers are paid for the amount they pick, and the fee per kilogram is the same for all passes, local
       pickers are more motivated to work at the beginning of the season when they can pick more cotton
       in a given time period, and thus earn more money. In the middle of the season, when all farmers
       have cotton ready to be harvested and there is mounting pressure to complete the harvest before
       the oncoming rains, the demand for pickers is the highest; farmers and pahta shtabs must mobilize
       as many people as possible. During this period, farmers have to rely on both local pickers and those
       brought in from urban areas.

71.	   Pickers who participated in our study claimed that toward the end of the season (the third and
       fourth passes), their interest drops significantly. By this point, there is not much cotton left in the
       field. Instead of 100 kg a day, a worker can now pick only 10–20 kg per day. Because the fee per
       kilogram is set by the government and remains fixed throughout the season, the amount a picker
       can earn per day average drops by more than five times, and the effort per kilogram of picked cotton
       increases. By this time, many local pickers leave their brigades. Farmers and pahta shtabs have to
       rely on people brought in from urban population centers to pick the cotton.

                 “During the first picking, mothers-in-law with daughters-in-law and children come.
                 Everybody comes with the families. And during the second and the third picking nobody
                 comes.”
                                                                     —farmer, Bagdad District, Fergana

                 “For the first pass, people pick up to 100 kg of cotton per day, but for the second picking
                 less than 50 kg per day, and for the third pass they pick 30 kg of cotton in a day. They pick
                 less and they earn much less money—about Soum 5,000–6,000 per day, people don’t want
                 to come for this money … Therefore it is necessary to make the fees higher for the second
                 and third passes. For example, Soum 200, 300, or 400 per kg, then more people will come
                 for the third picking.”
                                                                          —farmer, Bagdad District, Fergana

                                                     39
72.	   During focus groups, farmers revealed that if they have to fully rely on the pickers provided by the
       cotton shtab, they might end up with poor-quality pickers from urban areas, which will delay the
       harvest until the start of the rainy season and lower the quality of the cotton. To avoid ending up
       in such a situation, farmers said they invite the family members of their permanent farm workers
       to come pick cotton. For example, if a farmer has 20 permanent workers, he/she might be able to
       form a brigade of 40–50 pickers. If three to four neighboring farmers merge these workers into one
       brigade, they should be able to organize a brigade of 150–200 motivated pickers.

73.	   Farmers from Jizzakh and Syrdaryo mentioned employing another strategy—hiring some good
       pickers from urban areas or rural areas in other districts, and paying them more than the official
       rate. Farmers in Jizzakh claimed that in their district, labor shortages for picking cotton are very
       high. In response, one focus group participant claimed to have brought in 10 relatives from another
       district, gave them accommodation and food, and paid them an additional Soum 15,000 per day so
       they would agree to pick cotton. In Syrdaryo, one cotton farmer said that when he realized he did
       not have enough pickers, he went personally to a nearby city and asked an urban mahalla office to
       bring him 40–50 good pickers.

Daily schedules
74.	   Cotton pickers from local areas who participated in the focus groups were asked to describe the
       typical day of a cotton picker. The day starts at 5–6 am and ends at 4–5 pm; pickers are thus in the
       field 10–12 hours a day. In the morning, pickers from local communities walk to the field or are
       transported by buses arranged by the pahta shtabs. At lunchtime, farmers must provide them with
       a hot meal. This is a general rule that hokimiyats carefully monitor. Pickers from local communities
       can bring their own lunch or, if their houses are nearby, go home for lunch to, say, check on their
       children. People from outside the local community who were mobilized by the pahta shtab usually
       start work later (8–10 am) and finish at 5 pm. They are given some form of accommodation, usually
       in government buildings such as schools and local colleges, and are given food three times a day.

75.	   Farmers often start their day at 5 am by meeting with neighboring farmers to discuss how many
       people will work their land that day, and whether anyone should be relocated from one farmer
       to another. For example, it might be the case that pickers were supposed to work on the field of
       a particular farmer, but if there are not many open cotton bolls on his fields, and if his neighbor’s
       fields are ready for picking, farmers can agree to relocate pickers to the second farmer. During the
       day, farmers are in the field to provide pickers with working equipment and arrange for lunch. In the
       late evening, farmers meet with the pahta shtabs to report the amount of cotton harvested, discuss
       the schedule for the next day, and cover any possible problems that could occur.

Payments
76.	   According to cotton pickers in Syrdaryo, Fergana, and Karakalpakstan, pickers are paid once every
       five days and delays are rare. In Jizzakh, pickers said they receive cash payments on a daily basis.
       Each brigade has a weigh man and an accountant who each day weigh the amount of raw cotton
       picked by each person. The cotton is then delivered to the CGP, where the approximate amount of
       dirt is estimated and deducted from the amount for which payment is made. The fee per kilogram
       is the same for all regions and is set by the government once a year. It does not differ by passes.

77.	   Farmers were said to not be involved in the payment process. CGPs and state banks are responsible
       for paying pickers. According to the mahalla leader in Fergana, an employee from the state bank
       comes to the field and pays the pickers directly. Farmers in Karakalpakstan said that brigade heads
       sometimes receive the money from the bank and then distribute it among pickers. To motivate and
       attract more pickers, farmers in Syrdaryo and Karakalpakstan said that they use their own personal
       money to pay pickers daily. Only those farmers who have such cash available can afford to do this.

Box 1. Mini case study (Fergana): Cotton farmer

                           Respondent: Female, 46 years old, established the farm in 2005. She has a
                           secondary vocational education in agronomy. Before establishing the farm she
                           worked as a specialist in a biological lab. She has a husband and two grown-up
                           sons. All of them help her on the farm, together with her two brothers-in-law,
                           particularly during the cotton-picking season.

                           Farm characteristics: Total farm size is 60 ha divided over 13 plots of land, each
                           varying between 9.2 and 0.9 ha. In 2014 she cultivated cotton on 28.6 ha and
                           wheat on 31.4 ha. Overall soil quality is good (ball bonitet is higher than 50
                           points). She has 26 full-time employees.

                          Productivity of cotton: On average, the respondent obtains about 3 tons of raw
cotton from 1 ha. In 2014 she harvested 80 tons of cotton, 70 percent of which was first-grade cotton, 23
percent second and third grade, and 7 percent was fifth grade.

In 2014, 100–200 people were involved in picking cotton on the farm. These were divided over four passes
as follows:

1st pass: 15 days, 150–200 people
2nd pass: 10 days, 150–200 people
3rd pass: 5–6 days, 100 people
4th pass: 5–6 days, 100 people

Average costs for manual cotton picking in 2014 were Soum 250,000 per 1 ha.

Hiring pickers: The farmer’s land is located closely to the villages, and the farmer does not have a problem
hiring pickers. According to the respondent, farmers submit their application for the number of pickers
needed to the cotton shtab when cotton bolls are 70 percent to 80 percent open. Then three or four
farmers whose land is close to each other receive one brigade of 150–200 pickers (people from local
areas). Then these farmers agree among themselves where pickers will start work first and where they will
go next. If there are not enough pickers, the shtab can send additional brigades comprised of people from
urban areas. However, these groups pick less cotton and pick cotton with more dirt and leaves. Moreover,
these groups work mostly two days a week (Saturday and Sunday).

Mechanization: Mechanization has not yet been introduced in the district. Despite the fact that the farmer
does not have a problem hiring pickers, she is interested in using machines to harvest cotton on her land.
Her opinion is based on the experience of farmers who grew cotton in the Soviet times. She said that
she heard from them that machines can harvest cotton of high quality and do not leave cotton in the
fields. She believes that mechanization will help reduce cotton harvest costs and timing. The farmer could
afford to lease the machine for 10 years. In her opinion, farmers, not MTPs, should be provided with the
machines. If at least some farmers purchased them, they could quickly harvest their cotton and then help
their neighbors. As a result, most farmers would be able to harvest cotton before the rainy season and
get cotton of good quality. If MTPs are provided with the machines, farmers will have to submit official
applications for them and there will be long waiting times to get them. There will be no guarantee that the
cotton will be harvested on time.

Characteristics of cotton pickers
78.	         Local government officials and leaders interviewed for our study estimated that between 14 and
             20 percent of the district population was involved in picking cotton in 2014. Of these, 70 percent
             to 85 percent were said to be from rural areas, and about one-third (Bayaut District, Syrdaryo) to
             four-fifths (Beruniy District, Karakalpakstan) of all pickers were from local communities. Pickers are
             mostly female and typically between 20 and 40 years old (see Table 5).

79.	         Three main types of cotton pickers were distinguished. These are (i) local villagers with relatives
             who work as permanent laborers for a cotton farmer and then pick cotton on these farms, possibly
             also to reinforce social bonds; (ii) local villagers without relatives who work permanently for a
             farmer, but are involved in cotton picking on a nearby farm, usually for farmers they know; and
             (iii) people from outside the district and urban areas who are brought in to the area to pick cotton,
             usually on the more remote (and sometimes lower-yielding) farms.

80.	         Participants in focus groups with local rural cotton pickers were asked what different wealth
             groups exist in their community and roughly what proportion of each group is involved in picking
             cotton. The aim of this exercise was to identify the wealth status of cotton pickers and assess what
             proportion might be especially vulnerable. In all four regions, respondents claimed that households
             in their community could be divided into three groups: wealthy, middle income, and vulnerable.

             •	          Wealthy households, comprising between 10 and 15 percent of the local population.
                         Cotton pickers participating in focus groups claimed that the main characteristic of this
                         group is that they have some savings and/or extra income they can invest. This group
                         was said to include farmers, traders, entrepreneurs, high-level government workers, and
                         dehkans. Cotton pickers who participated in focus groups in all five sites claimed that
                         20 percent to 50 percent of members from this group pick cotton, mostly to help their
                         relatives who are cotton farmers meet the state quota.
             •	          Middle-income households, about 70 percent to 80 percent of the rural population. This
                         includes government workers, teachers, doctors, dehkans who rent land from farmers,
                         and daily wage laborers in the agricultural and industrial sector. This group’s main feature
                         was said to be that households manage to meet their daily needs but have limited
                         opportunities to save money. Most of these households have members who pick cotton.
             •	          Vulnerable households (5 percent to 15 percent of the population). Focus groups with
                         cotton pickers suggested that this group consists of the most vulnerable households.
                         Respondents stated that this group includes “lazy” households (those with young male

                                                                    42
                    members who were said not to want to do any heavy work); elderly people living without
                    their children; households that have lost a breadwinner, such as divorced women or
                    widows with children; and households with members that have disabilities. Households
                    from this group have trouble earning enough money to cover their basic needs. Fifty to
                    eighty percent have members who pick cotton. However, the total number of hours worked
                    in cotton fields tends to be lower for this group than for middle-income households. Some
                    households in this group have no members who can pick cotton due to old age or poor
                    health.

Seasonal distribution of demand for casual labor in agriculture
81.	     During focus groups with pickers, participants were asked which months they and other
         agricultural workers in the area are most and least busy working in agriculture. A distinction
         was made between demand from cotton farmers, demand from non-cotton farmers, and labor
         requirements for their own kitchen gardens (tomorkas). Participants were asked to use a scale from
         1 to 5 for each month, where a score of 1 implies people are least busy and 5 indicates they are most
         busy. The average of the four groups is presented in Figure 4.

   Figure 4. Distribution of demand for casual labor throughout the year by (i) cotton farmers; (ii) non-
                        cotton farmers; and (iii) kitchen gardens owned by laborers

                                                                                     period

82.	     As shown, at the beginning of the cotton harvest in September, agricultural day workers face
         competing demand for work on their own tomorkas, while demand from farmers for work on
         wheat and other non-cotton crops lowers somewhat but is still high. In October, however, when
         demand for cotton-harvesting labor continues to peak, demand for labor in other agricultural
         activities lowers further. Agricultural workers are busiest from March to July with irrigation (men)
         and weeding (women) of wheat and vegetables, as well as harvesting vegetables. Wheat is harvested
         in July, reducing farmer demand for non-cotton labor after that. Some farmers and dehkans that
         grow vegetables, rice, and horticultural crops require harvesting labor in August and September,
         which competes with the cotton harvest for labor demand.

83.	     Overall demand for agricultural labor during the cotton harvest is highest in the research sites
         in Fergana and South Karakalpakstan, and lowest in Jizzakh (see Figure 5). Fergana has a high
         proportion of land under horticulture, for which harvesting labor needs are high from July to
         September. In South Karakalpakstan, labor is relatively scarce and there is a high demand for labor

                                                            43
        to harvest horticultural crops, melons, rice, and vegetables during this same period. In Jizzakh,
        where farmers mostly grow wheat and cotton, overall demand for agricultural laborers seems to
        drop in August, making local laborers available for part-time work picking cotton. In all four areas,
        pickers harvest crops from their tomorka in July–September, with the amount of work dropping
        during late September–October.

84.	    Women typically participate in weeding and picking cotton, while casual male workers are
        involved in land preparation, irrigation, and cutting cotton stalks. Men are usually employed as
        farmers’ full-time workers, while women do their tasks part time. Women tend to be responsible
        for most of the work on the tomorkas (see next section), except it is generally men’s duty to water
        these gardens. Picture 5 shows a tomorka in winter in Karakalpakstan.

Alternative income sources
85.	    Cotton-picking households typically have multiple sources of income. Daily wage work for a farmer
        is an important component of this, especially for women. Men also have work opportunities

                                                              44
           outside the agricultural sector. Focus group discussions with cotton pickers and mini case studies
           revealed that men may have formal full-time employment contracts with farmers and work for
           them as mechanics or drivers, or farm managers. Payments were often said to be made in kind in
           the form of wheat, cotton stalks, or the right to use a piece of land to grow secondary crops. Women
           usually work for farmers for only six months each year. This includes four months of weeding of
           cotton and wheat and two months picking cotton. They may also have contracts with farmers. For
           example, in Syrdaryo and Fergana, some women who do weeding for farmers have contracts with
           them. Payments for weeding wheat and cotton were said to reach Soum 30,000 per ha in cash and
           in kind. Women typically weed about 2 ha per month and thus might reach a monthly income of
           Soum 60,000 (about US$20–24).
86.	       Tomorkas are an important source of income for cotton-picking households. Cotton pickers’
           households typically have 0.06–0.1 ha of land near their house, which they use to grow fruits
           and vegetables. Part of the harvest is used for households’ own consumption, while the rest is
           sold on the local market. If a household member has an employment contract with a farmer, the
           household can be allocated a plot of that farmer’s land (0.2–1 ha) to grow secondary crops after
           wheat is harvested. Households usually grow vegetables on this land, which they sell on the local
           market or to middlemen. Usually, women are responsible for cultivating crops on the tomorka and
           the extra plots of farm land. Livestock is also an important source of income and can be sold when
           the household needs money, such as for a wedding or in times of illness.
87.	       Dehkan farmers—smallholders that typically own about 0.5–2ha on which they are free to grow
           what they want—do not usually pick cotton. They instead prefer to use their own land to cultivate
           horticultural crops or rice, for which the peak labor demand coincides with the beginning of the
           cotton harvest. However, dehkans that also have employment contracts with farmers and rent
           farmland from them to grow secondary crops normally pick cotton on these farmers’ land.
88.	       Participants in focus groups with cotton pickers in all sites conveyed that working opportunities
           outside the agricultural sector are very limited, especially for women. This is especially so for
           full-time jobs. These are usually only available in factories located in urban areas, and are often
           only considered suitable for men. An average monthly salary was said to be around Soum 300,000
           per month (US$100–120), part of which they have to spend on transportation costs. Some cotton
           pickers (especially the women) claimed that such costs make these jobs less attractive.
89.	       As mentioned, there are substantial wage gaps between men and women. However, for both men
           and women, wage rates between rural and urban areas do not differ much. No official statistics
           on wages exist in Uzbekistan. Using the 2013 World Bank/GIZ Uzbekistan Jobs, Skills, and Migration
           Survey data, we note that on an annual basis, wages for women are one-third below those of
           males, and during the peak agricultural season about 40 percent less. Wage levels in rural areas
           are about one-tenth lower than in urban areas. However, during the peak agricultural season (July–
           September), the wages in rural areas are almost equal to those in urban areas. Differences between
           parts of the country are also quite significant (see Table 6).

90.	    Discussions with focus group participants confirmed that rural gender wage gaps can be
        substantial, with daily wages being up to 50 percent lower for women compared to men.
        Estimates of respondents for each of the four regions (summarized in Table 6) also confirmed that
        wage differences can be substantial across the country. According to their estimates, daily wages
        for unskilled agricultural work, for example, are lower in Jizzakh and Syrdaryo then in Fergana (see
        Figure 6).

91.	    Farmers in Syrdaryo claimed that households in the area may have members who have migrated
        to Russia and Kazakhstan, Turkey, or South Korea, and the remittances they receive from them
        represent a significant portion of their available budget. These households were said to be relatively
        well off and their members usually do not pick cotton. In none of the other sites were remittances
        from labor migration named as an important source of income. Also, some farmers who participated
        in focus groups in Syrdaryo reported that local pickers were less available in recent years due to
        migration. They said that women whose husbands work abroad no longer picked cotton. Farmers
        claimed that these households have a high enough income, and so need not rely on what can be
        earned from cotton picking.

92.	     In all visited districts, local experts and pickers said that vulnerable households could apply to
         the mahalla office for social assistance. If a household is granted assistance, it will receive Soum
         150,000 per month (US$50–60) for six months. A household can apply for social assistance only
         once a year and only receive it for up to half a year. Mahalla leaders claimed there are strict quotas
         for providing the assistance. For example, in our study site in Jizzakh, in 2014 the mahalla office
         had a maximum of 17 households out of 1,200 households who were eligible for social assistance
         from the government. Every year, the VAC receives 30–40 applications but is only allowed to select
         17 households. In Syrdaryo, only 10 out of a total of 570 households could be provided with social
         assistance.

93.	     According to mahalla leaders, there is a special committee whose members visit each household
         that applied for social assistance, and then make a decision. Cotton pickers who participated in
         the focus groups believed that only the most vulnerable households should apply for the assistance,
         such as those with members with disabilities, elderly people with no children to support them, or
         mothers who have lost their husbands. They stated that due to the low quotas for social assistance,
         it is shameful for a household that has enough income to apply for this. Box 2 presents a case study
         of a vulnerable household.


 Box 2. Mini case study (Fergana): Vulnerable household

 Respondent: Female, 39 years old, school-level education, involved in picking cotton since 1995.

 Household composition: Respondent, her husband, and three children (a 20-year-old son and two seven-
 year-old twin daughters).

                                              Sources of income: The respondent’s husband and son work
                                              as daily wage laborers in the mahalla as builders. The husband
                                              earns around Soum 800,000 per month (US$270–320); the
                                              son earns Soum 25,000–35,000 per day and works seven
                                              to eight days a month. His monthly income is about Soum
                                              200,000 (US$67–80).

                                          The household has a tomorka of 0.09 ha on which it grows
                                          fruits, vegetables, and nuts. In 2014, in addition to its own
                                          consumption, the household sold 300 kg of potatoes (at Soum
                                          1,300 per kg), 200 kg of corn (at Soum 1,000 per kg), and 150
                                          kg of nuts (at Soum 3,000 per kg). The total income from their
 tomorka in 2014 was Soum 1.04 million (US$340–400).

 The respondent has a chronic disease that makes her unable to work outside the house except to pick
 cotton. This year her health got worse and she was not able to participate in the cotton harvest. However,
 her neighbor—who is a cotton farmer—kindly hired her to cook lunch for cotton pickers. This provided an
 extra Soum 800,000 (US$270–320).

 According to the respondent, households that are involved in picking cotton do not receive social assistance
 from the mahalla. They believe that if a household is in need, its members should pick cotton to earn
 enough to support themselves. However, since the respondent participated in picking cotton since 1995
 and could not do it this year due to her poor health, she was included on the list of social assistance
 recipients. The assistance was Soum 145,000 per month (US$48–58) and lasted for six months.


Cotton-picking fees and benefits
94.	     Rural cotton pickers who participated in our study consider picking cotton to be a seasonal part-

                                                     47
       time job. On average, one picker was said to work in the cotton fields between 42 and 60 days in
       a season. Most of these days (20–30) are typically spent picking cotton in September during the first
       pass, when cotton is easiest to pick and more can be picked in a day (and thus yield higher earnings).
       In October, during the second pass, there is less cotton in the field. Pickers said that during this
       period they work for 15–20 days, and only 7–10 days during the third and fourth. It is difficult to
       earn a decent amount during these last rounds as there is little cotton left in the field.

95.	   In 2014 cotton pickers were paid Soum 217 per kg of raw cotton (US$0.72–0.86). The fee is the
       same across the country, irrespective of labor scarcity or how difficult it is to pick the cotton.
       The payment is made in cash every two to five days. The gross fee is Soum 235 per kg, but a labor
       tax of 7.5 percent is deducted, leaving Soum 217 per kg. If a farmer wants to pay more per kg to
       attract laborers, they must use their own money. As mentioned, study respondents in Syrdaryo and
       Karakalpakstan claimed to witness this practice in their area.

96.	   As an additional bonus and to boost motivation, pickers are given cotton oil if they meet a daily
       quota. A picker will receive 1 liter of cotton oil (worth Soum 5,000) if he/she meets a certain daily
       quota set by the pahta shtab and the farmers. The quota differs by pass. During the first pass the
       quota is the highest—a person needs to pick 80–100 kg in a day to receive 1 liter of oil. During
       the second pass this is 50–60 kg of raw cotton, and during the third and fourth pass, 20–30 kg.
       On average, pickers are able to meet the quota once every two to four days. Cotton pickers who
       participated in our focus groups claimed they received on average 14 to 28 liters of oil per season.

97.	   The practice of providing bonuses in the form of cotton oil was observed in all study sites. According
       to pickers, it is a relatively new practice that started in 2011. In Syrdaryo, farmers, together with the
       pahta shtab, extended the practice and give pickers bonuses in the form of sugar and soap. People
       who picked 100 kg a day for five days in a row receive 1 kg of sugar and two bars of soap. Pickers
       in Karakalpakstan, however, claimed that farmers there only gave them cotton oil during the third
       pass, when they would receive 1 liter if they picked 60 kg of cotton in a day (see Table 7).

                 “The  income of my husband is about 70 percent of our annual income. It means that 30
                 percent of our income is what I earn from picking cotton. This includes cotton oil, sugar,
                 and soap that we receive for picking cotton. We receive enough oil and sugar for the whole
                 year, until the next cotton picking season.”
                                                           —female cotton picker, Bayaut District, Syrdaryo

98.	   Cotton pickers said that receiving cotton oil as a bonus is an important motivation for them. When
       the practice was introduced, more people reportedly became interested in picking cotton. Elderly
       family members would come to the field to help younger ones meet the daily quota. Several family
       members would pick, but just one family member would submit the cotton. Households use the oil
       for cooking, and the amount of oil one picker is able to obtain in a season may cover a household’s
       consumption for six to eight months. As shown in Table 7, the cooking oil bonus can add 10 percent
       to 18 percent to cotton-picking income. According to cotton pickers who participated in our study,
       pickers typically earn between Soum 600 and 1,500 per person per season, which is equivalent to
       US$200–600. The last column of Table 7 shows the average rural water rate for rural Uzbekistan
       for work outside the cotton sector. As shown, only earnings during the first and second pass can
       compete with the rural wage rate.

                 “I come to the field to pick cotton very early in the morning and stop working at 5–6 pm.
                 I try my best to pick 100 kg of cotton to receive 1 liter of oil and as a consequence our
                 household does not buy oil from September until the spring. This season I received 54 liters
                 of cotton oil. We consume around ten liters of oil per month, I have a daughter, she is a
                 student and she also takes some oil with her when she comes home. It means that the oil
                 that I received during the cotton season will be enough for our household for the next five
                 months.”

99.	             In addition to bonuses, pahta shtabs and mahalla offices were said to provide “prizes” to the best
                 pickers. These come from local entrepreneurs and organizations. Cotton pickers said prizes include
                 towels, watches, DVD players, utensils, and so on. There is no particular quota to qualify for these
                 prizes. The practice, including the type of prizes awarded, varies significantly by area.

100.	            Farmers are expected to provide local rural pickers with one meal per day, but focus group
                 discussions revealed that this is not appreciated by all pickers. Farmers were said to receive
                 prepayments from the CGPs to prepare lunches. Pahta shtabs and mahalla offices monitor that
                 these lunches (see Picture 6) are indeed provided. Cotton pickers who participated in our study
                 reported that in particular, female pickers do not think this is necessary. Female pickers in Jizzakh
                 said it might take up to two to three hours to feed everyone, and they prefer to bring their own
                 lunches. They claim the quality of the lunch can be poor. In Syrdaryo and Fergana, pickers said they
                 are given lunch every day and are satisfied with its quality. In Syrdaryo male pickers said that each
                 day when they submit their harvest, 5–10 kg of raw cotton is deducted to pay those who cooked
                 lunch. In Karakalpakstan, female pickers said they mostly go home for lunch. Farmers cook lunches
                 mostly during the first and second pass when there are a lot of people in the field, or when the plot
                 is located far from the population area. Pickers suggested that farmers could provide lunch every
                 other day instead of daily.

101.	   Permanent farm laborers whose relatives pick cotton on the farm of their employer might receive
        additional bonuses in the form of cotton stalks. These are mostly used as fuel for cooking and
        heating homes during winter. A farm worker’s household is typically allowed to harvest cotton stalks
        from 1.5–2 ha of farmland. One ha provides between 500 and 1,000 bunches of cotton stalks (see
        Picture 7). The market price for stalks is about Soum 1,000 per bundle, and thus all cotton stalks for
        the farm workers’ household may be worth Soum 0.75–2 million (US$250–650). About 500 bundles
        of cotton stalks cover one household’s consumption for one year. If a household harvests 1,000
        bunches of cotton stalks, keeps 500 bunches and sells the rest, it will generate Soum 0.5 million of
        additional income (US$170–200).

The importance of picking cotton in local livelihoods
102.	   Data gathered from focus groups with cotton pickers across the five research sites revealed that
        income from cotton picking typically represents between 10 and 15 percent of annual income of
        rural middle and low-income households. For some households this can be as high as 30 percent.
        The mean among all our respondents was 12.4 percent. Cotton pickers who participated in focus
        groups were asked how many of their household members picked cotton in 2014, how much
        households earned in total from cotton picking, and what proportion of their annual household
        income this represents. Findings showed that rural households can earn between Soum 0.4–2.5
        million (US$150–800) from cotton picking. The mean is Soum 1 million (US$330–370). Focus groups

                                                    50
              in Fergana and Syrdaryo suggested that households in these areas might even earn on average
              Soum 1.1 million and Soum 1.3 million, respectively. Of course, the amount earned depends on the
              number of household members that participated in picking cotton and the number of days they
              worked in the field (see Table 8).

103.	         Focus groups with pickers suggested that the proportion of cotton-picking income versus
              total annual income tends to be higher for rural middle-income households (up to 20 percent
              or sometimes even 30 percent) than for the most vulnerable in rural communities (around 10
              percent). Rural middle-income households might have several household members who pick cotton,
              work the whole day (6 am–4 pm) in the field, and are motivated to earn as much cash as possible. In
              contrast, vulnerable households often consist of pensioners or women with small children who can
              only work half of the day, or due to health reasons cannot pick much cotton.

104.	         Cotton picking has several advantages compared to other daily agricultural wage labor. Payment
              is made in cash, which is advanced by state banks and made almost immediately after the work
              is completed (usually every two to five days during the season). This is attractive, given the severe
              shortage of cash in the economy. In contrast, permanent farm workers usually are paid in kind in
              the form of the harvest product (such as wheat), or they might be given a piece of land on which
              to grow secondary crops. Even if a farmer pays workers in cash, workers might be paid two to three
              months later, after the farmer has sold the harvest. Farmers simply do not have the liquidity to pay
              their workers in cash until after they have sold their harvests. Box 3 presents a case study of a cotton
              picker in Jizzakh.

 Box 3. Mini case study (Jizzakh): Cotton picker
                                          Socioeconomic background of the respondent: The respondent
                                          is a 31-year-old woman. The household consists of five members
                                          (the respondent, her husband, and their three children). The
                                          respondent has completed only secondary education. The
                                          household has a tomorka. Their main source of income is working
                                          on the land of other farmers.
                                        Employment and income: The respondent earns money by
                                        weeding crops for farmers in spring and picking cotton in autumn.
                                        In total, she has paid work during five months of the year. The rest
                                        of the time she works on the tomorka. She was paid 600 kg of
 wheat for weeding a farmer’s cotton land.
 The respondent’s husband works full time for a farmer. He is responsible for irrigation and is paid in kind.
 His annual income is 1,000 kg of wheat. Apart from that he is allowed to cultivate 0.2 ha of the farmer’s
 land throughout the year. On another 0.5 ha he is allowed to grow secondary crops after the farmer has
 finished harvesting wheat. The farmer lets his workers decide how they want to receive the payment; in
 cash or in kind. The household decided to receive the payment in kind.
 The wheat that the household receives as payment is used to make bread. It is almost enough for a year.
 The respondent sells small amounts of the wheat the husband received whenever they need cash. They
 grow vegetables on the land they received from the farmer, and sell them to a middleman who is the
 respondent’s brother-in-law. He in turn sells it in Tashkent. They earned 4.5 million Soum (US$1500–1700)
 selling vegetables this year.
 Importance of picking cotton: The respondent picks cotton every day in September, 15 days in October,
 and one week in November. She works from 7 am to 7 pm and usually picks 100–120 kg of cotton a day. In
 total, she earned Soum 960,000 plus 25 liters of oil worth Soum 125,000, making for a total of Soum 1.085
 million (US$350–400).
 She spent the amount she received in September (Soum 600,000) to buy her children some school clothes.
 The money for her work in October (Soum 300,000) was spent on a jacket for herself (Soum 120,000)
 and some food for the winter. The amount she earned in November was spent on food. The respondent
 calculated that her income from working on cotton fields (weeding and picking) represents 15 percent to 20
 percent of the total household income. The respondent stated that without the opportunity to pick cotton,
 they will lose a significant part of their income. It might affect her in autumn when she needs to buy clothes
 for her children. If she can no longer pick cotton, she will not search for other income opportunities, but
 instead spend more time working on the tomorka and another piece of land the household is cultivating.

105.	    Discussions with female cotton pickers indicated that households plan how they will spend the
         money earned from picking cotton. Across all five sites, households spend cotton-picking money
         on the following categories:
         •	        Livestock. The money can be invested in, say, a cow. After feeding it for a year it can be
                   sold on the market, allowing them to further raise their income.
         •	        School uniforms, books, and equipment for children. Cotton picking takes place in early
                   autumn, which is also the start of Uzbekistan’s school year. Cash earned from picking
                   cotton enables families with school-age children to purchase uniforms and equipment.
         •	        Weddings. Many families arrange weddings after the cotton season so that some of the
                   costs can be covered with the money earned from picking cotton. People also use cotton-
                   picking money to buy wedding presents. Focus group participants in Syrdaryo claimed it
                   is traditional to present a significant amount of money to their relatives when they get
                   married. Close relatives are expected to give Soum 0.5 million (US$170–200).
         •	        Dowry. In some cases, the bride’s family collects a dowry to give to the daughter. In poor
                   families, young women may have to work in order to put together their own dowry. A
                   young participant of the focus group in Jizzakh said that she had set a goal at the beginning

                                                      52
                         of the season to earn enough money for her family to buy everything she needed for her
                         dowry. She picked 100 kg of raw cotton a day and earned a total of Soum 700,000 during
                         the season. The amount was enough to cover almost all costs. She was very proud that she
                         had managed to do this herself.
            •	           Preparing the winter. Cotton pickers who participated in focus groups in Fergana, Syrdaryo,
                         and Karakalpakstan conveyed that income from cotton picking helps households prepare
                         for the winter. They use it to buy coal and wood for heating; winter clothes; and wheat and
                         other food that is more expensive during the winter season.
106.	       Rural middle-income households that participated in focus groups in Tashkent region thought
            that picking cotton was a good way to earn extra money without making others think they are in
            need of extra cash. They claimed that doing other unskilled agricultural work might be shameful,
            as it lets the community know they are short on money. That problem does not exist with picking
            cotton, however, as it is considered less shameful and more socially acceptable for this group.

Health impacts of cotton picking
107.	       Mahalla leaders and representatives of pahta shtabs in all five sites claimed there are minimal
            health impacts involved in cotton picking and that cotton pickers in the field experienced no serious
            illnesses during the last cotton harvest, or those in previous years. A representative of the pahta
            shtab in the selected sites in Syrdaryo and South Karakalpakstan stated that a number of cotton
            pickers (estimated at 5 percent in Syrdaryo) fell ill during the last cotton season. The most common
            illnesses reported were colds and upset stomachs caused by drinking unboiled water.
108.	       Students who pick cotton for the first time (starting from third-year college students onwards)
            were said to become sick more often, according to the mahalla leaders and pahta shtab
            representatives interviewed for our study. The reason was said to be that they are not used to hard
            work in the field and have to eat food they are not accustomed to. Elderly people picking cotton
            were also reported to be sick more often. Ambulances and mobile clinics were said to be available
            for check-ups and to provide medication to those who get sick.
109.	       Cotton pickers reported in detail on the different illnesses that affect them in the field. Only cotton
            pickers in Karakalpakstan claimed there were limited negative impacts of cotton picking. The most
            common sicknesses reported in the other sites were backache, colds, headache, allergic reactions
            to defoliants, and exacerbation of chronic diseases.37
            •	        The most common medical condition that impacts cotton picking was said to be backache.
                      Cotton pickers participating in focus groups in Syrdaryo, Fergana, and Jizzakh stated that
                      either they experienced backaches or they knew other people who had. Backaches are
                      caused by carrying loads of cotton around in their aprons, which can be quite heavy. This
                      particularly affects women as they tend to pick more cotton. It forces them to take several
                      days off and purchase medical ointment to reduce or treat the pain.
            •	        The common cold is the second most common illness that affects cotton pickers. It was
                      said to be caused by working in the rain or chilly morning weather, or in hot weather
                      conditions that make pickers sweat and then cool down in chilly wind. Colds were
                      mentioned in all five study sites except in Karakalpakstan. Usually those who catch a cold
                      take two to seven days off to take medicine and recover at home.
            •	        Headaches from and allergic reactions to the chemicals used to defoliate the cotton plant
                      were mentioned by cotton pickers in Syrdaryo and Fergana as problems that had affected
                      them or others. Focus group participants in these sites claimed that cotton picking might
                      exacerbate chronic diseases such as gynecological or kidney-related diseases.

110.	       Illnesses caused or exacerbated by picking cotton contribute to additional and often unforeseen
            expenses for the worker. This can range from Soum 50,000–60,000 (US$30–35) to even Soum
            100,000 (US$60–70).
37. According to the GoU, if cotton pickers have any medical problems, medical support is provided on site. People must pass a “medical commission”
to be cleared for work in the field.

                                                                       53
5. Types of cotton farmers and their harvesting costs
111.	   During focus group discussions, cotton farmers were asked to divide cotton farmers in their area
        into broad groups of different wealth and describe characteristics of each group. In all five study
        sites, participants described three groups: well-off farmers, middle-income farmers, and vulnerable
        farmers. This chapter describes each of these groups and their characteristics. These groups are not
        based on statistical analysis of wealth data, but instead reflect the views and perceptions of those
        who participated in the discussions.

“Better-off” or “golden” farmers
112.	   In each of the five sites, well-off farmers were said to comprise about 10 percent to 20 percent
        of cotton farmers. These cotton farmers are also referred to as “powerful,” “rich,” “golden,”
        or “giant” farmers. The main feature of this group is that their revenues exceed their expenses,
        and they manage to make a profit from cotton farming. They distinguish themselves from other
        groups in that (i) their farm land is located close to population points and has good-quality soil
        (ball bonitet is 60–65 points or higher) and access to a reliable supply of irrigation water; (ii) their
        income is generated by different types of crops, and, in addition to wheat and cotton, they also
        grow horticultural crops and keep livestock; (iii) their farm size varies from 80 ha to 100 ha; and
        (iv) they tend to have high yields and produce up to 150 percent of their state-mandated cotton
        production quota.
113.	   Farmers in the well-off group have adequate resources to plough, sow, weed, and harvest their
        crops on time. They have their own machinery (up to five different types) and do not depend on the
        service of the MTPs for their farm activities. For labor they rely on their permanent workers, who
        each bring in family members and people from local communities to harvest the cotton. As noted
        in the previous chapter, cotton pickers from the local area are motivated to work on these farmers’
        land for a number of reasons. First, their land is closer to population points, reducing travel time to
        the field. Second, the quality of their cotton is better, allowing pickers to harvest more cotton per
        day than on other farms, and to earn more cash in a day. Third, these farmers can afford to provide
        additional bonuses and provide pickers with a better food.
                  “I used to be a poor farmer. But I set a goal to become a well-off farmer. I knew that I
                  need machinery to achieve the goal. I worked really hard. I borrowed money to purchase
                  the first unit of machinery. Later I purchased my second unit of machinery using my own
                  money. I leased my third unit of machinery. And now I have a plan to lease a combine
                  harvester … That is why I say that the only way to help poor farmers is to provide them
                  with better leasing options.”
                                      —farmer who participated in FGDs with farmers with good-quality soil
114.	   Well-off farmers have access to a reliable source of good-quality irrigation water. They tend to
        cultivate land that is close to the beginning of the irrigation canal, where water is more plentiful than
        at its middle or end. Farmers in Fergana conveyed that those with land situated at the beginning
        of the canal also receive better quality water that is relatively free from chemicals (unlike canal
        water further downstream). Wealthy farmers tend to rely on gravity irrigation and thus do not need
        to pump water to their fields, which saves money on electricity and leaves them unaffected by
        electricity shortages or pump/pump station breakdowns. This was considered a crucial factor by
        farmers in Karakalpakstan, where focus groups with farmers suggested that only 20 percent to 25
        percent of farmers receive water through gravity irrigation. Other farmers rely heavily on pumps
        and incur higher costs to produce cotton.
115.	   Due to these favorable circumstances, well-off farmers have the highest yields: 3–3.5 tons of raw
        cotton per ha. They also incur relatively modest costs and their debts are low. Farmers in Syrdaryo,
        Fergana, and Karakalpakstan stated that only the well-off farmers are allowed to grow seed cotton,
        which CGPs purchase at the highest price. Table 9 summarizes the characteristics of well-off farmers
        for each of the four regions.

Middle-income farmers
116.	        Middle-income cotton farmers represent around 50 percent to 60 percent of all cotton farmers in
             all five sites. They make little profit from cotton due to variable yields and high production costs,
             according to the cotton farmers that participated in our focus groups. While these farmers normally
             meet the state production quota, they incur higher costs due to poorer soil quality and the more
             remote location of some of their plots. They also have more constrained access to irrigation water.
             Focus group participants reported that middle-income farmers typically manage to cover their cost
             of production and pay off loans provided by state banks, but very often make no or very little profit,
             making it difficult for them to invest in their farm by, for example, buying new machines.

117.	        In Karakalpakstan and Syrdaryo, focus group participants claimed that farmers in this middle-
             income group have high-quality soil (ball bonitet of 60) for some of their plots, while the soil on
             their other plots is of lower quality (ball bonitet of 40). The higher-quality soil is usually found
             on plots closer to population centers, while plots with lower-quality soil are located further away.
             Respondents across all sites stated that farmers in this group tend to own some machinery, but it
             is often outdated. They must therefore rent certain machines from MTPs or well-off farmers. In
             Karakalpakstan, it was said that middle-income farmers usually lack machines for land preparation.

118.	        Middle-income farmers tend to meet 90 or 100 percent of the quota and incur relatively high
             production costs. Their yields are between 2 and 3 tons of raw cotton per ha, about 1–1.5 tons per
             ha less than the well-off farmers. Due to the more remote location of their land, poorer soil quality,
             and less reliable supply of irrigation water, they tend to have higher cotton production costs than
             well-off farmers. They barely manage their production costs and their profits tend to be low or non-
             existent. They have no means to purchase new machines.

                                                                      55
119.	       Usually, these farmers’ land is located at the beginning or middle of the canal, or some are located
            at the head of the canal. Others, however, others are situated at the middle or tail end of the
            canal. Some middle-income farmers in Fergana and most in Karakalpakstan said that they depend
            on electric pump irrigation, which means they incur an additional electricity expense. Table 10
            provides further details on the characteristics of middle-income farmers in each region.

“Vulnerable” or “lagging” farmers
120.	       Vulnerable farmers are also referred to as “lagging” or “bankrupt” farmers. This group represents
            20 percent to 30 percent of all cotton farmers in the studied districts, according to respondents.
            Focus group participants in Syrdaryo and Karakalpakstan stated that farmers in this group struggle
            to meet the state quota and have no funds to invest in their farm. They have trouble repaying their
            debts to suppliers and banks, and the gross value of their harvests tends to be lower than the
            expenses they incur.

121.	       Respondents believed that limited access to water is the main cause of low yields for this group
            of farmers. Their plots are often located near the tail end of the canal, so they receive less and
            poorer-quality water than farmers upstream. Moreover, they rely on pump irrigation (except those
            in Jizzakh) and thus incur electricity expenses to operate the pumps. Insufficient irrigation results
            in shorter cotton plants, which was said to be problematic for the harvesting machines that are
            currently on the market.

                           “How can poorly performing farmers pick cotton with machines when there is not enough
                           water for their cotton! They have undersized cotton. Machines do not pick such cotton.
                           Their land is located in the droughty zone; mechanization cannot be applied there.”

122.	       The farmers in this group usually do not have any equipment or machinery as they have no money
            to buy, lease, or rent them. Cotton yields tend to be low: 1.5–2 tons of cotton per ha, and the
            cotton’s quality tends to be poorer than other farmers’ cotton.

123.	       These farmers’ lands are located far from population points (50–120 km). This makes it difficult
            for them to attract villagers to pick cotton. Instead, they rely on poorly motivated pickers from
            outside the areas, such as those brought in from urban areas by government organizations. See
            Table 11 for some of these farmers’ characteristics. As mentioned in the previous chapter, local
            pickers are least motivated to pick cotton on the fields of this group. These farmers were said to
            provide poor working conditions; water, lunch, and work equipment are reportedly insufficient for
            pickers. Secondly, the yields and quality of their cotton tend to be low, making it unattractive for
            local pickers to work on these farms.

124.	       In sum, cotton farmers’ wealth depends on quality of soil, access to machinery, location of the
            farm relative to population points, and access to irrigation water. These factors together influence
            cotton yields and production costs, and particularly influence the costs for manual cotton picking.

125.	       Vulnerable farmers tend to spend more money on cotton picking than better-off farmers. This
            is evident from a comparative analysis of costs for cotton picking of better-off and vulnerable
            farmers for Syrdaryo, Karakalpakstan, and Fergana, based on data collected in each site.
            Vulnerable farmers pay up to 35 percent to 65 percent more per kilogram of picked cotton than
            better-off farmers. This is due to workers’ higher transportation costs; the cost of providing more
            frequent meals; workers’ lower productivity; and (in South Karakalpakstan) higher bonuses and fees
            per kilogram to attract workers (see Table 12).

6. Mechanizing the cotton harvest: Potential impacts on cotton
pickers and cotton farmers
126.	   During focus group discussions with cotton pickers and farmers, participants were asked what—in
        their view—would be advantageous and disadvantageous about mechanizing the cotton harvest.
        This chapter summarizes those discussions.

Potential impact of mechanization on cotton pickers
127.	   Cotton pickers across all sites believed that cotton harvest mechanization will negatively impact
        their livelihood. Female cotton pickers were particularly concerned. They claimed that if machines
        harvest most cotton and demand for cotton-picking labor falls, it will impact their contribution to
        their household income. In addition, their household “power” and autonomy would be affected
        and their real contribution to the household budget would decline. They are unsure that they would
        find an alternative income source to compensate for the loss.

128.	   Male participants in focus groups with cotton pickers were more positive about the effects of
        mechanization. They claimed that if there are fewer jobs for cotton pickers, they will work longer
        hours on their tomorka or do some other daily wage job, such as work for dehkans that grow
        horticultural crops or vegetables. Moreover, young male participants (20–25 years old) claimed that
        mechanization would open new job opportunities for them. They believed that if the entire cotton
        harvest is mechanized, farmers and MTPs will need drivers and mechanics. If local colleges provide
        courses on how to operate these machines, they would like to take them and apply for such jobs.

129.	   In districts where labor is scarce (such as those in Jizzakh), cotton pickers raised the concern
        that mechanization would bring down daily wages for other agricultural work. Currently, due to
        high labor scarcity and significant demand for cotton pickers, as well as the fact that other crops
        (vegetables, horticultural crops) need to be harvested at the same time as cotton, farmers must pay
        higher wages to workers to harvest vegetables and horticultural crops. If there is less or no demand
        for cotton pickers, however, more labor will be available in September–November, and farmers will
        set lower daily wages for agricultural work.

130.	   Cotton pickers in all sites suggested that a positive effect of mechanization will be to eradicate
        the need for government employees (teachers, doctors) and students to pick cotton (especially
        in remote areas, where local people do not want to pick cotton). Consequently, schools and local
        hospitals will operate on a normal schedule during the cotton season.

                 “Mechanization will help a lot. Because organizations will have less problems and less
                 additional expenses. Students of universities and institutes will not stop their study. People
                 who come from Tashkent to pick cotton, had to stop their work. State expenses will be
                 reduced.”
                               —FGD with cotton farmers with poor soil quality, Pakhtakor District, Jizzakh

131.	   Local government representatives, local leaders, and farmers were more optimistic about
        the potential impact of mechanization on cotton pickers. In their view, mechanization cannot
        eliminate all demand for cotton pickers. First, some farmers in the district will keep growing seed
        cotton, which can only be harvested manually. Second, not all land is suitable for machine harvest—
        small plots, unevenly shaped plots, and plots with low soil quality and poor water availability are
        unsuitable for mechanization. Cotton that is grown on such land will either be harvested manually
        or the land will be allocated for secondary or horticultural crops. Consequently, farmers will still
        require people to work on the land. Third, machines that are currently available on the market leave
        some cotton in the field, and participants expected farmers to need to hire people to pick the cotton
        machines leave behind.

Potential impact of mechanization on cotton farmers
132.	   Overall, farmers in all four regions who participated in our study claimed that mechanization
        will offer important advantages in terms of the overall logistics of the harvesting process and
        completing the harvest on time. They stated it is easier to manage one machine and one driver
        than 100 cotton pickers. A machine can harvest the same amount of cotton in an hour that 50–100
        pickers can do in one day. Farmers in Syrdaryo and Jizzakh, where labor is scarcest, and farmers
        whose farms are located far from population centers, see the most advantages in mechanization.
        Even if machine harvesting reduces the quantity and quality of cotton harvested, the advantages
        would still outweigh the costs.

                 “With mechanization one person will replace 100 pickers. You need one machine and one
                 driver instead of 100 pickers. Now in remote lands it will be easier to harvest cotton. It will
                 be easier to harvest cotton for all farmers. They will take less time to harvest cotton, we
                 will be able to seed wheat earlier.”
                                  —participant in focus group with farmers with more than 30 ha of cotton,
                                                                                     Bagdad District, Fergana

133.	   If mechanized, the harvest can be completed in one month instead of three, which will allow
        farmers to sow wheat earlier, increasing its yield. The second advantage of completing the harvest
        on time is to avoid the rainy season. Farmers reported that rain can significantly lower cotton’s
        quality, which affects its sale price.

134.	   Farmers in Jizzakh and Syrdaryo, where part of the cotton harvest is already mechanized, pointed
        out that not all of their plots are suitable for mechanized cotton harvesting. These plots have
        irregular shapes or are rugged in the corners. Currently, farmers have to follow the state order
        to grow cotton on these fields. But they said that because machines will not be able to harvest
        cotton on such plots, they can be used to grow high-profit secondary crops instead. Discussions with
        farmers in Jizzakh revealed that some plots receive limited water, making it very difficult to ensure
        that cotton plants are of sufficient height for machine harvesting. According to farmers, such plots
        could instead be used to grow vegetables, horticultural crops, or fodder crops, all of which require
        less water.

135.	   Farmers in Jizzakh and Syrdaryo who have experience with mechanized harvesting reported it
        can save up to 50 percent of cotton-harvesting costs. Farmers in Syrdaryo claim that machine
        harvesting costs them around Soum 200,000 per ton of raw cotton, whereas manual harvesting
        costs Soum 300,000–400,000. They provided the following calculation:

        •	       Currently, farmers pay MPTs Soum 177,000 per 1 ton of raw cotton for machine harvesting.
                 The service includes the machine, a driver, and a mechanic. If a farmer has a cotton yield
                 of 3 ton per ha, he/she will need to pay the MTP Soum 531,000. In addition, the farmer
                 needs to pay for fuel. To harvest cotton from 1 ha, the harvesting machine requires 30
                 liters of diesel oil. At a market price of Soum 2,700 per liter this equals Soum 81,000. In
                 total, the farmer will have to spend Soum 612,000 for machine harvesting per ha, or Soum
                 204,000 per 1 ton of raw cotton.

        •	       For manual harvesting, the same number of cotton farmers need to pay pickers Soum
                 235,000 per ton (the current fee is Soum 235 per 1 kg, including tax). Harvesting 1 ha of
                 cotton costs the farmer Soum 705,000. On top of that, farmers need to pay for cotton oil
                 (to give pickers as a bonus) and for transportation costs. According to farmers in Syrdaryo,
                 this results in a total cost of Soum 0.9–1.2 million per ha, or Soum 300,000–400,000 per
                 ton of raw cotton.

                 “I calculated the costs for mechanized and manual harvesting of cotton, and the costs of
                 machine harvest were relatively lower. Farmers incur high costs for manual cotton picking.
                 Apart from the fee, we provide pickers with cotton oil, soap. We pay taxes on their salary.
                 We provide them with lunch. A brigade of pickers can pick cotton on one of my fields in one
                 week. I calculated that a machine did the same task in three days.”

136.	   The quality of harvesting machines led to heated discussions among farmers who participated
        in focus groups in Syrdaryo and Jizzakh. Many blamed the machines’ poor quality for the low-
        grade cotton that resulted when they harvested by machine. Nearly all farmers in Jizzakh who
        harvested by machine in 2014 got a lower price for their second-grade cotton. Only one farmer
        managed to obtain a first-grade price. Farmers in Syrdaryo, Jizzakh, and Karakalpakstan had a
        number of concerns regarding the quality of harvesting machines that are currently on the market.
        Some farmers here who participated in a mechanization pilot were given first-grade prices even if
        their cotton was second grade (probably as an encouragement). Technical issues that farmers raised
        during the discussions include those discussed in the following paragraphs.
                                                   61
137.	   A primary concern is that compared to manual cotton picking, current machines have spindles
        that result in shorter and thus lower-grade cotton fiber. The spindle is the part of the machine that
        removes the cotton from open bolls. Farmers who participated in focus groups in Karakalpakstan
        and Jizzakh claimed that the harvesting machines that were available during the Soviet era and
        harvesting machines of an American brand did not have this problem. In Karakalpakstan, some
        farmers said they wanted to see how spindles work before deciding whether to harvest by machine.
        There was an intense debate among farmers over whether the spindle can be adjusted and whether
        MTPs allow farmers to adjust these themselves.


138.	   A second concern expressed by farmers regards the fan, the part of the machine that sucks cut
        cotton into a basket. Farmers claimed that the fan is not strong enough and leaves too much
        cotton in the field. Farmers participating in focus groups in Karakalpakstan and Syrdaryo claimed that
        representatives of the factory that makes the machines closely monitored machines’ performance
        during the 2014 harvest. The representatives told farmers that the machines will be modified in the
        future.


139.	   The importance of adjusting agronomic practices of cotton cultivation to better suit machine
        harvesting was also discussed by farmers during focus groups. Farmers in Syrdaryo, as well as
        representatives of the MTPs and CGPs in Syrdaryo, Jizzakh, and Karakalpakstan, claimed that cotton
        should be grown differently if it is harvested by machine. Cotton should be planted in rows 0.9
        meters apart, but according to farmers in focus groups in Karakalpakstan and Fergana, it is currently
        planted in rows 0.6 meters apart (farmers in Jizzakh and Syrdaryo said they currently plant rows
        0.9 meters apart). However, according to farmers from Syrdaryo, even if farmers are supposed to
        plant at 0.9 meters, they do not follow that guidance very strictly when their cotton is harvested
        manually. The real distance could be between 0.7 and 0.95 meters. Farmers in Syrdaryo said that
        this year they followed the adjusted agronomic practices required for a mechanized harvest and
        claimed to not experience any significant loss in the cotton’s quality.


                 “I always sowed cotton in rows 0.6 meter apart. But in 2015 I plan to sow all my cotton in
                 rows that are 0.9 meters wide distance, so I will be able to harvest by machines. On each
                 100 tons of cotton I will save Soum 25–30 million on labor. If I harvest by machines 200
                 tons of cotton, I will save Soum 60 million. It is enough to buy a new tractor.”

140.	   Farmers who want to mechanize their harvest prefer to lease the machines instead of renting
        them from MTPs. Farmers were worried that if MTPs are in charge of managing the harvesters, they
        might charge farmers for the machines without taking responsibility for the quality of the harvested
        cotton. In Syrdaryo and Karakalpakstan, middle-income and especially “vulnerable” (low-income)
        farmers were said to rely on MTPs’ services. Well-off and some middle-income farmers have their
        own machines. However, vulnerable farmers are often indebted to the MTPs, which threatens
        many MTPs with bankruptcy. This in turn affects their operations, quality of staff, and services. In
        Jizzakh, farmers expressed concern that there is only one MTP in the area, which is too far away for
        some farmers to visit. They also raised concerns about long wait times for machines. Also, when
        the harvest is mechanized, more cotton will be taken from the field in a given time. Therefore,
        additional transportation will be needed to transport the cotton to the ginneries.

              “This year I harvested my cotton by machines on five hectares of land. These machines
              belonged to the MTPs. They have machine operators who are responsible for the operation
              of these machines. But their machine operators do not meet our requirements because the
              majority of them are young. And we, farmers, need our own machine operators.”

                 a reason for that. The machines and machine operator both belong to the MTP. But if
                 the machinery is our own, our machine operator will operate it carefully. The machine
                 operator from MTP does not spare machines; he uses it to the full power. And at such use
                 it consumes much more diesel fuel.”

                 for their production. But machine operators should do adjustment of tractors on places.
                 Everybody says that these are good tractors, and farmers want to buy them. Let them give
                 me this tractor, I will make the adjustment myself.”

141.	   Farmers are concerned about the current lack of knowledge about various aspects surrounding
        cotton harvest mechanization. They would like to know more about what machines are on the
        market, the costs involved in operating them, the implementation process of mechanization, and
        any necessary adjustments to land preparation and sowing practices. Farmers also said it is too
        expensive to buy a machine that can only be used one month out of the year, which is the case if
        harvesting machines are only suitable for one task and cannot be used for any other agricultural
        activity.


142.	   Farmers thought that mechanization would be more profitable for those with large farms—that
        is, those larger than 30 ha. Those with small plots were expected to have trouble mechanizing
        their harvests. In South Karakalpakstan, for example, farmers said that many in the area have land
        plots between 1 and 5 ha. One option could be to consolidate smaller plots into larger ones, but this
        reportedly requires a significant investment and might take two to three years.


143.	   Farmers with remote, poor-quality land with limited access to irrigation water—often the most
        vulnerable farmers—are most in need of mechanizing their harvests. This is because they have
        most difficulty finding cotton pickers and, as discussed in Chapter 4, incur the highest costs to
        have their cotton picked. Farmers in Jizzakh stated that 60 percent of farms there are located far
        from population centers, between 5 and 40 km away. Farmers here have a significant amount of
        land under cotton and trouble finding pickers. Mechanization of these cotton fields would reduce
        the need to bring in cotton pickers from outside the area. The problem also exists in Karakalpakstan,
        a region with a lot of steppes and remotely located fields.


144.	   However, study participants in all districts claimed that vulnerable/lagging/bankrupt farmers—
        who represent 10–20 percent of all farmers in the selected district—will have the most difficulty
        mechanizing the cotton harvest. In particular, these farmers cannot afford to buy or even rent
        machines. This group usually does not even have enough resources to grow and harvest cotton on
        time. Their soil is poor and they have limited access to irrigation water, which makes their cotton
        plants grow too short to be harvested by machine. Cotton production on fields of these farmers
        tends to have low or even negative returns and cotton production would not necessarily become
        the most remunerable crop for them even if mechanization would reduce their harvesting costs.

Box 4. Mini case study (Jizzakh): One cotton farmer’s experience with mechanization
Respondent: A 58-year-old male with higher education who established his farm in 1999. He started with
20 ha and now has 53 ha. Before farming, the respondent worked as a schoolteacher and used to rent small
amounts of land with horticultural crops.

                                                    Mechanization experience: The respondent has two
                                                    fields (20 ha and 33 ha); he grows wheat on one and
                                                    cotton on the other. He switches fields every year. This
                                                    year, the hokimiyat and MTP suggested the farmer
                                                    use machines to harvest cotton, as an experiment. He
                                                    agreed, and the MTP harvested 1 ha of cotton on his
                                                    land by machine. The productivity was 5 tons of raw
                                                    cotton. The farmer was very satisfied with the result
                                                    and asked the MTP to harvest the rest of the cotton, but
                                                    they said it was only an experiment, and they had to try
                                                    it on other types of land. One harvester completed the
                                                    work (1 ha of land) in less than an hour, which takes 50
                                                    pickers a whole day to do the same task. The farmer
said if he had the opportunity he would harvest all his cotton by machine. If necessary, he would grow and
weed cotton in a different way to get better quality.

The respondent believes that farmers should be allowed to buy these machines. They will take good
care of them, and the productivity and quality of cotton will be higher. Currently the MTP does not have
qualified specialists to operate these machines; all of the specialists are recent graduates with very limited
experience. They try to do the job faster to save fuel, and thus harvest cotton of lower quality. Another
option is to give machines to WCAs, which would allow farmers to have more control over them. They
would be allowed to use their own drivers and make better decisions about when the machine should
harvest cotton, and on whose field. The farmer would agree to lease the machine; he said he could repay
the cost in 10–15 years.

Potential solution for land that is not suitable for machine harvesting: The respondent suggested that
hokimiyats allocate plots with low soil quality and limited water availability (these lands are currently used
to grow cotton and wheat but which are not suitable for machine harvesting) to farmers for complexes to
breed cattle, keep bees, and to garden. If he is able to use some land for other purposes, he thinks that
he could employ about 20 people. If other cotton and wheat farmers are allowed to use such land for
purposes other than growing state-mandated crops, they will need more full-time workers and employ
people who previously worked as cotton pickers.

7. Solutions according to study respondents
146.	   In all five sites, farmers, cotton pickers, and local government officials were asked what measures
        and support services could ensure cotton harvest mechanization benefits all income groups. This
        chapter summarizes the discussions that came out of these questions.


Policy measures and support mechanisms to mediate the social effects of
mechanization for pickers, including the most vulnerable

147.	   Female pickers suggested and supported the idea of developing and organizing local-level skills
        trainings for women. Female pickers said they are aware such courses (in tailoring, baking, or
        nursing) exist in the district they would like to attend, but these are only offered in urban areas. It
        would cost a significant amount to attend them, since women would need to pay the course fee
        and cover costs for travel and lunch. Pickers from Syrdaryo offered an example of baking courses
        that are available only in the city of Guliston. The course lasts three months and costs Soum 30,000.
        Adding daily travel costs and lunch adds up to Soum 120 per month, or Soum 360,000 for an entire
        course, not including costs for study equipment and materials. Despite women’s high interest in
        attending such courses, most families cannot afford it. Women suggested it would be better if some
        courses were locally organized by experienced women. For example, a tailoring course was reported
        to be organized by an experienced woman in rural Karakalpakstan. The women teaches tailoring
        to 10 students at home, and after the course the graduate can expect to earn Soum 6,000–8,000
        per day working part time. Participants in all areas said they could afford the course fee of Soum
        30,000–40,000.

148.	   In Fergana, participants suggested that the government and banks could offer special loans to local
        entrepreneurs who want to train locals and then employ them. For example, if an entrepreneur
        decided to open a tailoring workroom, he/she would develop a business plan that includes trainings
        for people from local communities, costs of materials and equipment, and so on. Then, based on
        the business plan, the bank could approve or decline the application. These loans could be provided
        at a lower interest rate or with no pledge required.

149.	   Microloans to purchase livestock and poultry were also regarded as an attractive way to cushion
        the negative social impact of mechanization. Pickers suggested that if they were to purchase
        livestock with such loans, they could earn additional income and be in possession of a valuable food
        source for the household (dairy products, eggs, meat). The loan could be provided for at least three
        years to people who lost income due to mechanization. The loan application could be supported
        by a recommendation letter from the mahalla office. Participants from Karakalpakstan suggested
        households might use the money in the following ways:
        •	        to buy a calf (the price ranges from Soum 2.5 to 3.5 million) and then sell it after six
                  months for Soum 6–7 million;
        •	        to keep poultry. A chicken costs Soum 15,000, and each household can keep up to 100
                  chickens. The investment to start a small chicken farm is thus Soum 1.5–2.5 million.

150.	   According to cotton pickers and mahalla leaders, existing social support mechanisms would not be
        suitable to compensate the lost income in vulnerable households. First, there is a strict quota for
        the assistance. In visited areas, the quota was at least 50 percent lower than number of vulnerable
        households. Second, middle-income households lose the most income but are not eligible for social
        assistance. Third, the majority of rural households are involved in picking cotton, and even if the
        quota is increased it would be difficult for local government entities to identify households that lost
        the most income. According to focus group participants from Syrdaryo, Karakalpakstan, and Jizzakh,
        if social assistance is provided for former cotton pickers, most households will apply; this might
        cause conflicts within communities if some former pickers receive assistance while others do not.

                                                     65
        Participants also suggested that people will get used to receiving money without working. This kind
        of behavior is not respected in rural communities, and so it was believed that the social assistance
        transfers will not actually improve these households’ livelihood in the long run.

151.	   Respondents said that farmers should be allowed to lease harvesting machines, as buying them
        would be too expensive. According to respondents, a harvesting machine costs Soum 180 million
        (US$60,000–70,000). Farmers from the wealthiest group and some from the middle-income group
        said they could afford to lease one machine for 10–15 years, with a down payment of 10 percent
        to 30 percent and a 5 percent to 15 percent annual interest rate on the loan. Farmers in Syrdaryo
        suggested that leasing a machine would be more profitable for them since they will save money
        on MTP services, and some part of the money can go to repay the loan. Farmers in Karakalpakstan
        suggested it would be more convenient if CGPs lease harvesters to farmers. According to the
        suggestion, farmers would make the first payment and CGPs would deduct money annually from
        what CGPs owe farmers for the cotton.

152.	   Farmers in Jizzakh and Karakalpakstan suggested that group loans be provided to two to three
        farmers to buy machines. However, that option was said to only work for well-off and middle-
        income farmers, to minimize the risk that one of the farmers would be unable to repay his/her
        share. Vulnerable farmers might not be able to pay their share of the loan or pay maintenance costs.
        Focus group participants suggested that if well-off farmers and middle-income farmers purchase/
        lease machines, they could rent them out to vulnerable farmers and charge them lower fees than
        the MTPs currently do.

153.	   There is a concern about the availability of spare parts. Spare parts should be easily available and
        at a reasonable price, said respondents. According to farmers from Jizzakh, the government should
        set a fixed price on spares and sell these through CGPs or MTPs. It was suggested that a hotline be
        established so that farmers can complain if higher prices are charged.

154.	   Farmers in Syrdaryo and Karakalpakstan suggested that CGPs be provided with machines. A
        CGP can hire people to operate the machines and deduct the cost of the services from the money
        the CGP owes farmers. According to farmers, CGPs will take better care of the machines, and the
        arrangements and payment process will be easier for farmers. Farmers in Syrdaryo suggested that
        CGPs charge vulnerable farmers a lower tariff. Currently MTPs charge farmers the same fee in all
        study districts—Soum 177,000 per 1 ton of raw cotton.

155.	   Respondents suggested that training and seminars on mechanized farming should be organized for
        farmers as well as hokimiyat officials, MTPs, and CGPs. Experimental farms should be established
        in each district to showcase the advantages of mechanization and to teach farmers how to grow
        cotton in ways that are conducive to machine harvesting. It is also critical to make sure farmers
        know whether they will mechanize their harvest before cotton is sown, so the farmer can apply the
        correct procedures and the harvest will not suffer in quality and quantity.

8. Conclusions and recommendations
156.	   This study gathered primary data through focus group discussions with cotton pickers and cotton
        farmers, and in-depth interviews with local officials and mechanization experts across five sites in
        Uzbekistan. Together with a review of available studies and data, the following conclusions can be
        drawn.

157.	   Daily earnings from cotton picking are above rural daily wage rates for women only when they
        pick cotton on high-yielding farms (with more than 2.5 tons of raw cotton per ha) and in particular
        during the first and second pass. On these farms and during these early passes, picking productivity
        is high, as many cotton bolls are open within a given area. Pickers are able to pick 100 kg of raw
        cotton per day, and earn about US$10 per day. On the lower-yielding farms—which are often more
        remote—it takes more time to pick a particular amount of cotton, and local pickers are less keen
        to pick there. Farmers in charge of these lands have trouble finding local pickers even if they offer
        more money (above the official fee) and extra bonuses. They depend on labor brought in by the
        state from outside the area to harvest their fields. These laborers tend to be civil servants or factory
        workers, and are unmotivated and not very productive. A similar situation occurs during the third
        and fourth passes on the better yielding farms.

158.	   As the more remote and low-yielding farms have the most difficulty attracting pickers to harvest
        their cotton fields, these are the ones most in need of mechanization. However, the costs of
        growing cotton on these farms are often higher than the benefits, and mechanization might be
        unaffordable to them. Production costs are high here due to difficulty accessing a reliable supply
        of irrigation water, high costs incurred for irrigation pumps, and higher costs to attract labor. As
        a consequence, cotton cultivation on many of these farms is a loss, and many farmers are highly
        indebted. This might make it difficult for them to provide any upfront costs to rent or buy cotton-
        picking machines.

159.	   The third and fourth passes can be important for farmers to meet the state-mandated production
        quota. However, lower productivity for cotton pickers and the fixed official cotton-picking fees
        make it difficult for farmers to attract sufficient local labor to harvest the remaining cotton. More
        flexible cotton production quotas and/or higher fees for third and fourth passes should prevent the
        need to bring in “unmotivated” mobilized labor from outside.

160.	   Cotton harvest mechanization is most likely to be initiated by the better-off farmers who can
        more easily afford the machines and are in a better position to experiment and innovate. As local
        cotton pickers mostly work on these farms, they are most likely to be affected and see their income
        from cotton picking drop. Our findings suggest that women from middle-income households would
        be particularly affected. For them, cotton picking might contribute up to 30 percent of their annual
        income. It is not yet clear to what extent upcoming horticultural farms would be able to generate
        sufficient alternative employment.

161.	   To prepare them for alternative income-earning opportunities, many of the local cotton pickers
        suggested they would benefit from different types of skills training. Such services are currently
        only available in urban areas, however. Loans for starting small business enterprises where these
        skills can be applied were said to be important to generating alternative incomes, but unavailable.

162.	   Existing social assistance transfer systems only reach a small portion of the population, and
        households covered under these programs do not seem to be the ones that will be most affected.
        This is because they have less able-bodied household members that participate in the cotton
        harvest. The current social assistance scheme would only reach a small portion of those affected by
        mechanization.


                                                     67
163.	        There is a severe lack of information among farmers on the characteristics of the various harvesting
             machines, their pros and cons, under what conditions they can be rented, and how they will be
             serviced. Agronomic requirements of cotton cultivation under mechanized harvesting are not well
             known. Farmers were keen that the harvesting machines should not be made available through
             the MTPs but instead via the cotton ginneries, as the latter would have a stake in the quality of the
             harvested cotton.

Recommendations
164.	        This social impact assessment has identified two vulnerable population groups involved in the
             cotton production process. These are: (i) women who are engaged in cotton picking and have
             few alternative cash income–earning opportunities; and (ii) farmers who grow cotton under less
             favorable production. The recommendations presented below aim to address the needs of both of
             these groups to make sure the cotton harvest mechanization process is successful and generates
             benefits for all population groups.

Short term mitigation measures

165.	        The government should consider a public works program. Such a program could focus on improving
             rural infrastructure (roads, canals) to increase farm productivity, while at the same time providing
             alternative income-earning opportunities for households that lost income from cotton picking
             following mechanization. It could also help address the situation of surplus labor, following the
             return migrants from Russia.

166.	        Labor market management information systems that provide information on labor demand,
             shortages, surpluses, fees, and wage rates across regions should be made accessible. Such
             information, together with more flexible wage rates, will make workers more likely to voluntarily
             travel from labor surplus to labor deficit areas when wage incentives are present.

167.	        Options should be explored for organizing contract labor teams that consist of skilled and effective
             workers who can compete with mechanized harvesting or find niches for cotton harvesting, such as
             premium cotton for cotton seed, small fields, and cotton fields in remote areas. Cotton-picking fees
             should be liberalized so that farmers are free to pay what is needed to attract such laborers.

Medium term reform measures

168.	        There is a need to liberalize farming and allow farmers that currently grow cotton in areas that are
             less suitable for that crop to switch to more remunerative farm activities that raise land and labor
             productivity and use less water. The latter is important in areas where abundant irrigation water is
             not easily available s.38

169.	        Structural barriers that prevent rural women who currently pick cotton from accessing formal
             employment or engaging in alternative income-earning activities should be identified and
             tackled. The government in partnership with private sector and development partners could for
             example strengthen support measures that enable rural women from starting and developing their
             small businesses through access to micro-finance, technical training, and child care. Measures that
             address social norms and values that prevent rural women from making their preferred choices and
             grow their entrepreneurial activities would also be important. Livestock production, expansion of
             horticultural production, and agro-processing could be relevant. Community-driven development
             schemes, where communities are put in charge of their own development, could be developed to
             open such opportunities and allow rural women to benefit from them (Box 5 and 6).



38. To some extent this is already happening in the country, and this is further promoted through policies issued in 2015.

                                                                         68
 Box 5. Example of community driven development project that addresses small-scale community
 infrastructure needs of poor and remote communities – The Kecamatan Development Program, Indonesia.

 Objectives. The project aimed at improving socio-economic and local governance conditions by supporting
 productive proposals developed by communities, in a country with much regional variation and pockets of
 conflict-affected areas.

 Design. The program provides technical assistance to facilitate the planning and implementation of sub-
 projects by local communities through the deployment of facilitators (social and technical) in each sub-
 district. 75 percent of project funds go towards roads, bridges, irrigation and clean water.

 Impact. Impact studies have shown that these interventions are effective in targeting the poorest and most
 remote areas: Over 77% of fund loan beneficiaries have been the poorer members of their communities,
 and 38 % have been women. A stronger community voice improved a range of maternal and child health
 outcomes.

 Box 6. Example of a successful project on strengthening capabilities of poor rural women, the Pudhu
 Vazzhvu Project, Tamil Nadu, India

 Objectives. The project’s goal was to building the skills and capabilities of poor women, and enhancing
 their livelihoods by financing demand driven sub project investments.

 Design. Village communities or self-help groups were formed that identify needs, plan, implement and
 monitor project activities. Substantial technical support was provided as well as marketing support. The
 focus was on women with a special project package for persons with disabilities, tribal populations and
 vulnerable groups. Village governments were involved and incentives were provided to them.

 Impact. The project has significantly empowered women in the private and public spheres by (i) improved
 access to low-cost credit and economic opportunities, (ii) improved agency of women within the household,
 and (iii) an increased participation of women in local politics and civic action

170.	    Measures to further support farmers engaged in high value activities such as horticultural or
         livestock production that have a higher labor productivity (in Soum per day) than cotton, and thus
         enable farmers to pay (female) workers attractive daily fees, would be important. At the same time,
         support to smallholders (dehkans) to raise the productivity of their plots and enhance the quality
         and value of their harvests would be needed. This would require better integrating smallholder
         in the value chains of their products to enable them to tap into higher value markets and meet
         product preferences of middle and high income consumers.

171.	    Assisting the most vulnerable households more broadly would require strengthening the
         mechanism for identifying those household, and expanding the coverage of social assistance
         programs. This would include making sure only those households that need it are assisted through
         the program and ensuring all vulnerable households are covered.

172.	    Agronomic research is needed to produce cotton varieties that are not only well suited to the
         range of different Uzbek growing conditions but that also reduce the number of cotton picking
         passes. This will help: (i) make sure that mechanized picking is economic and efficient; and (ii)
         institute a more efficient handpicking process that enhances cotton pickers’ productivity and
         increases their income.

Medium term measures to mechanization work better for marginalized
farmers
173.	   Further diversifying the agricultural sector could help farmers undertake only those activities that
        are most suitable to their production conditions and yield the highest value. This is likely to bring
        more income to the rural population, create jobs, and reduce dependency on cotton. Our findings
        suggest that it would be opportune to review the current policy, whereby farmers are required to
        grow cotton on land in areas where cotton production conditions are less favorable, where yields
        tend to be low, and where few cotton picking laborers are prepared to work.

174.	   Mechanizing the cotton harvest requires further on-farm field testing of different harvesting
        machines and machine design options. Such field tests should take place under different cotton-
        growing conditions that currently exist in Uzbekistan, including both the most and least favorable
        conditions. This will help ensure that the mechanization needs of marginalized farmers that grow
        cotton under difficult conditions—such as low reliability of irrigation water, low soil fertility or highly
        salinized soils, and low availability of labor—are also addressed. Such field tests should make sure
        to solicit the feedback of different types of farmers on the different machines and design options.

175.	   Different business models for mechanizing the cotton harvest should be piloted to test the
        effectiveness, impact, and alternative arrangements for ownership, leasing, and contract service
        provision (for example, cotton harvested by a contractor), and to address the needs of smaller-scale
        farmers and those with remote fields. In addition, training courses should be organized to facilitate
        the emergence of contract service businesses and alert the banking community to the potential of
        this as a recurring business model.

176.	   The government, together with farmer organizations, should develop a plan for enabling farmers
        and pickers to actively engage with these research findings and explore new ways forward, for
        example by undertaking scenario planning exercises, including stakeholder voices when formulating
        an action plan, and so on.

Appendix 1. Estimates of labor use in cotton harvesting in
Uzbekistan
Estimates of labor associated with cotton harvesting in Uzbekistan are imprecise. For the purpose of
approximating the number of workers involved in each cotton harvest, a number of assumptions were made.

Person-days required to harvest cotton

First, cotton area and production of lint in Uzbekistan are used as the basis for calculations. Official data on
seed cotton production are available, but variances in moisture content in seed cotton from season to season
and reporting irregularities make data on seed cotton production problematic. Therefore, a ginning ratio
of 0.32 applied to lint production is assumed to estimate seed cotton production each season at standard
moisture content. For 2014–2015, production is estimated at 940,000 tons of lint, resulting in an estimate of
seed cotton production of 2.94 million tons. Seed cotton production at independence was around 4.5 million
tons and has been trending downward.

There are three predominant estimates of the amount of labor required to harvest seed cotton: kilograms per
day per worker, hours per ton, and hours per hectare.

Estimates of the average amount of seed cotton harvested per day per worker vary substantially. Children
harvest less than adults. Motivated workers harvest more than unmotivated workers. Teenage students sent
from university are probably the least productive. Farmers and farm laborers who depend on harvest income
probably work the most effectively, while government officials required to work a few weeks a year are
probably much less productive. There is more sunlight in September than in October, so productivity is higher
per day earlier in the harvest than later.

Given large variances among workers, average productivity per worker is somewhere between 35 kg and
100 kg of seed cotton per day. An average over all workers all days of 60 kg per day is assumed in these
calculations. Based on seed cotton production of 2.94 million tons, 49 million person-days of labor would
have been required to harvest the 2014–2015 crop in Uzbekistan. In the early 1990s, around 70 million to 80
million days of labor might have been required.

Another measure of productivity is the average amount of time required to harvest 1 ton of seed cotton.
This time will vary with labor productivity per person and yields per hectare. With average row spacing of
one meter, there will be one hundred rows per hectare and a worker will walk 10 km up and down rows to
harvest 1 ha. If yields are higher and bolls are denser, seed cotton can be harvested faster. Based on surveys
of production practices conducted by ICAC, an average of 200 hours of labor are required to harvest one ton
of seed cotton in Uzbekistan. Assuming a nine-hour workday, about 22 person-days will be required per ton
of seed cotton, or about 65 million person-days to harvest the 2.94 million–ton 2014–2015 crop. These same
calculations resulted in estimates of 90 million person-days to 100 million person-days in the early 1990s.

Finally, the same surveys by ICAC indicate that on average it takes 470 hours of labor to harvest each hectare
in Uzbekistan. Planted area was 1.275 million ha in 2014–2015, suggesting that about 67 million person-days
were required to harvest the 2014–2015 crop, compared with 90–100 million 20 years ago.

It is not surprising that the estimates of person-days resulting from the second and third measures of
productivity are essentially the same, since the source for each estimate of productivity (200 hours per ton,
or 470 hours per ha) is the same. The three measures of labor productivity indicate that somewhere between
50 million and 70 million person-days of labor were required during the 2014–2015 cotton harvest. The more
likely figure is around 65 million person-days, based on an average requirement of 200 hours per ton of seed
cotton.

Persons involved in harvesting cotton
Translating these estimates into millions of workers requires additional assumptions to be made. The harvest
season (from early September to early November) is never more than 75 days, and so the minimum number
of workers involved in the 2014–2015 harvest would have been about 650,000 people (49 million person-days
divided by 75 days per season.) However, this estimate is patently too low, as probably no one in the entire
country works from beginning to end. More realistically, people in each region will work for a few weeks while
the cotton in that region is ready to be picked. Therefore, a more realistic assumption is that the average
worker accounts for 20 days, or about three weeks, of harvesting cotton each season, and this suggests that
around 3 million people were involved in 2014–2015. It could also be assumed that each worker was active
for just 10 days, or 1.5 weeks during 2014–2015, and this would double the estimate of workers involved in
the harvest to about 6.5 million. Based purely on subjective understanding of harvest practices, conversations
with individuals, and common sense, it seems more likely that the average worker spends about 3 weeks
harvesting cotton, and this suggests that about 3 million people were involved in the most recent season
(See Figure A1). Two decades ago, when cotton production was greater than it is now, the same calculations
indicate that between 5 million and 6 million people might have been involved in each cotton harvest.

Impacts on earnings

The GoU recently adopted a policy to mechanize 70 percent or more of the cotton harvest by 2016.
Mechanization will shorten the harvest season by several weeks and reduce the amount of labor required
each season. Increased industrial employment will be facilitated in the assembly, operation, and maintenance
of equipment. However, mechanization will also lower demand for labor in rural areas, and cash incomes for
those who pick cotton will be reduced.

Total earnings by workers harvesting cotton were between US$250 million and US$300 million in 2014 (Soum
235/kg of seed cotton), depending on the exchange rate. Cotton picking is an important source of seasonal
cash income for many rural households, and many people who currently earn seasonal incomes during the
cotton harvest would be negatively affected by mechanization.

Earnings per person associated with cotton harvesting were around US$80–100 on average, but workers who
picked more than average or who followed the harvest from region to region would have earned more.

Per capita GNI in Uzbekistan was US$2,090 in 2014. As of 2011, agriculture accounted for 19.1 percent of GDP
and 25.9 percent of labor force participation, which suggests that agricultural incomes average 74 percent of
national average GDP, or about US$1,400. Therefore, earnings per person associated with cotton harvesting
represented 6 or 7 percent of average annual earnings in rural areas.
                                                     73
However, the importance of income from harvesting cotton may be greater to farm workers and farm families
than indicated by percentages of 6 or 7. Out of the many millions of person-hours involved in each cotton
harvest, farmers, family members, and farm workers account for the bulk of this time. Since farm workers
tend to be the lowest paid in any economy, and since income associated with cotton might be the only
cash received by many rural workers, income from cotton harvesting would be highly important to workers
displaced by machine harvesting.

Appendix 2. Research questions
Focus group discussions with cotton pickers
General

1.	       For what proportion of cotton pickers is cotton harvesting an important source of their livelihood
          and income earning? How does it differ across different parts in the county?
2.	       What are the current cotton-picking fees, and how does this differ across the country/district/
          region? Do some farmers pay higher fees than others? What determines the fee?
3.	       How are cotton pickers typically recruited, and what differences exist in recruitment practices? Who
          organizes the logistics and who pays? How long do they work? How are transport, food, and lodging
          arranged?

Socioeconomic profile

4.	       What is the socioeconomic profile of those who pick cotton (their wealth status, employment status,
          income sources, area of residence, education, age, gender, and so on)?
5.	       How important is cotton harvesting in terms of their overall livelihood strategies and income-
          earning opportunities? How does this differ among men and women, the low-income group and
          the middle-income group?

Incentives to work as a cotton harvester

6.	       What incentives exist for people to work in the agriculture sector, and how are these different in the
          cotton subsector and other subsectors? What is attractive and less attractive about picking cotton
          as compared to horticulture and other subsectors? How does this differ across the country?
7.	       How do wage rates differ for agricultural labor across subsectors (cotton, horticulture)? If wage
          rates for picking cotton were higher, would it be easier to find workers who would be willing to pick
          cotton? How does this differ across the country?

Impact of mechanization

8.	       How will mechanizing the cotton harvest affect the livelihoods of those who manually pick cotton?
          What groups will be particularly affected? How does this differ across the country?
9.	       If those who pick cotton can no longer do that, what alternative income opportunities will they
          have instead, if any? Will these alternative income-earning opportunities be equally accessible for
          income groups, including the most vulnerable?
10.	      How much should the cotton-picking fee be raised to compensate for the reduced demand for their
          labor?

Skills training and social safety nets

11.	      What programs or services that provide skills training exist, and what role could they play in
          transitioning to alternative income-earning opportunities?
12.	      What social assistance programs exist and how do they function? Could they play a role in transferring
          funds to households to compensate them for the loss of income when the demand for manual labor
          for cotton harvesting declines? What alternative measures are needed to make this happen?

Key problems and solutions

13.	      What problems are foreseen with cotton mechanization that affect your livelihood? What groups
          will be particularly affected? How does this differ across the country?

       do?

Focus group discussions with cotton farmers and/or farm managers
1.	    How difficult is it for farmers to obtain sufficient cotton-picking labor? What is the main reason for
       the lack of laborers willing to pick cotton? Would a higher payment rate make it easier to attract
       labor?
2.	    What are some of the current difficulties with cotton pickers?

       less well? How might this differ between well-off and less well-off farmers? How might this vary
       across different parts of Uzbekistan?
6.	    What policy measures and support services could make cotton harvest mechanization work for
       farmers of all income groups, including the most vulnerable? How do these measures vary across
       different parts of Uzbekistan?
7.	    Overall, what needs to happen to make it easier for farmers to have their cotton harvested on time?

       what type of cotton farmer will this be feasible, and for what type will this be less feasible? What
       farmers are likely to be unable to afford mechanization, and what support would they need?
2.	    For what type of farmer will mechanization work well and for what type will it work less well? How
       might this differ between well-off and less well-off farmers? How might this vary across different

Module 3. Impact of mechanization [Duration—40 min]

Introduction to the module: In many countries, manual cotton picking has been replaced or decreased by
machines. I would like to discuss with you possible effects of mechanizing cotton picking in Uzbekistan.

         any farmers from the district tried or applied mechanization to pick cotton in recent years? Or
         previously? Which groups of farmers have tried mechanization? (refer to groups in Question 1)

20.	     Have you personally tried mechanization? What changes have you experienced? How has it affected
         your costs and return on cotton production? How has it affected your demand for cotton pickers?

         differ among types of farmers who grow cotton in your district? (refer to groups in Question 1)


         Types of farmers                       Advantages                          Disadvantages




22.	     For what type of cotton farmer will harvest mechanization work well (easy/difficult to implement;
         cost/benefits) and for what types will it work less well? (Refer to groups in Question 1.) What types
         of farmers might consider mechanization more or less attractive?

23.	     How will mechanizing the cotton harvest affect the quantity of the cotton you can harvest from your
         fields? Why?

24.	     How will mechanizing the cotton harvest affect the quality of the cotton you grow on your fields?
         Why? Would mechanization work for picking seed cotton?

25.	     How might mechanization affect farmers’ costs pertaining to the cotton harvest? What do you think
         should be the fee for a mechanized cotton harvest?

26.	     How might mechanization affect farmers’ return on cotton?

27.	     How will mechanization affect the timing of the cotton harvest? Will it allow you to plant wheat or
         other crops?

28.	     Only certain land is suitable for cotton to be picked by machine. This means that if mechanization
         becomes more common in Uzbekistan, farmers will not be able to use all land that they use now to
         grow cotton. In your opinion, how could they use the land instead?

                  participants.




29.	     To what extent would mechanization help you meet harvest labor shortages? Will you still need
         cotton pickers? (Probe: to pick cotton that was left in the field by machines, for example.) Will their
         work differ from what cotton pickers do now? How will the fee and recruitment process differ?

30.	     Will mechanizing cotton picking cause you to need more employees with certain specialization?

Module 1. Introduction (socioeconomic profile) [Duration—40 minutes]

1.	         Let’s talk about people in the area; some of them might be wealthier than others. What groups
            can people who live in your area be divided into when you think about wealth? Please describe
            each group in terms of the following characteristics: occupation, employment status, gender, age,
            income source, education qualification, and so on. (Moderator, probe: farmers who grow state-
            mandated crops, farmers who grow secondary crops, dehkans, daily wage laborers, laborers for
            enterprises with an employment contract, government employees, families with migrants, and so
            on.) Could you also rank these groups by wealth? (Moderator, use a flip chart and write down the
            rank given by participants for each group.)
                                                              84

                        Wealth groups                                 The number of steps in the scale depends on the
                                                                                     number of groups


Moderator: The list should always be on the wall, so you can refer to it anytime.

2.	        Considering those groups that we named for the previous exercise, what percentage of each group
           is involved in cotton picking? How important is cotton picking for them in terms of livelihood
           strategies and income-earning opportunities?

Moderator: Use a flipchart for the exercise and fill out the form during the exercise.

                                                                                      Importance of income received from

3.	        Let’s take a closer look at people from groups for whom cotton picking income is most important
           (those groups who got scores from 4 to 5 in the previous question, third column). What proportion
           of their annual income comes from cotton picking? Do they have other sources of income? If so,
           what are these? Where do they work for the rest of the year and what is their average income?

4.	        Let’s do an exercise together. If we look at people in the area, which month(s) are the busiest working
           in agriculture? (Moderator, use a flip chart and draw a table such as below. Discuss each row with
           participants and ask them to provide a score from 1 to 5 for each month where 1 is assigned to
           people who are the least busy and 5 for people who are the most busy. Then write down an average
           score provided by participants.)

9.	             How much can a cotton picker earn a day? What is the difference for men and women, people of
                different ages and levels of qualification? Are there differences by pass? At the beginning/end of
                the cotton harvest? Is there a norm/quota that one should pick in a day? What happens when one
                picks more than the quota? Less than the quota?

10.	            Are there people who work in the agricultural sector but do not pick cotton? What proportion
                of people working in agriculture do they represent? Why are these people not involved in cotton

Module 3. Impact of mechanization [Duration—40 minutes]

Introduction to the module: In many countries, manual cotton picking has been partly replaced by machines.
I would like to discuss with you possible effects of further mechanizing cotton picking in your area.

14.	        Could you tell me what proportion of cotton is picked by machine in your area? Have any farmers
            used machinery to harvest cotton? What was their experience? How has it affected people who
            picked cotton for those farmers?

15.	        Let’s look again at the wealth groups we defined earlier (Moderator, refer to the table completed
            for the Question 1.) What would be negative and positive effects of mechanization for different
            wealth groups? (Moderator, use a flipchart for the exercise, draw a table as below, and fill it out
            with participants.)

16.	         I would like to discuss with you how important cotton picking is for you and your family. How many of
             your household members are involved in cotton picking? Could you roughly estimate how much you
             and your household members earned this year picking cotton (calculate cash payments + additional
             benefits)? What percentage of the annual income of your household came from picking cotton?

17.	         How would it affect your household if due to mechanization you were unable to pick cotton and earn
             this money? Does the effect differ for certain wealth groups? What groups will be most affected?

18.	         Let’s look again at the groups of people who depend most on cotton-picking income. (Moderator:
             refer to the list of groups completed after Question 2 and discuss groups with scores of 4 and 5.) If
             these people can no longer pick cotton (which also means they will not receive additional benefits
             such as cotton stalks), what other income opportunities will they have, if any? What alternatives
             will be most common? Will these alternative income-earning opportunities be equally accessible
             for all income groups, including the most vulnerable? Will these alternatives be equally accessible
             for men and women?

19.	         Can a small-scale business be an attractive alternative to income from cotton picking? What kind of
             business can it be?
