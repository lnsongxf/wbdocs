1. Introduction

This document aims to clarify how technical training by specialist regulatory-facing
food analysis training establishments impact on the wider food safety capacity
building agenda. It will provide the Global Food Safety Partnership (GFSP) with a
complete food supply chain view of food testing training needs and related drivers for
adoption of food safety standards. It rides with the assumption that only by having
food move through regulated pathways, can food safety be assured for the public
and the interest of private sector ventures be protected. This identifies with the
particular challenge of food systems (national and regional) in developing countries,
i.e. the transition from informal food systems to those that have to meet regulatory
standards.

The report maps the various tiers of technology transfer to relevant stakeholders
(trainees) in the agri-food supply chain. For example, training establishments such
as the International Food Safety Training Laboratories (IFSTL) address training in
food analysis for regulatory compliance to formal international quality standards, e.g.
ISO 17025. As we move down the food chain from fork to farm the number of actors
increases and the technology needs are for faster and cheaper screening methods,
but importantly, they are influenced by the analytical requirements of those actors
that are higher up in the food chain. Growers work to the specifications set by the co-
operatives, who work to the requirements of the processors, who work to retail
standards that are aligned to formal international standards. So whereas farmers
need cheap screening diagnostics; and processors need online sensors, they all will
be influenced by the legislative and quality assurance aspects of the smaller but
influential target group that training establishments such as the IFSTLs address.
Providing training in methodology to the high level stakeholders in this context is key,
as they will, through their subsequent compliance testing, provide the environment
and drivers for technology transfer to farmers and growers to thrive.

There are a number of key institutions, donors and organizations that are providing
training and expertise to support technology transfer and laboratory capacity building
in developing countries.

Some of these programmes are carried out in isolation and are not linked to a
sustainability strategy that addresses the analytical needs of the public and private
sectors, including farmers. This report aims to identify some of the key players
internationally and, in cooperation, attempt to align both content and resources to
ensure sufficient consistency for the GFSP to support these programmes globally.
This work will also provide an approach for Governments and countries to identify

                                           3
their food safety laboratory needs as part of the proposed national food safety
training and capacity building needs assessments.

Ultimately, the framework will lead to the development of a comprehensive set of
laboratory training resources to be supported under the GFSP and starting with a
few pilot programmes to demonstrate the utility and efficiency of this approach.

Key questions to be answered?


   Global food safety laboratory capacity building needs and rationale
   The role of food analysis in supporting a food safety infrastructure
   Food analysis requirements along the food chain including detailed annexes and
    tables for tests and reference methodologies
   The role of regulatory compliance testing in supporting food standards and safety
   Training requirements and solutions
   The role of the private sector laboratories including case studies


Some of the above were answered through the use of a survey of food training
establishments and subsequent feedback on their training programmes and
methodologies (See Annex B).

2. Global food safety laboratory capacity building needs and
   rationale

It is clear there is a strong relationship between food safety within a particular
country and the robustness and functioning of its internal food safety infrastructure.
However considerable resources are required to maintain such an infrastructure so
there needs to be strong political and economic drivers in place to ensure such a
system is a priority for the residing Government. Often the internal agri-food market,
or consumer pressure, is insufficient to maintain such a system with the result that in
developing countries it is often the external market (exports) that is the driver for the
development of food standards and safety systems. This results in a two tier system
with marked differences between the safety and quality standards of food intended
for export and that intended for internal consumption. A key question that needs to
be addressed in such a two tier system is the time lag between the development of
the food safety system to support external trade and the development of a
functioning system for domestic public health.

2.1 The role of food analysis in supporting a food safety
infrastructure

Figure 1 describes a generic food safety infrastructure that is required to monitor and
enforce food safety. The requirements are, for many developing countries, complex,
resource intensive and economically prohibitive. The tools that are presently
available to control food safety across the food supply chain can be summarised as
follows:

      Preventative control plans
      Mandatory product safety standards
      Risk base inspections
      Product tracing
      Inspections through third party certification
      Product certification for high risk foods

In terms of the key challenges that relate to application of these control measures,
the following issues have been identified as key to ensuring their effectiveness:

      Ensuring close interaction with all elements of the supply chain – ingredient
       vendors, packaging providers, distributers and retailers
      Understanding all possible hazards across the food chain
      Implementing mitigation strategies against the risks
      Ensuring monitoring and verification across the supply chain

Drivers from the regulation bodies

      Prior notification of all import shipments
      Physical inspection of imports
      The global move to register food production facilities and inspection, e.g. by
       the FDA and EU (FVO)
      Global coalition of regulators
      Global data information systems
      Expanded capacity for intelligence gathering


2.2    The role of regulatory compliance testing in supporting food
       standards and safety
Food analysis is a key component of assurance and compliance of all of the above
and can be initiated through the internal drivers of the national infrastructure or as is
commonly the case in developing countries, through external drivers resulting from
external trade. In order to enter external markets, food standards need to be visible
and validated. The standards, whether national, commercial or global need to be
verifiable to assure compliance. Figure 2 describes how food standards need to be
                                            5
assured by testing of the components in the food chain wherever they apply. For
example Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for pesticides apply to crops whereas
many other standards/Regulations apply to the finished product as purchased at
retail. The non-compliance with a standard/Regulatory limit has implications both
upstream and downstream. Non-compliance should prevent further progression of
the product upstream and recall/rejection of products downstream. The many
different standards that may be applicable for export (e.g. Codex, EU, FDA, industry)
result in a strong driver and need for laboratory testing services to verify compliance,
hence export is probably the most important driver in developing food safety testing
and capacity building.

Key drivers for the producers / importers

      Risk based foreign supplier verification
      Clear product specifications
      Purchase agreements
      Accredited 3rd party audits
      Preventative controls and testing programme
      Traceability measures.

The need to assure actors in the supply chain that the food complies with the
required standards whether global, governmental or commercial is the major driver
for developing food safety initiatives in the majority of developing countries that have
a significant export market.

      Fig 2 Relationship between food standards and testing. Food standards can apply at
      various stages of the food chain and impact both upstream (barrier to further progress
      along the food chain) and downstream (product recall). Standards and commercial
      standards in particular are directly dependent on immediate upstream requirements
      and indirectly on retail requirements.




2.3   Food analysis requirements along the food chain
Laboratory analysis features heavily in the establishment of food control systems by
contributing to the assessment of the level of exposure potential risks in the food
chain and through compliance assessment. Laboratory services can be provided
from both within the government and the private sector and there are good working
examples of both types of operation in many parts of the world. Figure 3 describes
the key elements to the provision of successful laboratory service that is able to
support food safety within a country.

Having effective capacity in these laboratories is critical to the success of the food
control systems. It is now the norm that food control laboratories will achieve third
party verification of their competence through accreditation to international quality
standards e.g. the ISO 17025 laboratory competence quality standard. This
necessitates the implementation of an effective quality system that includes both
internal and external quality control measures for their operations. Staff training in
the effective application of the laboratory methods is also critical to this. Figure 4
describes the potential areas for capacity building in laboratories carrying out food
safety analysis to help ensure the laboratory meets both the expectations now in
place for quality as well as the needs of the stakeholders and users of their services.

It is clear that in order to perform trace analyses to internationally recognised
standards, considerable investment in staff training and infrastructure is required.
Demonstration of competence in sampling and analysis through the audit of
procedures and accreditation is essential and must be included in any capacity
building requirements if the resulting analyses are to be accepted at export. Training
in methodology and techniques for analysing food are only part of the training
requirements needed for food analysts to be able to verify compliance with food
standards. Other important components include:

      Method validation

      Relevant legislation

      Official sampling procedures

      Quality system (ISO17025)

      Equipment installation and maintenance

Any capacity building programme in the area of food analysis needs to include these
wider elements in order to deliver sustainable fit for purpose training outcomes.

Scope of methods of analyses
As previously discussed the method requirements for testing will be dictated by the
standards/legislation relevant to the intended market. Whereas the specific reference
method may change, there is general commonality on the types of analytes that are
required to be tested. These will generally fall in one of the following headings:

      Food composition

      Food labelling

      Food pathogens

      Trace elements/heavy metals

      Natural toxicants e.g. mycotoxins

      Food contact materials

      Pesticides

      Veterinary residues

      GM food and feeds (EU focus)

2.4    Training requirements and solutions


The general scope of training requirements was identified in Section 2.3. Further
evidence was obtained through the results of a detailed questionnaire that was sent
to candidate organisations thought to undertake capacity building in the food
analysis area. The results of the study are given in Annex B but the key findings
obtained from the 25 respondents are summarised here:




Fig 5 training programmes for those training providers that carry out food testing (chemical
contaminants) training in developing countries.

pathogens) training in developing countries. Other consisted of staphylococcus aureus, vibrio,
bacillus sp. Clostridium, toxigenic fungi,

Figure 7 Scope of respondents training programmes



As expected the results demonstrate the main requirement is for training in methods
of analyses and associated screening procedures that can be used for official
control/verification of formal standards/regulatory limits. In addition there is a
demand for knowledge of the quality assurance and audit processes necessary to be
able to demonstrate competence. It is interesting to note that less than 50% of all the
providers in the study provided training on data analysis and interpretation, two
essential components of food analysis but ones which are resource intensive in
terms of training provision. This raises a key aspect of capacity building, that is how
to best deliver sustainable technology transfer outcomes rather than just deliver
training programmes; the former is a continuum, the latter finite.



2.5    A Framework for capacity building in food analysis


Advanced analytical procedures demand continual updating with the state of the art
to ensure efficiency gains can be realised. It is clear therefore that it is essential to
offer post training aftercare as a means of ensuring continual professional
development. E-learning and communication tools have a role to play in forging and
servicing a user community of food analysts. Webinars will always struggle to
replace hands on training but have a role in pre and post training evaluation and
                                             13
proficiency; communication tools such as Facebook and LinkedIn are well suited to
developing an interactive user community; whereas tools such as Twitter could be
used in 1:1 aftercare for trouble shooting. Assuming the desired outcome is to
provide recognised competence in food testing, for this to be achieved it needs to be
sustainable both economically and scientifically. The latter can be achieved using a
“twinning model” rather than traditional training programmes. The aim of twinning is
develop competence and bring the trainee into a larger group of competence where
the experiences, mentoring, coaching and links provide a more sustaining
environment (see Fig 8).




Fig 8 Twinning approach to technology transfer: the twinning approach although initially resource
intensive has the potential for the trainee institutes to eventually be the twinning mentors of the
future with concomitant economic savings.



The twinning approach is similar to that advocated in APEC’s FSCF PTIN Laboratory
Competency Strengthening Initiative where relationship building is a key part of
sustainable technology transfer. Figure 9 shows a suggested framework for
sustainable technology transfer based on the twinning approach. A key aspect is
evaluating whether the candidate country/laboratory is suitable for receiving the
training i.e. are the correct conditions in place to facilitate the desired training
outcome? A combination of remote and in situ training (of the trainers) transfers the
vision of a competent laboratory to the trainee, and establishes the links that will be
needed to sustain personal scientific development in food analysis. Training
outcomes are validated through external proficiency and through a final evaluation of
the training process.

2.6 The role of the public and private sector laboratories delivering
services in support of National food safety standards: case studies

Some of the present capacity building initiatives and strategies for Laboratories are
given below:

       APEC FSCF PTIN Laboratory Competency Strengthening Initiative (2013)
       FDA’s International food safety capacity building plan (2013) and ongoing
        assessments through the USDA/FAS programming and their STAG laboratory
        group.
       Embedding crop pest risk management and surveillance into commercial and
        community practices for a more secure farming and food future: a case study
        for east Africa. https://www.agriskmanagementforum.org/ (2013)
       SPS compliance; a requisite for agro-industrial exports from developing
        countries. UNIDO’S Trade Capacity building programme, V.07 87831, Nov
        (2007)
       EU       training      programmes       including      collab4safety,    EDES
        http://edes.coleacp.org/en/edes/page/20330-introduction
         and Better Training Safer Food http://ec.europa.eu/eahc/food/about.html
       Private sector participation including consultations through the IFSTL, Waters
        Corp., Abbott, EcoLab and others and including assessment of their in-house
        training resources and availability



                                                15
Most of these initiatives are publically funded either nationally, internationally, or
through Non-Government Organisations such as the EU, UN, and charities. Private
sector funding for capacity building is relatively small and limited to large
multinational food companies and instrument providers e.g. Mars, Waters Corp.
In contrast there is considerable private sector funding of private sector laboratories
in order to facilitate trade. Private laboratories in developing countries are often the
“first adopters” as they have clear financial objectives and purpose.


2.7    Case Studies

The following case studies from Africa are given to some indication of the issues
associated with the establishment of effective food safety monitoring laboratories in
countries where there are significant resource gaps. The role of the private sector
laboratories in these case studies illustrates the growing interface between public
and private labs delivering services in support of national and international food
safety standards



Case study 1

A Government Fisheries Laboratory

      Lack of laboratory management with sufficient technical expertise and
       leadership
      Not accredited to ISO 17025
      No embedded quality system
      Poor electrical power supply
      No quality control checks on results
      No participation in proficiency test schemes
      No financial control with no separate budget and accounts
      No clear purpose for the laboratory with no link to the food inspection and
       sampling process resulting in very small sample numbers
      Lack of spares and maintenance for key equipment
      Critical reagents such as media not available
      No microbiology reference organisms
      IT problems with corruption of data and files
      No effective validation of methodology
      No access to international methods
      Extremely convoluted and lengthy procurement process (reagents are out of
       date by the time they are delivered)
      The laboratory is not financially sustainable and not fit for purpose




                                          16
This case study emphasises the need for the correct economic and political drivers
to be in place as well as basic infrastructure before technology transfer can take
place that will deliver the required sustainable training outcomes.



Case study 2

Public laboratory moving into public/private partnership

      Offers food inspection services to ISO 22000
      Partnership with SGS a global Certification and Testing Body
      Wide range of both private and government customers
      Laboratory accredited to ISO 17025
      Well run embedded Quality System in place
      Good laboratory environment
      Well maintained general equipment but clear knowledge gap in use and
       maintenance of instrumental equipment
      Adequate supply of reagents and reference materials including
       microbiological reference organisms
      Some equipment failures due to lack of spares and service agent
       interventions
      Very good quality food microbiology testing but very limited trace level
       analysis expertise covering pesticides, mycotoxins and veterinary drugs
      In the process of procuring key new equipment including LC-MS/MS
       instrumentation but no knowledge base for the operation of such equipment
      Food safety training carried out in India and South Africa
      ISO Standard methods used for microbiology
      No waste management policy and procedures
      No LIMS implementation
      Move away from Government to private sector funded organisation
      Good level of control of budget and effective management of resources
      Simple procurement pipeline with good delivery times for consumables
      7 day a week working pattern for efficient service delivery

The laboratory is a federally owned public enterprise governed by the Ministry of
Science and Technology. It services both public and private sectors. There is a very
clear role for the laboratory in supporting both the food industry and food
enforcement. The staff are very proactive and are looking to improve their
methodology and are procuring LC-MS. They are a good candidate for twinning and
for eventual internal technology transfer within the country and region (“train the
trainers”).

Case study 3 Private laboratory

  •   The Laboratory facilities at a food supplement production plant are comprised
      of chemistry and microbiology laboratories. There has been a long
      established management structure in the laboratory with clearly defined
      Technical Management and Quality Manager roles. The laboratory is also a
      member of the country’s Laboratory Association. A 5 story private laboratory,
      training and conference centre is being developed and will offer a wide scope
      of food testing services.



  •   Established food chemistry and microbiology laboratory in support of enriched
      and infant food production plant
  •   Laboratory accredited to ISO 17025
  •   Good laboratory environment
  •   Good supply of regents and reference organisms
  •   Good macro analysis expertise but very limited trace analysis knowledge
  •   Waste disposal policy and procedures not developed
  •   New instrumentation being purchased but this did not include LC-MS/MS at
      the time of the visit




           HPLC equipment                              Chemistry area

                                        19
Potentially a very effective laboratory service with what appeared to be very good
links with food producers and distributors. The new establishment could also act a
regional training centre.

These case studies indicate that public and private laboratories can both be the
targets for technology transfer, as it is having the correct drivers for sustainable
change that is of prime importance rather than whether the laboratory is public or
private.


2.8    Key food legislation and the related analytical methodology

As described in sections 2.3 & 2.4, the scope of the training requirements for food
testing is quite clear and similar for most testing laboratories around the world
involved in compliance testing. The exact description of the methods differs widely
however, particularly with the advent of methods criteria that are now being used
within international standards e.g. EU, Codex.                   Method criteria-based
legislation/standards permit the use of any method that fulfils the method
performance criteria. It is unrealistic therefore to try to document all of the variants of
potential methodologies. Some official method descriptions do still exist in vertical
legislation describing commodity standards within EU and Codex, but these are only
used for reference purposes with “equivalent” screening methods being employed on
a routine basis. Annex A describes some of the relevant EU legislation and
associated reference methodology. In many cases (especially more recent
legislation) use is made of method criteria rather than prescriptive method
descriptions.

Some of the sources of official methods are:

      National legislation within each country – the US being the most significant in
       terms of trade

      NGO’s e.g. European Union, Codex Alimentarius, ISO, CEN, OIV

      Industry standards – a large number of methodologies are identified through
       the various industry standards for commodities as well as proprietary
       standards and methods within the private sector.

An example of some of the major sources of methods and related standards is
provided in Annex A, the list is not exhaustive. A more detailed examination of the
composition of some EU standards is provided to demonstrate the sheer complexity
of the international standard/method matrix.

3 Conclusions

     Laboratory testing of the compliance of food safety components of the food
      chain with national and international standards is an essential component of a
      food safety system.

     In developing countries drivers for developing a food safety system are
      usually derived from the external market primarily to facilitate international
      trade.

     In the absence of suitable economic and political drivers, capacity building in
      such countries is very difficult; case studies have been provided from 3
      laboratories in Africa that illustrate this point.

     Laboratory capacity building in developing countries is primarily facilitated
      through public/NGO/charity training programmes with a limited number of
      suppliers.

     Data is available from 25 training organisations on their programmes in
      training in food analysis.

     Most of the training programmes consolidate around two major types of food
      analysis: chemical contaminants and food pathogens

     References to those organisations that have compendiums of methods of
      analyses are provided: the number of individual methods is too large to be
      practical to index on an individual basis

     Capacity building should focus on training outcomes rather than outputs: a
      framework is proposed in order to provide sustainable competence in food
      analysis and exploit the e-tools that are now available
