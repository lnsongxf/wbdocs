 Box 1.1 Profile Highlights of the Selected States

 In Andhra Pradesh, India’s third largest state, agriculture accounts for more than one-quarter of state GDP       . Most
 farmers depend on rainfed agriculture, while 28 percent of total cultivated land is irrigated. Since 2005, distribution
 losses have steadily declined, but subsidies and financial losses have risen. Agricultural consumers represent 14
 percent of the utilities’ consumer base, accounting for about one-third of sales. After virtual segregation of all mixed
 rural feeder loads (2001–05), the state switched to physical segregation and pilots are under way. Key objectives are
 to boost small rural industries by providing non-agriculture customers a 24-hour, three-phase supply and improve
 agricultural productivity by extending agricultural consumers’ 7–9 hours of three-phase supply for pump sets.

 Gujarat state in northwest India has a per-capita electricity consumption of 1,354 kWh, nearly twice the national
 average. In 2003, Jyoti Gram Yojna (JGY), an innovative rural electricity scheme, introduced the physical separation
 of 11-kV feeder lines serving rural agriculture consumers and rural household and commercial connections. The
 program also installed meters on feeders to eliminate theft. Since JGY was completed in 2006, agricultural energy
 consumption has trended upward. Today Gujarat’s power distribution utility has a profitable balance sheet.

 In Rajasthan, India’s largest state in terms of land area, agriculture contributes more than one-quarter of state GDP
 (FY2010–11). Agriculture consumers represent just 12 percent of the utilities’ consumer base but 39 percent of sales.
 Rural load segregation, initiated in 2005 as part of the Feeder Renovation Program, aims to reduce losses of mixed
 rural feeders and improve rural households’ supply quality. Integrated with HVDS on agricultural feeders, DT meter-
 ing, and replacement of LT cables with ABC, this ongoing program adopted virtual segregation. To eliminate agri-
 cultural theft, a roster switch on existing feeders balances three-phase, agricultural supply hours with single-phase
 hours when households receive an unrestricted supply. Since 2005, distribution losses have steadily declined, yet
 higher agricultural consumption has more than offset the financial benefit.

 Haryana, located in northwest India, is among one of the most prosperous states in the country. In 2009–10, per
 capita income was estimated at US$1,486 (Rs. 78,781), and the literacy rate was 71.4 percent. Canals are the main
 source of irrigated water for cultivating diverse crops. Farmers comprise 11 percent of the electricity consumer
 base, accounting for 39 percent of total utility sales. Since the state government erected dedicated 11-kV feeders
 to separate agriculture loads from rural household connections in 2005, distribution losses have steadily declined.
 All of the 1,226 feeders erected were equipped with AMR compatible bulk meters. Over the same period, the utili-
 ties’ financial losses have increased. Delayed completion of the scheme was resolved in mid-2010 when the state
 government began regular monitoring.

(ii) socioeconomic benefits. Better quality of supply is               for system balancing. A single day’s hourly loading data
related to such issues as voltage, outage frequency, and               for all 11-kV agriculture and JGY feeders in the Vinchiya
data on system balancing and the failure rate of distribu-             substation was collected and analyzed to determine the
tion transformers (DTs). Socioeconomic benefits relate                 loading pattern during single- and three-phase feeder
to non-agriculture rural households’ increased hours of                operations. The extent of system unbalancing was higher

 Box 3.1 Advanced Metering Infrastructure

 Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) can be used to limit supply hours to farmers without segregation of loads.
 This IT-based system uses two-way communication and back-end software applications with energy meters to mea-
 sure, collect, analyze, and control energy use on a real-time or near real-time basis. It is quite effective in communi-
 cating and implementing supply rosters through remote connect/disconnect and handling detection of unauthorized
 consumption, thus reducing losses. The system can be designed to perform a wide range of functions. It can imple-
 ment varying tariffs for consumers connected on the same feeder, including time-of-day tariffs, which can encourage
 farmers to switch on pump sets during off-peak hours and thus eliminate the need for remote connect/disconnect of
 irrigation loads. It can perform energy audits, provide utilities accurate data, and reduce billing-cycle costs. The AMI
 technology has matured and is now commercially available at an affordable cost.

     Components          Discussion points
     Field visits        Prior to the meeting, the World Bank study team visited the UGVCL Energy Management Center, UGVCL
                         Area Load Dispatch Center, Rupal village (to interact with rural consumers covered under the JGY), and the
                         Randheja substation.
                         The team noted that UGVCL has implemented automatic data acquisition at the feeder level and is
                         conducting effective energy management and auditing. Load scheduling implemented through the Area Load
                         Dispatch Center allows the utility to restrict its peak demand to about 3,000 MW against a connected load of
                         7,300 MW (figures quoted by the utility).
     Sharing of study    The World Bank team presented the study background, approach, and key findings. The audience agreed with
     findings            the study findings specific to Gujarat.
                         The UGVCL Managing Director noted that the agriculture subsidy, as included in the study, pertains only
                         to unmetered agricultural consumption. It was suggested that the study report highlight the total subsidy
                         against agricultural consumption. The requisite data was subsequently requested from the concerned official.
     State-specific      Scheme data not utilized for agriculture approvals. Gujarat still uses fixed consumption norms for
     queries and         unmetered consumers as part of regulatory submissions. It was agreed that the actual agricultural data

     note                While individual agricultural consumption might not be disclosed publicly, feeder/DT-level data can be
                         publicly shared for transparency. The Principal Secretary suggested that, for all states that have successfully
                         segregated rural load, the central government should provide financial support for installing RMR
                         infrastructure on segregated feeders.
                         Moving from load segregation to individual metering to enable direct subsidy delivery. Gujarat is ready
                         to evaluate the direct subsidy model on a pilot basis; however, it was agreed that the pilot would require
                         installing advanced metering infrastructure to extract the requisite data from end-user consumers.
                         Key JGY lessons to carry forward to other states interested in similar initiatives:
                         •	 A strong procurement system (including material, quality, and vendor management systems) must be in
                            place before initiating such state-level schemes.
                         •	 The key challenge is the demand for 24-hour supply by greenhouse consumers supplied through
                            segregated agriculture feeders.
                         •	 The Managing Directors’ view was that the model to be followed eventually is 100 percent consumer
                            metering supported by AMR, which can contribute to direct-subsidy delivery in rural areas by
                            implementing time-of-day tariffs. A group of agricultural consumers is willing to pay the market price for
                            reliable, good-quality power. These initiatives could be started with this group.

                    segregation.
Components          Discussion points
Field visits        Before the meeting, the World Bank study team visited the Bassi subdivision selected for the load
                    segregation study. The team was informed that agriculture consumers are connected through HVDS, and
                    meters are provided on all transformers; thus, consumers are metered on a 100 percent basis. However,
                    some meters are defective. No IT-based solution has been implemented to read and process the data.
Sharing of study    The World Bank team presented the study background, approach, and key findings. The audience raised the
findings            following key points:
                    •	 Increased agriculture connections post completion of the FRP were due primarily to the release of all
                       pending connections for the past 10–15 years, increased supply hours to agriculture consumers, and the
                       rise in connected load per consumer due to groundwater depletion. The team indicated that the study
                       report would be updated to reflect this information.
                    •	 Rajasthan was regulating the supplied agriculture connections even before the FRP was initiated; thus,
                       the FRP might not result in the flattening of the demand load curve as in Gujarat. It was agreed that the
                       requisite data substantiating this statement would be shared with the study team for further analysis and
                       validation.
                    •	 Because subdivisions in Rajasthan differ significantly, the study report should include a caveat highlighting
                       that the detailed study was limited to a sample subdivision; this caveat was subsequently highlighted in
                       the report.

                    Key FRP lessons to carry forward to other states interested in similar initiatives:
                    •	 The new FRP scheme proposed will integrate the installation of energy-efficient pump sets as a demand-
                       side mechanism (DSM) measure.
                    •	 Agri-products should be linked to the subsidy.
                    •	 Smaller transformers (10 kVA) should be used in HVDS.

                        Pradesh distribution utilities.
     Components         Discussion points
     Sharing of study   The World Bank team presented the study background, approach, and key findings in the context of their
     findings           relevance to the Madhya Pradesh rural load segregation scheme. The Madhya Pradesh team shared the
                        following information.
                        Madhya Pradesh distribution utilities have a total of 75 segregation schemes, averaging about US$9.4–11.3
                        million (Rs. 50–60 crores) per scheme. A third-party project management consultant has been hired to
                        manage the planning, design, execution, and monitoring of the scheme. Nine months have passed since the
                        contract for execution was awarded; no pilots were undertaken.
                        Execution of the scheme will be outsourced using turnkey contracts.
                        The distribution utilities have decided to adopt the Gujarat model of physical feeder segregation and aim to
                        restate their distribution losses post segregation.
                        The East distribution utility has prepared a separate scheme for installing feeder/DT-level automated metering
                        infrastructure on the segregated feeders.
                        The decision to connect agriculture or non-agriculture load to the new feeder created as a result of physical
                        segregation will depend on the respective load proportions on a given feeder.
     Institutional      A general framework for undertaking load segregation was prepared using the study findings presented. The
     framework for      rural load segregation scheme of Madhya Pradesh was mapped onto the framework. The key highlights were
     load segregation   as follows:
                        •	 Strategic objective. In Madhya Pradesh, the primary objective of feeder segregation is continuous supply
                           to non-agriculture rural consumers. The approach is physical segregation without HVDS, except where
                           agriculture connections have high connected load. Feeder segregation is planned for selected state
                           districts where feeders have been selected, based on existing loss levels.
                        •	 Conceptualization
                          –	 Technical and operational evaluation. Key positives for the proposed approach to load segregation are
                             low metering of agriculture connections in the state, large scope for peak load management, and ability
                             to control supply hours on agriculture feeders. However, high financial losses of state utilities and
                             existing inadequate supply are deterrents to the proposed scheme.
                          –	 Socioeconomic status in rural areas. The physical separation may be comparatively costly owing to the
                             state’s large geographical spread. However, the scheme would require limited communication with
                             farmers compared to other load segregation models.
                          –	 Execution and evaluation phases. The three project teams of the distribution utilities were updated
                             on basic project requirements to ensure a robust and successful execution of the scheme and its
                             subsequent evaluation. These include (i) preparation of a robust baseline and subsequent financial and
                             technical targets; (ii) procurement strategy that optimizes existing state practices through a cell with
                             technical and project management expertise; (iii) tier-based project management for robust monitoring;
                             (iv) continuous regulatory engagement from the outset of the evaluation phase; (v) use of advanced
                             metering infrastructure to support data collection, monitoring, and evaluation of the scheme; (vi)
                             third-party inspections during and after project execution, and (vii) engaging a creditable third party
                             to evaluate both the financial and social costs and benefits of the scheme vis-à-vis the documented
                             baselines.

Impact of load     The impact of rural load segregation on the state’s groundwater levels was discussed at length. The views

groundwater        •	 Every three years, the state water department conducts a study of the depleted blocks. According to the
reserves              results of these studies, there is a 5 percent marginal increase in the depleted blocks. The groundwater
                      situation appears alarming due to variations in the block classification criteria adopted in various studies;
                      thus, feeder segregation is not expected to have a large impact on the state’s groundwater levels.
                   •	 Feeder segregation must be primarily an energy-sector scheme; inter-linkages with other sectors would
                      make it difficult to coordinate across departments.
                   •	 The agriculture business does not receive requisite returns, which explains the need for subsidy to
                      farmers. The agriculture subsidy can be removed if the agriculture sector can be assured of needed
                      financial returns.
