     The procurement process may also be a

     are contrary to EA+EE principles. TTLs who
     have overseen bulk EE procurement by cli-

     consumers. However, creation and mainte-

     Because of its position, the WB has a remark-

     benefits that EE brings to EA are relatively
     clear – lower project and consumer costs,
     mitigated after-market risk, longer run times
     and more reliable supply, etc. – but the bene-
     fits of EA+EE to larger EE goals may prove to
     be even more significant. Markets requiring
     access are typically energy “green fields,” and
     work there could very well generate tech-
     nological innovations and smart business/
     project models with global benefits. Position-

     in time, show that access was essential to
     efficiency.

     to convince clients and WB EA staff of the
     value of EA+EE, and to equip them to act.

STRUCTURING SHS MARKETS FOR SUCCESS –
This project did not fulfill its goal of backing
the installation of 20,000 SHSs in large part
because of the delay in establishing the SHS
market’s tariff. The project TTL also saw that
energy service demand from at least some
SHS purchasers was not met by the 60Wp
SHS and its three CFLs and black and white
TV. It may be that a more flexible and com-
petitive SHS market, such as Bangladesh’s –
one with a variety of SHS sizes and super-ef-
ficient off-grid appliances and tariffs set and
then adjusted as needed by ESPs and/or
local NGOs – could have reached more cus-
tomers, and achieved REP’s objectives, more
quickly.


“One size fits all” may not be the best ap-
proach for establishing new SHS markets.
Packaging differently sized SHSs with a va-
riety super-efficient products can provide a
more diverse group of customers with more
energy service at a lower price point.

     LOCAL MARKETS – Many WB access projects
     take place in rural areas with limited mar-

     projects have shared that it is often difficult
     to deliver consumers and businesses ade-
     quate energy service, training and support.
     REAP’s response to these challenges (e.g.
     appropriate demand assessment, flexible
     procurement and sales model, establishment
     of SSCs) was essential to its success and the
     sustainability of its impacts. It provides a
     conceptual model for success in developing
     EA+EE markets in other contexts.


     Like Bangladesh RERED, Mongolia REAP is
     a unique project with a unique context—but
     the lesson it provides in patiently assessing a
     market’s barriers and flexibly responding to
     them is highly transferable.

     DEVELOP A EA+EE MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE
     – Mongolia’s REAP faced similar challenges
     to Bolivia in terms of providing energy to a
     large number of people who reside in sparse-
     ly populated rural areas. Under REAP, region-
     al sales and service centers were established
     that were privately operated but trained and
     certified under the program to ensure they
     had adequate qualifications and knowledge
     to service the SHS industry in Mongolia. Ser-
     vice centers can fix problems with batteries
     and other parts of the SHSs, and also sell en-
     ergy efficient off-grid compatible appliances.
     In Mongolia, this created business opportu-
     nities and commercial markets that did not
     previously exist and it may have the same ef-
     fect in Bolivia—coupling the establishment of
     these sales and service centers with a con-
     sumer awareness effort built around energy
     efficiency could be particularly beneficial.

     PROCUREMENT TOOLS ARE NEEDED TO
     IDENTIFY HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS – In the
     absence of a global standard for SHSs, or
     standards and labeling programs for the ap-
     pliances that can be used with these systems,
     more data and information is needed to help
     both institutional purchasers like the WB and
     local consumers make informed decisions. A
