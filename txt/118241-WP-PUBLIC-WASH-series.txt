  A Glimpse at the Water and
  Sanitation Sector in Nigeria
               Nigeria’s sanitation sector is in critical condition
      Only 29 percent of Nigerians have           130 million Nigerians do not meet
       access to improved sanitation              the MDG standards for sanitation


              Nigeria’s water sector faces significant challenges
   61 percent of Nigerians have access to       Access to piped water on premises in
  improved water, but only 31 percent have      urban areas declined from 32 percent
   access to improved water on premises             in 1990 to 7 percent in 2015


                     Poor households are deeply affected by
                          inadequate access to WASH
      71 percent of households in the        Poor children are about four times more likely

                   Public expenditure in water and sanitation is
                            limited and of poor quality

  Executive Summary
  More than 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to improved water, and
  close to 700 million lack access to improved sanitation facilities. In Nigeria alone, 71 million
  people continue to live without access to improved water, while 130 million people do not meet
  the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) standards for sanitation. A large body of evidence
  suggests that limited or no access to water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services
  adversely affects individuals’ health, hinders their access to educational and economic
  opportunities, and affects their work efficiency and labor productivity.

  As the global community moves toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
  it is necessary to assess the current state of access to water and sanitation in Nigeria so
  policy makers and key stakeholders can develop effective policies and interventions to address
  shortcomings in access to WASH. Such efforts should be targeted at the most vulnerable in
  society, specifically those who experience the greatest burdens of poverty.

  This report offers an overview of the state of WASH services in the country. It draws from a
  number of national data sources, desk reviews, and original research to analyze service
  delivery in the country and assess the sector’s performance. It offers an overview of poverty
  in Nigeria, considers the relationship between poverty and WASH, explores demographic
  patterns influencing access to WASH, and analyzes the relationship between WASH and child
  health outcomes. Further, it evaluates the performance of water agencies, examines and
  identifies institutional bottlenecks, offers insights on how to make the sector more efficient
  and sustainable, conducts a public expenditure review (PER) of the WASH sector, and
  explores the organization of the institutional landscape for urban water supply in Bauchi City.
  The report concludes with recommendations for tackling the current crisis of WASH services
  in Nigeria.

  The following are the key messages emanating from the report:


  Message 1: Nigeria’s WASH Sector is in Critical
  Condition and Requires Immediate Attention
  It is imperative for Nigeria to expand its WASH services and emphasize the effective and
  sustainable management of such services. The analysis throughout this report—especially the
  mapping techniques—reveal that water supply and sanitation services are systematically
  scarce throughout the country (except for a few local exceptions, such as Abuja). Those who
  live in the bottom 40 percent (B40) of the income distribution and those residing in rural areas
  are particularly disadvantaged. Therefore, policy makers must renew their focus on the
  management of existing water points and schemes to sustain and expand services—since
  failure rates for both are particularly pronounced.

  Nigeria lags behind other countries in the region. Despite the progress achieved between 1990
  and 2015 for access rates to improved water sources, Nigeria has regressed with regard to
  access to piped water service. Access to piped water on premises in urban areas dropped from
  three in every 10 persons in 1990, to even less than one in 2015. Indicators for sanitation are
  not only lagging but suggest that the subsector has been neglected by policy makers and is in
  an alarming state of dilapidation. Less than one-third of Nigerians have access to improved
  and unshared sanitation facilities, and only 5.6 percent make use of sewerage systems.
  Further, there is a clear wealth divide in access to water and sanitation. The richest 20 percent
  of households in Nigeria have more than 90 percent access to improved water and sanitation
  while slightly less than 30 percent of households in the poorest quintile have access to



A Wake Up Call 	                                                                                      xvii
         improved water, and only 12 percent of these households have access to improved sanitation.
         These shortcomings are at least partially the result of deficiencies in the performance of water
         agencies, water points, and water distribution schemes. Almost half of the existing water
         points and schemes in Nigeria are nonfunctional. This multidimensional failure has not only
         fueled mounting water stress in the country but also has created a poverty trap by adversely
         affecting poverty and human development outcomes.

         Analyses conducted for this study confirm with new detail the degree to which Nigeria’s WASH
         sector is underdeveloped in comparison to regional standards, for both water supply and
         sanitation, and across urban and rural areas, with piped utility service regressing, and significant
         access gaps for the poor. Nigeria’s WASH sector is in critical condition, calling for priority policy
         attention and bold action by state and federal governments.


         Message 2: Improving the WASH Sector Will Have
         Significant Implications for Poverty Reduction and
         Human Development Outcomes
         In the WASH sector, poor households are constantly being left behind. National survey data
         indicate that fewer than 30 percent of poor Nigerians have access to improved sources of
         water. Households in rural locations are also disproportionately impacted. Evidence suggests
         that 34 percent of the rural population must travel at least two hours round-trip to fetch water
         from a functioning improved source. When a trade-off between working time and time to fetch
         water forces households to tilt toward using informal or unimproved proximity water sources, it
         brings along health hazards and undernourishment.

         Undernutrition is a major public health problem in Nigeria. Thirty-seven percent of children
         under five years of age are stunted, 18.5 percent are wasted, and 29 percent are underweight.
         Close to half of children in the B40 are stunted, and 37 percent of children in the B40 are
         underweight. Inadequate WASH increases the risk of contracting neglected tropical diseases,
         such as soil-transmitted parasitic helminth infections, schistosomiasis, and trachoma—all of
         which are endemic across Nigeria. In some regions of the country, these diseases are prevalent
         in more than 50 percent of the population.

         Improving access to WASH will help address Nigeria’s chronic undernutrition. Unsafe WASH
         conditions enable the transmission of enteric pathogens that can cause diarrhea and
         environmental enteropathy, and can lead to chronic problems with absorbing nutrients. This, in
         turn, can lead to stunting, wasting, and being underweight.

         Improving WASH will thus have significant implications for poverty reduction and human
         development outcomes. In light of the interactions between WASH and other sectors, a
         multisectoral approach is needed for greater synergy with the public health, education, urban and
         rural development, and environmental sectors, among others. To generate a sustained impact,
         WASH must be fully integrated with interventions and other programming in associated sectors.
         The combination of such interventions will have more impact than the sum of their parts.


         Message 3: The Sector is Constrained by Inefficient
         Service Delivery and Failing Facilities
         Shortcomings in the WASH sector are connected in part to deficiencies in the performance of
         water agencies, water points, and water distribution schemes. More than 38 percent of all
         improved water points and around 46 percent of all water schemes in Nigeria are nonfunctional
         (deemed out of service in 2015, at the time of the survey). Further, nearly 30 percent of water
         points and water schemes appeared to fail in the first year of operation after construction,
         presumably because of poor build quality. The report finds that several factors—if more


xviii	                                                                                          A Wake Up Call
  carefully considered during the design, implementation, and operational stages—would
  drastically decrease the failure rates of water points and water schemes.

  When considering most water-utility service indicators, Nigeria underperforms in relation to
  both African and global averages. Self-reported utility data contributed to the International
  Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET) show that Nigerian state
  water agencies (SWAs) perform below the average level of performance for utilities in Africa, for
  the available indicators. The data further indicate that Nigerian SWAs underperform global
  IBNET averages by a significant margin between 2011 and 2015.

  Nigerian SWAs display mixed results and trends in terms of operational efficiency. For
  example, between 2011 and 2015 the continuity of service increased slightly from
  11.9 hours per day to 12.2 hours per day. In the same period, there was a boost in staff
  productivity across water agencies, in which the average number of employees per
  1,000 connections slightly fell from almost 18 to 16.6. The number of samples passing the
  required number of tests to detect residual chlorine presence also increased slightly from
  79.4 percent to 80.9 percent. However, SWAs performed poorly along indicators of financial
  performance: average revenue fell from US$0.32 per cubic meter sold to US$0.26 per
  cubic meter sold, while the already low cost recovery ratio of 0.63 fell further to 0.58 in the
  same period.


  Message 4: To Achieve the SDGs in WASH, Nigeria
  Must Invest at Least Three Times More than it
  Does Today
  Nigeria needs to spend more to achieve the SDGs in WASH. Recent estimates produced by
  the World Bank suggest that Nigeria must invest about 1.7 percent of its current GDP   , or US$8
  billion per year (2015 prices), to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Although there are no recent
  estimates for overall expenditure in the sector, between 2006 and 2010, the Federal
  Government of Nigeria (FGN) and the states invested close to US$1 billion per year
  (0.42 percent of GDP) in WASH. Capital expenditure was close to 0.28 percent of GDP       , which
  is lower than regional levels (0.7 percent of GDP). Overall, these figures are particularly low in
  light of what is needed to stem the crisis in the sector.

  Nigeria also needs to spend more efficiently. For instance, 44 percent of borehole construction
  projects committed were never started. This ratio is even higher for canal and dam projects—​
  70 percent and 79 percent, respectively. Moreover, only 37 percent of borehole projects,
  10 percent of dam projects, and 5 percent of canal projects were fully completed.


  Message 5: Sound Sector Institutions Are Needed
  to Better Sustain Existing and New WASH-Related
  Efforts
  Nigeria’s federal system contributes to a diverse institutional landscape for the water sector
  across 36 states, which is a challenging context for implementing national programs. Within
  the Nigerian federal system, subnational governments are assigned primary responsibility for
  water supply and sanitation; in practice the FGN also plays a substantial role in financing
  capital investments. Coordination of planning and budgeting of investments and of associated
  operations and maintenance (O&M) is particularly challenging given the number of actors,
  which each have diverse incentives and priorities for allocating resources to the sector.

  State water authorities exercise limited autonomy over fiscal and human resources. All SWAs
  are public institutions, though some have been established as state-owned corporations with


A Wake Up Call 	                                                                                       xix
      a degree of autonomy. Yet, even for the latter group of utilities, the collection of tariffs remains
      low, leaving them dependent on state governments to finance their operations, expenses, and
      salaries. Further arrangements for human resource management create complex lines of
      accountability for performance. Limited reliable data exist to inform decision making and
      performance management—or to contribute toward greater public accountability.

      In Bauchi City, the (formal and hidden) costs of connecting to piped water and citizens’
      negative perceptions of SWA service reliability are significant challenges. Piped water is
      viewed as being more affordable (on a monthly basis) than other sources of water. While
      evidence suggests that citizens would be willing to pay official connection fees and tariffs
      to access piped water service, perceived barriers to connecting are high. These include
      quotes for connection fees that are higher than official rates; the need to cover material
      and labor costs; difficulty negotiating access or paying for permission to cross neighboring
      properties or nearby roads; and terrain issues, such as the need to buy and operate
      booster pumps in hilly areas.


      Needs Looking Forward
      Failure to address the current situation will have dire consequences for the nation. Without
      immediate attention to this sector failure by policy makers and other key stakeholders, the
      country will at best continue to suffer from the damaging effects of the status quo. At worst,
      the situation will continue to deteriorate, making it increasingly difficult to recover and establish
      the policies and programming to rehabilitate the sector in the future. It is thus imperative to
      take stock of past failings and take decisive action now. Such action must be expanded and
      sustained as part of a long-term national commitment.

      The analysis in this diagnostic suggests seeking opportunities for reform that can deliver
      better services within the existing political context. The main binding constraints to water
      sector development pertain to governance, and inadequacies in finance, in an overall context
      of fragmentation (36 responsible states):

        ••   There must be a long-term governmental commitment to finding pathways for better
             delivery in Nigeria in the context of a federal system with enormous potential but
             uneven institutional capabilities. There must be a strengthened long-term commitment
             to governance and institutional reforms, as well as a push for reforms that better
             align institutional incentives, offer more robust accountability mechanisms, and
             prioritize financing and capacity building in the sector.

        ••   The government should invest in closing implementation gaps, supporting service
             delivery capabilities in the water sector, and promoting greater integration of the private
             sector into the water and sanitation sectors. As part of scaling up capacity-building
             programs, the sector requires pragmatic approaches to human resource management to
             better align incentives, promote greater accountability, and encourage the retention of
             talent. Moreover, there should be greater, and a more strategic, promotion of private
             sector involvement in water management, paving the way for the introduction of new
             methods and skills. The careful introduction of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the
             operation and maintenance of selected water systems can be a potentially game-
             changing opportunity: allowing the sector to replenish its skills and learn from
             experimentation, while also placing competitive pressure on public operations to offer
             better, more efficient services. Similarly, the role of the informal water vending, well-
             drilling, and fecal sludge disposal businesses should be better recognized within the
             existing legal and political frameworks, and thus better integrated, through regulation,
             into the water and sanitation service delivery chains.

        ••   The water sector requires greater and more efficient financing and investment—including
             an upgraded tariff and subsidies structure and a more accountable budget process.

         To  help attain cost-recovery and affordability objectives, there should be a greater
         emphasis on decoupling tariffs and subsidies and a better targeting of subsidies. To
         incentivize better sector performance, it is imperative to push forward on a financing
         structure that is more accountable and driven by results. The establishment of rules-
         based funds—to channel federal budget support to state investments in a more
         transparent manner—would be an important tool for empowering federal leadership,
         and to guide and incentivize sector development and reform by the states. Renewed
         emphasis is also needed on a long-term utility credit-worthiness agenda that promotes
         access to commercial finance.

    ••   In light of the synergies between WASH and other sectors, a multisectoral approach is
         needed. Access to WASH services in Nigeria is sharply conditioned by differences in
         levels of poverty, education, wealth, geographic location, and health. To generate a
         sustained impact, the WASH sector must be fully coordinated with the interventions and
         programming of associated sectors, such as public health, education, urban and rural
         development, environment, and governance. The combination of such interventions will
         have more impact than the sum of their parts. Drawing from the findings of this report,
         new efforts should consider geographical mapping and targeting to ensure that programs
         reach populations that are most in need.

  The country can and must take significant action to improve its water and sanitation sector.
  With the knowledge put forward in this report, subsequent dialogue, and ample action, it is
  possible for Nigeria to transcend the current crisis. Achieving the SDGs is still within reach. The
  costs of not moving forward in the sector are simply too great to ignore; the lives of 182 million
  individuals—and the fate of the nation as a whole—are linked to progress in this sector.

 Chapter 1
 Introduction

 With a population of 182 million, Nigeria is the largest country in Africa. It also has one of
 the fastest-growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa: its gross domestic product (GDP)
 quadrupled between 2005 and 2015. However, Nigeria has been unable to translate its
 rapid growth into fast poverty reduction. Three key factors have likely contributed to Nigeria’s
 persistently high poverty levels: (a) economic growth has been accompanied by high rates of
 population growth; (b) economic growth has not led to expanded jobs and other opportunities
 for all citizens; and (c) there is evidence that inequality has been rapidly increasing. Further,
 Nigeria is falling behind on several key indicators, including measures of the accumulation
 of physical and human capital and measures of household access to basic services (Molini
 et al. 2016).

 The entire region has limited access to WASH services. As of 2015, 319 million people in Sub-
 Saharan Africa did not have access to improved water, and 694 million lacked access to
 improved sanitation facilities. Alarmingly, a large body of evidence suggests that limited or no
 access to water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services has a number of deleterious
 effects on development outcomes. It adversely affects individuals’ health, limits their access
 to educational and economic opportunities, and hampers their work efficiency and labor
 productivity.

 Nigeria’s levels of access to WASH are markedly lower than those of other peer countries in
 the region. Fifty-seven million people in Nigeria continue to live without access to improved
 water, while 130 million people use unimproved sanitation facilities. According to research
 conducted by the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) of the World Bank, the socioeconomic
 impacts of poor sanitation alone cost the country about N455 billion (US$2 billion) each
 year. Such a status quo exists even though the country achieved the Millennium Development
 Goals (MDGs) for water in 2015. Nigeria was, however, unable to achieve the MDGs for
 sanitation.

 Against this backdrop, the Nigeria WASH Poverty Diagnostic seeks to assess the dynamic and
 often deleterious relationship between poverty and access to WASH services. This report
 draws from a number of national data sources, desk reviews, and primary research to provide
 insights to help close the gap between poverty and access to water and sanitation.

 As Nigeria sets out to achieve the more ambitious SDGs, it is all the more important to assess
 the current state of the WASH sector so policy makers and key stakeholders can develop
 effective policies and interventions to address shortcomings in access to WASH. Such efforts
 should be targeted at the most vulnerable in society, specifically those who experience the
 greatest burdens of poverty.

 This report is part of the broader Global WASH Poverty Diagnostic initiative, led by the World
 Bank’s Water and Poverty Global Practices. The initiative spans 18 countries across multiple
 regions. At the core of each diagnostic report lie four questions, which help guide the analysis

     and conversation toward probing the links between poverty and WASH access; the end goal is
     to offer insights for improving policy and practice:

                          Who are the bottom 40 percent of the national income and/or wealth
         Core Question 1: 
                          distribution and where in the country do they live?

                           hat is the level and quality of WASH services experienced by
         Core Question 2: W
                          the  bottom 40 percent and absolute poor, as compared to the top
                          60 percent and non-poor?

         Core Question 3: What are the linkages and synergies between WASH and other sectors?

                          What are the WASH service delivery constraints and solutions to
         Core Question 4: 
                          improving services to the bottom 40 percent?

     Under Core Question 1 (CQ1), we will primarily consider trends in poverty reduction that have
     occurred in Nigeria over the course of the past decade. For Core Question 2 (CQ2), we utilize
     the 2015 National Water Supply and Sanitation Survey (NWSS) data and the 2011 Multiple
     Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) to understand households’ access to water and sanitation,
     as well as to assess the functionality of water points and schemes. Advanced mapping
     techniques are used to better understand access to water and sanitation services, and to
     better assess the relationship between access and poverty. We also consider the Human
     Opportunity Index (HOI) to understand equality in access to WASH services. Further, we look
     at the NWSS data on public facilities to gain a sense of access to water and sanitation in
     public health centers and schools. In addressing Core Question 3 (CQ3), we draw from a
     number of sources to better understand the linkages and synergies between WASH and other
     sectors. For Core Question 4 (CQ4), we consider a myriad of sources to ascertain service
     delivery constraints.

     By addressing these four core questions, this diagnostic provides a comprehensive picture of
     access to WASH services and their corresponding relationship with poverty. At each step of the
     report, we offer critical takeaways. The final section synthesizes all of these takeaways into
     five core messages and offers comprehensive policy recommendations.

     Overall, the findings of the report reinforce the notion that Nigeria’s water and sanitation is in
     critical condition. Failure to address the current situation will have dire consequences for the
     nation. Considering the well-documented and far-reaching impacts of inadequate access to
     water and sanitation, and its inequitable impact on the poor, there is little doubt that
     shortcomings in this sector are severely hindering Nigeria’s overall progress. Without immediate
     attention to this sector from policy makers and other key stakeholders, at best, the country will
     continue to suffer from the damaging effects of the status quo. At worst, the situation will
     continue to deteriorate, making it increasingly difficult to establish the policies and programming
     needed to rehabilitate the sector in the future. As such, it is imperative that action is taken
     now, and that such actions are sustained.

     The report is structured as follows: chapter 2 focuses on the poverty profile of Nigeria. Guided
     by CQ1, it provides a profile of those residing in the bottom 40 percent (B40) of the national
     income or wealth distribution, and explores where in the country they live. We consider trends
     in poverty reduction that have occurred in Nigeria over the past decade. Namely, we use
     General Household Survey (GHS) panel data to assess changes in poverty rates and describe
     the characteristics of the poor. Then, using advanced mapping techniques, we look at the
     geographic distribution of poverty.

     Chapter 3 explains the current status of the water and sanitation sector in Nigeria. This chapter
     aims to understand Nigerian households’ access to water and sanitation using the latest data
     available, the 2015 NWSS. The chapter utilizes advanced mapping techniques to better
     understand geographical variation in access to water and sanitation services. Finally, it looks

 at the NWSS data on public facilities to derive a sense of the current state of access to water
 and sanitation in public health centers and schools.

 Chapter 4 focuses on the synergies between poverty and access to WASH. This chapter
 analyzes the level of WASH services experienced by the B40 and absolute poor, as compared
 to the top 60 percent (T60) and nonpoor. To answer CQ2, the chapter considers households’
 access to water and sanitation using the 2015 NWSS and the 2011 MICS. Advanced mapping
 techniques are used to better understand access to water and sanitation services, and to
 highlight the relationship between access and poverty. Further, this chapter considers the
 Human Opportunity Index (HOI) to look at equality in access to WASH and understand the
 social determinants conditioning access to WASH services.

 Chapter 5 covers some of the overlapping health risk factors associated with poor WASH and
 maps out their unequal distribution. In particular, this chapter focuses on the risk effects for
 children under five. The chapter aims to (a) quantify the proportion of WASH attributable risk
 of diarrheal disease borne by children in the bottom 20 percent (B20) and B40 of the income
 distribution, as measured by wealth quintiles; (b) estimate the potential health and other
 benefits of targeting WASH investments to children in the B20 and B40; (c) assist in identifying
 priority areas for WASH investment in which the social return will be greatest. A WASH poverty
 risk model is used to assess patterns of disease across different economic and geographic
 subsets of the population for children under five.

 Chapter 6 addresses the sustainability of the water sector in Nigeria through the lens of the
 efficiency of SWAs, and through the performance of water schemes and water points. The
 chapter uses the International Benchmarking Network (IBNET) for Water and Sanitation
 Utilities dataset to look at service provision efficiency in terms of utility performance. The
 measures used to estimate efficient service provision are staff productivity, service continuity,
 water consumption per capita, percentage of water samples that passed residual chlorine
 tests, cost recovery, and average revenue. The chapter also uses information from the NWSS
 2015 survey to identify the reasons why a limited percentage of water points and schemes
 are functional, and why some water points and schemes are failing faster than others. It also
 explores the possible drivers behind the failure of water schemes and water points, such as
 age, geographic distribution, hydrological characteristics, technology, and promoters. Finally,
 this chapter uses econometric techniques to decompose the relative share of each respective
 driver in contributing to water points and schemes’ likelihood of failure.

 Chapter 7 uses institutional and political economy analysis to explore challenges facing water
 service delivery in Nigeria. It provides a first look at bottlenecks and entry points for reform,
 highlighting key questions that may be unpacked further through fieldwork. With a primary
 focus on urban and rural water supply, the chapter sheds light on the causes behind the
 decline in access to piped water through household connections, and why the functionality of
 water points and schemes remains low. It sets out to understand why particular institutional
 capabilities have emerged, why certain bottlenecks persist, and what might be done to shift
 the institutional environment in a more positive direction over time.

 Chapter 8 provides a brief overview of the status of public expenditure. The primary objective
 of this chapter is to analyze the recent fiscal developments in Nigeria’s WASH sector within
 the context of a broad infrastructure investment program for growth and poverty reduction. The
 chapter offers insights on how to finance public investment, given the Federal Government of
 Nigeria’s (FGN’s) lack of access to resources and poor efficiency in expenditure. The broader
 aim for this chapter is to offer initial insights to help the Nigerian government map plans to
 better achieve the SDGs for WASH.

 Chapter 9 illustrates how national challenges play out in a specific state by exploring the
 institutional and organizational landscape for urban water supply in Bauchi City. The chapter
 draws on fieldwork carried out in Bauchi City, which aimed to (a) understand the institutional
 bottlenecks to improving publicly provided water; (b) assess the organization and dynamics of


A Wake Up Call	                                                                                      3
     informal service chains; and (c) identify household willingness to pay for publicly provided
     water. Fieldwork relied on qualitative methods covering well-off areas with relatively reliable
     access to publicly provided water (Anguwan Albasa); poorer unplanned settlements (Kandahar);
     and areas with a mix of formal and informal suppliers (Old Town). Data were collected through
     focus group discussions with households and interviews with informal providers and senior
     officials in the water sector.

     Chapter 10 concludes by offering key takeaway messages and policy strategies for addressing
     deficiencies facing the WASH sector. It summarizes the five core messages and provides
     preliminary entry points for reform to ensure better water and sanitation service delivery.
     Among other items, it advises the Nigerian government to adopt a multisectoral approach to
     dealing with the challenges facing the WASH sector, and to make a long-term commitment to
     finding pathways for better delivery in Nigeria including (a) greater investment in helping
     close implementation gaps, (b) support for service delivery capabilities in the water sector,
     and (c) greater integration of the private sector into the water and sanitation sectors. It also
     advises the government to place greater attention into building a more efficient financing and
     investment system, including helping upgrade tariff and subsidies structures, and creating
     more accountable budget processes.

 Poverty in Nigeria

                                         Key Takeaways

    •	 In recent years, Nigeria has successfully reduced its poverty rate by approximately
        10 percentage points. Poverty rates fell from 46.4 percent in 2004 to 36.2 percent
        in 2013.

    •	 However, this reduction in the poverty rate has not translated into a reduction in the
        total number of poor citizens. The country has experienced rapid population growth—
        nearly 3 percent per year—hampering the reduction of the absolute number of poor.

    •	 Three key factors have likely contributed to this low responsiveness: (a) economic
        growth has been accompanied by high rates of population growth; (b) economic
        growth has not led to expanded jobs and other opportunities for all citizens; and
        (c) there is evidence that inequality has been rapidly increasing.

    •	 Access to infrastructure has a significant impact on poverty in Nigeria. Econometric
        analysis indicates that the second biggest driver of the prominent north-south
        divide, as generated by endowments, is access to basic infrastructure.




 Poverty and Inequality in Nigeria
 While poverty declined by approximately 10 percentage points between 2004 and 2011,
 there was little improvement between 2011 and 2013 (see table 2.1). Poverty rates
 computed from the General Household Survey (GHS) panels, for which the consumption
 module was reestimated using survey-to-survey techniques, suggest that poverty rates are
 significantly lower than previous estimates.1 According to the GHS panels, poverty rates fell
 from 46 percent in 2004 to 35.6 percent in 2011, and to 36.2 percent in 2013 in per capita
 terms at the national level. The stagnation between 2011 and 2013 is likely the result of an
 overall decrease in the growth of the oil, trade, and agriculture industries in 2012.

 Most Nigerians remain either poor or vulnerable to poverty (Corral, Molini, and Oseni 2015).
 Households considered vulnerable to poverty are those that are above the poverty line in the
 consumption distribution2 but below the middle-income cutoff of about N130,000 per capita
 per year (approximately N356 per capita per day, in 2010 prices). Hence, although welfare
 improved throughout the income distribution between 2004 and 2013, 86 percent of
 Nigerians are still considered vulnerable to poverty or poor: 36 percent of the population are
 poor and 50 percent are considered vulnerable to poverty. On the other end of the spectrum,
 only 14 percent of Nigerians are considered middle income or above. Between 2004 and
 2013, changes in poverty, both positive and negative, have been most pronounced in urban
 areas. For instance, although the share of citizens vulnerable to poverty increased by
 8 percent in urban areas, these areas also saw an 18 percent decrease in the poverty rate,
 and a 10 percent increase in the share of people in the middle income.

     Despite Nigeria’s impressive reduction in the poverty rate, the total number of Nigerians living
     in poverty didn’t change significantly. Over the last decade, Nigeria experienced rapid population
     growth: nearly 3 percent per year. The rapid population growth, coupled with no changes in the
     poverty rate between 2011 and 2013, offset the gains made in poverty reduction between
     2004 and 2011. Between 2004 and 2013, the number of poor Nigerians increased by
     788,000. Further, while the overall population increased by 40 million between 2004 and
     2013—with population growth occurring almost evenly in urban and rural areas—the absolute
     number of poor decreased by 3 million in urban areas and increased by approximately 4 million
     in rural areas.

     The poverty rate decreased much faster in urban areas than it did in rural areas. Between 2004
     and 2013, the poverty rate in urban areas decreased from 34.2 percent to 15.9 percent, while
     poverty in rural areas barely improved, dropping from 51.6 percent to 48.5 percent. Although
     Nigeria’s last urban-rural classification was conducted in 1991, such findings are consistent
     with the fact that growth in agriculture remained slow in the years 2011–14, and with the
     widespread belief that urbanization has been a key driver of poverty reduction in Nigeria.

     Poverty reduction has not kept pace with the country’s large gross domestic product (GDP)
     growth. Nigeria’s GDP has outperformed the average GDP of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
     and performed similar to other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), growing at an
     average of 8 percent each year since 2004. However, the country’s large GDP growth has not
     kept pace with the country’s reduction in poverty: for every 1 percent growth in GDP per capita,
     the country experienced only a 0.6 percent decline in poverty. The low rate of poverty reduction
     may stem from the fact that the increase in GDP per capita did not lead to an equivalent
     increase in real per capita consumption: while GDP per capita grew by approximately 4.3 percent
     annually, average consumption grew at 3.2 percent. Hence, for each 1 percent increase in per
     capita GDP , there was only a 0.74 percent increase in per capita consumption. Further, most
     of the increase in consumption was driven by increased consumption in urban areas.

     Three key factors likely contributed to the low responsiveness of poverty reduction to economic
     growth (Molini et al. 2016). First, economic growth has been accompanied by high rates of
     population growth. While Nigeria’s population saw an increase of about 2.7 percent per year, a
     figure comparable to the Sub-Saharan African average, it exceeded the average rate of
     population growth for other LMICs, which decreased from 2.3 percent to 1.5 percent between
     1990 and 2014. Such higher rates of population growth adversely impacted economic growth;
     this is further evidenced when decomposing GDP      . Ultimately, Nigeria’s high population growth
     is driven by a very high fertility rate—5.5 births per woman—which is double the average of
     LMICs and higher than the Sub-Saharan African average of 5 births per woman.

     Second, economic growth has not led to expanded jobs and other opportunities for all citizens.
     Overall, the discrepancy between growth in consumption and GDP per capita are explained

 by the structure of the economy, which is heavily dependent on oil and mining, a sector that
 generates few jobs and is often dependent on foreign labor. Further, nonoil sectors, such as
 finance, are highly concentrated geographically. Other sectors, such as agriculture and
 manufacturing, have also been performing poorly (Beegle, Ringold, and Johansson de Silva
 2015). Overall, empirical analysis suggests that over the last decade, the Nigerian economy
 has had a low labor absorptive capacity at both the aggregate and sectoral levels (Ajakaiye
 et al. 2015).

 Third, there is evidence that inequality has been rapidly increasing. Between 2004 and 2013,
 GDP per capita grew more rapidly than the national average for people in the top percentile of
 the income distribution—increasing overall inequality. For people in the bottom 10 percent
 of the income distribution, growth in GDP per capita was, between 2004 and 2011, better than
 it was for people in the other percentiles; however, it suffered serious setbacks in growth
 between 2011 and 2013. Measures of household consumption make it clear that inequality
 rose in this period: inequality increased by approximately 15 percent when using the Gini
 coefficient, and by 82 percent when considering the Theil index.

 Persistently high levels of inflation have hampered poverty reduction in recent years. Since the
 1980s, Nigeria has faced high levels of inflation, placing a large portion of the population—
 highly concentrated around the poverty line—at risk. Those living in urban areas are even more
 vulnerable. Nigeria fares worse in terms of inflation than do other oil-exporting LIMCs: it has
 the second-highest level of inflation out of all oil-exporting developing countries, second only to
 Angola (IMF 2011).

 Poor households are likely to be headed by older men who are self-employed in agriculture and
 possess no education. Across all years and regardless of income, men are more likely than
 women to be the heads of households. Typically, the head of a poor, vulnerable to poverty, or
 middle-income household is 50 years old. Approximately 75 percent of the heads of poor
 households were self-employed in 2013, and they worked primarily in agriculture. Between
 2004 and 2014, the percentage of poor households with an uneducated household head
 increased from 54 percent to 67 percent.

 Most poor households face serious deficiencies in access to basic infrastructure. Poor
 households are less likely to own durables (e.g., televisions, fridges, stoves, and generators)
 than are vulnerable to poverty and middle-income households, potentially due to the limited
 availability of electricity in poor dwelling units. They also lag behind in ownership of vehicles
 for transportation, the use of efficient energy sources, and in access to improved water and
 sanitation.3

 Nigeria has underperformed when compared to other Sub-Saharan African countries in an array
 of poverty-related, nonmonetary indicators. While Nigeria has improved in most of its
 anthropometric indicators, other African countries have generally performed better. Progress is
 particularly needed in improving the under-five mortality rate (U5MR), the maternal mortality
 ratio, and rates of stunting and malnutrition. In the education sector, Nigeria’s gross enrollment
 ratio of primary schools is 13.7 percent lower than the average of LMICs in Sub-Saharan Africa
 (98.4 percent). Further, the literacy rate of Nigerian women is a mere 53.1 percent—far behind
 those of other countries (e.g., in Kenya and Rwanda).

 Nigeria faces significant inequality in access to water and sanitation—particularly among
 children. When considering the Human Opportunity Index (HOI), which measures equality in
 access to water and sanitation for children (0–16 years) in Nigeria (circa 2006), both the HOI
 and the coverage for water are close to 0.4,5 Nigeria performs well in access to sanitation
 compared to a number of other African countries, but coverage is still a mere 15 percent. The
 gap between coverage and the HOI is more than 5 percent, thus children’s access to flush
 toilets is both low, highly unequal, and very much influenced by their geographic and demographic
 circumstances (e.g., wealth, location).

     Mind the Gap
     Evidence suggests that poverty is highly concentrated in the north. As of 2013, over 57 percent
     of poor Nigerians lived either in the North East or North West. Including the North Central,
     around 72 percent of the poor live in northern regions—a 10 percentage point increase from
     2004. This regional concentration is likely explained by a combination of factors, among which
     are less favorable climate, distance from the sea, and poor and dilapidated infrastructure.
     While the poverty rate and the absolute numbers of poor declined in the highly populated
     coastal and central regions since 2004, the opposite has occurred in the North West and
     North East zones. In contrast, middle- and high-income households are typically found in urban
     locations, and in the southern parts of the country.

     Poverty rates in the North region are higher than they are in the South region, and have decreased
     at a much slower rate. In the past decade, all southern regions saw a decline in poverty.
     In contrast, only the North Central region saw a reduction in its poverty levels (a reduction of
     almost 18 points), while poverty rates remained the same in the North West and North East
     regions—at 47.6 percent and 59 percent, respectively. The reduction in the total number of
     poor also mirrors this divide: the total number of poor in the South South region decreased by
     almost 6 million, while there was an increase of almost 8 million in the North region.

     Further, poverty is more chronic and long-lasting in the North region. Looking at the 2011 and
     2013 GHS panels, we see clear patterns of chronic concentrated poverty in the North region:
     75 percent of the chronic poor (poor in both periods) are in the North region, and 25 percent
     in the South region. Approximately 60 percent of the transient poor (poor in 2011 and nonpoor
     in 2013, or vice versa) also reside in the North region. In the northern regions, the percentage
     of the chronic poor is highest in the North West region (37 percent) and second highest in the
     North East region (15 percent). Inversely, the share of chronic poor is typically under 10 percent
     in the southern zones.

     The North East and North West can be considered largely responsible for the low responsiveness
     of poverty reduction to growth. Between 2004 and 2013, their percent of the population
     remained consistent (37 percent), but their share of the poor increased from 46 percent to
     57 percent. When calculating the growth elasticity of poverty with these two zones excluded,
     the value doubles, and the speed of Nigeria’s poverty reduction outpaces growth. Different
     patterns of poverty reduction in these regions are reflective of both their different rates of
     growth in per capita consumption and variation in inequality.

     The increase in inequality and polarization was driven by widening regional disparities. When
     calculating the Gini coefficient, we see that the increase in inequality at the national level was
     largely driven by two components: inequalities among regions (an average of 25 percent of the
     total increase in the Gini coefficient between 2003 and 2013 is explained by an increasing
     North-South regional divide) and within-zone inequalities (approximately 50 percent of the
     increase is explained by inequality within regions). Nigeria is also undergoing a fast process of
     polarization—the combination of divergence from global and convergence on local mean
     incomes—as opposed to inequality, which is the overall dispersion of the distribution. When
     using the relative distribution method, the generalized increase in consumption meant that as
     of 2013, households were crowded around the top deciles of the previous distribution in
     2004—masking growing polarization. This polarization is confirmed when factoring out changes
     in real median expenditure. Lower deciles tend to be emptied in the southern regions (South
     West and South South), whereas the opposite is evident in the North West and North East.
     Hence, the north-south divide drives the pattern of distributional change.

     The north-south inequality divide spans across areas including education, health care, and
     nutrition. For instance, the enrollment rate across all age groups is lower in northern states,
     particularly for children ages 5–10. Further, after completing primary school (grade 6), over
     two-thirds of students in the North region are illiterate, as compared to 18 percent in the

 South region. In the North East, 72 percent of students are illiterate after grade 6. In terms of
 health outcomes, the U5MR has declined drastically in the southern zones, but remains high
 in the North region. Stunting and malnutrition are also direr in the North region, and consistently
 at the highest levels in the North West.

 The north-south divide is evident when considering poverty maps, and there is significant
 variation within zones. Gething and Molini (2015) present a statistical modeling approach that
 generates mapped surfaces of poverty rates at a fine spatial scale, in spite of various data
 limitations. Map 2.1 and map 2.2, panels a and b, utilize the 2012/13 GHS data to provide
 poverty headcount rates—the percentage of the population that live below the poverty line—
 across Nigeria. Map 2.1 provides a heat map of the poverty headcount rate at the national
 level, and map 2.2, panels a and b, present poverty rates and poverty headcounts at a more
 granular level: aggregated at the local government area (LGA) level.

 Maps 2.1 and 2.2 show a clear regional divide: the extreme poor inhabit a belt that extends
 across the country from the North West to the South East (extending from Zamfara State

                                       toward Cross Rivers State, bordering Cameroon). Further, poverty rates in the North West
                                       and North Central regions are relatively heterogeneous; the North Central region experiences
                                       low levels of poverty, which can be traced east from Abuja to the city of Jos, moving west into
                                       LGAs that border Benin, in Niger. Yet, other LGAs in this zone exhibit poverty rates as high
                                       as 60 percent to 85 percent. Among all regions, the South West is least affected by poverty;
                                       despite some exceptions, poverty rates appear to be lower than 12 percent, and the South
                                       Central region also performs well overall. Both of these southern regions experience positive
                                       spillover effects from the nearby Lagos. Among the southern regions, the South East is most
                                       visibly affected by poverty; rates in excess of 40 percent are observed at both the state and
                                       LGA levels. In the South South region, which encompasses the Niger Delta, pockets of
                                       poverty exist—namely in the LGAs of Southern Ijaw and Ekeremor.


                                       The North-South Divide: An Econometric Analysis6
                                       There is a high concentration of drivers of poverty reduction in the south, explaining the large
                                       north-south divide in poverty rates. Endowment differences account for 75 percent of this
                                       divide: 40 percent is explained by household structure: northern regions have higher
                                       dependency rates as well as more numerous households. The second biggest endowment-
                                       related factor driving the divide is access to basic infrastructure (20 percent), and the third
                                       biggest driver (13 percent of the endowment impact) is urbanization. Further, 6 percent of the
                                       endowment impact can be attributed to the educational divide between the north and south,
                                       in terms of household heads with primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Overall,
                                       differences in the structure of the labor market between the north and south—with the majority
                                       of those in the north dependent on subsistence agriculture—contributes to about 5 percent
                                       of the overall divide. When significant, returns on schooling, infrastructure, and productive
                                       assets serve to reduce the gap between the north and south.

 Chronically poor households have unique demographic characteristics: they are larger,
 concentrated in the north, sustained by agriculture, headed by older men, and less educated.
 Chronically poor households are more prevalent in the north, while nonpoor households are
 concentrated in the south—particularly in the South West. In general, chronically poor
 households have more members and have a higher number of dependents than both transient
 and permanent nonpoor households. Chronically poor households are also likely to be headed
 by 50-year-old men who are self-employed in agriculture. Households headed by individuals
 with no education are also likely to be chronically poor.

 Transiently poor and nonpoor households perform differently in a number of poverty-related,
 nonmonetary indicators. In general, transiently poor household heads’ level of education is
 closer to that of chronically poor households than it is to that of the nonpoor; they are more
 likely to be employed in agriculture than nonpoor households; and they are more likely to be
 located in northern areas (59 percent) as compared to the nonpoor (30 percent). Transiently
 poor households are also more likely to be located in rural areas and are less likely to have
 electricity in their dwelling. They are also more likely to use uncovered pit latrines and
 unimproved water sources.

 Econometric analysis reveals the importance of geographic region, education, type of employment,
 infrastructure, and climate in explaining chronic poverty. With all other factors being equal,
 living outside of the North West—as well as in urban rather than rural locations—increases the
 log odds that an individual occupies a dynamic profile higher than chronic poverty. When
 household heads possess higher levels of education, their households are more likely to occupy
 a higher dynamic category. Inversely, when a household head is employed in agriculture, his
 household has significantly lower log odds of occupying a higher category. Most interestingly, the
 log odds of moving out of chronic poverty increase in response to access to basic infrastructure
 and lower climatic variation.

 Access to basic infrastructure—such as electricity, water and sanitation, and roads—is
 much higher in the southern regions. Access to basic services (e.g., electricity, water, and
 sanitation) reduces the likelihood of being poor in Nigeria. While access to electricity is a
 nationwide challenge, this problem is particularly acute in the north—only around 25 percent
 to 28 percent of households in the North East and North West have access to basic services.
 We observe a similar trend when considering access to water and sanitation. Access to
 improved water is typically higher in the south than in the north; in 2013, over 70 percent
 of households in the south had access to improved water, whereas the northern region had
 access rates as low as 49 percent in the North Central zone. In terms of sanitation, around
 34 percent to 36 percent of households in the south had access to sanitation in 2013,
 whereas over 90 percent of households in the North East and North West lacked access.
 The north also has poor highway infrastructure, which limits households’ connectivity to
 federal and state capitals.



 Notes
 1.	 The authors’ reestimation of the consumption module was necessary, since the 2009–10
     Harmonized Nigerian Living Standard Survey’s (HNLSS) consumption module severely
     underestimated household survey consumption, and because consumption data for the
     2003–04 Nigeria Living Standard Survey (NLSS) and GHS panel were collected differently,
     negating the possibility of comparing their respective consumption figures.
 2.	 The consumption distribution is the measure of the purchase of goods and services across
     the population. This is an alternative means to assess economic equality for a given
     population.
 3.	 These calculations were made using the General Household Survey Nigeria (GHSN
     2012/2013) available at http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/.

      5.	 As described by Molini et al. (2015), the HOI was created by the World Bank with external
          researchers in 2008. It is an indicator to measure the inequality of opportunities.
          In particular, the HOI considers (a) how far a country is from the goal of providing universal
          access to a set of goods and services and (b) the degree to which there is equality of
          opportunity to access the goods and services. Intuitively, the HOI is an inequality of
          opportunity discounted coverage rate. The higher the correlation between access and
          circumstances, the larger the discount or “penalty” to the coverage rate in computing the
          HOI (Dabalen et al. 2015). In this case, as overall coverage is low, it is difficult to decipher
          inequality in access.
      6.	 Determinants of poverty rates in two southern zones (the South West and South South)
          and two northern zones (the North East and North West) are analyzed by estimating a
          recentered inference function (RIF) (Fortin, Lemiuex, and Firpo 2011). Then, using a
          standard Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, the divide in poverty rates is decomposed into
          the coefficient effect (differences in returns on variables), the endowment effect (changes
          in mean characteristics), and a residual. The same exercise is also conducted for middle-
          income households in these two groups.

                                         Key Takeaways

    •	 Nigeria   has made considerable progress in the water sector. The country has
        achieved the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for water, and the majority of
        citizens—61 percent—have access to improved water. Yet only 41 percent of the
        population has access to improved water within 30 minutes round-trip of their
        premises, and only 31 percent have access to improved water on premises. Even
        fewer, 7 percent, possess piped water on premises.

    •	 The sanitation sector is in critical condition. Nigeria was unable to achieve the MDG
        for sanitation, and current data reflect this reality: only 29 percent of Nigerians have
        access to unshared improved sources of sanitation, and only 5.6 percent make use
        of sewerage systems. Due to the widespread repercussions of poor sanitation,
        shortcomings in this sector are of significant concern.

    •	 Approximately 23 million to 46 million Nigerians practice open defecation. National
        estimates of open defecation rates—which vary between 13 percent and 25 percent—
        indicate that open defecation remains pervasive across the country.

    •	 Access   to safely managed water sources is probably between 15 percent and
        20 percent. Of the 31 percent of households that have access to improved water on
        premises, one in six had interrupted service within the two-week period preceding
        the survey, and 21 percent of drinking water sources in the dry season and 42 percent
        of water sources in the rainy season were contaminated.



 Access to Water and Sanitation in Nigeria
 What is the level and quality of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services experienced by
 the bottom 40 percent (B40) and absolute poor, as compared to the top 60 percent (T60) and
 nonpoor? To understand Nigerian households’ access to water and sanitation, we utilized data
 from the 2015 National Water Supply and Sanitation Survey (NWSS). We also used advanced
 mapping techniques to better understand geographic variation in access to water and sanitation
 services. Finally, we look at the NWSS data on public facilities to better understand access to
 water and sanitation in public health centers and schools.1

 Nigeria met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for water—69 percent of the
 population now have access to improved water. Between 1990 and 2015, Nigeria increased
 access to improved water by 29 percentage points. In 2015, 69 percent of households had
 access to improved water. This improvement was mainly driven by a 32 percentage point
 increase in coverage for rural areas—from 25 percent in 1990, to 57 percent in 2015
 (figure 3.1, panels a–c). While coverage in urban areas is higher, access to improved water
 increased by only 5 percentage points during this 15-year period.

      While access to improved water at the national level increased, access to piped water on
      premises declined by 10 percentage points: from 12 percent in 1990 to 2 percent in 2015.
      This is mainly due to a steep decline of 29 percentage points in access to piped water in
      urban areas—from 32 percent to 3 percent. The sharp decrease in access to piped water
      in urban areas is due to rapid urbanization, lack of investment, and institutional constraints
      in the expansion of services. Moreover, households continually face the risk of bacteriological
      or chemical contamination by increasingly relying on alternative water providers or private
      household solutions, such as unregulated manually drilled boreholes, which offer limited
      data on aquifer recharge and saline intrusion. On the supply side, the decrease in the
      provision of water to less than 50 liters per person per day affects the sustainability of the
      water utility systems, and leads to an inconsistent supply of water for those few consumers
      who have access to a water connection (Macheve et al. 2015). In rural areas, access to
      piped water was already low in 1990, and there was an additional decrease of 2 percentage
      points by 2015.

      Nigeria did not meet the sanitation targets for the MDG, and the country has seen an overall
      decline in access to improved sanitation. At a national level, there was a decrease of
      9 percentage points in access to improved sanitation. Access decreased from 38 percent in
      1990 to 29 percent in 2015. Urban and rural access to improved sanitation were both
      38 percent in 1990, and decreased to 33 percent in urban areas and 25 percent in rural areas
      in 2015 (figure 3.2).

 Between 15 percent and 25 percent of the population still practice open defecation.2 At the
 national level, open defecation rates remained relatively stable, with a 1 percentage point
 increase during this 25-year period. However, open defecation more than doubled in urban
 areas, from 7 percent in 1990 to 15 percent in 2015. Moreover, only 9 percent of the urban
 population was connected to a sewerage service in 2015 (National Population Commission
 [NPC [Nigeria]] and ICF International 2014). The practice of open defecation also increased
 in rural areas during this time period, though to a lesser extent—from 31 percent to 34 percent.
 There is significant reliance on on-site sanitation as a low-cost form of technology for reducing
 levels of open defecation, and the private sector provides services for excreta management.
 However, the final disposal sites of on-site sanitation technologies raise significant concerns
 about sustainability (World Bank 2009).

 Access rates for WASH, while comparable to those of many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa,
 are much lower than the rates of most other countries in Africa. Most noticeably, access to
 piped water in Nigeria is below that of most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, access
 to improved sanitation in Nigeria falls below estimates for Senegal and Rwanda (table 3.1).

      were surveyed, and the survey captures information on a household’s access to sources of
      water and sanitation (see box 3.1 for an overview of the datasets used for this report, and
      some of the challenges and opportunities facing the data ecosystem in Nigeria). We use the
      following eight indicators, informed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for water
      and sanitation, to provide an overview of the current state of access to water and sanitation in
      Nigeria:

      In assessing access to water in Nigeria, we utilize four key indicators:3

        ••    Improved water sources are those which, by the nature of their construction and when
              properly used, adequately protect the source from outside contamination, particularly
              fecal matter. Such sources include piped water to yards or plots, public taps or standpipes,
              tube wells or boreholes, protected springs, and rainwater.

        ••    Basic water satisfies the requirement for “improved technology” as specified by improved
              water, but it also assumes a 30-minute round-trip collection time.

        ••    Improved water on premises fulfills the same requirements as basic water, but further
              implies that improved water is available directly on one’s premise.

        ••    Piped water on premises fulfills the same requirements as “improved water on premises,”
              but water is provided through pipes.

      In assessing access to sanitation, the following four key indicators are used:

        ••    Fixed-point sanitation implies defecation into a pit or other containment structure,
              regardless of the quality of the structure or whether it is hygienically maintained
              (i.e., access to both improved and unimproved facilities). It is estimated as the opposite
              of open defecation, which is defined as “not having access to any type of toilet” or
              “going into the field.”

        ••    An improved sanitation facility is one that hygienically separates human excreta from
              human contact that is unshared or is shared between two or more households.

        ••    Improved sanitation implies access to a sanitation facility that hygienically separates
              human excreta from human contact and is not shared with any other households.

        ••    Sewerage implies that a household is connected to a sewer system.

      Box 3.1: Importance of Data

      Having reliable and consistent population surveys and extensive data on government
      expenditure and service provision is the cornerstone of solid, evidence-based policy
      decision making. This report has made use of ample sources of data to provide an
      overview of the WASH sector in Nigeria. Among the datasets used are: The
      Demographic Household Survey (DHS), the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS),
      the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS), the National Water Supply and
      Sanitation Survey (NWSS), data from the International Benchmarking Network for
      Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET), expenditure information published by the
      Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as other administrative data.

      It is encouraging that the government of Nigeria has taken positive steps towards
      documenting and releasing independent, reliable data on population estimates
      and social service provision. Central to this positive trend is the passing of the
      Freedom of Information Act of 2011, which made significant advances in helping
      democratize and increase transparency in government data.

      However, more work needs to be done to ensure that censuses and populations
      surveys are done regularly, that data are released on a timely manner, and that the
      data collected are of the highest quality. For instance: NWSS surveys suffered from
      duplicate observations and a number of other inconsistencies. There were also
      severe constraints regarding the quality, timeliness, and availability of data on public
      accounts and national finances used in the public expenditure review (PER).

      The Nigerian government thus needs to continue to promote the further
      implementation of population surveys, and keep working on bettering the
      infrastructure for the collection and documentation of service provision data. This
      will continue to allow for the production of high-quality policy research and well-
      informed policy making in relation to WASH and other sectors.




 The majority of Nigerians (61 percent) have access to improved water, but only a small
 percentage of them have access to improved water on premises. Approximately 45 percent of
 the population have access to basic water, only 31 percent has access to improved water on
 premises, and a mere 7 percent has access to piped water on premises (table 3.2).4 Hence, the
 majority of those with access to improved water must travel long distances to use these
 sources, which likely affects their usage rates.

 Less than one-third of Nigerians have access to unshared improved sanitation, and a mere 5.6
 percent actually make use of sewerage systems. Overall, 44 percent of the population use an
 improved shared facility, but only 28.6 percent have access to an improved sanitation facility
 that is not shared with other households. Given that the urban population is increasing, this
 finding is particularly alarming, since evidence suggests that the use of access to improved
 sanitation has a significant impact on health and anthropometric characteristics. In spite of
 this, open defecation (calculated as the inverse of fixed-point sanitation: 1 minus the rate of
 fixed-point sanitation) remains relatively high (15 percent).5

                                       Overall, the southern regions of Nigeria outperform their northern counterparts in access to
                                       improved water, while most northern regions have higher rates of improved sanitation. The
                                       South West has the highest rate of access to improved water (71.5 percent) and improved
                                       water on premises (41.4 percent) of all regions. Improved sanitation is higher in the north, with
                                       the North West having the highest level of access.

                                       Urban areas6 and state capitals display higher rates of access to improved water and improved
                                       water on premises. This finding is likely explained by the presence of better infrastructure in
                                       urban areas across Nigeria. State capitals are particularly at an advantage, since they have
                                       greater access to improved WASH across all indicators (see table 3.3).

                                       Although data are limited, it is estimated that between 15 percent and 20 percent of households
                                       have access to “safely managed water,” the SDG for water. Through the SDGs, the world has
                                       now committed to achieving universal access to water, sanitation, and hygiene under a broader,

 more refined and more intricate monitoring framework. The new SDG indicators for measuring
 access are composite and stricter than the previous MDG indicators. The three additional
 measurements that define safely managed are whether a drinking water source is on premises,
 available when needed, and free of fecal and locally relevant chemical contamination. There
 are no data available in Nigeria that allow us to fully comply with the definition of safely managed,
 but access to an improved water source on premises and uninterrupted service over the last
 two weeks is used as a proxy. As seen in table 3.4, 31 percent of the population have access
 to improved water on premises, out of which 26.1 percent of households have access to safely
 managed water. Data on water quality are quite scarce, but a study conducted in Port Harcourt
 found that 21 percent of drinking water sources in the dry season and 42 percent of water
 sources in the rainy season were contaminated by thermotolerant coliforms (see box 3.2).




      Box 3.2: Water Quality Testing Study in Port Harcourt,
      Rivers State, Nigeria

      A comprehensive analysis (World Bank 2015) of water sources and quality was
      conducted in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, in the dry season, between November 2013 and
      February 2014, with a follow-up during the rainy season, between July and September
      2015. Representative sampling suggests that municipal water supplies represent less
      than 1 percent of local water sources. Residents largely rely on privately constructed
      and maintained boreholes that are supplemented by commercially packaged bottled
      and sachet drinking water. The study led to several interesting findings:

      There were significant changes between the dry and wet seasons, including for
      commercially packaged water. Contamination by thermotolerant coliforms increased
      from 21 percent of drinking water sources in the dry season to 42 percent of drinking
      water sources in the rainy season. The most significant increase was in sachet
      water, which showed the lowest frequencies of contamination in the dry season as
      compared to other sources (15 percent), but the highest frequencies during the rainy
      season (59 percent). Only half as many respondents reported drinking sachet water
      in the rainy season as they did in the dry season.

      There were significant associations between water quality and other hazardous
      factors. Respondents primarily used flush or pour-flush toilets connected to septic
      tanks, while the remainder relied on toilets and pier latrines drained into surface
      waters. There were significant associations between fecal contamination in boreholes
      and the nearby presence of pier latrines. Sanitary surveys of boreholes showed that
      more than half were well constructed, and the study did not identify associations
      between structural or site deficiencies and microbial water quality.

      The deterioration of drinking water quality during the rainy season is a serious public
      health risk for both untreated groundwater and commercially packaged water,
      highlighting a need to address gaps in the monitoring and quality control of alternative
      supplies. While commercially packaged water should be regulated by the Nigerian
      National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), the results
      of this study indicate that these regulations are currently not sufficient.

                                                                           box continues next page




A Wake Up Call	                                                                                          19
           Box 3.2: Continued

           Given the nearly universal reliance on borehole-based, on-site self-supply in the
           study area, the Port Harcourt Water Corporation (PHWC) may face challenges in
           increasing its connection and metering levels unless it can maintain—and convince
           consumers of—the reliability and quality of forthcoming municipal piped supplies. In
           the meanwhile, water quality management in Port Harcourt should therefore include
           more effective regulation of private, public, and commercial water sources, with a
           particular focus on water quality monitoring and oversight of bottled and sachet
           water providers.




      Rates for sewerage are low across all locations. The availability of higher quality infrastructure
      likely explains why urban areas have a higher access to sewerage (12 percent) than nonurban
      locations (6 percent or lower). These abysmal rates of access to sewerage connections likely
      have severely deleterious impacts upon health outcomes in Nigeria.

      Open defecation is highest in rural areas. Rates of open defecation—the inverse of fixed-point
      sanitation—are highest in rural areas, mirroring the urban-rural divide in access to sewerage and
      other forms of WASH infrastructure. Open defecation is lowest in state capitals, at 3 percent,
      and in urban areas, at 6 percent.

      Although there is limited information on the use of household sanitation facilities, the data
      reveal interesting patterns in how the facilities are employed. In the states of Enugu and Ekiti:
      81 percent of households that own a latrine and have improved facilities stated that at least
      one household member does not use the latrine. There is also a large gender divide in the use
      of latrines: adult men are more likely than adult women to use the toilet. Almost 50 percent of
      young boys and almost 30 percent of young girls don’t use toilets at home. Interestingly,
      individuals from households that lack a toilet don’t necessarily recur to open defecation: these
      individuals mostly use their neighbor’s toilet, or a portable latrine. Respondents cited various
      reasons for not using the toilet, even if their household owned one. For instance, several
      female household members reported fear of contracting diseases as a key reason for not
      using the toilet. Some respondents stated that young boys under the age of 10 were “too
      young” to use the toilet (Box 3.3).

      Nigeria is also making progress toward achieving the SDG for sanitation and hygiene. For
      measuring access to sanitation and hygiene in accordance with this SDG, several additional
      aspects are considered when examining the use of unshared improved sanitation facilities:
      (a) the availability of a place for handwashing with soap and water at home, (b) child feces
      disposal practices, and (c) menstrual hygiene management (MHM).7 Using data and
      indicators for MHM, it is estimated that only 25 percent of women in Nigeria lack adequate
      privacy for defecation or MHM. However, estimates vary across states. For instance,
      85  percent of women in Lagos reported having everything they need to manage their
      menstruation, while in Kaduna State this figure was only 37 percent (PMA2020). Moreover,
      there are major barriers to hygiene: 88 percent of women in Nigeria lack access to a place
      for handwashing with soap and water at home. In rural areas, this figure is a staggering
      92 percent (Loughnan et al. 2016).

      Box 3.3: Sustainable Total Sanitation—Nigeria Baseline Report

      This box summarizes the description of baseline data collected in the states of Ekiti
      and Enugu as a part of the Sustainable Total Sanitation project in Nigeria (Abramovsky,
      Augsburg, and Oteiza 2015).

      Gender difference in usage. There is a large gender divide in the use of latrines.
      Among households where at least one member reported not using the toilet, adult
      women were three times (18 percent) less likely to use the household’s latrine than
      were adult men (5.6 percent). The main reason women stated for not using the toilet
      was fear of contracting disease; there appears to be a common belief in Nigeria that
      warm air coming up from the toilet pit makes women more susceptible to diseases.

      Access to improved sanitation and usage. While 89 percent of households that own
      a latrine have improved sanitation facilities, the number falls to 81 percent if we look
      only at those households which declared that at least one member does not use the
      latrine. Even if the household has a toilet, not all members seem to use it: almost
      50 percent of young boys and 30 percent of young girls.

      Patterns in open defecation. Individuals from a household without a toilet didn’t
      necessarily practice open defecation; these households mostly used their neighbor’s
      toilet or a portable latrine. Moreover, despite owning a latrine, around 17 percent of
      households in Enugu and 27 percent of households in Ekiti stated that their personal
      preferences were an important factor in influencing their decisions to defecate
      openly. Furthermore, about three in four households whose members performed
      open defecation reported that it was done away from their own homes. There were
      various reasons stated for not using a toilet, even if the household owned one: in
      Enugu, respondents stated that young boys under the age of 10 were “too young” to
      use the toilet. For women, it was mostly the fear of contracting diseases.

      Obstacles in acquiring latrines: The baseline survey data shows that only 36 percent
      of households own some kind of functioning latrine. The cost of construction is
      reported as the main obstacle in the acquisition of latrines. The relative magnitude
      of the investment cost, compared to the household’s income, explains a great deal
      of variation in latrine ownership. It costs on average of $382 to construct a toilet in
      Ekiti and an average of $296 to construct one in Enugu. This represents around
      44  percent in Ekiti, and 77 percent in Enugu, of the annual income of those
      households that don’t own a toilet. This suggests that the absence of a toilet does
      not necessarily stem from a lack of understanding about the cost and benefits of
      owning a toilet, but that it is perhaps best explained by the liquidity constraint of the
      households.

                                        Latest Geographical WASH Estimates for Nigeria
                                        Similar to the poverty maps used in chapter 2, heat maps were used to gain a sense of access
                                        to improved water and sanitation in Nigeria.8 Both national- and state-level maps were used for
                                        each of the seven WASH indicators, and overlaid them with other population characteristics to
                                        examine the relationship between poverty and access to water and sanitation.

                                        When moving across tiers of access to water, from the most attainable (improved water) to the
                                        hardest to attain sources of improved water supply (piped on premises), we observe a steady
                                        decline in access rates is observed. Such findings are observed from map 3.1, panels a–d, as
                                        the standards of quality and technology required to acccess the water sources progressively
                                        increase. Overall, clusters in the North Central, South West, and South South regions exhibit
                                        the best performance in terms of improved water, basic water, and improved water on premises.
                                        Piped water on premises is scarcely available throughout the country, short of a few minor
                                        pockets in Taraba, Jigawa, and Yobe states.

 There is a sharp north-south divide in access to fixed-point sanitation and access to improved
 sanitation. As shown in map 3.2, panel a (which shows the percentage of households with
 fixed-point sanitation, or not practicing open defecation), there is a belt extending from the
 South West to the South East of the country, separating regions with high open defecation
 rates in the south from regions with low open defecation rates in the north. The exception to
 this is the South South region, which seems to have low rates of open defection. As shown in
 map 3.2, panel b, access to improved sanitation shows a similar north-south divide. Map 3.2,
 panel b, also suggests that there is an overwhelming lack of access to improved sanitation
 across the country.

 There is very limited access to improved sanitation and to sewage systems across the country.
 As shown in map 3.2, panel c, only a few scattered regional pockets possess proper sewerage
 infrastructure in Nigeria. There is also little overlap between regions with access to improved
 sanitation and regions with access to a sewerage system.

 These heat maps shown previously, maps 3.1 and 3.2, provide estimates of access to water
 and sanitation at local. The following maps provide estimates at the state level. For each WASH
 estimate, map 3.3, panels a, present the percentage of the population with access to improved
 water for each state, and map 3.3, panels b, present the total population, in millions, of those
 without access to improved water. Although Kaduna and Kano states have high rates of access
 to improved water among their residents, a large number of them do not have access to
 improved water. Although 40 percent to 60 percent of citizens have access to improved water
 in these states, approximately 4.5 million individuals in Kaduna and 6 million individuals in
 Kano still lack access. Additionally, while Bayelsa appears to be the worst performing state in
 map 3.3, panel a (0 percent to 20 percent of citizens have access to improved water), only
 about 1.6 million individuals lack access (map 3.3, panel b), which is a low figure in comparison
 to many other states.

 States in Nigeria experience low levels of access to improved water on premises across the
 board. Nearly all states—with the exception of Lagos—have rates of access to improved water
 on premises that are below 60 percent (map 3.4, panel a). Approximately 5.6 million individuals
 still lack access in Lagos state. The state of Kano, while not exhibiting the absolute lowest rate
 of access, has approximately 9.1 million individuals who lack access to improved water on
 premises (map 3.4, panel b).

 The central region of the country experiences high open defecation rates. As map 3.5, panel a,
 shows, there are around eight states, from Oyo in the west, to Taraba in the east, for which

                                       open defecation rates range between 40 percent to 80 percent. Yet, because of low levels of
                                       population density, many of these states do not have particularly high numbers of citizens
                                       practicing open defecation; most states have between 1 million to 2 million people practicing
                                       open defecation. The estimates range from 1.1 million in Nassarawa State to 3.5 million in

 Access to improved sanitation is low nationally, and it is lower in the North West, South West,
 and South South regions. Several states have large segments of their populations that lack
 access to improved sanitation. The states of Imo, Kaduna, and Katsina have the highest rates
 of access to improved sanitation: between 40 percent and 60 percent (map 3.6, panel a).
 Between 2 million and 4 million residents in these states are without improved sanitation,

      which is roughly on par with the majority of states in the country. In contrast, Lagos, Oyo, and
      Kano are among the states with the lowest access: around 6 million to 13 million individuals
      in these states lack access to improved sanitation (map 3.6, panel b).

      In general, states with low access to improved water also have low access to improved sanitation.
      Yet this relationship does not hold among states with high access to improved water and high
      access to improved sanitation. For instance, Lagos State, which has 80 percent to 100 percent
      access to improved water, only has 0 percent to 20 percent access to improved sanitation.
      Lagos also has one of the highest number of people lacking access to improved sanitation.
      Jigawa and Imo states also mirror this performance, having high rates of access to improved
      water but low rates of access to improved sanitation.

      There is a high correlation between access to improved water and improved sanitation at the
      national level. Map 3.7 shows the interaction between improved water and improved sanitation,
      broken down by terciles. For example: “low-low” represents areas that belong to the bottom
      tercile of access to improved water and in the bottom tercile of access to improved sanitation;
      “high-high” represents areas that belong to the top tercile of access to improved water and the
      top tercile of access to improved sanitation. The corresponding figure 3.3, presents the share
      of the population in each of these groups. Almost a quarter of individuals have high access to
      both water and sanitation. Approximately 7.9 percent have low access to both improved
      sanitation and improved water—a relatively small share of the total population. Moreover,

 Note: This figure, based on data in map 3.7, shows the interaction between improved water and improved sanitation, broken
 down by terciles. For example: “low-low” represents the percentage of the population who are both in the bottom tercile of access
 to improved water and in the bottom tercile of access to improved sanitation.




 18.1  percent of citizens have high access to improved water, but low access to improved
 sanitation, and 4.7 percent have high access to improved sanitation, but low access to
 improved water. Additional research is needed to understand the underlying factors driving
 these interactions.

 Improved water is available to the majority of Nigerians, but the amount of time needed to
 access a reliable water source varies greatly across the country. The NWSS 2015 also includes
 a dataset on the functionality of water points and water schemes. A thorough analysis of this
 data in chapter 6 finds that around half of the water points and water schemes in Nigeria are
 not functioning. Map 3.8 presents the amount of time needed to complete a round-trip journey
 to the closest functioning9 water source from a given location, which is defined as the rural
 accessibility index.10 The accompanying table 3.4 presents the percentage of rural population
 in each time bracket. Only 38.7 percent of the rural population live within a 30-minute round-
 trip of a functioning water source, and 34.3 percent of the population live at least two hours
 away from these sources. Most alarmingly, over 26 million Nigerians living in rural areas must
 travel four or more hours round-trip to access functioning water points. These data were used
 to simulate a scenario in which we assume “perfect functionality” for all rural water sources
 (last column in table 3.4). After running the simulation, there remain low levels of access: only
 42.3 percent of the rural population would have access to a water sources within 30 minutes,
 and more than 30 percent of the rural population would need to walk at least two hours to
 these sources. This strongly suggests that efforts are needed to expand the number of
 easily accessible functioning water sources in addition to improving the number of functioning
 water sources.

 Around 74 percent of public health centers have access to an improved water source, and
 61  percent have access to improved sanitation (figure 3.4, panels a and b).12 In terms of
 access to water, the NWSS data offer information on access to water sources, which was used
 to calculate the proportion of facilities with access to an improved water source, as defined by
 WHO/UNICEF.13 The NWSS data also offer information on type of toilet facility used, which was
 used to calculate the proportion of facilities with access to improved sanitation, as defined by
 WHO/UNICEF.14

 Only 31 percent of public health care facilities have access to a basic, functioning hand hygiene
 station. The NWSS offers information on whether the centers have access to a handwashing
 facility, and whether or not it is being used, which was used as a proxy to calculate the proportion
 of facilities with access to a hand hygiene station, as defined by WHO/UNICEF15 (box 3.4). The
 NWSS offers data on whether the hand hygiene stations exist and are in use, and does not
 offer information on the availability of handwashing materials.16 Around 42 percent of the
 health centers have a separate facility for women and girls, and 6 percent have access to
 facilities for people with limited mobility.17 With regard to waste disposal, the NWSS does
 ask  about waste disposal with the question, “how is the waste-bin disposed?” However, it
 does not differentiate between infectious and sharp waste (a differentiation required by the
 WHO/UNICEF), and the survey responses for the NWSS do not offer sufficient detail to allow
 us to properly define whether the disposal of waste complies with the standards suggested by
 WHO/UNICEF. Hence, we do not include the waste disposal measure in our calculations.
 Furthermore, around 67 percent of respondents believe that people with disabilities face
 challenges in accessing and using toilets, around 51 percent believe that the needs of the
 disabled are not considered when toilets are built in public places or homes, and 11 percent
 believe the greatest challenges were experienced in health centers (box 3.5).

 Around 50 percent of public schools have access to an improved water source, 48 percent
 have access to improved sanitation, and 7 percent have access to a functioning, basic hand
 hygiene station (figure 3.5, panel a). This study also looked at the broader categories of access
 to basic sanitation. As shown in figure 3.5, panel b, 43 percent of public schools provide
 access to separate facilities for women and girls, and 4 percent provide access to facilities for
 people with limited mobility.

      Box 3.4: Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene in Health Care Facilities, Status
      in Low and Middle-Income Countries, and a Way Forward

      WHO/UNICEF (2015b) compiled data from 66,101 facilities in 54 low- and middle-
      income countries (LMICs). The report finds that, across all countries, 62 percent of
      health care facilities have access to an improved water source, 81 percent have access
      to improved sanitation, and 65 percent have access to water and soap for handwashing.

      According to the report from the 280 representative health care facilities in the
      2008 Nigeria HPSA survey, they observe that 71 percent of health care facilities
      have access to improved water, 71 percent have access to improved sanitation, and
      84 percent have access to handwashing. The NWSS estimates for access to
      improved sanitation and access to handwashing are lower than those provided by
      the WHO/UNICEF report. The differences may be explained by the fact that the
      NWSS sample is much larger than the one created by WHO/UNICEF and the
      estimates of the 2008 Nigeria HPSA survey, and that this report is  particularly
      looking at public health care facilities. The differences in estimates for handwashing
      might be partly explained by the fact that the NWSS does not offer information on
      whether the hand hygiene stations have soap or water or an alcohol-based hand rub
      dispenser.




      Box 3.5: Disability and Access to Latrines—UNICEF Survey

      UNICEF (2017) conducted a poll using a free short message service (SMS) social
      monitoring tool called UReport. Its aim was to derive an overview of Nigerians’
      perceptions of the challenges that disabled individuals face in accessing toilets. The
      poll, conducted in January 2017, had around 136,307 respondents. While it is not
      nationally representative, it does offer an interesting snapshot of the population’s
      general perceptions of the sanitation challenges facing disabled people.

      Around 67 percent of respondents believe that people with disabilities face
      challenges in accessing and using toilets, and around 51 percent believe that the
      needs of the disabled are not considered when toilets are built in public places or
      homes. Moreover, around 50 percent of respondents believe that no modifications
      have been made to toilets to ensure that they are more easily used by individuals
      with disabilities.

      Around 32 percent of respondents believe that the disabled face the greatest
      challenges in accessing toilets in markets, 28 percent believe that the disabled face
      the greatest challenges in access in schools, 13 percent believe the greatest
      challenges were in homes, and 11 percent believe the greatest challenges were

                                                                       box continues next page

                  experienced in health centers. Among those who noted having a disabled person in
                  their household, almost 90 percent of respondents believe that the disabled face
                  challenges in accessing and using toilets.

                  Hence, the survey reveals a degree of national awareness with regard to disabled
                  individuals’ challenges in accessing WASH services, and highlights that additional
                  efforts are needed, particularly at the design stage, in ensuring that facilities are
                  able to meet the needs of all Nigerian citizens.

 Concluding Remarks
 The NWSS 2015 offers an up-to-date overview of the water supply and sanitation sector in
 Nigeria. While other surveys, such as the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) and the Multiple
 Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), offer information on access to WASH, the NWSS provides a
 more recent snapshot. This chapter offered an overview of access to WASH along the following
 seven indicators: access to improved water, basic water, improved water on premises, piped
 water on premises, improved sanitation, fixed-point sanitation, and access to a sewerage.
 In doing so, it highlighted progress in some areas and major deficiencies in others, while also
 offering baseline information for assessing future progress in attaining the SDGs for water and
 sanitation.

 The indicators for access to improved water sources in Nigeria show low rates of coverage. While
 the rate of access to improved water has increased to 61.2 percent, just under one-third of


A Wake Up Call	                                                                                                                                                           31
      Nigerians have access to improved water on premises, and an abysmal 7 percent have piped
      water on premises. Deficiencies in water access are a daily source of strain for most citizens.

      The indicators for access to improved sanitation are not only low but also suggest that the
      sector is in an alarming state of dilapidation. Rates of open defecation may be low nationally,
      but less than one-third of citizens have access to improved sanitation, and approximately
      94 percent of the population lack sewerage connectivity. These figures are alarming.

      There is also a sharp urban-rural divide in access to water and sanitation. Urban areas and
      state capitals typically display higher rates of access to improved water and improved water on
      premises. Although rates of improved sanitation and sewerage are low across all areas,
      households in urban areas still experience higher access to sewerage systems. Despite
      increasing urbanization, slightly over half of Nigerians continue to reside in rural areas, and as
      such, their water and sanitation needs should be addressed.

      There is limited access to water and sanitation in public facilities. According to the NSWW 2015
      survey, around 74 percent of public health centers have access to an improved water source,
      and around 61 percent have access to improved sanitation. Only 31 percent of these centers
      have access to a basic, functioning hand hygiene station, 42 percent have a separate facility for
      women and girls, and a mere 6 percent have access to facilities for people with limited mobility.
      Around 50 percent of public schools have access to an improved water source, 48 percent have
      access to improved sanitation, and 7 percent have access to a functioning, basic hand hygiene
      station. Moreover, only 43 percent of schools provide access to separate facilities for women
      and girls, and almost none provide access to facilities for people with limited mobility.

      Nigeria’s water and sanitation sector is likely in critical condition. Considering the well-
      documented and far-reaching impacts of poor access to water and sanitation, there can be
      little doubt that shortcomings in this sector are drastically hindering Nigeria’s overall progress.
      Without immediate attention to this sector from policy makers and other key stakeholders, the
      country will, at best, continue to suffer from the damaging effects of the status quo. At worst,
      the situation will continue to deteriorate, making it increasingly difficult to establish the policies
      needed to rehabilitate the sector in the future. It is thus imperative that action be taken now,
      and that such actions are sustained.


      Notes
      	 1.	This report draws upon data from both the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme
           (JMP) and the 2015 NWSS to calculate the estimates of access to WASH. The estimates
           provided in the graphs and text in this section come from the JMP . The 2015 JMP estimates
           vary slightly from the numbers in the NWSS, but have the added benefit that they allow
           us to compare access to WASH across time. Unless otherwise specified or attributed to
           the JMP , all data described in the following sections, and elsewhere in the report, is derived
           from the 2015 NWSS.
      	2.	 The official estimate produced by JMP is 25 percent for 2015; however, different
           surveys—including the census and NWSS 2015—propose an estimate that is closer to
           15 percent.
      	3.	 Per the United Nations’ SDGs, many WASH-related studies consider two additional
           indicators: safely managed water and safely managed sanitation. Safely managed water
           refers to basic drinking water sources located on premises, available when needed, and
           free of fecal (and priority chemical) contamination. Safely managed sanitation refers to
           basic sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households, and where excreta
           is safely reused or treated in situ or transported to a treatment plant. Unfortunately, the
           FMWR commissioned data collection for this study prior to the adoption of the SDGs in
           September 2015, and as such, only a rough calculation of safely managed water was
           provided, and no calculation for safely managed sanitation. Safely managed water was

      calculated as those households that have access to an improved source of water on
      premises, and use uninterrupted service over the last two weeks as a proxy for available
      when needed.
 	 4.	The JMP estimated than only 2 percent of the population had access to piped water on
      premises, mostly based on a linear extrapolation of the trend estimated between 1990
      and 2010; however, more recent estimates for Nigeria include DHS 2011 with 5.2 percent,
      DHS 2013 with 3.3 percent, and LSMS 2013 with 4 percent.
 	 5.	It must be noted that the rate of open defecation as calculated from the NWSS 2015 data
      (15 percent) stands in contrast to the figure presented by JMP: 25 percent. While much of
      this discrepancy may be attributed to methodological differences and other potential
      differences in the data collection process, the NWSS figure is comparable to other official
      estimates of open defecation, including the Census 2010 (12.6 percent) and the Living
      Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) 2011 (19.4 percent). Establishing a concise figure
      for the rate of open defecation in Nigeria is a matter of significant importance, and merits
      further investigation, though for the purposes of this report, greater value lies in understanding
      the relative performance of fixed-point sanitation. Further, due to methodological differences
      between the NWSS 2015 and the JMP surveys, it is not possible to compare trends over
      time between these two data sources.
 	 6.	Per Nigeria’s National Water Supply and Sanitation Policy (2000), urban areas are defined
      as having a population of greater than 20,000 people, semi-urban areas (small towns)
      have a population between 5,000 and 20,000, and rural areas are inhabited by fewer than
      5,000 people.
 	 7.	Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) refers to household access to suitable facilities
      (including adequate space, privacy, water, and soap) and materials for menstrual hygiene.
      Given that there is limited data on MHM, open defecation and handwashing indicators
      were identified as the best proxy indicators for inadequate hygiene.
 	8.	As described in chapter 2, Gething and Molini (2015) present a statistical modeling
      approach that can generate mapped surfaces of poverty rates at a fine spatial scale,
      despite data limitations. The heat maps in chapter 3 utilize the same mapping methodology,
      and utilize an additional layer of data (the functionality of water points, as derived from
      NWSS 2015) to predict access to sources of water and sanitation, on a pixel-by-pixel basis,
      whereby each pixel represents 1 kilometer of land. Additional details of this methodology
      are provided in Andres et al. (2016).
 	 9.	Chapter 6 further discusses the functionality of water points and schemes in Nigeria.
 10.	The rural accessibility index uses NWSS household data, as well as data from the NWSS
      census of water points and water schemes, to estimate the round-trip distance to a
      functioning water source as of the time the survey was conducted. The distribution presented
      in table 3.1 is weighted by population density. Map 3.8, however, is meant to present travel
      distances, so it is not weighed by population density.
 11.	The rest of the sample (14 percent) comprises “markets,” “motor parks” and “public
      recreational centers.”
 12.	Many of the responses cite wells as the type of water source being used. They do not
      specify whether the wells are covered or uncovered, which marks the difference between
      improved and unimproved technology. We coded wells as improved.
 13.	Improved water sources in healthcare settings include piped water, boreholes/tube wells,
      protected wells, protected springs, rainwater, and packaged or delivered water. In the case
      of Nigeria, we also coded water from vendors as unimproved. Overall, we see that the water
      and sanitation-related questions asked in the public sanitation questionnaire of the NWSS
      are not entirely compliant with what was recommended by the WHO/UNICEF for monitoring
      WASH in Health Care Facilities. The WHO/UNICEF recommends assessing access to WASH
      in health care facilities along four areas: water, sanitation, hand hygiene, and health care
      waste management. The NWSS data offers questions that match onto a number of
      categories in the water, sanitation, and hand hygiene categories, but not in the area of
      waste management. See WHO/UNICEF 2016. Expert- Group- Meeting-on Monitoring WASH
      in Schools in the Sustainable Development Goals. http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user​

      14.	Improved sanitation facilities in healthcare settings include flush/pour flush toilets
          connected to a piped sewer system, septic tank or pit latrine; pit latrines with slab;
          ventilated improved pit latrines; and composting toilets.
      15.	The WHO/UNICEF defines a functional hand hygiene station as consisting of soap and
          water with a basin/pan for washing hands, or an alcohol-based hand rub dispenser.
      16.	The measure of access to a hand hygiene station used here is far from compliant with the
          standards set out by WHO/UNICEF (2016): they require that a hygiene station include
          soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub dispenser, to be considered “accessible.”
      17.	The NWSS survey data also includes questions which can help us better estimate whether
          health facilities offer access to broader definitions of basic sanitation. The WHO/UNICEF
          defines facilities with basic sanitation as those having: “…improved toilets or latrines for
          patients located on premises, that are functional at the time of visit, with at least one toilet
          designated for women/girls with facilities to manage menstrual hygiene needs, at least one
          separated for staff, and at least one meeting the needs of people with limited mobility.” ). The
          NWSS has information on type of toilet facility, which we used to develop a measure of
          improved sanitation. It does not contain information on whether there is at least one toilet
          designated for women or girls, but it does note whether there are separate facilities for women,
          which we used as a proxy. Further, while the NWSS does not include a question pertaining
          specifically to whether facilities provide access for people with limited mobility, it does have a
          question asking about provisions for physically challenged people, which we use as a proxy to
          estimate the proportion of facilities that offer access to people with limited mobility.

 The Poverty-WASH Access
 Nexus

                                        Key Takeaways

    •	 Demographic    characteristics—namely wealth, education, and urban or rural
        location—explain most of the variation in access to water, sanitation, and hygiene
        (WASH) services and inequity in access to WASH services for children. Household
        income plays the most important role.
    •	 Improved water exhibits both the highest rate of population coverage and the highest
        level of inequality in distribution. Regarding access to improved sanitation, coverage
        rates and inequality in distribution vary widely. The highest level of inequality is
        observed for sanitation facilities that are improved but shared.

    •	 Overlaying poverty rates with access to WASH suggests an obscure relationship
        between poverty and access to water and sanitation. While there are many places
        with high poverty rates and low levels of access, there are many instances in
        which high poverty is associated with high access to WASH, and low poverty is
        associated with low access to WASH. Nevertheless, for low poverty households,
        access to education and urban or rural location may be central in explaining
        variation in access to water. Differences in state-level characteristics are also
        likely to play an important role in explaining variation in access to WASH.




 Introduction
 For the most part, the WASH sector and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have
 focused on increasing overall WASH coverage over the last two decades. It is only recently—in
 large part due to the process of drafting the post-2015 SDGs—that issues of inequality have
 gained a more central role in conversations surrounding the WASH sector. The focus on
 inequality and inclusion is also a cornerstone of World Bank’s corporate goals of eradicating
 poverty and promoting shared prosperity. If the WASH sector is going to actively address
 inequalities in service delivery, stakeholders need to better understand who the poor are,
 where they live, and how to offer them improved access to services.

 Disparities in access to WASH services are a source of concern. Access to safe WASH services
 underpins many aspects of social and human development—from better health and nutrition
 (e.g., from reduced diarrhea and enteropathy) (Sachs 2001), to lower absenteeism and school
 dropout rates (e.g., absenteeism increases if water for the school has to be fetched by children
 from far away sources or if children fall ill because of diseases associated with access to poor
 water sources) (Kremer et al. 2005), to improved household income (e.g., if household
 members miss fewer workdays because they are not falling sick due to water-related diseases)
 (Strauss et al. 1998).

                                                        Improving WASH services can contribute in multiple ways to reducing poverty and increasing
                                                        opportunities for upward social mobility. This chapter presents new analysis on the
                                                        interactions between social and demographic characteristics and access to WASH, focusing
                                                        on the bottom 40 percent (B40) of the population. It also considers where poor populations
                                                        with limited access to WASH services reside. This chapter used data from the 2015
                                                        National Water Supply and Sanitation Survey (NWSS) and the 2011 Multiple Indicator
                                                        Cluster Survey (MICS) to understand the linkages between access to water and sanitation
                                                        and poverty. Further, the Human Opportunity Index (HOI) was used to better understand
                                                        equity in access, as well as the social and human determinants influencing access to
                                                        WASH services. As in chapter 3, advanced mapping techniques were used to better grasp
                                                        the relationship between access to WASH and poverty, and the General Household Survey-
                                                        (GHS)-NWSS data were also used to further understand patterns in differential access to
                                                        water and sanitation across states and poverty groups.


                                                        Determinants of WASH Estimates for Nigeria
                                                        The most recent MICS was used to consider the interactions between access to improved
                                                        water and sanitation sources across several population characteristics: wealth, education,
                                                        religion, gender, and ethnic group. The survey was administered to Nigerian households in
                                                        2011. The MICS was used because it offers a richer and more wide-ranging set of questions
                                                        on population characteristics than that provided by the NWSS. Thus, even though the survey
                                                        was conducted six years ago, it offers interesting patterns in access to WASH across different
                                                        subsets of the population.

                                                        Wealth is the most important factor in explaining access to WASH services. Only 29 percent
                                                        of households in the poorest quintile have access to improved water, compared to 91 percent
                                                        of households in the richest quintile (figure 4.1, panel a). Likewise, 12 percent of households

 in the poorest quintile have access to improved sanitation (including shared), as compared
 to around 95 percent of households in the top quintile (figure 4.1, panel b).

 Access to water and sanitation is positively correlated with the education level of the household
 head, although the association is weaker than it is for wealth. For instance, while 49 percent
 of households in which the household head has no education1 have access to improved water
 on premises, around 76 percent of households in which the household head has a secondary
 education or above have such access (figure 4.2, panel a). Likewise, while 34 percent of
 households in which the household head has no education have access to improved sanitation
 (including shared), that percentage jumps to 67 percent among households in which the
 household head has a secondary education degree or above (figure 4.2, panel b).

 There is a sharp divide in access to water and sanitation sources between households located
 in urban regions and households located in rural regions. For instance, around 85 percent of
 households in urban regions have access to improved water, compared to 53 percent of
 households in rural regions (figure 4.3, panel a). Likewise, around 9.2 percent of households
 in urban areas have access to piped water on premises, compared to 2 percent of households
 in rural areas. In terms of sanitation, around 79 percent of households in urban regions have
 access to improved sanitation (including shared), compared to only 37 percent of households
 in rural regions (figure 4.3, panel b).

 Religion plays a key role in explaining differences in access to water and sanitation.
 The percentage of households with access to improved water, improved sanitation
 (including  shared), and access to sewerage systems is greater among Christian
 households than it is among Muslim households (figure 4.4, panel a). 2 Yet Muslim
 households have slightly greater access to fixed-point sanitation: our findings suggest
 that around 74 percent of Muslim households have access to fixed-point sanitation,
 compared to 70 percent of Christian households (figure 4.4, panel b). This latter point
 suggests that open defecation is marginally more prevalent in Christian households
 than it is in Muslim households.

 The ethnicity3 of the household head plays a marginal role in explaining a household’s
 access to water and sanitation. Households from the Yoruba ethnic group have, overall,
 greater access to water sources: 87 percent of households from the Yoruba ethnic
 group have access to improved water, 73 percent have access to improved water within
 30 minutes’ round-trip, and 23 percent have access to improved water on premises
 (figure 4.6, panel a). Households from the Igbo ethnic group follow the Yoruba in access
 to water, with 76 percent of households having access to improved water, 60 percent

                                     access to improved water on premises (figure 4.6, panel b).

                                     The Hausa and Fulani households, on the other hand, have greater access to fixed-point
                                     sanitation (i.e., the lowest open defecation rate), but have lower access to improved
                                     sanitation (including shared) and sewerage systems. The latter point coincides with the
                                     pattern observed in open defecation in Muslim and Christian households (figure 4.4,
                                     panel  b): Hausa and Fulani households are predominantly Muslim, and the evidence
                                     suggests that open defecation is slightly less prevalent in Muslim households than it is in
                                     Christian households.


                                     Human Opportunity Index
                                     The HOI is an effective way to measure a country’s progress toward the universal coverage
                                     of opportunities for children, as well as equitable access to those opportunities.4 For the
                                     purposes of this report, the HOI is calculated to consider access to WASH services for
                                     children under the age of 16.

                                     Among water services, improved water has the highest coverage rate, but also the highest
                                     level of inequality in its distribution of services. Around 62 percent of improved water services
                                     are available to children, and 52 percent of them are equitably allocated. The difference
                                     between the two estimates, around 10 percentage points, is the percentage of improved
                                     water services allocated inequitably (figure 4.7, panel a). When considering access to
                                     improved water within 30 minutes’ round-trip from households (basic water), the coverage
                                     rate is lower (53 percent), but the inequality in the distribution is only around 9 percent.
                                     Coverage for improved water on premises is 18 percent, with an HOI of 13 percent, reflecting
                                     lower inequality in the distribution of the service (5 percent) as compared to improved and

 basic water. Access to piped water shows the lowest coverage when compared to the rest of
 the water services. The inequality, at 2 percent, is also the lowest among water services.

 Coverage rates and inequality in the distribution of sanitation services vary widely
 (figure 4.7, panel b). Fixed-point sanitation services have the highest rate of access
 (71 percent), and inequality in the distribution is relatively low (8 percent). Further,
 roughly half of the population have access to improved sanitation using a shared
 facility (49 percent), though inequality is 12 percent—the highest among all sanitation
 services. With regard to improved sanitation services that are not shared, just under a
 third of Nigerians (30 percent) have access to such facilities, though these are more
 equally distributed than are shared facilities. Nationally, access to sewerage systems
 is low (4 percent) and the HOI is a negligible 2 percent.

 Inequality in access to water services in Nigeria is mostly the result of variation in the wealth
 distribution (figure 4.8, panel a). Among the five factors5 considered in our analysis, wealth
 distribution—namely, residing in the B40 of the overall wealth distribution—has the most influence
 in predicting a child’s unequal access to water services.6 This is most pronounced for access to
 improved water on premises (57 percent). Whether or not a child lives in a rural area is a strong
 determinant of inequality, particularly in access to piped water on premises (30 percent). To a
 lesser extent, inequality in access to water services is adversely impacted by household heads’
 lack of education. The marital status and gender of the household head seem to have relatively
 little or no significance in impacting the distribution of water services (less than 3 percent).

 Residing in the B40 of the wealth distribution is the most powerful predictor of whether or not
 a child will have equal access to sanitation services. Wealth distribution has the largest effect
 on access to improved sanitation services that are not shared (64 percent). To a lesser extent,
 location of the household and a household head’s lack of education have a similar effect on
 access to this service (17 percent). Access to fixed-point and improved sanitation services that
 are shared appears to be most impacted by living in a rural location (figure 4.8, panel b).
 Household heads’ lack of education has the second most significant effect on access to
 sewerage systems, after that of income. Overall, household heads’ marital status and gender
 seem to have a relatively low impact on the distribution of sanitation services.

                                          Overall, this analysis suggests that significant work is needed to expand coverage and equity in
                                          access to WASH services in Nigeria. When comparing the HOI against coverage rates, there are
                                          gaps, to varying extents, for both water and sanitation services, suggesting that the country needs
                                          to expand access—particularly for vulnerable groups. Improved water services and improved
                                          sanitation using a shared facility exhibit the largest gaps for water and sanitation, respectively.

                                          water (map 4.1, panels a–d).7 As shown in table 4.1, 10.7 percent of households experience
                                          high poverty and high levels of access to improved water. Moreover, of those citizens living
                                          in high levels of poverty, 9.7 percent have access to basic water, 9.9 percent have access to
                                          improved water on premises and 4.9 percent have access to piped water on premises.
                                          Areas  with high poverty and high access to water are typically concentrated in the North
                                          Central and eastern parts of the country.

 Similarly, some areas experience low levels of access to water and low levels of poverty
 (map 4.1, panels a–d). For improved water, basic water, and improved water on premises,
 6.4 percent, 7.3 percent, and 9.6 percent of citizens, respectively, experience both low
 poverty and low access to these services (table 4.1). Most surprising, when considering
 access to piped water on premises, 37.5 percent of citizens experience both low poverty
 and low access. Such low poverty, low access areas are found in the western regions,
 particularly in the North West and South West, and to some extent in the South South.


 Poverty and Access to Sanitation
 There is no clear pattern between poverty levels and rates of open defecation (map 4.2, panels
 a–c). As shown in table 4.2, 12 percent of Nigerians living in high poverty areas have low rates
 of open defecation, while 9.8 percent of those living in low poverty also have high rates of open
 defecation. Just over a third exhibit both low poverty and low rates of open defecation. The
 North Central region has a number of areas with high rates of poverty, but also low rates of
 open defecation. Inversely, the South West and South South regions have areas with low rates
 of poverty but high rates of open defecation.

 There is also no clear relationship between poverty levels and access to sewerage systems.
 Sewerage systems are relatively scarce throughout the country. As mentioned in chapter 3,
 only 6 percent of households have access to sewerage systems (table 3.2). Broadly, 3.3
 percent of Nigerians exhibit high levels of poverty and high levels of access, while a surprising
 32.2 percent exhibit low levels of poverty and low levels of access (table 4.2). Areas with high
 rates of poverty and high access to sewerage are typically found in the South East region. We
 also find areas with low rates of poverty and low rates of access in the North West, South West,
 and South South regions, similar to that found with sanitation. Overall, nearly a third of Nigerians
 exhibit low poverty and low rates of access to sewerage.

 Similarly, there is no straightforward relationship between poverty levels and access to improved
 sanitation. Around 18.7 percent of Nigerians live in areas of low poverty and high access to
 improved sanitation, and around 5.7 percent live in areas of high poverty and low access to
 improved sanitation. Around 22.1 percent of Nigerians are in low poverty areas and have low
 access to improved sanitation, and around 10.4 percent of Nigerians are in high poverty areas
 and have high access to improved sanitation (table 4.2). There are areas of high poverty and
 high access to improved sanitation in the North Central region, and to a lesser extent, in the
 Eastern regions (map 4.2). Inversely, there are areas of low poverty and low access in the
 North West, South West, and South South regions.

 To further understand the factors underlying the poverty-WASH nexus, this report explores
 differences in socioeconomic factors for those households near to one another and exhibiting
 the same poverty levels, but experiencing different levels of access to improved water and
 sanitation. A geographic buffer was generated to capture households with high poverty and
 high rates of access and households with high rates of poverty but low rates of access that
 were within 50 kilometers of each other. This was done under the assumption that it is more

 greater similarities across baseline geographic characteristics.8

 There are no clear-cut differences in socioeconomic characteristics across all poverty
 levels that may help explain the difference in access to improved sanitation (table 4.3).
 Moreover, for high poverty households, the difference in the makeup of households for
 both improved sanitation and water is either counterintuitive—for instance, a slightly
 higher share of households with high access to improved water are in rural locations—or
 are not statistically significant.

 For low poverty areas, households with higher access to improved water tend to have
 more educated household members and are more likely to be in urban locations (table 4.3).9

A Wake Up Call	                                                                                                          45
      Around 91 percent of households in low poverty and high access areas have attended school,
      compared to 62 percent of households in low access areas. Moreover, 83 percent of households
      in low poverty and high access areas are in urban locations, as compared to only 14 percent
      of households in low poverty and low access areas. These findings echo the earlier observations
      on the importance of education and urban or rural location in explaining access to WASH.

      Across poverty access tiers, households are concentrated in a handful of states, which suggests
      that there are state-level factors driving differences in access. For example, for improved water,
      almost 60 percent of households in the low poverty and low access tier are in Bayelsa, Enugu,
      Ondo, Sokoto, and Delta, and around 56 percent of high poverty and low access households
      are in Benue, Enugu, and Katsina. For improved sanitation, around 43 percent of households
      in low poverty and low access tiers are in Osun, Delta, Lagos, and Ekiti, and around 63 percent
      of high poverty and high access households are in Katsina, Kano, Benue, Jigawa, and Taraba.
      This suggests that other state-level factors, such as expenditure and internal politics, are
      driving the differences in access to WASH across poverty groups.


      Concluding Remarks
      This chapter considered interactions between social and demographic characteristics of the
      population and access to WASH access, zooming in on the B40. Similarly, it examined the
      location of those poor populations with limited access to WASH services, and their differential
      access to water and sanitation by state and across a set of socioeconomic characteristics.
      Further, the report used the HOI to better understand equity in access, as well as the social
      and human determinants influencing access to WASH services.

      Overall, income, education, and urban or rural location explain most of the variation in access
      to WASH. For instance, only 29 percent of households in the poorest quintile have access to
      improved water, compared to 91 percent of households in the richest quintile. Moreover, while
      34 percent of households in which the household head has no education have access to
      improved sanitation (including shared facilities), that percentage jumps to 67 percent among
      households in which the household head has a secondary education degree or above. Moreover,
      income, education, and urban or rural location explain most of the variation in a child’s unequal
      access to WASH. In particular, residing in the B40 of the overall income distribution explains
      most of the variation in a child’s unequal access to water services. Gender, ethnicity, and
      religion play more marginal and ambiguous roles in explaining access to WASH.

      The relationship between poverty rates and access to water and sanitation is, overall, obscure. Our
      maps show several unusual, counterintuitive patterns of high access to WASH and high poverty
      rates, and low access to WASH and low poverty rates. For instance, the percentage of households
      that have low access to piped water on premises is higher in low poverty areas than it is in high
      poverty areas: 37.5 of households in low poverty areas have low access to piped water on premises,
      compared to 10.3 percent of households in high poverty areas. However, the data suggest that, for
      households in low poverty, access to education and urban or rural location may help explain the
      differences in access to water. Moreover, when looking across all poverty access tiers, the high
      concentration of similar households in a few states further suggests that differences in state-level
      characteristics likely play a central role in explaining variation in access to water and sanitation.


      Notes
      1.	 Approximately 37.6 percent of household heads have no education, 22.5 percent have
          only a primary education, and 39.9 percent have at least a secondary education.
      2.	 Population: 50.6 percent is Christian while 47.6 percent is Muslim.
      3.	 Ethnic groups: 24.4 percent of households belong to the Hausa and Fulani ethnic group,
          17.3 percent belong to the Yoruba group, 17.2 percent belong to the Igbo, and the
          remaining 41.2 percent belong to other minority ethnic groups.

 4.	 To measure inequality, the HOI takes the respective level of coverage for each service that
     is considered, and discounts that measure by an estimate of how unequally that service
     is distributed among the population. The HOI summarizes in a composite indicator: (a) how
     many opportunities are available, that is, the coverage rate of a basic service (e.g., access
     to improved water); and (b) how equitably those opportunities are distributed, that is,
     whether the distribution of that coverage is related to exogenous circumstances (e.g.,
     location, gender, household characteristics). Hence, an increase in coverage of a basic
     service at the national level will always improve the index. However, if that increase in
     coverage is biased toward a disadvantaged group, it will further reduce the inequality of
     opportunity, increasing the index more than proportionally.
        The component used to estimate the inequality of opportunity is the dissimilarity index
     (D-index). The D-index, widely used in sociology (Paes de Barros et al. 2009), measures
     the dissimilarity of access rates for a given service for groups defined by circumstance
     characteristics as compared with that of the general population. It is defined as the
     weighted average of the absolute differences of group-specific access rates from the
     overall average access rate. The D-index ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100 in percentage
     terms), and in a situation of perfect equality of opportunity, D will be zero.
 5.	 The five factors we considered here are whether (a) the household lies in the B40 of the
     income distribution, (b) the household is in a rural location, (c) the household head is
     single, (d) the household head is a female, and (e) whether the household head has an
     education. These factors mirror those used in previous studies to assess the inequality of
     opportunities. Moreover, these variables have also shown to be associated with the use of
     WASH services, and they are of particular interest because they are circumstantial; that is,
     they are factors that cannot be controlled by a child.
 6.	 We used the Shapley decomposition to calculate the contribution of each circumstance, or
     factor, to the observed inequality of opportunity across households. The decomposition
     breaks down the R^2 of a regression based on the relative predictive share of each factor
     in determining the effect of the outcome variable, so, by definition, the Shapley
     decomposition adds up to 100 percent. To calculate the impact of each circumstance, the
     Shapley decomposition takes the average of all possible changes to different combinations
     of circumstances to show how much inequality changes as a consequence of adding an
     additional factor (Biller at al. 2014). Since circumstances correlate with each other, the
     change in inequality that results when a factor is added depends on the initial set of
     circumstances to which it is added.
 7.	 Map 4.1 and table 4.1 show the interaction between access to sources of improved water
     and poverty, and map 4.2 and table 4.2 show access to sources of improved sanitation
     and poverty, broken down by quintiles. For example: for map 4.1, panel a, “low-low” is the
     percentage of households that are both in the bottom quintile of the access to improved
     water distribution and in the bottom quintile of the poverty rate distribution. “High-high” is
     the percentage of the population in the top quintile of the access to improved water
     distribution and in the top quintile of the poverty rate distribution.
 8.	 The additional analysis using a buffer of 50 kilometers was conducted to obtain an
     unbiased estimate of the factors predicting access to WASH across poverty groups. The
     assumption was that households closer to one another are more likely to share
     commonalities in terms of key baseline geographic characteristics (e.g., annual
     precipitation, ground elevation, and other factors), and thus offer a valid proxy “treatment”
     and “control” group through which to better assess the factors predicting access to WASH
     across poverty groups. The data suggest that the differences in means for many geographic
     variables across households exhibiting similar poverty levels are different at the baseline,
     which implies that the groups are not balanced. The authors of this report plan to conduct
     additional analysis to determine if any additional interactions between poverty and WASH
     can be deduced from the data.
 9.	 The proportion of households who have attended school was calculated as an aggregate
     of the number of people who went to school by household, as captured by the yes/no
     question: “Have you ever attended school?”, which was asked to all household members
     five years and above. The variable is equal to 1 if most of the people in the household
     attended school, and 0 if most of the people in the household did not attend school.

      ••   The overall distribution of the risk indexes indicates sharp divisions along geography,
           urban or rural location, and income groups in Nigeria. In general, risk of diarrheal
           disease is negatively associated with wealth; the poorest and most vulnerable are
           also more likely to live in communities with higher exposure risk.

      ••   Overall measures of exposure and susceptibility are positively associated with each
           other, and negatively associated with wealth. Those with the worst water, sanitation,
           and hygiene (WASH) conditions are also more vulnerable to disease due to
           inadequate health.

      ••   A majority share of the Global Burden of Disease Project (GBD) enteric burden
           estimated for Nigeria is associated with inadequate WASH, and disproportionately
           born by poorer children and those in vulnerable geographic areas. Approximately
           73 percent of the GBD enteric burden estimated for the country is associated with
           inadequate WASH. The national enteric burden associated with inadequate WASH
           is 10,083 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) per 100,000 children per year.
           Moreover, the WASH enteric burden for the poorest quintile is about four times
           greater than the enteric burden for the richest quintile. The burden for the poorest
           urban residents is 3.3 times higher than that for the richest, and in rural areas it
           is three times higher for the poorest rural residents than for the richest.




 Introduction
 Inadequate WASH can contribute to adverse health and development consequences, and some
 subsets of the population are more vulnerable to WASH-related risks than others. Population
 with poor health and nutrition are more vulnerable to experiencing the adverse effects of
 inadequate WASH than are those subsets of the population with good access to health and
 good nutrition. For example, being undernourished increases both the likelihood and severity of
 diarrheal disease, and those without access to timely health care are more likely to die as a
 result of an infection (Dangour et al. 2013). Moreover, children who are undernourished and
 lack access to quality health care face a higher risk of diarrheal disease and death related to
 poor access to WASH than do well-nourished children with access to high-quality health care.

 Inadequate WASH can result in exposure to a wide range of pathogens and cause many health
 problems. The ingestion of contaminated water, food, or soil as a result of the unsafe
 management of human excreta, a contaminated or inadequate water supply, or poor personal
 and domestic hygiene provides routes of transmission for numerous microorganisms that can

      cause diarrhea and other severe infections (White, Bradley, and White 2002). Evidence shows
      that inadequate WASH is estimated to explain around 2.4 million deaths annually, after
      controlling for a range of related health outcomes (including diarrheal diseases, soil-transmitted
      helminth infections, schistosomiasis, and undernutrition). The same study estimates that
      improving WASH conditions might reduce the global burden of disease by 9.1 percent in DALYs,1
      and reduce deaths globally by 6.3 percent (Prüss-Üstün et al. 2008).

      Diarrhea accounts for approximately 40 percent of the WASH-related disease burden (Prüss-
      Üstün et al. 2008) and remains one of the leading causes of death in children. Diarrhea spans
      a number of different diseases caused by a multitude of pathogens, including rotavirus, Shigella
      spp., pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli), Giardia spp., and Cryptosporidium spp. Together,
      diarrheal diseases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have been estimated to be
      responsible for over 800,000 deaths annually (GBD 2013). Despite great progress in reducing
      diarrheal mortality worldwide—deaths from diarrheal diseases fell by 31 percent between
      2000 and 2013—it remains the fourth leading cause of death in LMICs and the second
      leading cause of death in children under five (Liu et al. 2015).

      External factors such as access to health care, the nutritional status of children, and larger
      environmental conditions magnify the WASH-related risk of diarrheal disease. Poor WASH
      conditions and other external factors are often concentrated among certain groups, reflecting
      broader structural inequities related to poverty and geography. These risks can be substantially
      modified by factors external to WASH, such as access to health care, the nutritional status of
      children, and children’s ability to fight infection (Brown 2003; Guerrant et al. 2008) and larger
      environmental conditions (Prüss-Üstün and Corvalán 2006). Moreover, in many LMICs, rapid
      urban migration is creating crowded and unsanitary informal settlements, in which the poor
      urban population live without adequate WASH services and without high-quality health care
      access. Climate change has also increased the vulnerability of many poor communities to
      flooding and drought events, disrupting sanitation efforts and contributing to inconsistent
      agricultural production.

      There is ample evidence documenting the association between clean WASH practices and
      undernutrition, and the negative effects of diarrhea on the health of undernourished children.
      There has been wide recognition of the intimate relationship between diarrhea and
      undernutrition. There has also been growing evidence of the association between environmental
      enteropathy and undernutrition (Humphrey 2009). Unsafe WASH conditions enable the
      transmission of enteric pathogens that can cause diarrhea and environmental enteropathy,
      and can lead to chronic problems with absorbing nutrients. This, in turn, can lead to stunting,
      wasting, and being underweight. The exposure to diarrheal pathogens among undernourished
      children and those who lack access to preventative or curative services (e.g., vitamin A, oral
      rehydration therapy) is even worse, since these children are more susceptible to infection from
      diarrheal pathogens and more likely to die from it. A recent systematic review exploring the
      effects of WASH practices on the nutritional status of children finds evidence of a protective
      effect of WASH interventions on growth in children (Dangour et al. 2013).

      This chapter will cover some of the overlapping risk factors associated with poor WASH and
      map out their unequal distribution. The analysis will be only on the risk effects for children
      under five years of age. The end goal is to promote WASH investment strategies that more
      effectively and efficiently target areas with the greatest need. Specifically, this chapter aims to
      (a) quantify the proportion of WASH attributable risk of diarrheal disease borne by children in
      the bottom 20 percent (B20) and 40 percent (B40) of the income distribution; (b) estimate the
      potential health and other benefits of targeting WASH investments to children in the B20 and
      B40 of the income distribution; and (c) assist in identifying priority areas for WASH investment
      in which the social return will be greatest.

      A WASH poverty risk model (WASH-PRM) is used to assess patterns of disease across different
      economic and geographic subpopulations of children under five. The model includes WASH
      exposure factors— access to water, household sanitation, and hygiene—that influence the risk

 of diarrheal disease, and susceptibility factors—the acquisition of micronutrients, effective
 rehydration treatment, and undernutrition—that influence diarrheal disease and mortality. The
 model allows us to identify the population of children under five with the highest risk of diarrheal
 disease, stunting, and mortality, and to look at population patterns and the geographic
 distribution of the risks of diarrheal disease. The patterns that emerge from the model can
 help improve and streamline the targeting of WASH investments and programs.


 Child Health Outcomes in Nigeria
 Undernutrition is a major public health problem in Nigeria.2 The 2013 DHS estimates that 36.8
 percent of children under five in Nigeria are stunted, 18.5 percent are wasted, and 29 percent
 are underweight (figure 5.1, panels a, d, and g). Close to half of children in the B40 of the wealth
 distribution are stunted, and 37 percent of children in the B40 are underweight (figure 5.1,
 panels b and h). Similar patterns can be find in rural areas (figure 5.1, panels c, f, and i). While
 the proportion of under-five children who are stunted has improved since the previous

      Demographic Health Survey (DHS) in 2008, the extent of wasting and underweight among
      children has actually worsened, suggesting an ongoing nutritional deficiency among children in
      the country.

      Inadequate WASH has also been found to increase the risk of contracting neglected tropical
      diseases, such as soil-transmitted helminth infections (STH), schistosomiasis, and trachoma
      (Grimes et al. 2015; Stocks et al. 2014; Strunz et al. 2014), all of which are endemic across
      Nigeria. STH infections, schistomiasis (especially urinary and S. haematobium), and trachoma
      have registered prevalence rates of greater than 50 percent of the population in some regions
      of the country.3,4

      Five studies (Barzilay et al. 2011; Hutin, Luby, and Paquet 2003; Huttly et al. 1987; 1990;
      Oloruntoba, Folarin, and Ayede 2015) were identified to assess the effects of WASH interventions
      on diarrheal disease in Nigeria (box 5.1). The studies are subject to a high risk of bias, since
      none used a robust randomized control trial (RCT) design, only two had a nonexperimental
      design, and the other three studies were observational studies. Evidence from the studies
      suggests that WASH interventions have a positive effect on reducing diarrheal morbidity in
      Nigeria. Evidence from the observational studies suggests that inadequate sanitation facilities
      are associated with diarrheal morbidity, but, given that they are observational studies, they
      likely suffer from high degrees of bias, and do not allow us to make any causal inferences.
      While there is evidence of the relationship between WASH and diarrhea at the regional level,
      no evidence has been generated at the national level.




           Box 5.1: WASH Interventions and Diarrheal Disease in Nigeria

           One nonrandomized control trial, conducted in 2005, evaluates the impact of a
           point-of-use water chlorination and storage intervention on diarrheal-disease risk in a
           population of HIV-infected women in Lagos city (Barzilay et al. 2011). The intervention
           households received a 25-liter jerry can, one bottle of sodium hypochlorite solution,
           and basic sanitation and hygiene education. The report observes a 36 percent
           decrease in diarrhea between the pre- and postintervention phases, which was
           statistically significant (p = 0.04).

           Another nonrandomized control trial evaluates the impact of the Imo State Drinking
           Water Supply and Sanitation project on diarrhea prevalence and incidence among
           selected households (Huttly et al. 1990). The Imo project consisted of a package of
           water supply (installation of boreholes with hand pumps), sanitation (promotion of
           ventilated improved pit latrines), and health and hygiene education, and was launched
           in 1982 in three intervention villages in Imo state, in southeastern Nigeria. This
           study assesses the impact of the project in these three villages as well as two
           control villages that did not receive the intervention. An impact of the project on
           diarrhea morbidity was found only in limited subgroups of the population and a
           greater association with water availability, rather than quality, was suggested for
           diarrhea rates in young children. In 1986, a baseline cross-sectional study of diarrhea
           and its putative risk factors, in the five villages mentioned above, was conducted
           (Huttly et al. 1990). This study finds that water purification (filtering, boiling, or
           addition of alum) was a protective factor in the dry season; using nonpurified water
           was associated with 1.3 times increased risk of diarrhea, however, when stratified by

      age (this association was only significant for adults). The absence of soap in the
      households indicated an increased relative risk of diarrhea in children aged 5–14
      years during the wet season. The associations between diarrhea incidence and
      covering water containers, the presence of feces in the compound, and drinking only
      rainwater were not significant.

      One age-matched case-control study aimed to determine the hygiene and sanitation
      risk factors of diarrheal disease among children under five in Ibadan, Nigeria
      (Oloruntoba, Folarin, and Ayede 2015). Two hundred and twenty-two pairs of children
      were sampled from two health facilities. Control children were those under five who
      were admitted to hospitals for nondiarrheal illnesses, while cases were children
      under five who had been admitted for diarrheal illnesses. Logistic regression analysis
      finds lower risk of diarrhea among children having mothers with healthy hygiene
      practices. The risk of diarrhea was significantly higher among children whose mothers
      did not wash their hands with soap, who shared a toilet with other households and
      who had dirt or a foul smell around their toilets. There was, however, a reduced risk
      of diarrhea among children whose caregivers or mothers had adequate water for
      toilet use.

      Another case control study aimed to assess both the importance of handwashing
      with soap and the risk of drinking street-vended water with regard to contracting
      cholera, during an outbreak in Kano City, Nigeria (Hutin, Luby, and Paquet 2003).
      Authors report that individuals in the cases (cholera) were more likely to have drunk
      street-vended water and to have failed to wash their hands with soap before meals.




 WASH Poverty Risk Model
 The WASH poverty risk model (WASH-PRM) applied in this analysis5 assesses patterns of
 disease risk among children under five, across different economic and geographic dimensions.
 The model combines exposure factors (WASH-related elements that influence the risk of
 diarrheal disease) with susceptibility factors (health and nutrition components that influence
 the risk of diarrhea and mortality) to create a risk index score calculated individually for each
 child, and then aggregated into subpopulation estimates using the 2013 DHS. The geographic
 distribution of the diarrheal disease risk is also mapped.

 The primary purpose of this model is to describe how diverse and interrelated risk factors may
 contribute to how the national diarrheal disease burden is distributed across different subsets
 of the population (e.g., across wealth quintiles). The association or causality between WASH
 and these outcomes is not estimated because the DHS data is cross-sectional and prone to
 many biases. These descriptions are both quantitative (by economic group and setting) and
 spatial (through a series of heat maps showing intensity of risk) in nature. An understanding of
 the codistribution of these risk factors is used to identify the most consequential factors that
 require intervention.

 The core PRM model combines key susceptibility factors and exposure factors that are most
 relevant to the following health outcomes: diarrhea, stunting, and mortality. The relative risks

      associated with these exposure and susceptibility factors were gathered from a systematic,
      review-based meta-analysis publication, and calculated following conventional burden of
      disease analyses (Murray and Lopez 1997).6 The concept of a “relative risk” (RR) is a common
      and established approach in the epidemiological literature (Hennekens and Buring 1989; Levin
      1953). It represents the level of disease risk among “exposed” individuals, or those with a
      particular risk factor (e.g., not having safe drinking water) compared to “unexposed” individuals,
      or those without the risk factor (e.g., having safe drinking water). An RR greater than 1 indicates
      a larger risk of a given disease among the exposed versus the unexposed, and an RR of less
      than 1 indicates that the exposed have similar risks of getting the disease as do the unexposed.
      RR estimates are derived from pooling the effect sizes of high-quality studies designed to
      assess the effect of a given factor on a given disease, such as the effect of safe drinking water
      on diarrheal disease. These studies were identified using systematic literature review methods
      (Higgins and Green 2008).7

      The exposure factors of the framework include WASH-related elements that influence the risk
      of diarrheal disease (figure 5.2). RRs were gathered from the literature for different levels of
      these  WASH services. RRs for individual exposure risk factors are combined into a single
      exposure index. The susceptibility factors cover individual risk factors identified through
      the literature review. Quantitative risk estimates for each factor are combined into a single
      susceptibility index. Included here are also variations of other potentially important exposure
      factors (shown in light blue in figure 5.2) that are not included in the core model due to
      inconclusive evidence of the magnitude of excess risk or a lack of data on conditions and
      behaviors.

      The risk index combines information on the child’s household WASH characteristics, individual
      health vulnerabilities, and the RR associated with each factor. The RRs for the susceptibility
      and exposure factors are multiplied to develop a cumulative risk index. Some risk factors
      decrease risk (e.g., improved water, access to vitamin A), while others increase risk
      (e.g., underweight). Each factor is weighted differently and calculated according to a RR factor,
      as informed by the literature review.

      Scores for the exposure index are calculated individually for each child using the combined RR
      of access to WASH, based on the household’s coverage of water and sanitation service levels
      as derived from the 2013 Nigeria DHS. Service levels are defined with a desire to align them,

 where possible, with the World Bank Access Plus framework, and we use three service levels
 for both water and sanitation that can be combined to describe a number of exposure scenarios
 with varying degrees of diarrheal disease risk.8 Exposure values are then estimated for each
 child, and averaged by cluster using survey weights included in DHS datasets. After calculating
 the exposure index, it was rescaled and then adjusted it to the excess exposure risk due to
 inadequate WASH by subtracting 1 from the RR value.

 The model includes three risk factors related to the susceptibility of diarrheal disease and
 mortality. These include the acquisition of susceptibility-related micronutrients (vitamin A),
 effective treatment (oral rehydration treatment), and undernutrition or underweight assessed
 by a child’s WFA. We estimate RRs based on WFA z-scores recorded for under-five children in
 the child-level DHS data. RRs are assigned to different levels of WFA based on standard
 deviations below the global mean of the z-score distribution as compared to normal values.

 The susceptibility index and exposure risk are combined into the overall risk index, which is
 simply the product of the two indexes. Risk index scores are calculated individually for each
 child under five years of age and then aggregated into subpopulation estimates. The risk
 results from the WASH Risk Index are then translated them into commonly used measures of
 disability adjusted life years (DALYs), developed and used by the Global Burden of Disease
 project (GBD). DALYs are a common health metric that combine both the years of life lost (YLL)
 due to a particular cause or risk factor as well as the years lived with disability. A single DALY
 can be considered as one year of healthy life lost. DALYs are used to provide a summary
 estimate for the distribution of the enteric disease burden attributable to inadequate WASH,
 calculated across different subsets of the population.



 Results
 This section describes the main results of the analysis from the risk model. The results are
 presented in the following order: (a) the distribution and population patterns of exposure
 variables and the exposure index; (b) the distribution and population patterns of the susceptibility
 variables and the spatial distribution of the susceptibility index; (c) the distribution of the
 combined risk index; (d) the spatial distribution of the risk index and impact of water or
 sanitation interventions; and (e) the DALY burden of inadequate WASH.


 Distribution of Exposure to Inadequate WASH Factors
 Figure 5.3, panel b, shows the distribution of household sanitation access, and panel b shows
 the household drinking water access service levels by economic status (wealth quintile) for
 national, rural, and urban populations of children under five. The results suggest that a majority
 of children (75 percent of B20, 60 percent of those in the top 20 percent [T20]) do not have
 access to improved sanitation (figure 5.3, panel a). Moreover, there is a sharp disparity in
 access to improved sanitation across the economic distribution: around 15 percent of the
 poorest households (B20) have access to improved sanitation, compared to around 25 percent
 of the richest (T20) (figure 5.3, panel a). This pattern holds true across both rural and urban
 settings, although, in general, access to improved facilities is somewhat higher for children in
 urban households. Overall, very few children in households have access to a sanitation facility
 connected to a sewerage network: a sewerage service is available to only 5 percent of children
 in the richest households (T20 quintile), is marginally available in urban areas (around
 12 percent for T20, 1 percent to 5 percent for other quintiles) (figure 5.3, panel a), and is rarely
 available in rural areas (mostly for the T20 [around 5 percent]).

 There is also a large disparity in access to improved drinking water for children across the
 economic distribution. Almost 85 percent of the T20 have access to improved drinking water,
 while only 30 percent of the B20 have access (figure 5.3, panel b). This pattern holds true
 across both rural and urban settings, although, in general, access to improved drinking water

 is higher for urban households. Overall, less than 5 percent of households in the B20 have
 access to on-plot improved water, compared to 25 percent in the T20 (figure 5.3, panel b).

 Panels a–c of map 5.1 show a fine-scale spatial resolution map (at 5 square kilometers) of the
 exposure index value distribution across children under five in Nigeria, nationally (overall)
 (panel a), and partitioned by economic distribution (B40, panel b; T60, panel c). The maps
 show greater intra-regional heterogeneity in exposure. In the national level map, the highest
 exposure index values are concentrated in northwestern, northeastern, and southeastern
 Nigeria. For the B40 map, high exposure areas are more widespread and evenly distributed
 across the country. There are only a few concentrated areas of high exposure in the T60 map;
 these are located in the North West, South West, and north east.


 Distribution of Susceptibility Factors
 Figure 5.4 shows the distribution of susceptibility factors (moderate to severely underweight,
 probability of receiving oral rehydration treatment [ORT], and vitamin A coverage) by the
 economic distribution (wealth quintile) for national, rural, and urban populations of children
 under five. Nationally, there are higher percentages of underweight children in poor quintiles
 (almost 40 percent of B20 underweight, 15 percent of B20 severely underweight) compared to
 those in rich quintiles (15 percent of T20 underweight, 5 percent of T20 severely underweight).
 This pattern extends to urban and rural populations. The percentages of poor rural children
 that are underweight (almost 40 percent of B20) or severely underweight (5 percent of B20)
 are slightly higher than that of their urban counterparts (30 percent of B20, and 10 percent of
 B20, respectively). Nationally, the probability of receiving ORT is highest for the T20 (55 percent
 of T20), and this pattern extends to both rural and urban populations: only 20 percent of B20

 lowest mean exposure index value (national and urban T20: 2, rural T20: 2.5). Nationally, and
 for rural populations, the mean risk index for the B20 is fourfold higher than it is for the T20
 (8 versus 2). For urban populations, the mean risk index for the B20 is threefold higher than it
 is for the T20 (5 versus 1.5).


 Spatial Distribution of Risk and Intervention Impacts
 Panels a–c of Map 5.3 show the regional distribution of the disease risk index for children
 under five in Nigeria, both nationally (overall) and by economic group (B40 and T60). According
 to the overall map (panel a), children in the North West region have the highest average risk
 index value (>7), followed by the North East region (5–7). In the B40 map (panel b), the North
 West and North East regions have the highest average risk values (>7). B40 children have
 higher risk values (four out of six regions have average risk >5), especially as compared to the
 T60 children (all the regions have average risk values <5). All three maps suggest that the
 North West is a high-risk region.

 The geographic distribution of the risk index is the product of the exposure and susceptibility
 indexes (Figures 5.4 and 5.6, respectively). It is interesting to note that the geographic
 distributions for exposure and susceptibility have some differences, with the North Central
 region experiencing the highest exposure and North West region experiencing the highest
 susceptibility.

 Panels a–c of map 5.4 show a finer scale spatial resolution map (at 5 square kilometers) of
 the disease risk index value distribution across children under five in Nigeria, both nationally

 risk areas are largely concentrated in the South Central region. For the B40 population, there
 are larger areas of the highest susceptibility index values (>8) in northwestern and North
 Central Nigeria. There are concentrated areas of the highest risk values across all three
 maps—however, these high risk areas are more widespread in B40 and more localized in
 the T60 map, suggesting that the B40 of the population are vulnerable across larger areas of
 the country.


 DALY Burden of Inadequate WASH in Nigeria
 The WASH Risk Index model estimates the distribution of child diarrheal and enteric disease
 due to inadequate WASH. The risk estimates are then translated into the commonly used
 measure DALYs, developed and used by the GBD. DALYs are a common health metric that
 combines both the years of life lost (YLL) due to a particular cause or risk factor as well as the
 years lived with disability. For diarrheal and enteric disease among children under five, most
 (approximately 90 percent) of the DALY burden is due to YLL because of premature mortality.
 A single DALY can be considered as one year of healthy life lost. As such, DALYs permit
 comparison between diverse health conditions and provide a useful summary statistic of the
 disease burden for a given population.

 DALYs are used to provide a summary estimate for the distribution of the enteric disease
 burden attributable to inadequate WASH, by subpopulation groups. Figure 5.6 shows the
 calculated total enteric burden rate9 in DALYs, divided into the fraction associated with having
 inadequate WASH and burden rates unrelated to WASH, by wealth quintile for national, rural,
 and urban populations of children under five.

                                                              It is important to clarify aspects of what is meant by “associated” and “unrelated to” inadequate
                                                              WASH. First, some enteric infections are not preventable with improved WASH. For example,
                                                              almost all children under five years of age experience rotavirus infections, but improvements in
                                                              WASH do not prevent these. Hence, such infections are unrelated to inadequate WASH in that
                                                              they would not be prevented with improvements. Second, the DALY burden associated with
                                                              inadequate WASH here accounts for both the level of exposure due to inadequate WASH and
                                                              children’s susceptibility due to other factors. That is, the DALY burden associated with
                                                              inadequate WASH in a subpopulation reflects both exposure and susceptibility. Child
                                                              susceptibility affects both the WASH associated and unrelated burdens. That is, children in the
                                                              poorest subpopulations have a greater WASH associated burden in part because they have
                                                              higher exposures, but also because children with inadequate WASH are more undernourished
                                                              and have less access to health care. These susceptibility risk factors modify and magnify the
                                                              impact of inadequate WASH. The fraction of the overall enteric burden in children varies across
                                                              subpopulations, with a greater fraction in poorer subpopulations. The fraction due to inadequate
                                                              WASH is also much higher in the poorest populations across all subpopulations (figure 5.6).

                                                              have higher total enteric burden DALY rates in all three maps. The B40 children from the North
                                                              West region have the highest overall average regional enteric burden (23,489 DALYs per

                                                              inadequate WASH is 10,083 DALYs per 100,000 children per year. This is approximately 73

                                                              project provides its own estimate of the burden attributable to inadequate WASH. However, this

                                                              calculation uses the WASH PRM risk index model, which accounts for the codistribution of
                                                              inadequate WASH and child susceptibility. That is, data on the codistribution of risk factors

 are  used to account for the fact that children with inadequate WASH often also are more
 vulnerable due to under-nutrition and a lack of access to care. Second, using the underlying
 data on the distribution of risk factors, it is possible to examine the distribution across
 economic and geographic sub-populations. Lastly, in some cases slightly different assumptions
 regarding the relative risk associated with different WASH service levels were used.

 Our distributional analysis of WASH-associated burden suggests that the health burden of
 inadequate WASH is disproportionately borne by poorer children and those in vulnerable
 geographic areas. Nationally, the WASH enteric burden for the poorest quintile is about four
 times greater than the enteric burden for the richest quintile. The WASH-related enteric burden
 is lower in urban populations than it is in rural populations, though both populations exhibit
 significant wealth-related disparities. The burden for the poorest in urban areas is 3.3 times
 higher than that for the richest, and in rural areas, it is three times higher for the poorest than
 for the richest. It should be noted that this analysis, like the underlying GBD estimates,
 accounts for the impact of inadequate WASH on acute morbidity and mortality from enteric
 infections, though it does not account for the effect that these infections may have on
 undernutrition and its chronic sequelae.


 Concluding Remarks
 Exposure (WASH) variables are often codistributed with susceptibility (health-related) variables,
 reflecting underlying structural inequalities relating to wealth, urban or rural situation, and
 location. This codistribution of related factors compounds the impact of poor WASH among
 these populations, since it increases the associated health risk. At the same time, the fact

      that these variables are concentrated among certain groups presents an opportunity to better
      target WASH investments so that they reach the most vulnerable, who likely have the most to
      gain. In Nigeria, there are stark disparities between the rich and poor, those living urban and
      rural areas, and between regions. This suggests that, at least in terms of diarrheal disease,
      strategies that deliberately target the most vulnerable groups may yield the greatest health
      impacts.

      The overall distribution of the risk indexes indicates sharp divisions along geography, urban or
      rural location, and income groups in Nigeria. In general, risk is negatively associated with
      wealth; the poorest and most vulnerable are also more likely to live in communities with higher
      exposure risk. Children in poor households have higher susceptibility and risk than children in
      rich households, with the B40 having almost 60 percent of the cumulative share of susceptibility
      and risk. In urban and rural settings, the poorest (B20) children have twice the susceptibility
      as compared to the richest (T20). The rural B20 have four times the risk of the richest (T20)
      children, while the urban B20 have three times the risk of the urban B20. The 40 percent of
      children with the highest risk bear approximately 78 percent of the risk, and this is similar in
      urban and rural settings.

      WASH-related risk of disease varies significantly across regions and income groups in Nigeria.
      The reasons for this are threefold: (a) the variability in WASH-related exposures—with children
      in poorer households having higher exposures; (b) these same children are likely to be much
      more vulnerable due to underlying poor nutrition and a lack of access to basic health services;
      and (c) both WASH and health vulnerabilities are the product of underlying economic and
      geographic inequalities. All regions in Nigeria show disparities in risk between the poorest
      (B20) and richest (T20) quintiles, with the B20 having the highest mean risk index values. This
      pattern is especially evident in the South West region. Areas exhibiting the highest risk index
      values are concentrated in the north, with children from the North West and North East regions
      being particularly vulnerable to disease risk. According to the sanitation and water improvement
      maps, children from North West, then the North East, would experience the greatest risk
      reduction in response to improvements in access to water or sanitation, but all regions would
      benefit from such improvements.

      A majority share of the GBD enteric burden estimated for Nigeria is associated with inadequate
      WASH, and disproportionately borne by poorer children and those in vulnerable geographic
      areas. Approximately 73 percent of the GBD enteric burden estimated for the country is
      associated with inadequate WASH. The national enteric burden associated with inadequate
      WASH is 10,083 DALYs per 100,000 children per year. Moreover, the WASH enteric burden for
      the poorest quintile is about four times greater than the enteric burden for the richest quintile.
      The burden for the poorest in urban areas is 3.3 times higher than that for the richest, and in
      rural areas it is three times higher for the poorest than for the richest.

      This analysis suggests a number of priorities for designing more impactful WASH investment
      strategies:

        ••   This analysis describes how WASH-related risk is distributed across wealth quintiles,
             between rural and urban populations, and by location. A simple next step would be to
             map existing World Bank programs in Nigeria against these findings to assess the extent
             to which investments are reaching the populations who stand to gain the most.

        ••   Strategies to target investments toward groups with the greatest risk will not only require
             the identification and location of these groups but will also require that the WASH
             services provided or promoted are appropriate, available, and accessible to these
             groups.

        ••   Assess whether the most vulnerable children are able to benefit from or take advantage
             of WASH services as they are offered or available, and if not, understand why.

    ••   Geographic targeting of WASH investments to areas with higher concentrations of
         children who are vulnerable due to poor nutrition and low access to health care services.
         This may also facilitate cross-sectoral planning, delivery, and monitoring.

    ••   Pro-poor targeting in coordination with social protection programs that focus on
         households with young children who are economically vulnerable.

 The analysis also points to important knowledge gaps. There has been a large global effort to
 understand and document the impact of WASH investments, and this analysis suggests that
 overlapping vulnerabilities may substantially modify their impact. Analyses to understand how
 other vulnerabilities (e.g., environmental, health, and social) may change the impact of WASH
 interventions could provide new insights for improving the impact of WASH investments on
 poverty reduction.


 Notes
 1.	 DALY is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due
     to ill health, disability, or early death. It was developed in the 1990s as a way of comparing
     the overall health and life expectancy of different countries. DALY is becoming increasingly
     common in the field of public health and health impact assessment (HIA). It “extends the
     concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death...to include equivalent years
     of ‘healthy’ life lost by virtue of being in states of poor health or disability.” In so doing,
     mortality and morbidity are combined into a single, common metric.
 2.	 Moderate malnutrition is defined as a having a weight-for-age (WFA) ratio between −3 and
     −2 z-scores below the median of WHO’s child growth standards. It can be due to a low
     weight-for-height (WFH) (wasting), a low height-for-age (HFA) (stunting), or a combination.
     Similarly, moderate wasting and stunting are defined as a WFH and HFA ratio, respectively,
     which are between −3 and −2 z-scores below the WHO median. Children with moderate
     malnutrition have an increased risk of mortality, and moderate malnutrition is associated
     with a high number of nutrition-related deaths. If moderately malnourished children do not
     receive adequate support, their conditions may progress toward severe acute malnutrition
     (severe wasting or edema) or severe stunting (HFA less than −3 z-scores), both of which
     are life-threatening conditions.

 Efficiency of the
 WASH Sector

                                           Key Takeaways

    •	 When considering most water utility indicators, Nigeria underperforms in relation to
        both African and global averages.

    •	 According to the 2015 National Water Supply and Sanitation Survey (NWSS), more
        than 38 percent of all improved water points and around 46 percent of all water
        schemes in Nigeria are nonfunctional. These concerning figures beg for an
        investigation into the main drivers of failure.

    •	 Evidence from our analysis suggests that nearly 27 percent of water points are likely
        to fail in the first year of construction. Further, nearly 40 percent are likely to fail in
        the long run (after 8–10 years).

    •	 Water schemes have a similar likelihood of failure within the first year. Approximately
        30 percent of water schemes are likely to fail in the first year, while around 60
        percent are likely to fail after the age of 10 years.



 Introduction
 Nigeria faces significant water availability challenges. In the beginning of the millennium,
 Nigeria had an estimated 224 trillion liters of surface water per year and 50 trillion liters of
 ground water per year available to cover the water-related needs of its 128 million citizens.
 Total demand for the domestic consumption of water was estimated at around 6 billion liters
 per year, indicating that there is an abundant water resource potential (Akujieze et al. 2003).
 Today, given similar average per capita domestic consumption levels1 (Danilenko et al 2014),
 and with Nigeria’s population estimated at 182 million people, total demand for domestic
 consumption has increased to 7.7 billion liters per year.

 Issues with the sustainability of water are mostly linked to institutional, social, and technical
 failures (Parry-Jones, Reed, and Skinner 2001). At least 30 percent of water pumps in Africa
 are not working (Baumann 2009). Programs to address these problems should adopt a
 multitiered approach, focusing on soft strategies (e.g., promoting ownership, and encouraging
 changes in behaviors, norms and practices) as well as hard strategies (e.g., investing in human
 resources and suitable technologies, increasing the availability of finance for capital expenditure,
 and developing means to help users pay for services) (Baumann 2009). Without this multitiered
 approach, water systems are bound to fail.

 Nigeria faces wide-ranging deficiencies in the technical capacity of its water sector.
 Hydrogeological base maps for the country are of poor quality, and thus of little use in helping
 the government develop a water exploration and extraction plan. Poor knowledge of the Nigerian



A Wake Up Call	                                                                                         69
      geological terrain, a lack of adequate infrastructural facilities, and an inefficient legislative body
      have caused problems in the exploration, operation, and management of surface and ground
      water. Moreover, the country faces major problems with regard to the functionality of water
      pumps, resulting in a water service delivery system that does not match the population’s
      increasing demand for water.

      Even though the country has experienced a rapid growth in population, there has not been an
      improvement in the institutional capacity of the water service sector in Nigeria. When compared
      with global averages, Nigeria’s water infrastructure—as measured by staff productivity, total
      consumption, service continuity, and cost recovery—has underperformed. Between 2011 and
      2015, the performance of Nigerian water agencies was particularly poor: these agencies not
      only performed below the global average but they also greatly underperformed in comparison
      to the African average.

      The previous chapters of this report sought to assess the extent of access to water and
      sanitation in Nigeria, focusing mostly on the demand side of WASH services. To provide a more
      holistic assessment, this section looks into the supply side of WASH services—aiming to
      understand the performance levels of water supply service providers.

      In this chapter, the sustainability of the water sector in Nigeria is analyzed by looking into its
      technical capacity and efficiency in service provision. We use IBNET data to analyze the sector’s
      efficiency in service provision—it measures efficient service provision in terms of staff
      productivity, service continuity, water consumption per capita, percentage of water samples that
      passed residual chlorine tests, cost recovery, and average revenue. We then use information
      from the NWSS 20152 to analyze the functionality of water points and schemes, and provide a
      broad sense of the possible explanations behind their failures. In particular, it seeks to answer
      the following questions: (a) Why are some water points and schemes failing faster than others?
      Is it age-specific? (b) Do they follow any geographic pattern? (c) Do promoters, technology, or
      hydrological circumstances matter in explaining failure rates? (d) What roles do management
      and maintenance play in explaining the likelihood of failure? and (e) What are the relative
      shares of each driver in explaining the failure of water points and schemes?


      Assessing the Performance of Nigerian
      Water Agencies
      In this section, data provided by the International Benchmarking Network are used for
      Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET) to build a broad base of knowledge analyzing the
      efficiency, availability, quality, and financial sustainability of service providers across Nigeria.
      The aim is to encourage greater conversation with public and private water service providers
      to help identify and address deficiencies. Box 6.1 provides a summary of the indicators
      used in this analysis.

      The data suggest that water agencies in Nigeria exhibited mixed performance between 2011
      and 2015. While there were improvements in staff productivity, water continuity, and quality
      (table 6.1), indicators of financial performance—average revenue and operational cost
      coverage—registered a decline. Water consumption also decreased during this period.

      Table 6.2 presents the unweighted analysis of water agencies’ performance. For the most part,
      this table shows trends similar to the weighted estimates in table 6.1. There are a number of
      notable exceptions: contrary to the weighted estimates, the unweighted estimates for continuity
      decreased during this time period, suggesting that the increase in continuity found in table 6.1
      was driven by larger SWAs. Moreover, while average revenue decreased in both cases, the
      average operational cost recovery increased when unweighted between 2011 and 2015.
      However, the level of operational cost recovery remained low, and the water agencies did not
      recover costs, let alone generate profits. The average number of connections increased by
      almost 3 percent during this time.3

         Box 6.1: Indicators for Measuring Performance

         To assess the efficiency, availability, quality, and financial sustainability of service
         providers, we utilize a number of key indicators:

         •	 Staff productivity. The number of employees per 1,000 connections. A lower
             number suggests a greater level of staff efficiency.

         •	 Availability
           •	 Continuity. The average number of hours of service per day.
           •	 Quantity. Water consumption in liters per person, per day. Higher levels of
                 consumption imply improved service delivery.

         •	 Quality. This is measured by the percentage of samples that passed the relevant
             standards, as mandated by local laws or regulations, to detect the presence of
             residual chlorine.

         •	 Financial Sustainability
           •	 Operational cost recovery. The ratio between operating revenues and operating
                 costs. A ratio over 1 implies that a utility is generating profit.

            •	 Average revenue. Per cubic meter of water sold. This serves as a proxy for
                 tariffs, and enables price comparisons across service providers.

 To uncover variations in performance among SWAs in Nigeria, we divided the water agencies
 into the following three categories, based on their performance (Figure 6.1):

          than the 80th percentile (or less than the 20th percentile in the case of staff productivity)

                                       ••   Bottom 20 percent: Agencies whose mean performance for a particular indicator was
                                            less than the 20th percentile (or greater than the 80th percentile in the case of
                                            nonrevenue water and staff productivity) for the same period.

                                       ••   Middle 60 percent. Agencies whose mean performance was between the 20th and the
                                            80th percentile for the same period.

                                    There was a boost in staff productivity across water agencies in the bottom 20 and middle
                                    60  percentiles. Staff productivity increased for both the bottom 20 percent (from 46.5 to
                                    44 employees per 1,000 connections) and the middle 60 percent (from 24 to 21 employees
                                    per 1,000 connections). Staff productivity for the top 20 percent of the agencies remained
                                    roughly the same, with the number of staff per 1,000 connections at around 10.

                                    The continuity of water services displayed mixed performance across groups. The continuity of
                                    service decreased for the bottom 20 percent from 5.6 hours to 4.4 hours per day. It remained
                                    almost the same for the middle 60 percent, at almost 9 hours per day, and for the top 20 percent,
                                    at almost 17 hours per day. In terms of quantity, the average consumption of water decreased
                                    for the middle 60 percent by a large amount—from 48.6 to 41 liters per person per day. The top
                                    20 percent of agencies showed a slight increase in the consumption of water—from 72.7 to
                                    74.5 liters per person per day. Among the bottom 20 percent of agencies there were not enough
                                    observations in any given year to derive a conclusion with regard to changes in consumption.

                                    There was an increase in water quality between the bottom 20 percent and middle 60 percent
                                    of water agencies. The percentage of samples that passed the relevant standards to detect
                                    the presence of residual chlorine increased from 85.8 percent to 86.8 percent for the middle
                                    60  percent of agencies, and there was a larger increase for the bottom 20 percent—from
                                    52.8 percent to 59.2 percent. Overall, 99 percent of samples in the top 20 percent of agencies
                                    met the relevant standards throughout the period.

                                    There were mixed changes in levels of financial stability across all three groups. The average
                                    revenue for a cubic meter of water sold decreased from US$1.31 in 2012 to US$0.75 in 2015
                                    for the top 20 percent, from US$0.19 in 2011 to US$0.17 in 2015 for the middle 60 percent,
                                    and increased from US$0.01 to US$0.013 for the bottom 20 percent between 2011 and
                                    2014. On the other hand, cost coverage improved from 0.04 to 0.05 for the bottom 20 percent,
                                    decreased from 0.37 to 0.35 for the middle 60 percent, and remained roughly the same, at
                                    around 1.35, for the top 20 percent.

 Across most indicators, Nigeria underperformed in comparison to both African and global
 averages (figure 6.2). As noted earlier, the performance of Nigerian water agencies was
 poor. Nigerian agencies not only performed below the global average, but they also
 underperformed in comparison to the African average by a significant margin during the
 same time period.

      Note: (a) Based on unweighted observations. (b) Changes are computed based on the same composition of agencies in two consecutive years. (c) Since the top and
      bottom 20 percent of agencies are based on a smaller number of observations, the trends are more susceptible to large changes in the data of any one agency. Hence,
      despite our best efforts to exclude outliers while taking care to not discard useful data, trends for the bottom and top 20 percent of agencies show outsized growths or
      decreases in certain years due to the low number of observations. (d) Bold lines are based on at least 10 agencies. (e) Dashed lines are based on data for more than or
      equal to five, but less than or equal to ten agencies per year. (f) Dotted and dashed lines (for water consumption among the top 20 percent) indicate less than or equal to five
      observations per year. There was only one agency in the bottom 20 percent that consistently had observations across all years, and as such, it was not included in the graph.

      Box 6.2: Methodology for Calculating the Probability of Failure of Water
      Points and Water Schemes

      Two other pieces of information that are crucial for our analysis are the age and
      functionality status of each scheme. The functionality analysis has two components:
      first, we analyze variation in the functionality of water points and schemes using local
      regression analysis. Due to our interest in predicting the likelihood of failure, we carry
      out a locally weighted regression of a dichotomous variable, “nonfunctionality” on
      the “age” of water points and schemes (in years), and display it in a graph. Second,
      we decompose the relative shares of the various drivers of failure using the Shapley
      decomposition.

      The age of a scheme is calculated as its age in 2015, based on its year of
      commission. The central question is: do these water points fail because of age, or
      do other factors influence the process? In the results section, we plot the likelihood
      (probability) of failure against the respective age of these water points and categorize
      them by their location, technology, and promoters. To understand whether differences
      in operation and management options play a role in deciding the longevity of water
      points, we also categorize these water points by their maintenance and management
      options. Usage of a management committee is indicated by the presence of a
      community-based water, sanitation, and hygiene committee (WASHCOM) in a given
      community. We also calculate whether other factors play a role in predicting the
      failure rates of the water agencies (e.g., the local availability of spare parts, agents
      who conduct routine repairs, and hydrological factors—such as groundwater depth,
      groundwater storage level, and groundwater water productivity).

      and  scheme failure, we used econometric analysis—the Shapley decomposition
      technique—to decompose the relative shares of these factors. This technique
      decomposes the relative contributions of each indicator or a group of similar
      indicators in explaining variation in the outcome indicator, which, in our case, is the
      likelihood of failure. To discover the reasons for early, midterm, or long-run failure, we
      group water points that are one years old, those that are three to six years old, and
      those that are older than eight years. Then, for each of these three age groups, we
      decompose the relative shares of political regions, hydrological conditions, scheme
      size, technology, location, promoters, management, and maintenance and operation
      in explaining the water points’ likelihood of failure.




 the likelihood of failure for the best performing region in the south—the South East—is at least
 8 percent to 10 percent higher than the poorest performer in the north (the North East). This
 gap is more or less remains consistent across the water schemes’ 15-year lifespan.

 Midsized schemes with 5,000 to 10,000 beneficiaries perform slightly better than others in
 their initial 10 years. The likelihood of failure for all small and medium schemes shows a
 similar pattern of failure (figure 6.3, panel c).6 The likelihood of failure for these schemes within
 the first couple of years ranges between 20 percent to 30 percent, and then reaches a
 maximum of around 50 percent to 55 percent at eight to 10 years of age. For children older

      than 10, the likelihood of failure remains largely stable at the same rate. Groundwater- and
      surface water-based pump-piped systems7 have a similar likelihood of failure over the first
      15 years of their lifespan. Both types of pump-piped system schemes face a similar likelihood
      of failure; in the initial years this rate is approximately 30 percent, and at the age of 15 years
      it reaches 50 percent to 55 percent. Gravity flow schemes, on the other hand, have a rate of
      failure that is slightly less than 70 percent after eight years.

      LGA and NGO promoted schemes have a lower likelihood of failure than their counterparts.8
      Despite similar trends over the years, the FGN- and state-promoted schemes are almost
      10  percent more likely to fail than local government and NGO-promoted schemes. Donor-
      promoted schemes perform similar to the FGN- and state-promoted schemes; these have
      almost a 65 percent to 70 percent likelihood of failure at the age of 15 years.

      WASHCOM-managed9 water schemes perform at least 10 percent better in initial years, and
      around 25 percent better after 10 years. Moreover, the likelihood of failure is 8 percent to
      10 percent less when spare parts are locally available, particularly within a scheme’s initial eight
      to 10 years.10 When spare parts are locally available, the likelihood of failure is almost 10 percent
      less in the initial five years, and then slowly converges to the same rate of schemes for which parts
      are not locally available. Interestingly, this suggests that the proper maintenance and availability of
      required spare parts can reduce the initial failures of water schemes by a significant margin.

      Evidence suggests that there is not much difference in the likelihood of failure between
      schemes maintained by private consultants11 and by water works, particularly after eight to
      10 years. Before that, however, the schemes repaired and maintained by water works perform
      slightly better, by at least 5 percent to 8 percent.

      Water schemes with shallow groundwater depth have a greater chance of failure than do water
      schemes with deeper groundwater depth. Water schemes with deeper groundwater depth—
      between 25–100 meters below ground level—have around a 20 percent probability of failing
      within their first year, and over a 30 percent probability of failing after 10 years. Water schemes
      with a shallower groundwater depth—between 0–7 meters below ground level—have above a
      30 percent probability of failing in their first year, and after 10 years, this probability reaches
      almost 60 percent.

      When decomposing the drivers of failure, the aforementioned factors are grouped into three
      broader categories. First, factors that cannot be changed, such as political region and the
      hydrological characteristics of where the water scheme is located, are assessed. Second,
      influential factors at the design and implementation stage (and can be considered when
      developing new points and schemes)—namely which promoter funded the construction, what
      type of technology is used to build the water scheme (e.g., hand pump, motorized pump), and
      the size of the water scheme are considered. Third, influential factors at the operational stage
      (and can be addressed for existing points and schemes): management and maintenance
      (the  organization in charge of carrying out the repairs for the water schemes) and whether
      the water scheme is managed by a WASHCOM (figure 6.4) are considered.

      In water schemes’ first year of operation, factors that can be controlled in the design, operations,
      and implementation stages explain 66 percent of water scheme failure. As water schemes
      age, their likelihood of failure is better predicted by factors that can’t be modified and can be
      controlled during their operational stages. Inversely, as water schemes age, the share of water
      scheme failures linked to factors that are relevant at the design and implementation stage
      decreases. In the water schemes’ first year, 34 percent of failures are explained by factors that
      cannot be modified, and after eight to 10 years, that number increases to 45 percent. Likewise,
      the share of factors that can be changed during the operational stages increases from
      24 percent in the water schemes’ first year to 26 percent after eight to 10 years. Conversely,
      around 42 percent of water point failure in the first year can be linked to factors such as repair
      and maintenance, and management by WASHCOMs, whereas that number drops to 29 percent
      after eight or more years.

 Assessing the Performance of Nigerian Water Points
 As part of the NWSS there was a nationwide survey of all water points in Nigeria (see chapter 3).
 This survey provides information on 90,508 “improved” water points across states and LGAs.
 Similar to the water schemes survey, the survey includes details of water points’ respective
 years of construction, promoters, location, and their functional status.

 Almost 89 percent of the water points are tube wells or boreholes. The rest are either protected
 dug wells, springs, harvested rainwater, or infiltration galleries (table 6.4). Out of all water
 points, around 79 percent have been constructed by government agencies over the years.
 Among those, the majority are built by state governments (30 percent), followed by federal
 governments (25 percent), and local governments (24 percent). The rest are built by donors
 (8 percent), NGOs (5 percent), and philanthropists and others (9 percent) (for more detailed
 information on the breakdown of water points by type of promoter, see table 7.1).

 Fifty-four percent of water points are fully functional, and 8 percent are either in bad condition
 or not in use. Altogether, the total share of working water points is 61 percent. Nationally,
 around 75 percent of these working water points are functional throughout most of the year.
 and only one-third of states perform below the national average. Perhaps the most striking
 finding is that among all water points in Nigeria, more than one-third (38.2 percent) are not
 functioning at all (table 6.4).

 Around 25 percent to 30 percent of water points are likely to fail within the very first year after
 installation. The likelihood of failure increases with age, but does not vary much by location
 when water points are younger than eight to 10 years. After 10 years, however, older water
 points in rural areas perform better than their urban counterparts. After seven to eight years,
 the likelihood of failure in urban areas increases to around 45 percent as compared to
 35 percent in rural areas (figure 6.5, panel a).

                                                          Regionally, the likelihood of failure is higher in the south than in the north, irrespective of a
                                                          water point’s age. To identify any spatial differences, we separated all water points into six
                                                          political zones and plotted their likelihood of failure against their respective age. Figure 6.5,
                                                          panel c, shows that the likelihood of failure is lowest in the North West, followed by the North
                                                          East and North Central regions. The likelihood of failure in the North West region is around
                                                          15  percent within the first few years, while it is around 25 percent in the North East, and
                                                          slightly above 30 percent in the North Central region. The likelihood of failure increases steadily
                                                          with age in the North East and North Central regions—to more than 50 percent—while it is
                                                          largely stable in the North West, at around 18 percent to 20 percent.

 The likelihood of failure among motorized pumps is almost 20 percent higher after eight to
 10 years, higher than the likelihood of failure for manual and hand pumps. Initially, manual and
 hand pumps, as well as motorized pumps, have close to a 30 percent chance of failure. In later
 years, manual and hand pumps maintain a similar likelihood of failure, while for motorized
 pumps this rate increases to almost 50 percent after eight to 10 years. We observe a similar
 pattern when we disaggregate the data by geographic region.

 The initial likelihood of donor and NGO- or CBO-sponsored water points to fail is almost
 5 percent to 10 percent lower than that of units promoted by governments—namely by the FGN
 and state governments. Among government-sponsored water points, LGA-sponsored points
 are  the best performers. These water points have a steady likelihood of failure at around
 25 percent over their lifetime. The likelihood of failure for FGN-sponsored water points increases
 from around 30 percent in the initial years to more than 50 percent after 10 years. Donor- and
 NGO- or CBO-sponsored water points maintain close to a 10 percent advantage over FGN- and
 state-sponsored water points across their entire lifespan.

 The maintenance and management of water points is an important factor in explaining their
 likelihood of failure. Evidence suggests that the likelihood of failure is 15 percent to 20 percent
 less when nonfunctional water points are repaired by WASHCOM rather than by local artisans.
 In the initial years, the likelihood of WASHCOM-maintained water points to fail is around
 10 percent as compared to 30 percent for water points that are repaired and maintained by
 local mechanics or artisans. The likelihood of failure among government- and donor- or NGO-
 maintained water points is similar, and this likelihood remains steady—at around 30 percent—
 over their lifespan. Interestingly, in the initial years, while the likelihood of failure is similar
 to that of water points that are maintained by local mechanics, it starts converging with the
 failure rate of WASHCOM maintained water points after eight to 10 years.

 Failure declines by 5 percent to 10 percent when spare parts are locally available. Approximately
 80 percent of nonfunctioning water points are subject to mechanical failure and, in about
 45 percent of cases, spare parts are not locally available. When spare parts are available, the
 likelihood of failure declines by 5 percent in the initial years, and by almost 10 percent after
 eight to 10 years. This suggests that proper knowledge of water point repair, and the availability
 of required spare parts, can immediately improve the functionality of water points by a significant
 margin.

 Water points that have deeper levels of groundwater storage, deeper levels of groundwater
 profundity, and higher levels of groundwater productivity are less likely to fail. Water points that
 have groundwater storage levels deeper than 2.5 centimeters have a 20 percent failure rate in
 their first year, which then increases to almost 30 percent by their eighth year. Those with
 storage levels shallower than 2.5 centimeters have around a 30 percent failure rate in their
 first year, which increases to over 40 percent by their eighth year. Moreover, water points with
 a groundwater depth of more than 25 meters below ground level have around a 20 percent
 failure rate within their first year, which does not significantly increase over time, whereas water
 points with depths less than 7 meters below ground level have almost a 30 percent failure rate
 in their first year, which increases to above 40 percent by their eighth year.

 Lastly, water points with a groundwater productivity of greater than 5 liters per second have
 around a 20 percent failure rate in their first year, which rises to around 30 percent by their
 eighth year, whereas water points with groundwater productivity that is less than 5 liters
 per second have around a 30 percent failure rate in their first year, which increases to over
 40 percent by their eighth year.

 In the first year of operation, factors that can be controlled in the design, operations, and
 implementation stages explain 56 percent of water point failure (figure 6.6). As water points
 age, their failure is better predicted by those factors that can’t be modified, and by those
 factors that can be controlled during the design and implementation stage. Inversely, the share
 of water point failure attributable to factors that are relevant at the operational stage decreases

      with water points’ age. In the water points’ first year, 44 percent of failures are explained by
      factors that can’t be modified, and after eight to 10 years, that number increases to 63 percent.
      Likewise, the share of factors that can be changed during the design and implementation
      stage increases from 13 percent in the water points’ first year to 20 percent after eight or more
      years. Conversely, around 43 percent of water point failure in the first year can be linked to
      factors in the operational stages, such as repair and maintenance and WASHCOM management,
      whereas that number drops to 17 percent after eight or more years.



      Concluding Remarks
      When considering most water utility indicators, Nigeria underperforms in relation to both African
      and global averages. The country encountered mixed trends in the overall performance of water
      agencies between 2011 and 2015. While there were improvements in staff productivity, water
      continuity, and water quality, indicators of financial performance (e.g., average revenue and
      operational cost coverage) registered a decline. Water consumption also decreased during this
      period.

      Unfortunately, there is still a lurking degree of uncertainty behind some of the drivers of the
      performance of water agencies: there are inconsistent patterns between certain measures of
      efficiency, availability, quality, and financial sustainability, as well as in the overall performance
      of water agencies. The worst-performing SWAs had nine times more employees per 1,000
      connections than the best-performing SWAs. Similarly, while the best-performing SWAs provide
      service for 20 hours a day, the worst performers only do so for five hours a day. In the same
      vein, the best performers tend to be in a cost recovery situation, with 100 percent quality test
      compliance, and they deliver an average of 120 liters per person per day. In contrast, the worst
      performers recover only 10 percent of their costs, no more than 70 percent of the quality tests
      have passed current standards, and they deliver only around 20 liters per person per day.

 Half of the water schemes and 38 percent of water points are not functioning. Evidence from
 the analysis presented here suggests that nearly 27 percent of water points are likely to fail in
 the first year of construction and 40 percent are likely to fail in the long run (after eight to
 10 years). Water schemes have a similar likelihood of failure within the first year. Approximately
 30 percent of water schemes are likely to fail in the first year, and around 60 percent are likely
 to fail after 10 years.

 If water points and schemes are more carefully attended to during the design, implementation, and
 operational stages, it is possible to drastically reduce failure rates. When decomposing the drivers
 of water points’ and water schemes’ failure rates, it is found that influential factors at the design
 and implementation stages explain around 13 percent to 42 percent of failure, and influential
 factors at the operational stage (e.g., maintenance and management) are responsible for 24 percent
 to 43 percent of the failure rate. In the first year of operation, factors that can be controlled in the
 design, operations, and implementation stages predict the failure of 66 percent of water schemes
 and 56 percent of water points. As water points age, there is an increase in the relative importance
 of those factors that can be controlled during the design and implementation stage in explaining
 their failure. As water schemes age, there is an increase in the relative importance of factors that
 can be controlled during the operational stages in explaining the SWAs’ failure.


 Notes
 1.	 See IBNET’s database for 2014, https://www.ib-net.org/.
 2.	 NWSS 2015 data were collected and collated from all wards of Nigeria. They are a census
     of all water points and schemes in Nigeria, and were conducted as a follow-up to an earlier
     survey conducted in 2006.
 3.	 IBNET information on the performance of the agencies across water indicators is available
     at the state-level, however, because of outliers and small samples of water agencies per
     state, state-level performance of utilities are not included in the report or the appendix.
     This information is available upon request.
 4.	 Since the number of observations in the top 20 percent and bottom 20 percent of the
     utilities is less than 10—and in the case of water consumption, there are less than five
     observations—these results may be considered a broad, but not definitive snapshot, of
     these utilities’ performance.
 5.	 The analysis considers schemes that are already installed and not more than 15 years
     old. To avoid overestimation, we disregard all water schemes that are installed or
     rehabilitated in 2015—when the survey was conducted. Thus we run the functionality
     analysis and the Shapley decomposition on a sample of 3,325 water schemes. Similarly,
     considering older schemes may yield a reporting bias in favor of functional water schemes,
     since it may be difficult to recall all the schemes that failed long ago.
 6.	 The number of smaller schemes with fewer than 1,000 beneficiaries, and those with 1,000
     to 2,000 beneficiaries, constitute 31 percent and 18 percent, respectively, of the total
     number of schemes that are 15 years old or younger. Slightly larger or midsized schemes
     that serve between 2,000 to 5,000, and between 5,000 to 10,000 beneficiaries, constitute
     23 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Slightly more than 5 percent of schemes are large
     schemes that serve more than 10,000 beneficiaries.
 7.	 Almost 80 percent of all schemes are groundwater-based pump-piped systems, around
     11 percent are surface water-based pump-piped systems, and 6 percent are gravity flow
     schemes.
 8.	 Around 42 percent of schemes were commissioned by the state government, followed by
     29 percent that were commissioned by the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN). Around
     12  percent were commissioned by LGAs, around 6 percent by nongovernmental
     organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations (CBOs), or philanthropists, and
     around 6 percent were commissioned by donors. For more information on the breakdown
     by promoter, see table 7.1.
 9.	 WASHCOMs were formed and trained in 2,110 communities to ensure the effective
     participation of beneficiaries, as well as to promote a high sense of ownership and the

           sustainability of projects. Community-level structures were established in the project LGAs
           as part of the program entry processes. Women make up an average of 45 percent of
           these WASHCOMs and play active roles in decision making. Federations of WASHCOMs
           were also established in the project LGAs; these unifying bodies serve to promote citizens’
           voice and accountability across each respective LGA (UNICEF 2015). More than one-third
           of water schemes in the NWSS data set were managed by WASHCOMs.
      10.	 In slightly more than 39 percent of cases, spare parts are not locally available, as compared
           to 36 percent of cases in which spare parts are locally available. The remaining schemes
           (20 percent) do not have the necessary information to discern whether spare parts are
           locally available.
      11.	According to the available information on operation and management, around 42 percent
           of the water schemes are being repaired and maintained by private consultants. The rest
           are repaired and maintained by water works.

 Institutional Landscape for
 Water Supply

                                          Key Takeaways

    •	 Nigeria’s federal system contributes to a diverse institutional landscape for the water
        sector and a challenging context for the implementation of national programs with
        multiple government agencies engaged in the production and provision water.
        Coordination of planning and budgeting is particularly challenging given the number
        of actors, as well as their diverse incentives and priorities for allocating resources to
        the sector.

    •	 Reform signaling rather than implementation is common in the water sector. Many
        drafted national laws, policies, and strategies for public water provision have not
        been officially adopted or approved through appropriate channels. Further, once
        approved, formal policies have not automatically resulted in changes to how systems
        for water service delivery function in practice.

    •	 At the state level, low budget credibility, discretionary cash rationing, and weak public
        investment management centralized in governors’ offices impacts the quality of
        expenditure in water.

    •	 State water agencies (SWAs) exercise limited autonomy over fiscal and human
        resources. SWAs that have been established as state-owned corporations have a
        degree of autonomy on paper. Yet, even for these agencies, the collection of tariffs
        remains low, leaving SWAs dependent on state governments to finance their
        operations, expenses, and salaries.

    •	 Consistent and reliable data to inform decision making and performance management,
        as well as to contribute toward greater public accountability, are limited.




 Objectives and Scope
 This chapter uses an institutional and political economy lens to explore challenges facing water
 service delivery in Nigeria. As highlighted by chapters 3 and 6, access to piped water through
 household connections has decreased in urban areas, and the postconstruction functionality
 of water points and schemes remains low. Self-supply through the informal water sector is
 common, and citizens’ trust in public sector provision is limited. To unpack these issues
 further, this chapter provides a first look at why particular institutional capabilities have
 emerged, why certain bottlenecks persist, and strategies to shift the institutional environment

      Political, Institutional, and Organizational
      Landscape for Service Delivery
      Nigeria is a large country characterized by considerable ethno linguistic diversity, requiring
      successive governments to continually invest in building a sense of national unity and
      statehood.1 The logic of politics in Nigeria has been to maintain stability through the distribution
      of resources to powerful groups and individuals so they do not become a threat, while permitting
      some benefits to trickle down for the purposes of legitimacy. Decision making with regard to
      the allocation and use of resources has been guided by strategies for the management of
      political support, rather than achieving concrete development gains. This has contributed to
      the fact that a decade of impressive growth coupled with over US$800 billion in earnings from
      oil and gas reserves have not translated into significant increases in the well-being of the
      majority of citizens, as discussed in chapter 2. Rather, the main beneficiaries of oil rents have
      been politicians, civil servants, high-ranking military officers, and business interests who
      together form Nigeria’s elite class.

      Nigeria is administered through a complex and still evolving federal structure, with a federal
      government, 36 state governments, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and 774 local
      governments. States are marked by varying degrees of autonomy from the political center, as
      well as varying degrees of institutional capacity. The incentives, technical skills, and availability
      of resources for public officials to carry out assigned functions are constrained across states
      and even more so for local government areas (LGAs). Governors are powerful actors at the
      subnational level since decision making for the use of public resources is centralized in their
      offices. See figure 7.1.

      Within the Nigerian federal system, subnational governments are assigned primary responsibility
      for service delivery. Formally, responsibility is shared between states and local governments.
      The 1999 Constitution does not clearly define the relative roles of states and LGAs, leading to
      variation in how these tiers of government assume responsibly in practice (see chapter 8).
      While the federal government can adopt national legislation and policies, its legal authority to
      influence whether and how they are adopted and implemented by states is limited.

      State and local governments largely depend on revenue transferred from the federal government
      to carry out their assigned functions; 50 percent of state and over 70 percent of local government
      receipts are composed of revenue transferred from the federal government (Lewis and Watts
      2015). Oil and tax revenues are divided vertically between tiers of government and horizontally

      Box 7.1: Allocation of Oil and Tax Revenues (Lewis and
      Watts 2015)

      The Nigerian government’s oil revenues are allocated to four main areas: (a) federal,
      state, and local budgets, and extra budgetary funds; (b) “cash calls” to the Nigeria
      National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), to finance expenditures and investments in
      the oil sector; (c) the fuel subsidy; and (d) the excess crude account.

      By law, central revenues from oil and taxes are divided among tiers of government
      according to formulae developed by a central revenue commission with legislative
      approval. Under the current formula, oil revenues are divided according to a rule that
      first gives 13 percent to oil-producing states (the derivation principle) and then splits
      remaining revenues among the federal government (52.68 percent), state
      governments (26.72 percent), and local governments (20.60 percent).

      Tax revenues from oil (after application of the derivation principle), customs, excise,
      and corporate income taxes are divided among states as follows: 40 percent is
      allocated equally to all states, 30 percent in proportion to population, 10 percent in
      proportion to land mass and terrain, 10 percent according to “social development
      factors (education, health, and water),” and 10 percent to states that generate more
      internal revenue themselves.




 across states and LGAs according to a carefully negotiated formula that sits at the heart of
 Nigeria’s political settlement (see box 7.1). Reliance on centrally generated oil revenue weakens
 the citizen-state compact, severing the need for taxation and undermining accountability.
 Further, it has made the collection of data used to calculate the share of resources allocated
 to each state—such as population and access to services—a political as well as technical
 exercise. Additionally, it links quality of state budgeting and expenditure management to the
 availability and predictability of federal transfers.2

 Reliance on centrally generated revenue has not necessarily translated into central government
 ability to influence state performance. Legally, states have autonomy with regard to how
 they allocate funds between sectors and manage resources transferred from the center; they
 have authority to engage in financial transactions, own assets, appoint officials, collect and
 retain revenue, manage their accounts and take out loans. Further, because centrally generated
 oil and tax transfers are “unconditional” (i.e., nontargeted), the federal government has little
 practical influence over how such resources are used. More recently, conditional transfers to
 influence performance in basic education and fiscal sustainability have been introduced. Yet
 evidence that conditionality has been applied in practice or that these mechanisms have
 strengthened accountability to the federal level is mixed.

 Though the Nigerian political economy presents a difficult context for improving service delivery,
 the country is also characterized by strong entrepreneurial forces, pockets of public sector
 efficacy, and capabilities that allow institutional change to emerge under some conditions.
 A  series of case studies carried out by the World Bank examine successful reforms and
 pockets of effectiveness in Nigeria. The case studies reveal that (a) leadership is a crucial
 ingredient for prompting and carrying out reform efforts; (b) strong technical skills can achieve
 results when political leaders consign the policy process to specialists and devote their political
 energies into removing impediments for technical staff; and (c) feedback loops and the use of

      data can create space to learn, respond to bottlenecks as they arise, and facilitate midcourse
      corrections (Lewis and Watts 2015; World Bank 2015a).3 A core lesson is that pragmatism,
      course corrections, renewed pressures for change, and attention to unintended consequences
      have been integral to reform agendas. To the extent that pockets of effectiveness have
      emerged, they are typically the result of a long and complex process of experimentation.


      Policy Context of Urban and Rural Water
      The Federal Government’s National Water Supply Policy of 2000 (NWSP 2000) sets out the
      policy context for water service delivery in Nigeria. It promotes “the provision of sufficient
      potable water and adequate sanitation to all Nigerians in an affordable and sustainable way
      through participatory investment by the three tiers of government, the private sector and the
      beneficiary.” Responsibility for achieving this vision is shared across Nigeria’s federal, state,
      and local governments, as well as communities.

      In the urban water sector, reforms have sought a more commercial approach to water provision,
      transforming public water providers (SWAs) into autonomous corporations that use private
      sector partners in the delivery of services. Institutional reforms introduced by the 2004 Nigeria
      Urban Water Supply Reform Project 2004 (NUWSRP 2004) and subsequent World Bank
      projects (NUWSRP II and III) aimed to improve the reliability and financial autonomy of SWAs,
      as well as to increase access to piped water networks. As explored below, implementation of
      these reforms has proved difficult and failed to deliver sustained change.

      For rural areas, reforms have focused on expanding access. The 2016–30 Partnership for
      Expanded Water Supply, Sanitation & Hygiene (PEWASH) sets a goal of increasing water supply
      coverage to 57 percent to 100 percent by 2030 through water system rehabilitation, as well as
      expansion and construction of low-cost rural water schemes. PEWASH envisions shared
      ownership and management of rural water points by communities and LGAs, with communities
      taking charge of operations and maintenance (O&M).

      As of early 2017, the federal government is initiating steps to update the prevailing national
      water policy4 with attention to the roles and responsibilities of the three tiers of government;
      the governance, regulatory and accountability framework; the capacity of stakeholders;
      financing and access for the poor; sector planning; monitoring and evaluation; education,
      information, and communication; research and knowledge; private sector participation and civil
      society; as well as water security and sustainability in the context of climate change.


      Production and Provision in Urban and
      Rural Water Supply
      According to prevailing legislative and policy frameworks, the federal government is responsible
      for managing water resources, as well as leading the formulation of national policy and strategy
      advice for the public provision of water. The Federal Ministry of Water Resources Management
      (FMWR) operates 12 River Basin Development Authorities (RBDAs), which are charged with the
      development, operation, and management of reservoirs within their catchment area, and for
      providing the bulk of the water supply for water agencies and irrigation. In the past, some
      RBDAs provided borehole water to communities. Prevailing frameworks also allow for the
      federal government to make capital investments in support of state and LGA institutions.

      Responsibility for the provision and production of water services sits with state and local
      government institutions (Macheve et al. 2015). For urban areas, responsibility for provision and
      production is assigned to SWAs, which were established in 1997 and are formally accountable
      to state governments through the SMWRM and State Water Boards (SWBs).5 Legally, all SWAs
      are public institutions; some are established as state-owned corporations that, in principle,


88	                                                                                      A Wake Up Call
 grants them more autonomy (Macheve et al. 2015). Several states have established specific
 agencies for small towns, called State Small Town Water Supply and Sanitation Agencies
 (STWSSAs).6

 Responsibility for rural areas varies by state. In principle, LGAs are responsible for the
 establishment, operation and maintenance of rural water supply schemes and sanitation
 facilities. Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Departments have been established within local
 governments to oversee the delivery of water and sanitation services, and to provide
 support to communities in the facilities’ management, sanitation promotion, and hygiene
 education. Water, sanitation, and hygiene committees (WASHCOMs) exist in some LGAs
 and are responsible for the management of water and sanitation activities at the community
 level. Many states have established State Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agencies
 (RUWASSAs), which are responsible for supporting LGAs to manage the provision of potable
 water, sanitation, and hygiene in rural communities. Still, in other states, SWAs are
 responsible for rural water production and provision.

 In practice, self-supply is common, and citizens’ trust in public provision remains low. As
 described in chapter 3, publicly provided water reaches only a small share of citizens. Access
 to piped water through household connections has decreased, and the postconstruction
 functionality of water points and schemes remains low. Throughout Nigeria, nongovernmental
 organizations (NGOs), development partners, and the informal-private sector are directly
 involved in the production and provision of water services in both urban and rural areas. An
 overview of citizens’ strategies for navigating this landscape to access water in Bauchi City is
 provided in chapter 9.



 Governance Architecture for Publicly
 Provided Water Supply
 The following explores the organizational and institutional architecture of publicly provided
 water, as well as how these systems function in practice. It addresses policy, planning, and
 budgeting; financing; and tariff setting and collection functions; as well as human resource
 management, oversight, and accountability. As much as possible, each subsection describes
 de jure arrangements followed by a discussion of their de facto operation.


 Policy, Planning, and Budgeting for Urban and Rural Water
 Federal and state governments are both assigned a role in policy making. The FMWR is
 responsible for leading the formulation of national policy and strategy advice for the public
 provision of water. It is up to each state to adopt and implement national legislation and policy,
 as well as to decide on the institutional framework for delivering services. The National Council
 on Water Resources (NCWR) is the highest water resources policy formulating body, chaired by
 the FMWR with representatives from the Federal Ministry of Environment and all commissioners
 for state governments.7 State Ministries of Water Resources are responsible for policy,
 regulation, and monitoring—though not all states have a stand-alone ministry of water resources
 (e.g., the Rivers State Ministry of Water Resources and Rural Development [RSWRRD] in Rivers
 State). Thus, while certain structures and policies related to water supply prevail throughout the
 country, there is a great deal of variation in the management and provision of water across
 jurisdictions (World Bank 2015b).

 Federal, state, and local governments are responsible for their own planning and budgeting,
 and each plays a role in financing capital and recurrent expenditures in the water sector.
 Federal planning and budgeting processes are described in chapter 8. States are responsible
 for managing their public finances ‘to deliver services required for meeting the development
 needs of the state including for urban and rural water supply (World Bank 2011a). The federal

      government does not set targets or provide guidance to states regarding the level of resource
      allocation to water services, nor is there a national policy on tariffs.8 In line with states’
      institutional framework for public financial management, most have clear budget calendars
      that include time for consultation between the State Ministry of Budget and Planning and
      line ministries on sector needs and priorities. Once prepared, the budget is to be submitted by
      the governor to the State House of Assembly for approval. Limited information on the de jure
      arrangements for planning and budgeting at the local government level is available.

      With regard to policy making in the water sector, a key point of consideration is the prevalence
      of reform signaling rather than implementation. World Bank (2015a) finds that government and
      development partner efforts to improve the institutional environment for water service delivery
      have primarily focused on developing formal policies and governance frameworks. Many draft
      national laws, policies, and strategies for public water provision have not been officially adopted
      or approved through appropriate channels. For example, the Draft National Water Resources
      Bill April 2007 has not yet been passed into legislation, while others, such as the Water Supply
      Investment Mobilization and Application Guidelines (WIMAG) have not yet been approved.
      Further, once approved, formal policies have not automatically resulted in changes to how
      systems for water service delivery function in practice (see chapter 9 on Bauchi).

      An additional consideration is that planning and budgeting processes for the water sector are
      not well coordinated between tiers of government. The degree of state autonomy in Nigeria’s
      federal system contributes to a diverse institutional landscape and a challenging context for
      the implementation of national programs. Coordination is particularly difficult given the
      number of actors contributing to the construction and maintenance of water infrastructure,
      and their diverse priorities and incentives for allocating resources to the sector. The desire
      to deliver services to constituents is a powerful incentive that can lead actors to bypass
      normal sector planning processes. For example, at the federal level, when the budget is sent
      to the legislature for approval, members of Parliament add constituency development projects
      for their districts that are not selected based on stated FMWR or SMWR priorities. New
      infrastructure projects are particularly visible to constituents, possibly contributing to a bias
      toward new (and often nonfunctional) construction, rather than carrying out maintenance on
      existing infrastructure.

      At the state level, the Executive Council is one of the main de facto mechanisms for policy,
      planning, and budgeting for service delivery sectors (World Bank 2011a). The council is
      chaired by the governor and composed of commissioners serving in the states’ executive
      branch (heads of state ministries). For states surveyed, World Bank (2011a) finds that
      commissioners for water resources management regularly participated in these meetings. No
      other water sector coordination mechanisms were in place. Similar to that on the federal
      level, the budget prepared by the Federal Ministry of Budget and Planning with inputs from
      ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs), is also typically amended during the legislative
      approval process to accommodate legislators, adding specific projects for their home areas
      without necessarily aligning to identified sector needs (World Bank 2011b). Further, a 2011
      state PEFA assessment of select state governments identified failure to budget for the
      recurrent costs (i.e., operation and maintenance) associated with capital investments. Limited
      information on the de facto processes for planning and budgeting at the local government
      level is available.


      Financing Urban and Rural Water
      According to the 2000 Water Supply and Sanitation Services (WSS) policy, financing urban and
      rural water is shared between tiers of government; in practice, federal, state, and local
      governments, as well as NGOs, communities, and development partners play a role. Accurate
      data reflecting the actual share of expenditure on capital investments and recurrent costs
      across these actors are unavailable. However, the NWSS (2015) data reflecting the sponsorship of
      water points and schemes in Nigeria may provide a notional idea of the distribution (see table 7.1).

  Note: CBO = community-based organization; LGA = local government area; NGO = nongovernmental organization; n.a. = not applicable.


 As discussed in chapter 6, nationally, around 25 percent of water points and 29 percent of
 water schemes in Nigeria are sponsored by the federal government; around 30 percent of water
 points and 42 percent of water schemes were sponsored by state governments. Local
 governments sponsored close to a quarter of water points and 12 percent of water schemes.
 The share of water infrastructure sponsored by each actor varies significantly by state.9

 The level and efficiency of public expenditure in the water sector is low. Capital expenditure by
 the federal government and states was close to 0.28 percent of GDP         , which is lower than
 regional levels. Further, a large share of construction projects are never started or fully
 completed, and only 85 percent of completed projects are rated as satisfactory. These issues
 are discussed in detail in chapter 8.

 At the subnational level, state public investment management is weak. The 2011 PEFA
 documents low execution rates for state capital budgets; at the same time, capital expenditures
 represent a larger share of actual state spending on water supply than recurrent costs. The
 2011 PEFA finds that the procurement and management of capital investments was centralized,
 with the governor directly responsible for decision making on large and medium contracts.
 As the report describes, the “Governor personally selected the contractors under main projects,
 monitored their performance and authorized their payments. Fully competitive bidding was
 uncommon.” (World Bank 2011b).

 For urban water, state governments rather than SWAs take the lead on capital investments,
 “providing the necessary permissions to proceed, approving the design and financial plans,
 managing the bidding process, supervision of projects, commissioning the investment and
 transferring it to the SWA.” (World Bank 2011b). A 2015 World Bank performance assessment
 of utilities finds that 71 percent of SWAs had prepared investment plans and 77 percent had
 prepared feasibility studies or design documents for capital projects, even if resources to fulfill
 them were unavailable.

 State expenditure on water supply is impacted by the low credibility of state budgets and
 discretionary cash rationing (World Bank 2011b). As noted previously, states rely on
 intergovernmental transfers from the federal government to finance their budget. Difficulty in
 predicting the amount and timing of these transfers leads to a mismatch between the approved
 budget and the actual available resources. The resulting need for cash rationing introduces
 scope for discretionary decision making with regard to expenditure priorities, centralized in the
 governor’s office or with key advisors. In-year adjustments are typically made without formally
 updating the budget. Low budget credibility limits the MDAs’ ability to predict the availability of
 funds against the approved budget. Data from the Nigeria States’ Fiscal Database indicate that
 the average actual state expenditure for Housing and Community Affairs (which includes water
 supply) ranged from 46 percent to 62 percent of the approved budget between 2008 and 2013.

 For local governments, a key issue is whether federal transfers reach local government accounts.
 Intergovernmental transfers to local governments flow from the federal level to states, which—
 in principle—are expected to release funds to the LGAs. A key issue is that federal transfers
 do not always reach local governments. There is a great deal of variation in the public financial
 management arrangements between states and LGAs across the country, as well as limited
 transparency in how these arrangements work in practice. The 2011 PEFA finds indications


A Wake Up Call	                                                                                                                              91
      that states withheld significant amounts of funds due to local governments, using them for
      common projects and the direct payment of civil servants and teachers employed by LGAs
      (World Bank 2011b).

      A key area to investigate further is the role of community-based water, sanitation and hygiene
      committees (WASHCOMS). Communities (through WASHCOMs) are expected to contribute to
      financing the operation and maintenance costs of rural water. As described in chapter 6, the
      failure rate of water points maintained by WASHCOMS is lower than those maintained by local
      mechanics, government agencies, and donors or NGOs. WASHCOMs are present for 34 percent
      of water schemes, and schemes in which WASHCOMS are present are less likely to fail than
      when they are not present. How communities play a role in practice—including how they access
      and manage finance—will remain unclear without additional fieldwork.


      Tariff Setting and Collection in Urban Water

      Tariff setting is a state government function. The ways that tariff structures are developed vary
      by state, and it is not clear who has responsibility for reviewing them. The World Bank (2015a)
      performance assessment found that in practice, SWAs do not have the power to set tariffs, nor
      do they regularly review them. Of the SWAs surveyed, 46 percent reported that tariffs had not
      been reviewed in the last four years, and 29 percent had not been reviewed in four or more
      years (Lewis and Watts 2015).

      Legally, state water agencies have authority to collect tariffs from customers for water
      consumption, and this is a potentially important source of internally generated revenue for
      state governments. Tariff collection practices vary by state, and nonrevenue water remains a
      challenge across the country. In some cases, SWAs directly collect tariffs; World Bank (2015a)
      finds that 51 percent of SWAs issue bills. In other cases, the state government or SWB
      collects tariffs on behalf of the utility. SWAs not issuing bills reported that they were
      compensated by state governments (Lewis and Watts 2015). A significant number of illegal
      connections and ineffective billing systems have contributed to high rates of nonrevenue
      water. Data suggests that the top 20 percent of SWAs collected between US$0.80 and
      US$0.90 per cubic meter sold between 2011 and 2014; the middle 60 percent collected
      roughly US$0.20; and the bottom 20 percent collected US$0. Operational cost recovery is
      close to the African regional average for the top 20 percent of SWAs, but near zero for the
      bottom 20 percent.

      Most state governments finance SWA operations, expenses, and salaries, partially compensating
      for low tariff collection.10 This appears to contribute to a context in which SWAs’ autonomy from
      the SMWR is constrained. According to the 2015 performance assessment, “almost 50 percent
      of SWAs (17 of 35) do not have the authority to decide how to allocate their revenue, and only
      26 percent (9) have discretion on how to spend money in their accounts. For the other 8, the
      decision is made jointly by the SWA and the state government.” (Macheve et al. 2015).


      Human Resource Management, Monitoring, and Accountability
      Broadly, the human resources required to manage Nigeria’s water resources are available
      within the country, though these resources are not evenly distributed. For example, the
      absence of skilled workers in rural regions has been identified as a key constraint.11 There
      are strategies aimed at investing in the human capital of governments in charge of sanitation
      and drinking water, as well as plans to help cover remaining gaps in the distribution of human
      resources for these sectors.12 A recent UNICEF multistakeholder analysis of binding
      constraints in the water sector reveals that although a federal strategy exists to identify and
      better manage human resource problems and capacity gaps, it is not being implemented
      (UNICEF 2016). Findings suggest that political interference in employment processes is a key
      bottleneck (UNICEF 2016).

 In urban water, arrangements for human resource management create complex lines of
 accountability for performance. Arrangements for managing State Water Agency staff vary.
 In principle, SWAs established as corporations have more autonomy over the management
 of their staff than those that were not. In practice, for most states, SWA staff members are
 civil servants appointed and dismissed by their respective state governments according to
 the rules and policies that govern the civil service. Twenty-three percent of SWAs had no
 autonomy to hire staff, and only 19 percent were consulted when new staff were being hired.
 To some extent, the fact that SWAs’ human resource management is carried out by state
 governments limits their ability to manage or better incentivize the performance of their
 employees.13

 Daily management of the SWA is carried out by a general manager appointed by and
 accountable to the SWB. Formally, SWA boards have the authority to appoint the general
 manager, though in practice, the process is influenced by the governor. On average, general
 managers change once every three years. While boards have the authority to dismiss
 general managers, this has only happened once—with the remaining turnover related to staff
 reaching retirement age. Where they exist, the SWBs comprise government and political
 appointees; 2015 data reflect that consumers were represented on only three SWA boards
 and the private sector on only eight.

 The availability of reliable data to inform decision making, manage performance, and contribute
 toward greater public accountability is limited. As described in Lewis and Watts (2015),
 government data in Nigeria are “often inadequate, frequently ambiguous and contradictory, and
 sometimes virtually nonexistent.” Systems for regular service monitoring of the water sector
 are in the design phase, with data on service delivery still collected in an ad hoc manner, and
 many indicators fail to capture necessary information.

 At the federal level, the National Water Resources Institute is tasked with providing training
 and education, data collection, and dissemination services in the field of water resources
 development. Within the FMWR, there has been some traction with regard to collecting
 information on the functionality of water points and schemes. For example, this report has
 used data from the 2015 NNWSS, which were collected by the FMWRM in 2015. Yet more
 refined data are needed. For instance, the NWSS suffered from duplicate observations and
 a number of other inconsistencies. There are a number of constraints with regard to the
 quality, timeliness, and availability of data on public accounts and national finances, thus
 making it difficult to understand the volume and efficiency of expenditure in the water
 sector.14

 For urban water, SWAs are expected to collect and monitor customer data and be responsive
 to end users, though the actual collection and use of data by SWAs is mixed. Overall, 97 percent
 of SWA customer databases maintain information on billing, and 91 percent maintain
 information on collection and disconnection due to nonpayment. Only 37 percent collected
 information to assist in targeting their services to the poor (World Bank 2015b). Reporting on
 water quality varies between regions. For example, 87 percent of SWAs in the South South
 region reported such information, while no SWA in the South East did so (World Bank 2015b).
 In 2015, 26 SWAs reported having customer relations departments, and a further eight had
 staff assigned to manage customer relations. Only 6 percent of SWAs reported having no
 system in place for customers to rectify billing errors. Yet, despite the existence of customer-
 oriented systems, evidence suggests that such systems are not effectively used to improve
 performance (World Bank 2015b).

 Public access to information on urban water is limited. On average, 40 percent of SWAs publish
 tariff revisions in the local media, 40 percent hold public hearings on major investment projects,
 and 39 percent disclose water monitoring reports (World Bank 2015b). Yet there is variation
 across the SWAs.15 Lack of transparency regarding approved state budgets and funding flows
 further constrains public scrutiny (no state government has presented audited accounts more
 recently than 2013).


A Wake Up Call	                                                                                       93
      A key challenge in rural water supply is information asymmetry with regard to the quality of
      services provided by drilling contractors and monitored by MDAs. The need for specialized
      skills to construct boreholes means that neither water users nor government actors are easily
      able to discern whether a newly constructed borehole is providing high-quality water or whether
      the water supply will be sustained long-term. This means that government regulation of
      borehole construction is often difficult and ineffective, and service users in rural areas are
      unable to hold contractors or the state accountable. Where government monitoring of rural
      water takes place, the data collected provide information on the number of water points
      constructed, rather than on the quality of service provided. This means that important
      information on water provision is not collected, and hence state expenditure on rural water is
      made according to the number of water points constructed rather than the actual quality of
      the service provided.

      Moreover, rural citizens have little power or influence over politicians and public provision, and
      politicians are not elected on the quality of water services. In addition, while the construction
      of new water points may be perceived by citizens as a visible improvement to their locality,
      improvements to water quality and water point maintenance are less visible to users. As such,
      these improvements are more difficult to achieve and there is little for local politicians to gain
      in addressing such systemic problems. Instead, local politicians have more to gain financially,
      or in reputation, from the construction of additional water points. This may contribute to the
      pattern of “build, neglect, and rebuild” noted in chapter 6.



      Emerging Issues and Strategies for Reform
      This chapter provides a first look at the incentives and institutional arrangements that contribute
      to the status quo in the water sector. In particular, the following are emerging findings:

        ••   Nigeria’s federal system contributes to a diverse institutional landscape for the water
             sector and a challenging context for the implementation of national programs. Due to the
             assignment of functions and how they are taken up in practice, multiple government
             agencies engage in the production and provision of water. Coordination of planning and
             budgeting is particularly challenging given the number of actors, as well as their diverse
             incentives and priorities for allocating resources to the sector.

        ••   Reform signaling rather than implementation is common in the water sector. Many draft
             national laws, policies, and strategies for public water provision have not been officially
             adopted or approved through appropriate channels. Further, once approved, formal
             policies have not automatically resulted in changes to how systems for water service
             delivery function in practice.

        ••   At the state level, low budget credibility, discretionary cash rationing, and weak public
             investment management centralized in governors’ offices impacts the quality of expenditure
             in water. The quality of expenditure is further hampered by unclear fiscal arrangements
             between LGAs and states, and limited LGA autonomy over fiscal and human resources
             (impacting rural water in particular).

        ••   SWAs exercise limited autonomy over fiscal and human resources. SWAs that have been
             established as state-owned corporations have a degree of autonomy on paper. Yet,
             even for these agencies, the collection of tariffs remains low, leaving SWAs dependent
             on state governments to finance their operations, expenses, and salaries. Further,
             arrangements for human resource management create complex lines of accountability
             for performance.

        ••   Consistent and reliable data to inform decision making and performance management, as
             well as to contribute toward greater public accountability, are limited.

 Further emerging strategies for improving the quality and access of water supply to citizens
 include the following:

    ••    Recognize the diversity and complexity of the federal system. Seek flexible solutions that
          can adapt to a diverse political and institutional environment; align the incentives of
          federal, state, and local actors; and invest in communication and coordination between
          tiers of government.

    ••    Acknowledge and close the implementation gap. A focus on the policy environment alone
          has not automatically resulted in better performance. Seek opportunities to reward
          performance rather than inputs, and form rather than function. Focus on locally identified
          solutions to locally identified problems. Support small but concrete improvements to
          build confidence, gain momentum, and build a constituency for more difficult reforms
          (see box 7.2).

    ••    In the short term, seek options that are robust—even within existing political-institutional
          constraints—while at the same time seeking improvements that gradually shift the system
          to a higher equilibrium over time. For example, given the stickiness of the existing
          institutional environment, seek options for improving the quality and lowering the cost of
          self-supply through the informal sector. At the same time, target the long-run objective of
          building trust in publicly provided water through concrete improvements in SWA performance.

    ••    Tackle governance issues through multisector engagement. For areas in which the water
          sector is impacted by cross-cutting governance issues—such as the implementation of
          national programs, state and public financial management practices, and fiscal
          arrangements between local governments and state governments—policy makers




         Box 7.2: Improving Public Sector Provision in Kaduna—Navigating
         Political Economy Dynamics for Reform

         Hima and Santibanez (2015) and World Bank (2015a) highlight how numerous water
         sector reforms and policies have failed to be implemented, and suggest reasons for
         why those benefiting from the current status quo lack incentives to fundamentally
         change these institutional arrangements. Yet there are certain state governments
         and public sector agencies within the Nigerian bureaucracy that function comparatively
         well. At the state level, Kaduna State shows signs of improved public water provision.
         In this state, the SWA had slowly been improving its water services to the residents,
         progressively building an expectation of reasonable water supply standards.

         When state governor appointed a new general manager of the SWA, service quality
         deteriorated and users became frustrated with the state water service. Senior
         management within the SWA was able to use the momentum from this public
         dissatisfaction, as well as clear data on the SWA’s worsening performance, to
         persuade the state governor to back reform within the SWA and increase its autonomy
         to collect revenues (World Bank Nigeria 2015). This example demonstrates that
         politically unpopular reforms—such as providing greater autonomy to state water
         agencies to collect tariffs—can become politically feasible when citizens’ expectations
         of water services have progressively increased, and when the logic of reform can be
         effectively communicated by bureaucrats to political leadership.

            should consider multisector engagement that jointly addresses technical and institutional
            issues. Solutions may be cross-cutting (e.g., focused on state public investment
            management [PIM]) or may consider the water sector as an entry point for strengthening
            the overall context (i.e., can improvements be made in PIM for state-level water projects,
            which can then be leveraged to create more systematic cross-sector changes?).

           by the World Bank to inform its engagements in Nigeria. For a more detailed overview of
           the national political economy, see Lewis and Watts (2015).

           Water Sector Reform Project, Nigeria’s response to Ebola, infrastructure development in
           Edo State, and the Nigeria FADAMA National Development Series.
      	 4.	Three states have adopted legislation establishing (de jure) independent regulation of
           water supply as provided in their respective water laws: Kaduna (2016), Lagos (2004), and
           Rivers States (2012). As of 2017, Lagos and Rivers States have established an
           independent regulator (in 2012), though evidence suggests these agencies have not been
           able to take up their assigned functions in practice. In some states, the State Ministry of
           Water Resource Management (SMWRM) serves as the regulator. As discussed in chapter
           9, in Bauchi, the Bauchi State water law calls for a performance contract between the
           State Ministry of Water Resources and the SWA, but this has yet to be implemented.
           At national level, the FMWR is not performing any regulatory functions.
      	5.	Some issues are shared, but these are owned by state governments (World Bank
           2011b).
      	6.	 A widely recognized definition is as follows: “Small towns are settlements that are
           sufficiently large and dense to benefit from the economies of scale offered by piped water
           supply systems, but too small and dispersed to be efficiently managed by a conventional
           urban water agency. They require formal management arrangements, a legal basis for
           ownership and management, and the ability to expand services to meet the growing
           demand for water. Small towns usually have populations between 5,000 and 50,000
           inhabitants, but can be larger or smaller.” (Roche 2000)
      	 7.	World Bank (2011b) finds that the NCWR met regularly and was attended by technical
           managers and professionals, as well as by State Commissioners for Water Resource
           Management. While this federal institution was regarded as providing a useful platform for
           setting out and generating plans to respond to national challenges, responsibility for the
           uptake and implementation of these plans was up to state-level actors and typically did not
           occur.
      	 8.	While there is no national tariff policy, “the 2004 National Water Policy updated in 2009,
           repeats the ‘affordability’ criterion and adds that operators should be allowed to raise
           revenue to allow them to break even financially.” Bauchi State has a tariff policy in place,
           which was seen as one of the key achievements recorded in the three years of the SUWASA
           project implementation in the state (SUWASA 2011).
      	 9.	For example, the share of water points sponsored by the federal government is as high
           as 52 percent (Taraba) and as low as 8 percent (Jigawa). The share of water schemes
           sponsored by the federal government ranges from 11 percent (Cross River) to zero
           (Ekiti and Lagos). For local governments, the share of water points sponsored varies from
           54 percent (Jigawa) to 3 percent in Enugu. The share of water schemes ranges from
           27 percent in the FCT to zero in a number of states (Ekiti, Akwa Ibom, Benue, Edo, Enugu,
           Kwara, Cross River, and Taraba).

 WASH Public Expenditure
 Review

                                          Key Takeaways

    •	 Nigeria needs to spend more—at least three times more than it does today. Capital
        expenditure was close to 0.28 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)—that is
        lower than regional levels (0.7 percent of GDP). This figure is particularly troubling,
        since recent estimates suggest that Nigeria must invest 1.7 percent of its GDP to
        achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs). These figures for Nigeria are
        equivalent to US$8 billion.
    •	 Nigeria also needs to spend more efficiently. For instance, 44 percent of borehole
        construction projects are never started, and only 37 percent of borehole projects are
        fully completed. The proportion is even smaller for dam and canal projects: only 10
        percent and 5 percent of projects, respectively, are completed. Fifteen 15 percent of
        completed projects are rated unsatisfactory.




 Background and Overview of Budget Cycle
 The primary objective of this chapter is to analyze the recent fiscal developments in Nigeria’s
 water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector within the context of a broad infrastructure
 investment program for growth and poverty reduction. The overarching task is to offer insights
 on how to finance public investment within a challenging macrofiscal context, given the Nigerian
 government’s lack of access to resources and poor efficiency of public expenditure. The broader
 aim is to offer initial insight to help the Nigerian government map-out plans to attain the SDGs
 for WASH.

 As discussed in chapter 7, formal responsibility for the provision and production of water
 services sits with state and local governments. The federal government is responsible for
 managing water resources, as well as leading the formulation of national policy and strategy
 for public provision of water. However, the federal government often intervenes, directly financing
 investments, to increase water access.1 The Federal Ministry of Water Resources (FMWR) is
 the primary agency in charge of WASH activities at the national level. State spending constitutes
 50 percent of consolidated government expenditure.

 At the federal level, the budget process follows four main stages: drafting, legislative approval,
 implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. Usually, the budget process begins in June of
 the year preceding the new fiscal year, with a request from the Federal Ministry of Finance
 (FMoF)2 to the various ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) of the federal government
 to send in their expenditure proposals with estimated budget plans and targets.3,4 In the
 proposals, MDAs link their spending programs to the medium-term development priorities of

       the government, as set out in the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The MTEF,
       which is prepared every three years, includes government policies and revenue and expenditure
       projections, as well as the strategic development priorities of the federal government in the
       coming fiscal years. By October of the preceding year, a draft bill is prepared by the FMoF and
       sent to the presidency, which in turn sends it to the National Assembly. On approval of the
       budget by the National Assembly, the president signs the bill into law, called the Appropriation
       Act. The signing of the budget into law paves the way for the actual implementation of the
       budget (CSEA 2010).

       Every year, the National Assembly defines the project responsibilities of MDAs and civil service
       organizations. These include construction projects (e.g., boreholes, buildings, roads and
       canals) as well as nonconstruction projects (e.g., procurement, training, and advocacy). Many
       civil service organizations overlap in the policy projects they cover. For example, small-scale
       dams are constructed by the federal ministries of water, agriculture, and environment and all
       the River Basin Development Authorities (RBDAs). Therefore, the delivery of the same project
       type varies depending on the incentive structures in place for bureaucrats in the specific
       organization responsible for each project, holding constant other project and organizational
       characteristics (Rasul and Rogger 2016).

       The National Assembly is primarily responsible for assigning projects to organizations (MDAs
       and RBDAs) and enacts a budget law specifying the projects to be implemented each fiscal
       year. The projects are all established in law through the budget appropriation bills. The
       passage of the bill includes inputs from the executive branch, and ample involvement from
       sectoral committees within the legislative body. This unified budget is then voted on by both
       houses and introduced as the Budget Appropriation Act. This legal document defines the
       responsibilities of civil service organizations in terms of projects to be delivered (Rasul and
       Rogger 2016).

       Nigeria’s budget process is comprised of fragmented and complex institutional arrangements,
       with the FMoF only controlling part of the process.5,6 The 2007 Fiscal Responsibility and Public
       Procurement Acts sought to strengthen institutional arrangements for the management of
       fiscal funds and procurement processes, but these have been implemented only to a limited
       extent. The legal provisions guaranteeing the autonomy of the auditor general’s function are
       also relatively weak (OPM 2015).

       Moreover, current legal provisions provide the National Assembly with sweeping investigative
       powers, but they do not provide a strong role for the external audit function. The Fiscal
       Responsibility Commission also has considerable legal powers that are not currently being
       exercised. The auditor general is seeking to modernize and strengthen the role of his office
       through, among other measures, securing the right to make audit reports available directly to
       the public, rather than through the National Assembly. The adoption of the Freedom of
       Information law in 2011 was aimed at increasing access to fiscal information (OPM 2015).

       The process of National Assembly scrutiny and conflict between the executive and legislative
       branches often result in the expansion of budgeted expenditures, and long and unpredictable
       delays in budget approval. Moreover, constitutional and legal arrangements around the role of
       the National Assembly in the budget process are vague, and significant expenditures are not
       included in either the federal or state budgets (OPM 2015).

       Budget implementation is conducted by various MDAs of the federal government. On a quarterly
       basis, funds for capital projects are released to the relevant MDAs based on allocations in the
       federal budget, with revenues obtained from the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF). Since
       2005, the FMoF has instituted a Cash Management Committee to ensure that funds are
       available to enable smooth financing of the government budget and thus reduce both
       discretionary borrowing from the overdraft (Ways and Means) account of the Central Bank of

      Box 8.1: Data Restrictions

      Several strategic government agencies, such as the FMoF, Budget Office of the
      Federation (BOF), National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), NPC, and the Central Bank of
      Nigeria (CBN) regularly publish reports and provide data and information on social
      services such as health, education, and water that can be freely accessed by
      members of the public from their official archives, or downloaded from official
      websites. However, there are severe constraints regarding the quality, timeliness,
      and availability of data on public accounts and national finances in Nigeria. These
      weaknesses are further aggravated by the absence of a constitutional provision that
      guarantees free access of Nigerian citizens to data on the budget and national
      revenues. Public oversight at the subnational level is even more obscure, since state
      governors retain enormous control over revenue utilization, and thus, the allocation
      of state patronage. The federal government has recently adopted a Freedom of
      Information Law (2011); this may eventually contribute to greater budget transparency.
      The law does not contain any provisions specific to fiscal information, though in
      principle, it enables requests for information to be made. However, focus group
      discussions with journalists suggest that as of mid-2013, such requests for
      information remain cumbersome and often ultimately go unfulfilled. Yet, there is
      some sign of increased public and civil society engagement with fiscal issues.

 Findings
 Challenges in Access to Water, Sanitation, and
 Hygiene Services
 A significant constraint to accessing WASH in Nigeria is lack of financial resources. Federal and
 state government budget allocations to the sector are insufficient to tackle the infrastructure
 deficiencies of the sector. Given the decline in oil prices since June 2014 and reduction of
 domestic oil production in 2016, government revenue has decreased significantly, evincing the
 difficult fiscal position of both federal and state governments. In particular, many state
 governments have suffered from insufficient funds to cover recurrent expenditure, such as
 salaries or pensions, and have accumulated arrears. Thus, a focus on increasing the efficiency
 of public expenditure within a context of declining fiscal resources will be critical.

 Information and data in the area of financing and expenditure are difficult to acquire, given
 that most agencies are usually reluctant to release accurate data. The following section
 provides an analysis of public expenditure in the water, and, to a lesser degree, of the
 sanitation sector in Nigeria, based on the limited information gathered from the following
 sources: the 2010 report of the Center for the Studies of Economies of Africa (CSEA), the
 CBN Annual Economic Reports (2007–14), the Nigeria States’ Fiscal Database, and the World
 Development Indicators (WDI).



A Wake Up Call	                                                                                      101
       Federal and State Governments’ Total Expenditure
       in the Water Sector
       The Nigerian government invested close to US$1 billion per year between 2006 and 2010 in
       the water sector (see figure 8.1).8 Despite assignment of primary responsibility for water
       services to subnational governments, the largest share of the total water expenditure was
       initially executed by the federal government (2006). In 2007, the share of total water expenditure
       for federal and state governments was basically the same. More recently, from 2008–10, public
       expenditure on water has become more unevenly distributed with an average of 0.13 percent
       spent by the federal and 0.27 percent by state governments during that period (figure 8.1).
       There is evidence to suggest that some local governments also spend resources on water
       supply, though their contribution is believed to be quite low. There is insufficient expenditure
       data to provide a more accurate picture of local government area (LGA) spending.

       Between 2006 and 2010, total expenditure in the sector averaged 0.47 percent of GDP     , with
       capital expenditure averaging 0.32 percent of GDP and recurrent expenditure averaging
       0.15  percent (figure 8.2). As shown in figure 8.2, during this period, total government
       expenditure on water has been mostly driven by capital expenditure, but has been insufficient
       to meet infrastructure needs. The federal government’s total expenditure in water dropped
       from US$607.5 million in 2006 to US$136.2 million in 2009, a reduction of almost 80 percent
       in three years (figure 8.3). During the same period, the states government’s total expenditure
       in water raised from US$411 million in 2006 to US$670 million in 2009, an increase of
       63 percent in three years (figure 8.5).

       Figure 8.2 reflects a decline in the total water expenditure as a percentage of GDP in 2010.
       This is explained by the increase in GDP from 2009 to 2010: while the nominal total expenditure

 in water grew from US$806.5 million in 2009 to $1,010.6 million in 2010, the Nigerian GDP
 more than doubled—from US$169.48 million in 2009 to US$369.06 million in 2010.
 Therefore, while expenditure on water increased in absolute terms during this time period,
 given the large increases in the Nigerian GDP between 2009 and 2010, expenditure as a
 percentage of GDP actually shrunk.

 Nigeria’s capital investments in WASH are insufficient. Between 2006 and 2010, Nigeria’s
 investment in capital expenditure has been on average around 0.32 percent of its GDP
 (see figure 8.2), which is lower than regional levels (0.7 percent). This falls short of what is
 needed for the country to reach the SDGs (Foster and Briceño-Garmendia 2010). Moreover,
 figures 8.3 and 8.4 show that the federal government has greater levels of capital
 expenditure than recurrent expenditure. This stands in sharp contrast with the state
 governments’ expenditure on water, in which there is a more even distribution between
 capital and recurrent expenditures (see figures 8.5 and 8.6). Though to some extent, higher
 recurrent expenditure in the water sector is to be expected at state levels, given that they
 are assigned a greater role in the maintenance of infrastructure and in employing frontline
 staff. Between 2006 and 2010, the federal government’s average total expenditure in the
 water sector amounted to around 0.21 percent of GDP (see figure 8.4), with average capital
 expenditure at around 0.18 percent, and the average recurrent expenditure representing
 only 0.02 percent of GDP  .

 The investment needed for Africa to achieve the SDGs for WASH is estimated at around US$37
 billion a year, or around 2 percentage points of the regional GDP per year. Limited investment
 in the sector will make it impossible to achieve the SDGs. Recent estimates produced by the
 World Bank show that the investment needed for Nigeria to achieve the SDG for WASH is
 equivalent to US$8 billion,9 or 1.7 percentage points of GDP per year. Nigeria is among the

       State Governments’ Recurrent, Capital, and Total
       Expenditure in Water Supply
       State governments spend close to half a billion dollars per year in the WASH sector. Looking
       at a larger set of time series data for state government expenditures from 2003 to 2014, we
       see that the amount of expenditure on water supply has gradually increased over time,
       sometimes more than tripling its 2003 value, and averaging around US$470 million from 2010
       to 2014. Whether this trend has continued given the post-2014 decline in government revenue
       is unclear, given the absence of data from 2015 and 2016.

       Moreover, the share of expenditure on water is more or less equally split between capital and
       recurrent expenditure (figures 8.5 and 8.6). This stands in contrast to federal expenditure,
       which is mostly driven by capital investments (figures 8.3 and 8.4). Between 2003 and 2014,
       the average total capital expenditure for state governments in the water sector was around
       0.11 percent, and the average recurrent expenditure represented 0.10 percent of GDP
       (see figure 8.6).

       The average total expenditure of the state governments in the water sector between 2006 and
       2010 amounted to 0.26 percent of GDP (figure 8.7). Average capital expenditure was around

 rural areas and most lack sanitation services.10 In 2014, 81 percent of WASH funding went to
 urban areas, and only 19 percent was destined for rural areas. Moreover, in 2014, 96 percent
 of WASH expenditure went to drinking water services, and only 4 percent was devoted to
 sanitation services (see figure 8.10, panels a and b). A more equal distribution of services
 between urban and rural areas, and between drinking water and improved sanitation services,
 is required to help address some of the equity issues surrounding access to WASH services in
 Nigeria.


 Federal and State Governments’ Total Expenditure in Education,
 Health, and Water
 When comparing water sector expenditure with other service delivery sectors, water expenditure
 accounts for a smaller share of the GDP than the share of both education and health
 (see figure 8.8). The percentage of water expenditure is about half of what both federal and
 state governments spend on health, and almost a fourth of what they spend on education.11

       Budget Execution and Efficiency of Public Expenditure
       Execution of the Federal budget often suffers from significant delays and deviations. The budget
       system provides a high degree of discretion to the Accountant General’s Office. In particular,
       problems with timely budget approvals and cash management during budget execution affect
       capital budgets, with recurrent spending generally being favored.12 Moreover, approved budget
       heads are often not equivalent to the amount of funds being made available to MDAs with
       certainty. Furthermore, two factors in the budget cycle often complicate its execution further:
       (a) the FMoF has to issue expenditure warrants, which in principle have to be completed on a
       quarterly basis; (b) and the Accountant General issues mandates to the Central Bank of Nigeria
       (CBN) to credit the accounts of MDAs, and issues letters of Authority to Incur Expenditure (AIEs)
       to MDAs. Shortfalls in revenues often lead to cash rationing and delays in budget execution.

       The process for planning and budgeting at the state level is described in detail in chapter 7.
       Planning and budgeting processes for the water sector are not well coordinated between tiers
       of government. A further issue is that credibility of state budgets is low, with spending agencies
       typically receiving lower allocations than set out in the approved budget. Execution is
       characterized by discretionary cash rationing, at least partly driven by dependence on
       unpredictable transfers from the federal government. Limited information on the processes for
       planning and budgeting at the local government level is available.

       Overall, the data on Housing and Community Affairs show that the state budget execution rate
       for the period 2008–13 averaged at around 50 percent. Although there are no data that focus
       solely on state expenditure on water supply, the housing and community affairs expenditure
       includes water supply expenditure. Figure 8.9 illustrates budget execution rates for housing
       and community affairs by comparing the original budget allocated to projects versus the actual
       expenditure. The graphs show that only half of the original budget allocated for housing and
       community affairs was spent.

 Budget execution rates are low for water supply and sanitation, further constraining the sector.
 Capacity limitations at all administrative levels are among the factors constraining the physical
 implementation of infrastructure and the effective use of the budget.1 As discussed in
 chapter 7, issues that impact budget execution include overly ambitious goals, delays in the
 flow of resources, and lack of transparency in the allocation of resources. At the state level,
 dependence on unpredictable federal transfers and discretionary cash rationing in the
 governors’ office are also key challenges.

 To gain a better sense of the limitations behind budget execution, we considered water project
 completion rates across the country. In 2003 the Nigerian government began a program of
 sweeping reforms across all major government entities (Nkonjo-Iweala and Osafo-Kwaako
 2007), which resulted in the cancellation of US$18 billion of external debt from the Paris Club.
 At the federal level, the annual savings from debt interests were channeled into some social
 programs, and the presidency used this opportunity to track the effectiveness of government
 expenditure. In 2006 and 2007, the Nigerian government embarked on the Overview of Public
 Expenditure (OPEN) in the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS),
 known as the OPEN initiative, in which it traced, by project, the use and impact of 10 percent of
 all federal government social sector expenditures approved in 2006 and 2007 (Rasul and
 Rogger 2016). The projects selected to be part of the OPEN initiative were to be representative
 of existing social sector expenditures, but they were also intended to offer preliminary evidence
 for those projects intended to be scaled-up nationwide (Rasul and Rogger 2016). Under the
 OPEN initiative, expert teams visited public projects to record the extent to which these had
 been implemented as planned under the federal budget. The presidency contracted national
 and regional teams to undertake the monitoring process outside of civil service institutions.

 Table 8.1 offers evidence on a series of characteristics related to water-related project
 completion rates, by type of project. It considers water-related projects traced under the OPEN
 initiative that were approved in the 2006–07 federal budgets. Boreholes are the most
 common projects, covering 29 percent of the OPEN projects. Most projects, including water-
 related projects, are implemented by a wide range of organizations. For example, there are
 18 different civil service organizations building boreholes. Boreholes constitute most of the
 basic elements of rural infrastructure development. The size of the budget allocation reflects

                                               Sector in Nigeria

                                               Nigeria’s National Water Supply and Sanitation Policy, approved in 2000, encourages
                                               private-sector participation and envisages institutional and policy reforms at the state
                                               level. However, little has happened in both respects. Only five of the 37 states—
                                               Lagos, Cross River, Enugu, Kaduna, and Ogun—began to introduce PPPs in the form
                                               of service contracts, but the responsibility of the private sector remains separate from
                                               that of the public sector, and is often limited to operating infrastructure. While the
                                               government has adopted a decentralization policy, little actual decentralization has
                                               happened. The capacity of local governments to plan and carry out investments, or to
                                               operate and maintain systems, remains low despite efforts at capacity development.

                                               Given the reduced fiscal capacity of the Nigerian government and the large constraints
                                               it faces in its use of public resources, the government should reconsider turning to
                                               the private sector as an additional source of funding for WASH services.

                                               There are several reasons why the Nigerian government should consider PPPs for the
                                               delivery of WASH services in` the country: (a) PPPs are a way to introduce private
                                               sector technology, innovation, and operational efficiency to public service delivery;
                                               (b)  they impose budgetary certainty by setting present and future costs of
                                               infrastructure projects over time; (c) they are a means for developing local private
                                               sector capabilities through joint ventures with large international firms, as well as
                                               subcontracting opportunities for local firms in areas such as civil works, facilities
                                               management, security services, cleaning services, and maintenance services;

      to increasing levels of private sector participation (especially foreign) in a way that
      facilitates the transfer of important skills; (e) they make the country more competitive
      in terms of its infrastructure base, as well as by giving a boost to businesses and
      industries associated with infrastructure development (e.g., construction, equipment,
      and support services); (f) they supplement limited public sector capacities to meet
      the growing demand for infrastructure development; and (g) they extract long-term
      value-for-money through appropriate risk transfer to the private sector over the life of
      the project–from design and construction to operations and maintenance (O&M).

      Given the many potential benefits of greater integration of the private sector into the
      WASH service delivery, policy makers should more substantially consider the use of
      PPPs for improving the delivery of WASH services throughout Nigeria.




 the scale of the projects. For instance, the median budget for dams is US$18,000, while the
 median budget for a canal is US$347,000. The fact that projects are of relatively small scale
 is part of the reason why multiple organizations are implementing similar projects.

 The proportion of projects for the construction of boreholes that were never started is
 44 percent, and the proportions are even higher for canal and dam projects—70 percent and
 79 percent, respectively. Moreover, only 37 percent of borehole projects are fully completed,
 and the proportion is even smaller for dam and canal projects, in which only 10 percent and
 5 percent, respectively, are completed. While this may point to issues of corruption or passive
 waste, these are not likely to be the only explanations behind the poor quality and quantity of
 public service delivery. As the last column in the table 8.1 shows, the majority of completed
 projects are rated as satisfactory. These numbers imply that there may be important factors at
 the organizational level that explain variation in the quality and quantity of public service
 delivery in Nigeria.


 Concluding Remarks
 The level of expenditure for WASH in Nigeria is low. In particular, capital expenditure (averaging
 0.32 percent of the GDP in the 2006–10 period) has fallen short in comparison to estimates
 for the region (0.7 percent of GDP). Nigeria needs to at least triple its level of capital
 investment in WASH to compare to its well-performing regional counterparts, and thus meet
 the necessary standards to ensure the availability and sustainability of water and sanitation
 for all citizens.

 The efficiency of public expenditure should be enhanced. As illustrated by the poor level of
 budget execution rates, and by the unsatisfactory project completion rates, there is considerable
 space to improve the quality of expenditure of allocated resources; in particular, a deep analysis
 of bottlenecks to public investment management for water and sanitation may reveal areas in
 which institutional bottlenecks can be revealed and institutional capacities strengthened. Given
 the Nigeria’s challenging macrofiscal outlook, state governments in particular need to explore
 ways to increase the resource envelop for water supply. One avenue is to implement an updated
 water pricing and financing structure to allow for a more effective service cost-recovery process,
 and for more substantial budget support to pent-up investment and renewal needs.

       To maximize the provision of quality public service delivery in Nigeria, the government needs to
       ensure that more water and sanitation projects are completed, and that they are completed in
       a satisfactory manner. The current level of investment will certainly limit the likelihood of
       Nigeria achieving the new SDGs for clean water and sanitation. Thus, the government needs to
       find better ways to finance public investment. A larger share of resources focused on WASH
       services, a greater level of efficiency in budget expenditure, and greater integration of the
       private sector into the water and sanitation sectors, are required to help Nigeria move closer
       to achieving the SDGs in water and sanitation.

            Federal Ministry of Budget and National Planning, in charge of producing the 2016 budget
            and a three year (2017–19) budget plan for the country.

            a guaranteed share of revenues is passed to subnational governments, are deeply
            politically entrenched in Nigeria. These arrangements have militated against either the
            linking of fiscal transfers to accountability and performance, or arrangements for stabilising
            revenues in the face of oil price fluctuations (OPM 2015).

            new format, it is still unclear if the processes have been altered or still remain.

            presents for the state governments in 2010, which is US$561 million. In 2013, this
            number is US$432 million and in 2014 it is US$364 million (see figure 8.5).

       11.	Note that the percentage of expenditure on water in this section (0.43 percent) varies with
            that provided in the first section (0.47 percent). The reason is that in the first section, the
            expenditure as a percentage of GDP for each individual year between 2006 and 2010 was
            first computed, and then the average was obtained for the 2006–10 period, whereas in
            this section, the simple average was first computed using the annual dollar quantities
            spent for 2006–10, and then that average was computed into a percentage of the GDP            .
            This method was used for the purposes of this section, since the data obtained for the
            education and health sectors were more limited and not as disaggregated as that for the
            water sector. Therefore, it was easier to compute expenditures and percentages of GDP in
            this manner for the purposes of comparing these three sectors.

 Institutional Landscape for
 Urban Water Supply in
 Bauchi City

                                           Key Takeaways

    •	 Citizens in Bauchi City perceive piped water to be more affordable (on a monthly
        basis) than other sources, piped water is believed to be of good quality, and residents
        would be willing to pay official connection fees to access piped water. However,
        perceived barriers to connecting are high: these include quotes for connection fees
        that are higher than official rates; the need to cover material and labor costs; difficulty
        negotiating access or paying for permission to cross neighboring properties or nearby
        roads; and terrain issues, such as the need to buy and operate booster pumps in
        hilly areas.

    •	 Evidence    points to two distinct areas of policy intervention: strengthening the
        delivery  of publicly provided water, and strengthening the relationship between
        informal water suppliers and the Bauchi State Water and Sewage Corporation
        (BSWSC). Strengthening financial planning and budgeting, as well as budget
        execution, will be crucial to advancing investments in infrastructure. A better
        understanding of the budget cycle—from planning to execution—will uncover key
        bottlenecks for the effective disbursement of the funds allocated by the state
        government to the BSWSC. Improving the strategic allocation and reliability of these
        funds is crucial for improving the BSWSC’s ability to plan and fund future reforms.




 Objectives, Scope, and Methodology
 This chapter illustrates how national challenges play out in a specific state by exploring
 the institutional and organizational landscape for urban water supply in Bauchi City.
 Nigeria is administered through a complex and ever-evolving federal structure, with a
 diverse political and institutional landscape. While certain structures and policies related
 to water supply prevail throughout the country, there is a great deal of variation in the
 management and provision of water across jurisdictions (Macheve et al. 2015). Bauchi
 State performs relatively well compared to other states in Nigeria, and therefore gives an
 indication of the upper bound of what is currently being achieved in the urban water
 sector. Further, it is one of three priority states under the World Bank-supported Third
 National Urban Water Sector Reform Project (2014) and was selected by the Federal
 Ministry of Water Resources (FMWR) for deeper examination.

 The chapter draws on fieldwork carried out in Bauchi City, which aimed to understand the
 institutional bottlenecks to improving publicly provided water; assess the organization and

       dynamics of informal service chains; and identify household willingness to pay for publicly
       provided water. Fieldwork relied on qualitative methods covering well-off areas with relatively
       reliable access to publicly provided water (Anguwan Albasa); poorer unplanned settlements
       (Kandahar); and areas with a mix of formal and informal suppliers (Old Town). Data were
       collected through focus group discussions with households, as well as interviews with informal
       providers and senior officials in the water sector.


       Policy Context and Formal Institutional Architecture
       for Publicly Provided Water
       The Bauchi State Ministry of Water Resources, created in 1996, oversees the two key state
       water agencies, the Bauchi State Water Board (BSWB) and the Bauchi State Rural Water
       Supply and Sanitation Agency. The Ministry of Water Resources is assigned responsibility for
       policy formulation, policy coordination, research and development; it also serves as a liaison
       with the federal, state, and local governments; donor coordination; and similar high-level
       issues. It oversees the functioning of the BSWB and BSWSC and facilitates funding from the
       government.

       The mandate of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (RUWASSA) is the provision of
       water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services to all communities outside the state capital and
       local government headquarters. The staff of the RUWASSA was drawn from the Ministry of
       Water Resources, BSWB, and the Ministry of Rural Development when it was created in 2009.
       The RUWASSA of Bauchi has a strong relationship with eight local governments: it works with
       WASH units of the local government areas (LGAs), and in communities it establishes and
       works with community-based water, sanitation, and hygiene committees (WASHCOMs). In some
       cases, the Bauchi RUWASSA provides boreholes in remote areas of the city if there is no formal
       water supply.

       The BSWB was established in 1998 as the Bauchi State government agency responsible
       for the supply of water for domestic, commercial, and industrial use to all urban areas. The
       2011 Bauchi Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Policy set out the objective of supplying
       potable water to all residents (Bauchi State Government 2011), and the transformation of
       the BSWB into the autonomous, commercially oriented BSWSC began in 2012.

       The Bauchi State Urban Water Sector Law, which came into effect in 2014, formally established
       the BSWSC and outlined its institutional and regulatory framework.1 BSWSC supplies potable
       water to domestic, commercial, and industrial consumers in the urban areas of Bauchi State.
       There are 20 LGAs in the state, and all these LGAs are viewed as urban areas, making BSWSC
       effectively responsible for the supply of water to all the LGAs in the state.

       Although reforms articulated in the Bauchi State Urban Water Sector Law offer a promising
       institutional architecture, they have not yet translated into substantial changes to how the
       system works in practice. For example, interviews with the manager of the BSWSC indicated
       that very few steps have been taken to revamp the structure of the corporation to enable it to
       perform its functions.



       Provision and Production of Urban Water
       in Bauchi City
       The BSWSC is provides water supply service in four out of Bauchi State’s 20 LGAs; it
       serves less than 19 percent of the population for which it is responsible. Only 13 percent
       of the people served have piped water connections (2 percent of the state population);
       34 percent are supplied through standpipes (6 percent of the state population); and the

 remaining are served through alternative means such as water tankers (OPM 2017).
 Households account for 49 percent of the BSWSC’s distribution (OPM 2017). Industrial
 institutions account for 22 percent, public institutions for 17 percent, and public standpipes
 for 11 percent (OPM 2017).

 Only a small minority of areas in Bauchi City have water supply for 12 hours or more per day,
 with a majority of the city only benefitting from supply between zero and six hours a day
 (OPM 2017). Of the population with a household connection, only 39 percent benefit from
 running water between one and three days every week, and 58 percent benefit from running
 water between one and four days every week (OPM 2017).

 As is the case in the rest of the country, self-supply is common. In Bauchi City, the informal
 private sector consists of cart vendors sourcing water from BSWSC pipes, shallow wells, free
 public stand posts, and boreholes, as well as tanker trucks relying on BSWSC collection points.
 Beyond the informal private sector, citizens rely on ground water or rainwater, sachet and
 bottled water, and private boreholes (figure 9.1).


 Key Functions in Publicly Provided Urban Water

 Planning and Budgeting
 The BSWSC’s budget is prepared by the state government on the basis of proposals made
 by the state water authorities (SWAs). These proposals are usually submitted during the
 third quarter; they must include the approved budget of the current fiscal year, as well as
 actual expenditures up to June. Allocations to the BSWSC are made on the basis of the
 previous year’s budget with additions for the coming year. The State Ministry of Budget and
 Planning calls for budget defense toward the end of the year. Agreed allocations to recurrent
 (e.g., operations and maintenance [O&M]) and capital (e.g., infrastructure investments)
 expenditure are then reflected in the state capital budget.


A Wake Up Call	                                                                                    117
                                     The Bauchi State Urban Water Sector Investment Plan (2014–18) complements the state
                                     budgetary process. Developed in 2013 with assistance Sustainable Water and Sanitation in
                                     Africa (SUWASA) project (funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development [USAID]),
                                     this plan provides an approximation of the investment requirements for the urban water sector.
                                     It studies the existing funding arrangements, as well as needs for capital, operational, and
                                     maintenance expenditures. The document suggests that between 2014 and 2017, US$10.6
                                     million would be required to restore all existing systems to functionality and US$124.4 million
                                     would be required to meet the capacity gap.


                                     Financing
                                     Table 9.2 sets out the Bauchi State WASH policy principles for public expenditure in the
                                     water sector. For urban water, the policy envisions the largest share of capital expenditure
                                     (60 percent) and all of the operating and maintenance expenditure being financed by
                                     state institutions, including tariffs collected by the BSWSC. For rural water, the policy
                                     envisions half of capital expenditure coming from the federal government, with the
                                     remaining amount covered by states (25 percent), LGAs (20 percent), and communities
                                     (5 percent). The policy envisions the largest share of operating and maintenance
                                     expenditure coming from communities (70 percent), with the remaining amount split
                                     between states (10 percent) and LGAs (20 percent).

                                     As is true with data nationally, accurate data reflecting the actual share of expenditure on
                                     capital investments and recurrent costs across these actors are unavailable. However, NWSS
                                     (2015) data reflecting the sponsor of water points and schemes provide a notional idea of the
                                     distribution (see table 9.3). Notably, between 2000 and 2015, communities sponsored no
                                     water infrastructure. Actors not included in the Bauchi State WASH policy—such as
                                     nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), community-based organization (CBOs), philanthropists,
                                     and donors—sponsored 15 percent of water points and 12 percent of water schemes.

 The BSWSC finances its expenditure through tariff collection, state government allocations,
 and external funding from development partners. According to the Bauchi State Urban Water
 Sector Law (2014), BSWSC has autonomy over its revenue for operation and maintenance and
 is expected to cover operation and maintenance expenditures. In practice, poor tariff collection
 makes the SWA dependent on state disbursements to undertake expansion, construction, and
 repair of the water network. BSWSC revenue collection covers only 10 percent of operation and
 maintenance costs supply; this revenue is deposited in a special ring-fenced account. External
 funding from development partners, including from the World Bank, represents a substantial
 complement to state government contributions.

 The difference between state budget allocations to water supply and budget outturns is
 large and growing. While actual expenditure on water supply in Bauchi was relatively close to
 the average state expenditure on water supply in Nigeria in 2008, it dropped well below the
 average between 2009 and 2012 (see figure 9.2). Actual expenditure against the approved
 budget for BSWSC decreased from 17 percent in 2013 to 4 percent in 2015. Bauchi State
 expenditure for Housing and Community Affairs, which includes water supply, has ranged from
 2.7 percent to 9.3 percent of the approved budget between 2009 and 2013. During interviews,
 stakeholders attributed low execution of water supply budgets to the fact that more politically
 visible, “quick win” projects are given priority. Given that elections are held every four years,
 officials favor projects that can be planned, designed, and constructed within their term in
 office, such as roads.


 Tariff Setting and Collection
 The State Ministry of Water Resource Management (SMWRM) and the BSWSC are both
 assigned a role in setting tariff structures. According to the Bauchi State Urban Water Law
 (2014),2 the State Ministry of Water Resources ensures that the BSWSC operates using sound
 commercial practice by issuing a State Tariff Policy and Regulation. On the basis of this policy,
 the BSWSC is expected to review water rate scales annually after consulting with consumers
 and carrying out a tariff assessment for planning purposes. The BSWSC’s proposed tariff
 structure shall be submitted to the SMWRM for approval. De jure, there seems to be a clear
 distinction between the roles of the FMWR and BSWSC. However, in practice much of the policy
 formulation and policy coordination functions rest with the BSWSC.

 Tables 9.4 and 9.5 set out the prevailing connection fees and tariff structure in Bauchi, which
 was last reviewed in 2008. During field visits, neither the State Ministry of Water Resources
 nor the BSWSC could explain how the water rates were determined in 2008. Although the
 BSWSC has recently developed a new tariff structure with support from the USAID SUWASA
 program, it has yet to be adopted or implemented. The prevailing structure sets out a fixed
 connection fee based on pipe size, as well as fees to cover the cost of pipes and digging
 trenches. In practice, BSWSC clients must also cover the price of pipes and digging of the
 trench, increasing the cost of connection the further away one lives from the main piped
 network.3 These additional charges can make connection costs range from N8,200 to

 N21,000 (US$26 to US$68) in practice. With regard to monthly tariffs, commercial clients
 such as car wash sites, construction sites, and block making industries are assigned a
 higher tariff than public institutions (table 9.5). In principle, customers are to be billed a flat
 amount once a month.

 Revenue generated through tariff collection has declined between 2011 and 2015. While the
 total billed amount increased during this period, the revenue collected declined. The Bauchi
 Water Board currently bills 18,000 customers; another 22,000 customers are believed to be
 connected to the water system but are not registered in the billing system; and no customers
 are metered. The BSWSC’s revenue to billing ratio dropped from 22 percent in 2011 to just
 over 8 percent in 2015. A particular challenge has been the loss of revenue from major
 customers in the region. LGAs in the state stopped paying water rates for standpipes and
 their institutions due to a drop in local government receipts from federal allocations.
 Hospitals, the police and military, a local university, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and
 all state institutions are among other customers that have reduced or completely stopped
 payment of monthly bills.


 BSWSC Human Resource Management, Monitoring,
 and Accountability
 Formally, the BSWSC is governed by a board of directors appointed by the governor of the state;
 in practice, the board is frequently dissolved. The members of the governing body include a
 chairman, a managing director, a representative of the Ministry of Water Resources, a
 representative of the Bauchi State Chamber of Commerce, the Consumer Protection Council
 and other consumer advocacy groups operating in the state, a representative of the local
 government chairmen, and one other person with experience or specialization in water or in
 business who is capable of making contributions. Though policy specifies a four-year tenure for
 board members, the board has been dissolved by multiple incoming governments of the state.
 The current government also dissolved the board governing the BSWSC when it came to power
 in mid-2015, and a new board has yet to be reconstituted.

 The BSWSC is managed by a team consisting of the general manager as the chief executive
 officer and four assistant general managers. Each of these managers oversees a department


A Wake Up Call	                                                                                        121
       (the Commercial Department, Finance and Accounts, Administration and Human Resources,
       and Operations and Maintenance). The activities of the BSWB are overseen by the state
       commissioner of Water Resources. Interviews with key informants suggested that given the
       complex organizational structure, decision making can be slow and coordination between
       these different departments is problematic.

       Corporation staff members are civil servants hired by the state government. There were
       306 staff mapped to the BSWSC in 2011, and this gradually increased to 412 in 2015.
       From 2015, the state government stopped recruiting full-time staff and recruits only
       casual workers on an as-needed basis. Many key stakeholders interviewed indicated that
       the capacity of state government officials to understand the water sector and relevant
       problems is very low. Staff capacity at the middle and lower levels within the BSWSC is
       also poor. The staff capacity issue is exacerbated by the fact that the BSWSC cannot
       employ or fire staff, and is therefore unable to independently build additional capacity or
       sanction poor performance.

       The 2014 Bauchi Urban Water Law sets out the expectation that the BSWSC will operate on
       a performance-based contract with the state government, overseen by a performance
       contract monitoring and review commission. The objective is to incentivize BSWSC employees
       to fulfill the SWA’s standards and targets. As of late 2016, implementation of this policy had
       not taken place.

       The state has yet to establish a regulatory commission for its water corporation, nor are
       there signs that other state institutions are taking up key regulatory or oversight functions.
       The lack of incentives for regular monitoring and regulation is exemplified by the absence of
       a regulatory commission for water provision in Bauchi State. The establishment of an
       independent regulator could open the state government and water corporation to criticism,
       and in the absence of any perceived benefit to the state, this presumably acts as a
       disincentive for its creation.

       Formal responsibility for monitoring water quality is assigned to the Federal Ministry of
       Health (FMoH), but in practice it does not play this role. According to the Nigerian Standard
       for Drinking Water Quality (ICS 13.060.20) the FMoH is responsible for drinking water quality
       surveillance and enforcement. The ministry was expected to issue strategies and procedures
       that would be implemented by a Division of Water Safety. Given that the FMoH has not played
       its surveillance role in practice, a revised policy is being drafted to shift the surveillance role
       to the FMWR.


       Organization of the Informal Private Sector
       A common supply chain in Bauchi City is for the informal private sector to distribute water from
       the piped network. Water sourced by the BSWSC is treated and then enters the pipe network.
       Private vendors enter into formal contracts with the BSWSC and connect to their pipe network.
       The collected water is stored in reservoirs or tanks, and sold through informal transactions to
       cart pushers who then sell the water onward to households. No receipts are normally offered
       for these transactions.

       A second type of supply chain involves private vendors sourcing their water from open wells,
       which they have drilled using private contractors. In these instances, the water is not treated.
       The water is sold by private vendors to cart pushers through informal transactions. In certain
       areas cart pushers source the water directly from open wells, omitting the private vendor step.

       In certain areas, cart pushers source their water from BSWSC burst pipes. Occasionally,
       associations form around these burst pipes, with different types of providers selling the water.
       For example, in one case, an open water source was created by the failure of a BSWSC pipe or
       valve. This open water source was used for washing clothes, both as a business by washer

 men and directly by the surrounding households. Eventually, an association of washer men had
 formed. The Washmen Association is an informal business that operates at this open valve,
 charging fees for the collection of water and providing facilities for washing and drying clothes.
 The BSWSC recognizes the association and even provided them with standpipes to ensure
 better access to cleaner water. It is also serves as the point of contact between the BSWSC
 and users in the region.

 A further value chain is cart vendors sourcing their water from public standpipes. This type of
 value chain is particularly popular in areas where most households do not have a connection
 and reside quite far from the main connection point. Some public standpipes exist, and cart
 pushers travel to collect water from them and sell to the households in the area.

 Some cart vendors source their water from boreholes. The water is sourced from private
 boreholes, drilled by private contractors, and not registered. The water is then pumped by an
 association that sells it informally to cart pushers. The latter then distribute the water to
 households for storage and consumption. A variation of the supply chain occurs when cart
 pushers source their water directly from boreholes.

 Tanker truck drivers usually purchase water directly from sales points maintained by the
 BSWSC. They usually enter into formal agreements with the BSWSC. In some cases, the
 water is delivered directly to households. The tanker trucks’ major customers, however,
 are industrial firms. Alternatively, tanker trucks sell to sachet factories that then distribute
 sachet water to consumers. Sachet water factories were particularly popular a few years
 ago, but are more difficult to find now. The factories supplied drinking water at convenience
 because in the absence of a BSWSC supply, alternative sources could not be trusted for
 drinking. However, the costs of production of sachet water have gone up considerably in
 Bauchi and elsewhere, and competition from areas with better ground water quality have
 taken over the market.



 Citizens’ Perceptions: Urban Water in Bauchi State
 A consequence of the poorly maintained and geographically limited water infrastructure is
 that consumers may not have the option to connect to the piped supply or may be making
 a conscious choice not to connect or not to pay. This section presents a snapshot of
 citizens’ strategies for accessing water in Bauchi City, their perceptions of who is
 responsible for water supply, and their experience with the BSWSC and connecting to the
 piped water supply. Evidence was gathered through focus group discussions and key
 informant interviews in Bauchi City between October 2016 and February 2017.


 Accessing Water in Bauchi City
 Evidence from fieldwork suggests that reliance on the informal water market is highest in
 areas of Bauchi City where there is no formal supply or a mixed supply. In these areas, the
 informal market responds to demand arising from the long-term unavailability of piped water
 and seasonal scarcity of free ground and rainwater sources. Similarly, in areas with no piped
 supply, the informal market responds to demand for water when free sources are scarce.
 Water vendors provide a redistribution service by fetching water from areas that continue to
 have tap or groundwater even, in the dry season. In areas where everyone has a household
 connection to the piped supply, the informal market responds to demand that arises from
 interruptions in piped supply or dissatisfaction with piped water quality.

 Given limited access to piped water services, as well as water quality and seasonal availability
 problems with free water sources, people seem to have little choice but to buy from informal
 vendors. Respondents complained of the limited coverage and supply of BSWSC piped services,
 and while free well, borehole, tap, or rainwater was generally seen to have the advantages of


A Wake Up Call	                                                                                       123
       affordability and easy accessibility, these sources were often reported to be of inferior quality
       and become unavailable in the dry season. As such, people would then purchase jerry cans or
       packaged water to fulfill their household and consumption needs, if financially viable.

       Focus group participants felt that those who buy water from informal providers end up paying
       more than what they would be billed for water from piped connections to the formal water
       supply. As one individual summarized, “…the person who is without a piped water connection
       definitely spends more money. Take for instance the number of people you have in your household,
       if you have say 10 people in your house, you might spend up to 600 naira daily buying water
       compared to those who only pay once in a month.”4

       Fieldwork suggests that availability is a primary criterion for selecting a water source, because
       it lays the foundation for possible choices. It was widely agreed that water availability is less of
       a problem in the wet season. Generally, it was reported that during the rainy season tap water
       and groundwater from wells and boreholes are more available and of better quality. During the
       wet season, rainwater is the preferred choice for drinking and domestic uses because it meets
       all criteria: it is freely available, accessible close to home, and widely reported to be of better
       quality than other sources. However, water scarcity is a problem in the dry season, when most
       turn to informal providers.

       Within the bounds of what is available, affordability is a further criterion for selecting water
       source. People generally expressed desire to have a sufficient quantity of what they perceived
       to be the best quality water, but their choice was always constrained by what they could afford.
       Even in the wealthiest area where focal group discussions (FGDs) were held, people were
       constrained by costs—these respondents agreed that bottled water was the best quality for
       health and taste, but none said they could afford to drink it regularly. In other areas, it was
       widely agreed that sachet water (pure water) was wanted for health and taste reasons but was
       not always affordable. Even jerry can vendor water was said to be unaffordable sometimes.
       One man from Kandahar said succinctly, “If you don’t have money to buy it, you can’t get good,
       clean water.”

       Accessibility was expressed as another key criteria governing water choices. The main aspect
       of accessibility mentioned in the FGDs was proximity. The most important function of distributing
       vendors is that they deliver water to people who would otherwise have to go long distances to
       access it. Many respondents across the groups said that they send their children to fetch water
       for them, but sometimes this is not feasible. When nearby sources (e.g., wells, rainwater, in
       some cases boreholes) are not available, households that can’t fetch water themselves will
       either pay Islamic students to fetch it, or will purchase from vendors that deliver to them. It was
       widely reported that ease of access is the primary selling point for the distributing vendors in
       the dry season. In the wet season, rain and well water are generally the most accessible and
       people purchase substantially less, when the primary selling point for the water vendors then
       becomes water quality.

       Within the bounds of what is available, affordable, and accessible, respondents reported
       choosing their water based on its quality. They judged water quality based on appearance
       (including color, the presence of particles or sediment, algae [referred to as “green particles”],
       worms or insects, turbidity versus clarity, appearance of the water container); taste (salty,
       “awful,” chemical-like—e.g., chlorine); and smell (“bad odor,” chemical-like—e.g., chlorine).
       There were variations between and within groups about which of these aspects was most
       important, but generally it was agreed that good water is clear, colorless, odorless and tastes
       pure. Good quality water was desired for a better experience of drinking or otherwise using
       it  and was also linked strongly with health. Variability in the quality of piped, vended, and
       free  water was a recurring theme. Nevertheless, the consensus was that bottled water is
       acknowledged as the best, followed by sachet water, tap water, borehole water (including tap
       and borehole water purchased from vendors), and, lastly, well water.

       The importance of water quality did differ when usage was considered. “If the well water
       is not drinkable, then they will buy water to drink and the water from the well will be used

124	                                                                                         A Wake Up Call
 for other activities.”5 Generally with water used for domestic purposes, water quality was
 less of a concern. One exception was when taste or odor was too off-putting for cooking,
 bathing, or washing. The second exception was that groundwater is not preferred for
 washing because it is hard and does not lather properly (reported in FG1, FG11, FG12,
 and FG15).


 Residents’ Perceptions: Who Is Responsible
 for Water Supply?
 During focus groups discussions, there was a consensus among respondents that it was
 the government’s responsibility to ensure the supply of and access to water. People
 largely believed that provision of water was a part of the government’s “responsibility to
 the masses.”6 Other responses included that access to water was a “right” of the people,
 and the responsibility for this was shared between the federal and state governments.7
 Respondents in Rafin Zurfi believed that the government had two main functions: protecting
 the people and their property, and providing essential social amenities, of which water
 was a pivotal one. It was envisaged that the federal government could contribute to water
 provision by complementing and supplementing the actions undertaken by the state
 government. Respondents in the Kandahar and Rafin Zurfi areas also cited promises
 made by the elected representatives during elections, in which water supply was promised
 to the people if they voted the new government in.

 Local government, councilors, and community leaders were also believed to be indispensable
 for access to water. The main reason for this was their closeness to the people, and their ability
 to take this forward with the relevant state governments, governors, and other authorities. One
 respondent summarized notes: “if [a community leader] pressurize the government they will
 provide water. Even if the governor brings the pipes here, if the community head is not serious
 about it, his own community will not get.”8

 Respondents in four out of the five sampled areas highlighted the role and responsibility
 of the community in accessing water. However, the envisaged roles or responsibilities of
 the community were vague and abstract. Respondents said that if the government sees
 the individual and community efforts taken then it would respond and do its share in
 providing access to water. As one respondent summarized, “at least the community can do
 5 percent then the government will do 95 percent.”9 Respondents also recognized that
 when the government fails to provide access to water, the community can organize into
 a  community organization and work toward accessing water. One of the respondents
 highlighted the fact that the community organization could mobilize resources from the
 people to access water supplies.10

 Some examples of capital investments by nongovernment actors were raised during focus
 groups. An individual seeking the “blessing of the people” set up a solar-powered borehole,
 without any assistance from the community or government. However, poor electricity
 supplies limit the extent to which the borehole can be used. In another case, legislators in
 the region dug a few boreholes in the area, but these boreholes did not have water. As
 another example, a community was credited with digging three boreholes and a well in its
 area, without any assistance from any state agents. Due to maintenance issues, only one
 of the three boreholes is currently functional, and the community is trying to mobilize
 resources to repair and maintain the others. In another region, a committee formed by
 members of the community dug the only well in its area. This committee also looks into
 repairing the well when required.

 Examples of community participation were cited in four out of the five sampled areas.
 Community participation, however, must have taken place at a very localized level, since
 different FGDs in the same area yielded different responses to the question on community
 participation. One of respondents in the Old Town area said that his community had an

       organization that had been advocating for access to water since 1999, and was successful in
       increasing access to water numerous times by liaising with different state authorities.11 Other
       examples of community participation in the Old Town area include the mobilization of resources
       for community issues, liaising with the local legislator for increasing access to water, and
       informal discussions among women.


       Customers’ Experiences with the BSWSC
       Respondents connected to the formal water supply claimed that people paid the BSWSC for
       using piped water services in their households. The analysis of data from a short survey filled
       out by participants also suggests that there is no major discrepancy between the frequency
       with which bills are received and the frequency with which they are paid. However, it is possible
       that there is an element of response bias, as people were being asked about their civic
       behavior and responsibilities.

       In several cases respondents suggested an element of reciprocity regarding payment of bills.
       “It is about ‘help me, I help you.’ … If they give us water, then we will pay the bills … so that the
       government can get revenue to provide water and other services.”12 Others spoke of a “lack of
       regular water supply … this will discourage you from paying.”13 In at least three instances,
       payment was also linked to a sense of affordability on behalf of formal users, with the general
       understanding that there were times when “money isn’t there,” but whenever able, people paid.

       A number of respondents across locations referred to problems with billing and payment.
       Respondents claimed that they were not provided with regular water bills the way the National
       Electric Power Authority (NEPA) bills were brought, which made it difficult for them to know the
       amount due even if they were willing to pay for water services. Respondents claimed it could
       “be a whole year” or more that they were not issued bills. In addition, some complained that
       they were sometimes expected to go to the water board office to pay bills, since the local
       branch had been closed. This was considered difficult and people were discouraged from
       traveling to make payments, as the office was far way (FGD 20).

       Monitoring gaps in the BSWSC were also highlighted in a number of cases. Respondents
       claimed the water board staff provided inadequate service, and did not “constantly follow up on
       their bills issue,” and when people went to make payments “no evidence is issued for my [sic]
       payment or recorded.”14 In addition, information on registered water suppliers was at times
       reported to be incomplete, so relevant authorities could not determine if people did not pay for
       water or whether they had illegal connections.

       In general, respondents appeared to suggest that people would be more willing to pay for piped
       water services if certain quality standards were ensured. Of those respondents already
       connected to the piped water supply, 80 percent reported they would like better water quality
       and over 50 percent indicated a preference for more hours of service per day. Users indicated
       that people would generally “pay, and on time” if the frequency of supply and quality of piped
       water was improved; billing, registration and documentation issues were resolved; and efforts
       were undertaken to improve the awareness and orientation of users on using water, paying bills
       and reporting grievances.


       Connecting to the BSWSC
       Although most people would like to have piped water, given its advantages of quality and
       affordability, many respondents felt that connecting to the piped supply was challenging. This
       was mainly due to the expenses involved, the nature of the connection process and the physical
       limitations of the piped network.

       A substantial number of people may be willing to pay more than the official connection fee;
       based on the fee scale collected from the SWA, the cost of connecting—inclusive of labor and


126	                                                                                          A Wake Up Call
 pipes—is at most N13,050 (US$42). Information gathered from focus group participants
 through a “willingness to pay tool” suggests that 68 percent of the sample are willing to pay
 N13,000 (US$42) or more to connect to the piped supply. Further, when informed of the
 monthly tariff, 87 percent responded that they would be willing to pay this tariff.

 Yet citizens may be unaware of the official connection fee or are being asked to pay more when
 they try to connect. One group of respondents suggested the cost would exceed N20,000 to
 N30,000 (US$65 to US$97) if one lives close to a pipe. In the two other instances, respondents
 provided even higher estimates, with one respondent claiming that he had been given an
 estimate of N50,000 (US$161)—just for pipes—since he lived on a hill; another noted he had
 tried to get a piped water connection but “one official… gave me an estimate of about 150,000
 naira [for registration, materials] because of this I couldn’t continue.”15 This could reflect some
 rent seeking on the part of officials, who may be charging higher connection fees than those
 officially quoted to researchers for the fieldwork.16

 Respondents appeared to agree that once registration and inspection was complete,
 customers were responsible for purchasing all the materials required for the connection. In
 terms of equipment and materials required, most respondent groups mentioned pipes to
 their area, elbow junctions, and pipe or tap heads. Some respondents highlighted that
 tanks were required to store water. A number also spoke of it being necessary to buy pumps
 or engines, especially if their houses were at a height or distance, since water would not
 reach them otherwise. Purchasing gum or cement for the pipes and tanks was discussed in
 a few instances.

 In addition, people had pay for laborers who would dig the pipe trench to connect their houses
 to the line. It appeared that in most cases, the BSWB does not provide workers for this
 purpose, and people have to source and pay laborers themselves. In two discussions,
 respondents suggested they had the option of using water board staff for this purpose, although
 they explained that one needed to pay the BSWB for this service, since “nobody works for free
 anymore.”

 Most respondent groups believed free connections were possible in locations with a mixed
 or primarily formal supply, though respondents in at least seven groups proclaimed it was
 not feasible and one still had to pay to be connected. Free connections can be obtained by
 either directly tapping into the public piped network or through neighbors’ connections.
 While there were a few references of the latter occurring without the neighbors’ knowledge
 and permission, in most cases people were said to come together in “joint ventures” and
 share the cost of connection or to “give a token” to their neighbors to connect to their pipe
 and then pay money together, or to use the connection for free. Two groups of respondents
 mentioned the role of “plumbers” in facilitating these free connections, and explained that
 especially given the staff shortages in the Water Board, local plumbers had experience in
 this work and could “get your water connected without them [Water Board] seeing any trace
 of the digging.”17

 Respondents across most locations seemed to be aware that such types of free connections
 to the piped supply were illegal and reported that the BSWB would disconnect them if the
 connections were known. Three groups also complained that such illegal connections
 reduced the water pressure and supply for the owner of the connection. However, there
 seems to be a general openness to sharing connections with neighbors, and a respondent
 even stressed that such water use should not be illegal, and that people should be allowed
 to “improvise from [their] friends” if a water pipe were brought to the area but they could
 not afford a connection.

 In addition to the monetary costs of piped connections, supply reliability was seen as a
 major deterrent to connecting. Multiple groups across all four areas with unconnected
 respondents claimed that people are dissuaded from trying to connect to the formal
 piped  network because they believe that they will not receive water even if they do.


A Wake Up Call	                                                                                        127
       BSWB staff were reported to be “careless” in inspecting and following up on major lines,
       and as a result, some people see the connections as a “waste of money” since they can
       go long stretches of time without tap water. Respondents also reported illegal connections
       to be a major problem in accessing water even after having connected to the piped
       water network.

       In addition, terrain issues were brought up in most discussions. Respondents complained
       that they live in hilly regions, and it is problematic for those living at a height to access
       water due to insufficient water pressure. Under such circumstances, those who could
       afford it tend to purchase large engines or pumps to push water up the hills. However, not
       only were these pumps expensive and required electricity or generators to work but also
       those who could afford pumping machines “will channel all the water to their own storage
       tanks, leaving those of us without machines with no water. This discourages people from
       getting connections.”18 In addition, respondents complained that the hard or stony ground
       made it difficult for them to dig and lay underground water pipes, and that they were
       required to use above-ground pipes—which often crossed roads or other public places and
       thus were liable to frequent damage and breakage.

       Negotiating access or paying for permission to cross neighboring properties or nearby roads is
       also an issue. In many groups, respondents claimed that if the BSWB’s proposed route for the
       piped connection passed through roads or other people’s properties, it posed a major challenge
       for the potential user, since they would then need to negotiate or pay for permission. Generally,
       respondents seemed to suggest that acquiring access through other people’s land or property
       was difficult, as they may “feel you want to destroy their fence just to put pipes.”19 One group
       indicated that the community leader’s intervention would be needed in this regard. If the
       neighbor or individual did not consent, then the connection could not be made. Similarly, to get
       a connection to a house across a road, one would “have to struggle with the State Development
       Board … you will have to pay charges... [and] pay the State Development Board to come and cut
       the road or drill it.”20


       Emerging Findings and Entry Points for Reform
       Findings in this chapter reflect how national challenges play out in the context of Bauchi State.
       In particular, implementation gaps prevail. The Bauchi State Urban Water Law is in some ways
       a model of what a technical reform could look like in Nigeria, but it remains unimplemented.
       Further, low credibility of the state budget contributes to a decreasing level of expenditure on
       water supply. Reduced or nonpayment of water bills by state and local government agencies
       also contribute to this low expenditure. As is the case nationally, the BSWSC lacks autonomy
       over its fiscal and human resources, creating a challenging context for incentivizing performance.
       Due to low revenue collection, the BSWSC relies on the state government for funding, and
       employees are recruited and managed by the state.

       With regard to citizens’ perceptions of water in Bauchi City, the formal and hidden costs of
       connections are a barrier, and perceptions about the unreliability of service also play a role.
       Findings from the focus group discussions reflect the following key points about citizens’
       perceptions:

         ••   Availability is the primary criterion for choice of water source, with affordability and
              accessibility being secondary considerations. Within the bounds of what is available—
              affordable and accessible—citizens in Bauchi City choose water based on its quality.

         ••   Publicly provided piped water is viewed as being more affordable (on a monthly basis)
              than other sources, and is believed to be of good quality.

         ••   Residential customers of the BSWSC report problems with billing and payment. Though
              respondents reported paying their bills regularly, they also suggested that people are


128	                                                                                       A Wake Up Call
         more willing to pay when the service is more reliable (e.g., more hours of supply or
         higher water pressure).

    ••   Evidence suggests that citizens in Bauchi City would be willing to pay official connection
         fees to access piped water. However, there are a number of perceived barriers to
         connecting, including (a) quotes for connection fees that are higher than the official rate;
         (b) the need to cover material and labor costs; (c) the difficulty of negotiating access or
         paying for permission to cross neighboring properties or nearby roads; and (d) terrain
         issues—such as the need to buy and operate pumps in hilly regions.

    ••   Perceptions of reliability were also seen as a deterrent to connecting to the piped supply.

 Analysis also points to two distinct areas of feasible policy intervention: (a) strengthening the
 delivery of publicly provided water, and (b) strengthening the relationship between informal
 water suppliers and the BSWSC:

    ••   Strengthening financial planning and budgeting, as well as budget execution, will be
         crucial to advancing investments in infrastructure. A better understanding of the budget
         cycle—from planning to execution—will uncover key bottlenecks for the effective
         disbursement of the funds allocated by the state government to the BSWSC. Improving
         the strategic allocation and reliability of these funds is crucial for improving the BSWSC’s
         ability to plan and fund future reforms.

    ••   Increasing the BSWSC’s autonomy over financial and human resources is a promising
         area of intervention. While top management at the BSWSC appears willing to advance
         reforms, it is constrained by an inability to directly manage staff (i.e., hire, fire, and
         promote) as well as its de facto dependence on unreliable budget allocations from the
         state government.

    ••   Strengthening incentives and capabilities for BSWSC tariff collection is an important
         complement to increasing the body’s autonomy. In the short term, this can start with a
         concerted effort to collect tariffs from the larger institutional providers that are currently
         underpaying. This may require dialogue between the BSWSC and these public institutions
         to negotiate a feasible plan for payment. In the medium term, a comprehensive tariff
         reform alongside investments in metered connections are necessary.

    ••   Regulation of the informal private sector through service-level agreements emerged as
         a promising area of policy intervention. In the short term, the BSWSC does not appear
         to be able to cope with the increased demand for water services from customers in
         Bauchi City. Regulation should be based on the following principles: (a) Recognizing
         water vendors as an integral part of the urban water supply system and as official
         partners with whom to build trust and accountability; (b) Addressing constraints on
         informal water markets, such as the cost of water sources (connection fees and
         tariffs for piped supply), water access and availability (leading to queuing), and
         counterproductive laws against water vending; and (c) Improving water services for
         customers in terms of water quality controls and regulating the price of water; and
         forming vendor and consumer associations, thereby improving the relationships
         between vendors, consumers and the BSWSC.

 Emerging Messages and
 Needs Looking Forward
 Nigeria is a water-rich country that faces increasing water security challenges, especially in the
 water supply and sanitation sector. Despite uneven distribution and availability of its water
 resources, Nigeria is water-rich. The country needs to build an effective integrated water
 management framework—consisting of robust institutions, solid policies, strong organizational
 capacities, and a rigorous data framework—to deal with growing water demands, the rapid
 degradation of resources, and the rising threat of climate change. Nigeria’s water security
 challenges are nowhere as acute as in the water supply and sanitation subsector: access to
 piped water service is steadily regressing in urban areas, infrastructure managed by
 underfinanced and underperforming SWAs is undergoing rapid decay, and urbanization is
 placing added pressures on the capacity of water agencies to deliver services. Most urban
 dwellers must rely on scarce, unsafe, and costly supplies from informal vendors or private
 wells. In rural areas, low levels of investment and high system failure rates have resulted in a
 water supply that is well below regional standards. Half of the rural water systems are
 permanently out of service within eight years of commissioning. Moreover, government
 oversight of sanitation has left the sector in serious conditions: with the exception of Abuja, in
 urban and rural areas alike, access to sanitation consists almost exclusively of private on-site
 facilities, supported by informal fecal sludge management. Approximately 15 percent to 25
 percent of the population still practice open defecation. The socioeconomic cost of poor
 sanitation is estimated at US$2 billion per year.

 This report offers an overview of the state of WASH services in the country. It draws from a number
 of national data sources, desk reviews, and original research to analyze service delivery in the
 country, and assess the sector’s performance. It offers a synopsis of poverty in Nigeria, considers
 the relationship between poverty and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); explores demographic
 patterns that influence access to WASH; and examines the relationship between WASH and child
 health outcomes. Further, it evaluates the performance of water agencies, conducts a public
 expenditure review of the WASH sector, identifies institutional bottlenecks, offers insights on how
 to make the sector more efficient and sustainable, and explores the organization of the institutional
 landscape for urban water supply in Bauchi City. The report also provides recommendations for
 tackling the current crisis in Nigeria’s WASH services. Key messages:


 Message 1: Nigeria’s WASH Sector is in Critical
 Condition and Requires Immediate Attention
 Although Nigeria has made considerable progress in the water sector, access to high-quality
 water services remains low. The country has achieved the Millennium Development Goal (MDG)
 for water, and 61 percent of citizens have access to improved water.1 Yet around 57 million
 people continue to live without access to improved water, and 71 percent of people in the
 poorest quintile lack access to an improved water source. Only 31 percent have access to
 improved water on premises, a meager 14 percent of the population have access within
 15 minutes of their premises, and only 7 percent possess piped water on premises. Moreover,
 13 percent of the population in capital cities enjoy access to piped water on premises, while
 only 4 percent of the rural population have such access.

       The sanitation sector is in precarious condition. Nigeria was unable to achieve the MDG for
       sanitation. Only 29 percent of Nigerians have access to improved and unshared sanitation
       facilities, and there is no significant disparity between rural and urban areas. Less than
       6 percent make use of sewerage systems. Approximately 27 million to 46 million Nigerians—
       between 15 percent and 25 percent of the population—practice open defecation. Moreover,
       open defecation rates remained relatively stable during the past 25 years. Poor sanitation
       costs the country N455 billion (around US$2 billion) each year.

       Over the last few decades, Nigeria reversed its progress in access to piped water and improved
       sanitation. According to data from the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), while access to
       improved water at the national level increased, access to piped water on premises in urban
       areas declined from 32 percent in 1990 to less than 10 percent in 2015, suggesting an
       erosion of utility service coverage. Access to improved sanitation also decreased from
       38 percent to 29 percent during this time period.

       In terms of access to improved water and piped water on premises, Nigeria lags behind many
       other countries in the region. Around 61 percent of Nigerians have access to improved water
       and around 7 percent have access to piped water on premises. In contrast, 81 percent of
       citizens in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 93 percent of citizens in Senegal, and 85 percent
       of citizens in Sierra Leone have access to improved water. Moreover, 17 percent of citizens in
       the Democratic Republic of Congo, 80 percent of citizens in Senegal, and 12 percent of citizens
       in Sierra Leone have access to piped water on premises.

       There is no clear-cut regional divide in access to WASH. When mapping access to water and
       sanitation at the local government area (LGA) level, the findings suggest significant variation
       among states. Although there is a north-south divide in access to improved sanitation and
       open defecation practices, most other WASH indicators do not indicate a sharp north-south
       division—which contrasts long standing regional differences in infrastructure and development.
       Further research is needed to better understand these patterns and to help develop more
       tailored policy solutions that account for regional characteristics.

       There is a clear wealth, education, and urban-rural divide in access to water and sanitation.
       Only 29 percent of households in the poorest quintile have access to improved water, compared
       to 91 percent of households in the richest quintile. Likewise, only 12 percent of households in
       the poorest quintile have access to improved sanitation, compared to 95 percent of households
       in the top quintile. Moreover, while 34 percent of households in which the household head has
       no education have access to improved sanitation, and that percentage jumps to 67 percent
       among educated households. Lastly, 85 percent of urban households have access to improved
       water, compared to 53 percent of households in rural regions.

       Analyses conducted for the purposes of this study confirm with new detail the degree to which
       Nigeria’s WASH sector is underdeveloped in comparison to regional standards, for both water
       supply and sanitation, and across urban and rural areas, with piped utility service regressing,
       and significant access gaps for the poor. Nigeria’s WASH sector is in critical condition, calling
       for priority policy attention and bold actions by state and federal governments.


       Message 2: Improving the WASH Sector Will Have
       Significant Implications for Poverty Reduction and
       Human Development Outcomes
       Poor households disproportionately bear the effects of inadequate access to WASH. Using
       advanced mapping techniques, the analysis pinpoints high-poverty and low-WASH access
       hotspots, and finds a strong geographical correlation between the two. Many of the health
       burdens related to low access to WASH are thus borne by the poor. Addressing shortcomings

 in WASH sector development will yield vast benefits: not only in terms of health outcomes, in
 particular for the poor, but also in terms of the overall productivity of the nation.

 Poor households are being left behind in access to WASH services. For households residing in
 the bottom 20 percent (B20) of the income distribution, approximately 29 percent have access
 to improved water services. Further, only 5 percent of these households have access to such
 services on premises, and less than 1 percent have access to piped water. Around 55 percent
 of poor households also defecate in the open, and only 10 percent have access to improved
 sanitation facilities.

 Using the Human Opportunity Index (HOI), the report finds that inequality in access to water
 services among children is mostly the result of variation in income distribution. Income
 distribution—namely, residing in the bottom 40 percent (B40) of the overall wealth distribution—
 has the most influence in predicting a child’s unequal access to water services.

 For the most part, mapping techniques suggest an obscure relationship between poverty and
 access to water and sanitation. When overlapping poverty maps with access maps, a number
 of seemingly counterintuitive patterns became evident. For instance, 10.7 percent of the
 population are poor and have relatively high access to improved water, whereas 6.4 percent of
 nonpoor households have relatively low access. Nevertheless, further analysis suggests that,
 for low poverty households, access to education and urban or rural location may be central
 factors in explaining disparities in access to improved water. Moreover, across poverty-access
 tiers, households are concentrated in a handful of states, which suggests that there are state-
 level characteristics driving the differences in access to WASH.

 Access to high-quality WASH is critical for reducing the enteric burden in the country. The report
 utilizes a WASH poverty risk model to assess patterns of disease risk among children under
 five, across different economic and geographic dimensions. The model assesses that
 approximately 73 percent of the enteric burden estimated for Nigeria is associated with
 inadequate WASH. The national enteric burden associated with inadequate WASH is so great
 that approximately 10,083 life years are lost2 per 100,000 children per year.

 Moreover, the WASH enteric burden for the poorest quintile is about four times greater than the
 enteric burden for the richest quintile. The burden for the poorest in urban areas is 3.3 times
 higher than that of the richest. Correspondingly, this burden is approximately three times
 higher for the poorest in rural areas than for the richest citizens who reside there. Hence—
 inadequate WASH undoubtedly has dramatic consequences upon the health, well-being and
 productivity of Nigerian citizens—particularly the poorest.

 Inadequate access to WASH is associated with undernutrition, which is a major public health
 problem in Nigeria. Unsafe WASH conditions enable the transmission of enteric pathogens that
 can cause diarrhea and environmental enteropathy, and can lead to chronic problems with
 absorbing nutrients. This, in turn, can lead to stunting, wasting, and being underweight. The
 2013 DHS estimates that 36.8 percent of children under five years of age are stunted,
 18.5 percent are wasted, and 29 percent are underweight. Close to half of children lying in the
 B40 of the income distribution are stunted, and 37 percent of children in the B40 are underweight.
 While the proportion of under-five children who are stunted has improved since the previous
 Demographic Health Survey (DHS) in 2008, the extent of wasting and underweight status among
 children has worsened, suggesting that Nigerian children face chronic nutritional deficiency.

 Inadequate WASH has also been found to increase the risk of contracting neglected tropical
 diseases, such as soil-transmitted helminth infections, schistosomiasis, and trachoma—all of
 which are endemic across Nigeria. In some regions of the country, these diseases are prevalent
 in more than 50 percent of the population.

 Overall, these findings highlight the long-standing deleterious relationship between WASH,
 poverty, and human development outcomes. There is an urgent need for policy makers to

       address deficiencies in the sector and target future efforts toward the most impoverished
       Nigerians, who disproportionately suffer as a result of inadequate access to WASH.


       Message 3: The WASH Sector Is Constrained by
       Inefficient Service Delivery and Failing Facilities
       At least part of the shortcomings in the WASH sector is connected to deficiencies in the
       performance of water agencies, water points, and water distribution schemes. More than
       38 percent of all improved water points and around 46 percent of all water schemes in Nigeria
       are nonfunctional (deemed out of service in 2015, at the time of the survey). Further, nearly
       30 percent of water points and water schemes appeared to fail in the first year of operation
       after construction, presumably because of poor build quality. The report finds that certain
       factors, if more carefully considered during the design, implementation, and operational stages,
       would drastically decrease the failure rates of water points and water schemes.

       When considering most water-utility service indicators, Nigeria underperforms in relation to
       both African and global averages. Data from International Benchmarking Networks for Water
       and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET) highlight that Nigerian SWAs perform below the average level of
       performance for utilities in Africa, for most available indicators. The few exceptions include the
       indicators of staffing levels and chlorine test compliance. The data further indicate that Nigerian
       SWAs underperform global IBNET averages.

       Nigerian SWAs display mixed results and trends in terms of operational efficiency. For example,
       between 2011 and 2015, the continuity of service decreased for the bottom 20 percent of
       SWAs from 5.6 hours to 4.4 hours per day. It remained almost the same for the middle
       60 percent of SWAs, at almost 9 hours per day, and for the top 20 percent, at almost 17 hours
       per day. In the same period, there was a boost in staff productivity across water agencies in
       the bottom and middle percentiles. Staff productivity increased for both the bottom 20 percent
       (from 46.5 to 44 employees per 1,000 connections) and the middle 60 percent (from 24 to
       21  employees per 1,000 connections). Staff productivity for the top 20 percent of SWAs
       remained roughly the same, with the number of staff per 1,000 connections marginally
       decreasing from 9.8 to 9.7.3 WASHCOM managed water schemes perform at least 10 percent
       better in initial years, and around 25 percent better after 10 years of age. The mechanisms
       behind the better performance of community managed schemes needs to be better understood,
       and that lessons from these experiences should be scaled up.

       Hence, if Nigeria is to stabilize its WASH sector, a number of counterproductive trends must be
       reversed. The country must overcome the spectacular share of existing water points and water
       schemes in disrepair (46 percent), as well as the continual erosion of the already inefficient
       services provided by urban water agencies.


       Message 4: To Achieve the SDGs in WASH,
       Nigeria Must Invest at Least Three Times
       More than it Does Today
       Nigeria needs to spend more to achieve the SDGs in WASH. Recent estimates produced by
       the  World Bank suggest that Nigeria must invest about 1.7 percent of its current GDP           , or
       US$8 billion per year, to achieve the SDGs by 2030.4 Although there are no recent estimates
       for overall expenditure in the sector, between 2006 and 2010, the Federal Government of
       Nigeria (FGN) and the states invested close to US$1 billion per year (0.42 percent of GDP) in
       WASH. Capital expenditure was close to 0.28 percent of GDP         , which is lower than regional
       levels (0.7 percent of GDP). Overall, these figures are particularly low in light of what is needed
       to stem the crisis in the sector.


134	                                                                                         A Wake Up Call
 Nigeria also needs to spend more efficiently. Current and future resources must be harnessed
 more efficiently. For instance, in 2015, 44 percent of borehole construction projects committed
 were never started. Figures are even higher for canal and dam projects—70 percent and
 79 percent, respectively. Moreover, only 37 percent of borehole projects, 10 percent of dam
 projects, and 5 percent of canal projects were fully completed.

 In retrospect, Nigeria’s WASH sector is vastly underfinanced, and allocated funds—already
 scarce—are implemented in a very ineffective manner. The exceptional prioritization of
 adequate financing resources is required, though this alone is unlikely to prove sufficient.
 Greater accountability will be needed to ensure that, for instance, budgeted and approved
 projects are actually completed.



 Message 5: Sound Sector Institutions Are
 Needed to Better Sustain Preexisting and
 New WASH-Related Efforts
 Nigeria’s federal system contributes to a diverse institutional landscape for the water sector
 across 36 states, and a challenging context for the implementation of national programs.
 Within the Nigerian federal system, subnational governments are assigned primary responsibility
 for water supply and sanitation; in practice the FGN also plays a substantial role in financing
 capital investments. Coordination of planning and budgeting of investments and of associated
 operations and maintenance is particularly challenging given the number of actors, as well as
 their diverse incentives and priorities for allocating resources to the sector. Thus, policy makers
 should revisit the role of each tier of government, both on paper and in practice, to better
 integrate federal spending on water into state planning and budgeting.

 Reform signaling, rather than implementation, is common in the water sector. Many draft
 national laws, policies, and strategies for public water provision have not been officially adopted
 or approved through appropriate channels. Further, once approved, formal policies have not
 automatically resulted in changes with regard to how water service delivery systems function
 in practice.

 At the state level, the poor quality of public financial management impacts WASH services.
 Data  from the Nigeria States’ Fiscal Database indicate that the average actual federal
 expenditure for housing and community affairs (which includes water supply) ranged from
 46 percent to 62 percent of the approved budget between 2008 and 2013. Public investment
 management is centralized in the state executives’ offices, with governors directly responsible
 for the selection of contractors and monitoring their performance. However, low budget
 credibility and the resulting need for cash rationing introduces some scope for discretionary
 decision making regarding expenditure priorities. A further constraint is that unclear fiscal
 arrangements between LGAs and states contributes to limited LGA autonomy over fiscal and
 human resources, which impacts the provision of rural water in particular.

 State Water Authorities (SWAs) exercise limited autonomy over fiscal and human resources. All
 SWAs are public institutions, though on paper, some have been established as state-owned
 corporations with a degree of autonomy. Yet, even for these agencies, the collection of tariffs
 remains low, leaving SWAs dependent on state governments to finance their operations,
 expenses, and salaries. Further arrangements for human resource management create
 complex lines of accountability for performance. Reliable data to inform decision making and
 performance management—as well as contribute toward greater public accountability—are
 also limited.

 As an example of citizens’ perceptions of water, in Bauchi City, the formal and hidden costs of
 connecting to piped water and negative perceptions of the reliability of utility service are


A Wake Up Call	                                                                                        135
       significant challenges. Piped water is viewed as being more affordable (on a monthly basis)
       than other sources of water. While evidence suggests that citizens would be willing to pay
       official connection fees and tariffs to access piped water services, perceived barriers to
       connecting are high. These include quotes for connection fees that are higher than official
       rates; the need to cover material and labor costs; difficulty negotiating access or paying for
       permission to cross neighboring properties or nearby roads; and terrain issues, such as the
       need to buy and operate booster pumps in hilly areas.

       Sector institutions are the key instruments for improving Nigeria’s beleaguered WASH sector.
       As such, the aforementioned challenges—administrative, financial, and otherwise—must be
       addressed to stem the current crisis. Improving sector institutions will also go a long way in
       terms of building user confidence, thus increasing their likelihood of using public WASH
       services, including piped water.


       Needs Looking Forward
       Failure to address the current situation will have dire consequences for the nation. Without
       immediate attention to this sector failure by policy makers and other key stakeholders, the
       country will at best continue to suffer from the damaging effects of the status quo. At worst,
       the situation will continue to deteriorate, making it increasingly difficult to recover and to
       establish the policies and programming needed to rehabilitate the sector in the future. It is
       thus imperative to take stock of past failings and to take decisive action now, and that such
       action be expanded and sustained as part of a long-term national commitment.

       The analysis in this diagnostic suggests seeking opportunities for reform that can deliver
       better services within the existing political context. Greater attention should be placed on
       further delving into good practices in water and sanitation reform, public-private partnerships
       (PPPs), and service delivery from other countries, and incorporating these lessons into the
       Nigerian context.5 The main binding constraints to water sector development in Nigeria pertain
       to governance and inadequacies in finance in a context of fragmentation:

         ••   The government must demonstrate a long-term commitment to finding pathways for
              better delivery in Nigeria in the context of a federal system with enormous potential, but
              uneven institutional capabilities. Governance is the central reason why Nigerian water
              institutions perform poorly compared to neighboring countries with fewer resources. The
              implementation of functional responsibilities by federal and state governments, the low
              priority of water on the political agenda, and misaligned incentives and weak accountability
              systems hinder the enactment of policies and institutional reforms. For instance, the
              Nigeria Urban Water Supply Reform Project (NUWSRP) was launched in 2004 with the
              support of the World Bank, the African Development Bank (AFDB), the U.S. Agency for
              International Development (USAID), and the Agence Française de Développement (AFD);
              its aim was to assist in the corporatization of state water agencies and the establishment
              of regulatory capacities. However, it has been initiated in several states, but has yet to
              be fully and sustainably enacted in any. These efforts highlight the need to find new
              pathways for external actors (including the federal government) to incentive better
              performance, allowing subnational governments to find innovative solutions, share
              lessons learned, and scale up what works. Water service providers continue to be
              subject to direct political interference by state governments, enjoy minimal autonomy,
              and have few incentives to improve performance. Water providers are chronically
              underfinanced: they have inadequate tariff revenues and operate on shoestring budgets,
              incompatible with the basic operations, maintenance, and management functions of a
              utility. The establishment of sustainable independent state regulatory agencies is also
              failing, inviting consideration of more pragmatic alternatives, such as regulatory
              provisions embedded in state-SWA performance contracts. Finally, SWAs offer very little
              transparency and accountability to their consumers, and civil society is only marginally
              involved in helping to improve the sector. As a result of such governance failings, utility

         service that should support socioeconomic development of the nation gives way to
         unsafe, expensive, and unequal coping water supply alternatives, such as informal
         vending and, for those who can afford them, private boreholes.

    ••   To improve the current situation, there must be a strengthened long-term commitment
         to governance and institutional reforms, and a push for reforms that help better align
         institutional incentives, offer more robust accountability mechanisms, and prioritize
         financing and capacity building in the sector. A renewed federal-state coalition may be
         needed in the WASH sector, by which federal and states agree to clarified responsibilities,
         and by which a federal mandate is upheld to guide, incentivize, support, and oversee
         sector development efforts by the states. Such national recommitment to give Nigerians
         the WASH services they deserve would also benefit from wide political endorsements to
         ensure continuity across electoral cycles. Given the challenge at hand, a strong
         participation of civil society for representing users and for monitoring governance and
         service gains should be valued by governments as indispensable.

    ••   The government should invest in closing implementation gaps, supporting service
         delivery capabilities in the water sector, and promoting greater integration of the private
         sector into the water and sanitation sectors. At both the federal and state levels, policy
         making, oversight, planning, and regulatory roles are often impaired by uneven institutional
         capacities, insufficient resources, and inadequate data. Public service providers face
         similar challenges, with unclear lines of accountability and limited incentives to perform.
         The poor performance of the public water sector lies in stark contrast with the dynamism
         and explosive growth of alternative private providers, such as informal water vendors and
         well drillers in urban areas. Institutional and service delivery capabilities must also be
         strengthened to ensure the sustainability of Partnership for Expanded Water, Supply,
         Sanitation & Hygiene (PEWASH), Nigeria’s updated rural Water Supply and Sanitation
         Services (WSS) program. The sector requires pragmatic approaches to scaling up
         capacity-building programs, which build on locally owned solutions to bottlenecks that
         impair performance. The sector also requires pragmatic approaches to human resource
         management to better align incentives, promote greater accountability, and encourage
         the retention of talent. Moreover, there should be greater, and a more strategic, promotion
         of private sector involvement in water management, paving the way for the introduction
         of new methods and skills. Nigeria lacks an example of a well performing urban SWA by
         regional or international standards. In this context, the careful introduction of PPPs in the
         operation and maintenance (O&M) of a few selected water systems can be a potentially
         game-changing opportunity: allowing the sector to witness normal, modern O&M, to
         replenish its skills and learn from experimentation, while also placing emulation pressure
         on public operations to offer better, more efficient services. Similarly, in the interest of
         customers and citizens, the role of the informal water vending, well-drilling, and fecal
         sludge disposal businesses should be better recognized within the existing legal and
         political frameworks, and better integrated—through regulation and capacitation—into
         the water and sanitation service delivery chains.

    ••   The water sector requires greater and more efficient financing and investment, including
         upgraded tariff and subsidies structures and a more accountable budget processes. The
         large deficits in WSS service access suggest that chronic underinvestment in infrastructure
         expansion, upgrade, and renewal is the norm. Poor coordination among federal and state
         actors leads to highly inefficient public expenditure. Coverage of recurrent O&M costs
         through tariff revenues and budget support and subsidies is insufficient, leading to the
         systemic neglect of maintenance needs, erosion of service standards, and loss of market
         share to informal service options. An updated water pricing and financing structure is
         required to promote a more effective cost-recovery process, and to provide more substantial
         budget support for investment and renewal needs. States’ attitudes toward tariff reform
         and regulation should evolve, recognizing that inadequately low tariffs are contributing
         to  the disappearance of SWAs’ service, forcing citizens, especially in poorer areas, to
         buy  scarce, unsafe, and much more expensive water supplies from private  vendors.

              To help attain cost-recovery and affordability objectives, there should be a greater emphasis
              on decoupling tariffs and subsidies, with tariffs consistent with cost-recovery and
              consumption subsidies more narrowly targeted on the poor households who need them.
              To incentivize better sector performance, it is also imperative to push forward on a financing
              structure that is more accountable and driven by results. The establishment of rules-
              based funds—to channel federal budget support to state investments in a more
              transparent manner—would be an important tool for empowering the federal leadership,
              and to guide and incentivize sector development and reform by the states. Renewed
              emphasis is also needed on a long-term utility credit-worthiness agenda that promotes
              access to commercial finance.

         ••   Additionally, in light of the synergies between WASH and other sectors, a multisectoral
              approach is needed. Access to WASH services in Nigeria is sharply conditioned by
              differences in levels of poverty, education, wealth, geographic location, and health. So to
              generate a sustained impact, the WASH sector must be fully coordinated with the
              interventions and programming of associated sectors, such as public health, education,
              urban and rural development, environment, and governance. The combination of such
              interventions will have more impact than the sum of their parts. New efforts should also
              consider geographical mapping and targeting to ensure that programs reach populations
              most in need.

       The country can and must take significant action to improve its water and sanitation sector.
       With the knowledge put forward in this report, subsequent dialogue, and ample action, it is
       possible for Nigeria to transcend the current crisis in the sector. Achieving the SDGs is still
       within reach. The costs of not moving forward in the sector are simply too great to ignore; the
       lives of 182 million individuals—and the fate of the nation as a whole—are linked to progress
       in this sector.


       Notes
       1.	 The JMP estimates that approximately 69 percent of the population have access to
           improved water; however, this estimate is based on the linear interpolation of different
           surveys in the country. The 61 percent figure provided here was computed from the NWSS
           2015, for which 200,000 households were interviewed, across every ward in the country.
       2.	 This loss of life years is formally expressed as disability adjusted life years (DALYs).
       3.	 It is also necessary to note that the top 20 percent SWAs are the largest, accounting for
           an average of 70 percent of the total number of connections in Nigeria during 2011–15.
       4.	 In 2015 prices.
       5.	 A synthesis report on all 18 countries diagnosed as part of the World Bank WASH Poverty
           Diagnostics will be published, which will include rich information on the challenges and
           good practices facing the WASH sector across countries, and can serve as a useful anchor
           document to incorporate relevant lessons for improving the WASH sector in Nigeria.
