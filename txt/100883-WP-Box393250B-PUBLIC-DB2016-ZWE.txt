THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name

Zimbabwe is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                 Legal form: Private Limited Liability Company

Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,            Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
along with the associated time and cost. These
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       File the memorandum and articles of association with the Registrar
       of Companies

       The law provides for model or boilerplate articles of incorporation. On
       the date of incorporation, the Registrar of Companies must be notified
       of the appointments of the company’s directors and secretaries. This is
       done by filing the particulars of the directors and secretaries and any
       changes therein or a list of directors and principal officers (Form CR 14).
       These documents must be accompanied by a duplicate original or a
       printed notarized copy.

       Registration Fee is US$ 5 for every US$ 100 or part thereof of the
       nominal/authorized capital of the company with a minimum fee of US$
       100.
       In practice, companies usually start up with a low amount of capital to
       avoid the exorbitant stamp duty. A company may also issue shares at a
       premium to circumvent the requirement.

        Before an application for approval of building plans can be
        submitted to the local authority, approval must first be obtained
        from the Inspector of Factories. This is a separate application and
        carries its own application fee, established by the Inspector. The        30 days                USD 429

        BuildCo must submit the following documents at the same time:
        the building permit application, the application for the factories
        inspection, the TPD-1 form for the planning permit (only if
        needed which is not the case for the Doing Business case study),
        and the architects' and structural engineers' drawings and
        certificates to the relevant local authority for approvals, under
        the Regional, Town, and Country Planning Act and the model
        building bylaws. The application must be accompanied by a

      plans, the Chief Building Inspector makes a final assessment and
      issues an approval of building plans to the applicant. The form
      contains a commencement of work notice that must be
      submitted by the applicant once the footings are ready for
      inspection. Subsequently, all phases of the construction must be
      approved by the Building Inspectorate.

      Procedural and approval costs are either 1% or 1.75% of the
      construction cost, but this varies from one authority to another.
      The time required for the entire procedure depends on the local
      authority; in Harare, it is usually not less than 6 months and can
      be up to a year.

      Because the approval cost is based on a percentage of the total
      construction cost, a certain amount is paid based on the
      estimated cost. However, the local authority may ask for the
      difference between the estimate and the actual cost at the end
      of the project (a common requirement). The cost of completion
      depends on whether the developer is prepared to fund the pre-
      purchase option. In addition, many developers close an
      insurance bond with the building contractor on the value of the
      construction materials.

      Should construction works commence prior to the approval of
      the building plans the local authority now imposes a
      "Regularisation Fee", or fine, of US$5,000.

      Agency: Harare City Council



      Request and receive inspection from Building Inspectorate
      upon completion of foundation

      Delays frequently occur because the City of Harare inspectors
      cannot get transportation to inspect a site. Even if offered a lift
      to the site by the contractor or consultant, the inspectors are not
      allowed to accept it because they are not insured for travel
      provided by a third party.

      Theoretically, inspections are conducted once a month. A final
      inspection will occur only if specifically requested (but is required
3     for obtaining the occupancy permit). Theoretically, the builder         30 days       no charge
      must stop construction until the inspection is conducted, but
      doing so is impractical. The City of Harare inspectors generally
      allow a structural engineer to cover the inspections of
      foundations. In practice, since 2007 due to lack of fuel and
      means of transportation, inspections are no longer conducted.
      Companies use their own engineers for inspections during
      construction.

      * Request and obtain water and sewage connection from
      Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA)

      In 2007, municipal water supplies have been taken over by a new
      authority, the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA).
      Obtaining a new connection now requires proof of ownership of
      the stand and account clearance on any other water billing and is
      undertaken by the developer (in this case BuildCo) or its agents.

      Separate applications are made by the construction company for
      water and sewerage connections. There may be an additional
      charge for this determined by the local authority.
7                                                                                  1 day       USD 2,390
      BuildCo completes and lodges an application for a “new water
      connection and supply” form, available at the Water and
      Sewerage Branch of ZINWA. In addition to the form, BuildCo
      must provide the following:
      • A letter of commitment addressed to the Director of Works
      stating BuildCo’s intention to proceed with a connection
      • A statement of the quality of water required, to determine the
      appropriate pipe size and meter needed

      The branch will issue the applicant a T.W. number and notate the
      application form. A receipt for the application specifying the fees
      to be paid is issued. Fees come in two parts, a supply deposit

      and a connection fee, and would be USD 626.00.

      The applicant must take the notated application form and the
      receipt to the City Treasury Office, pay the required fees, and
      have the branch receipt machine-endorsed with the payment.

      The cost depends on the type of water supply required. The
      applicant must purchase the water meter; ZINWA are no longer
      able to supply water meters. Application, connection fee, and
      account deposit amount to USD 1,764.00 for a 25-milimeter
      connection. There is no charge for the application, but there is an
      upfront charge before the connection is made.

      The embossed receipt and the application form are returned to
      the branch, which requests that a job number be issued by the
      Costing Office. The branch then issues a Location Advice
      internally for the work to be undertaken. The applicant is
      required to complete an Installation of Water Service form
      indicating the site of the connection.

      Where fire hose reels on site are required (a requirement under
      the building bylaws for any industrial/warehouse building
      exceeding 400 sq. m. in floor area), a 2-inch (50mm) water meter
      is required.

      Approval by the Fire Department is required to obtain an
      occupancy permit. Inspections are made by appointment only. At
      least one week’s notice is required most of the time. The same
9     issues as with other inspections apply (no transportation, long        7 days       no charge
      delay). Therefore, in practice, the architect or draftsman picks up
      the inspector and brings the inspector to the site. Otherwise, it
      might take weeks before the inspector visits the site.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      The seller applies for the rates clearance certificate to the local
      authority under whose jurisdiction the property falls

      This application is performed by a conveyancor (fees already covered by
      Procedure 1). The local authority will provide an assessment of how
      much is payable by way of advance rates and outstanding rates, if any.
      In Zimbabwe there is at the moment no land tax, instead rates are paid
      to the local authority. So every property in Zimbabwe is subject to these
      rates paid by the property owner to the municipality or any other local
      authority for the services provided, like refuse, sewage etc. Before one
      can transfer a property all the rates due should be paid to the local
      authority, so it depends on outstanding amount due to the municipality.
      The rates in Zimbabwe are based on the value of the property, size and
      whether there are improvements or not. It is also important to note that
      the value of the property is a function of the location of the property. For               USD 500 (Approx
      the property we are talking about the rates would therefore be around                      average for high

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
