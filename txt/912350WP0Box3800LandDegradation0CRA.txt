                              Land degradation is a critical global environmental issue. It directly affects the livelihoods of
                              millions of people, many of them poor and vulnerable in the world’s drylands, where more
                              than 500 million hectares of land is degraded. It also negatively affects the world’s ability
                              to increase the production of food that is necessary to feed the rapidly growing global
                              population. It is therefore critical to maintain the environmental health and sustainability of
                              production landscapes. This requires land management approaches that take into account
                              all key natural resource components, principally soil, water and biomass.

                              For this reason, the GEF’s work in land degradation, specifically desertification and

                              deforestation, emphasizes the need to take an integrated approach to sustainable land
Global Environment Facility   management. This publication reviews the GEF’s portfolio of experiences dating back
                              to 2002. Since that time the GEF has invested close to US$0.5 billion in more than 100
                              integrated land management projects, and leveraged more than US$2 billion in co-financing.

                              This report analyzes how the GEF financing has been able to catalyze the application of
                              integrated approaches to combat land degradation. The analysis unpacks the processes,
                              practices, tools and knowledge innovation embodied in the various projects and programs.
                              It shows that we have come a long way in demonstrating the value-added of these
                              approaches for safeguarding ecosystem services in the context of improving the livelihoods
                              of poor and vulnerable communities.

                              The analysis also shows how appropriate management of production landscapes can help
                              achieve multiple environmental benefits—from biodiversity conservation, to climate change
                              mitigation and adaptation, and protection of international water resources. A key message is
                              that livelihoods and environmental protection are absolutely inseparable, especially in many
                              of the world’s dryland areas: Only by ensuring that land-user’s livelihood needs are met can
                              the risk of further degradation of fragile land ecologies be mitigated.

                              It is my hope that this publication will be a source of inspiration for countries and their
                              partners, as they seek to combat land degradation and ensure sustainable rural livelihoods,
                              in particular for smallholder farmers, pastoralists and herders.

                                       projects for environment and development benefits.

                                       A total of 101 projects financed by the GEF under OP12
                                       and OP15 were identified as relevant for the portfolio
                                       review. All of the projects were financed during GEF-3
                                       and GEF-4 and therefore either are in the late stages of

                                       the cohort was analyzed to determine the nature of GEF

                                       land management approaches. To analyze trends, the
                                       review took into account the full amount of GEF resources
                                       invested and cofinancing in all 101 projects and programs.
                                       Regional trends were based on the four GEF regions:
                                       Africa (including North African countries), Asia (includ-

                                       Learning Missions

                                       The purpose of learning missions was to engage and
                                       consult with key stakeholders on each project’s overall
                                       goal of generating multiple benefits through integrated
                                       approaches in production systems, with a specific focus
                                       on understanding the catalytic effect of the GEF’s
                                       financing in the project. Of the cohort of 101 projects
                                       included in the portfolio review, four were visited
                                       during learning missions by a team from the GEF
                                       Secretariat. The four selected were subprojects under
                                       the Country Pilot Partnerships Program between the
                                       GEF and the governments of Burkina Faso, China, and
                                       India, and they offered opportunities for learning
                                       across multiple scales. At the time of the learning
                                       mission, the projects were either completed or in an
                                       advanced stage of implementation. Prior to each
                                       mission, the GEF Secretariat team reviewed relevant
                                       project documentation, including project implementa-

     BOX 2.1 The Ecosystem Approach
     The ecosystem approach is a strategy for the integrated management of land, water, and living resources that promote conservation and
     sustainable use in an equitable way.

     An ecosystem approach is based on the application of appropriate scientific methodologies focused on levels of biological organization, which
     encompass the essential structure, processes, functions, and interactions among organisms and their environment. It recognizes that humans,
     with their cultural diversity, are an integral component of many ecosystems.

     This focus on structure, processes, functions and interactions is consistent with the definition of “ecosystem” provided in Article 2 of the
     Convention on Biological Diversity.

     The ecosystem approach requires adaptive management to deal with the complex and dynamic nature of ecosystems and the absence of
     complete knowledge or understanding of their functioning.

     The ecosystem approach does not preclude other management and conservation approaches, such as biosphere reserves, protected areas, and
     single-species conservation programs, as well as other approaches carried out under existing national policy and legislative frameworks, but
     could, rather, integrate all these approaches and other methodologies to deal with complex situations.

BOX 3.1 Capacity Building and Policy Reforms for Integrated
Ecosystem Management
In Burkina Faso, the World Bank–Global Environment Facility (GEF) Sahel Integrated Lowland Ecosystem Management Project was designed to
pilot integrated ecosystem management practices in targeted microwatersheds. A major component of the project was to strengthen capacities
at the local level, with a focus on village-level institutions to facilitate decision making and conflict resolution. Because the project was linked
directly to a nationwide rural development program, the local piloting of natural resources governance in agropastoral systems was designed to
influence the government’s decentralization policy. Growing tensions between farmers and herders in the country’s fragile Sahelian agroecolo-
gies required an appropriate policy and regulatory framework to help promote integrated approaches for addressing multiple environmental and
livelihood needs.

In China, the Asian Development Bank–GEF project on Management and Policy Support to Combat Land Degradation specifically targeted legal
and policy frameworks for controlling land degradation as a means of strengthening the enabling environment and building capacity for inte-
grated approaches to sustainable land management in six affected provinces. During the framework development, the integrated ecosystem
management approach was incorporated into current provincial laws and regulations. Capacity building was used to raise awareness of the
benefits of integrated ecosystem management, to increase the knowledge and skills of decision makers at provincial and local levels, and to
establish entry points for integrated approaches in existing legal instruments relevant to natural resources and land degradation.

     BOX 3.2 Mainstreaming Biodiversity through Integrated Ecosystem
     Management
     Mainstreaming biodiversity in production systems is a major priority of the biodiversity focal area, for which 13 projects were financed under
     OP12 to apply the integrated ecosystem management approach. The framework for these projects included components on (a) conservation
     planning to integrate biodiversity in production landscapes and in the context of protected area management; (b) practices to safeguard biodi-
     versity in the context of alternative livelihoods from production systems; (c) financial incentives to promote mainstreaming, such as payments
     for ecosystem services; and (d) improvement of enabling conditions through policy, regulatory, and institutional frameworks. All of these
     components are consistent with principles of the ecosystem approach, including focusing on sustainable land management and improving the
     socioeconomic conditions of local communities to reduce pressure on natural habitats. Project investments contributed to capacity building for
     resource users and other relevant stakeholders by increasing access to knowledge, technologies, and best practices for sustainable use and
     management of resources in production systems.

     The mainstreaming projects demonstrate synergy between the Biodiversity and Land Degradation focal areas with respect to safeguarding
     ecosystem services that underpin the sustainability of production systems. In Africa, the projects enhanced synergy through integrated
     ecosystem management in agricultural and forest production landscapes, with a strong focus on capacity building and improvement of the live-
     lihoods of communities. In Asia, projects focused on rangeland and forest production landscapes in the context of protected area management,
     with emphasis on institutional strengthening, assessment, and monitoring of global environmental benefits. In Europe and Central Asia and
     Latin America and the Caribbean, mainstreaming projects in agriculture and forest production landscapes addressed legal and regulatory
     frameworks, scaling up of resource management practices, and capacity building.




     BOX 3.3 Monitoring Global Environmental Benefits at Farm Scale
     The World Bank–Global Environment Facility Drylands Management Project in Kazakhstan was designed to promote the conservation, rehabili-
     tation, and sustainable use of natural resources in marginal cereal-growing areas in the Shetsky rayon of the Karaganda oblast in Kazakhstan.
     The focus was on advancing sustainable land use systems, with potential for replication in similar areas across the country and in other Central
     Asian countries. A key feature of the project’s approach was improving knowledge for quantification and monitoring of carbon sequestration
     under different land use types as evidence of sustainable land use. As a result, 140,000 hectares of restored land that was brought into sustain-
     able production could be assessed for its contribution to carbon sequestration, in addition to biodiversity conservation and control of land
     degradation. By engaging small and medium farmers, the project also established the foundation for scaling up the approach to include other
     farmers, which increased the potential for generating quantifiable global environmental benefits in the context of improving productivity.

BOX 3.4 Framework for Monitoring Global Environmental Benefits in
Production Systems across Multiple Scales
The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations–United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)–Global Environment Facility
(GEF) Land Degradation and Assessment in Drylands project was a global effort to increase understanding of land degradation trends. Using a
multiscale approach (local, national, and global), the project developed and piloted strategies, tools, and methods to assess and quantify the
nature, extent, and severity of land degradation and the overall ecosystem resilience of dryland ecosystems. In addition to a global framework,
the project also facilitated opportunities for baseline assessment and monitoring at the subregional level, based on six pilot countries from
different regions: Latin America (Argentina); East Asia (China); the Caribbean (Cuba); West Africa (Senegal); Southern, Central, and Eastern
Africa (South Africa); and the Near East, North Africa, and Mediterranean region (Tunisia).

The United Nations Development Programme–GEF project Ensuring Impacts from SLM—Development of a Global Indicator System (called
KM:Land) was also designed as a global effort to strengthen adaptive management of sustainable land management projects for generating
and monitoring environmental benefits. The focus was specifically on developing indicators for monitoring benefits from combating land degra-
dation in production systems, including strategic guidance on metric measurement methodologies and project intervention logic. The project
approach enhanced links with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and also helped to inform the development of a
tracking tool and knowledge management system for the GEF Land Degradation focal area.

The UNEP–GEF Carbon Benefits Project was designed to promote carbon as a global environmental benefit from sustainable land management
in production systems. The focus was on developing a cost-effective, user-friendly, yet scientifically rigorous methodology for modeling,
measuring, and monitoring carbon and greenhouse gas mitigation benefits in projects dealing with natural resources in different land use
systems. This methodology will ensure a standardized approach for quantifying and assessing carbon benefits in projects addressing natural
resource management. The tools will allow project teams to establish baselines for carbon and greenhouse gases at the landscape level and to
monitor and account for changes in carbon stocks during project implementation.

BOX 4.1 Achieving Multi–Focal Area Synergies through Integrated Approaches
The Uttarakhand watershed project demonstrates how multi–focal area synergies can be achieved through an integrated approach that links
global environmental benefits to local livelihoods. The OP12 project was designed to integrate management of land, water, and forests on the
basis of the food, water, energy, and income security needs of local communities and depending on their vulnerability to climate change in
microwatersheds. In particular, GEF financing helped to generate global environmental benefits:

Integrated watershed management. Capturing and efficiently managing runoff for year-round availability of water was a major priority for
farmers, especially women, who also spent considerable time fetching water for domestic needs. Hence, interventions were selected to increase
water security and reverse degradation on the fragile slopes. Ponds and pits were used to capture water on the upper levels of slopes, while
practices such as terrace repairs with vegetative boundaries, rainwater harvesting, dry stone check dams, irrigation channels, and riverbank
protection were used for soil conservation and erosion control.

Renewable energy alternatives. In addition to restoring traditional water mills by improving hydrological flows, the project promoted pine needle
briquettes, solar stoves, and biogas as alternative sources of energy for cooking and heating. These options arose out of the practice of fuel
wood collection by women, which was a major driver of deforestation and soil degradation on the slopes. Making pine needle briquettes for
fuel was also embraced by communities because removal of pine needles reduced the risk of dry-season fires in the watershed. These interven-
tions were therefore important for community livelihoods because they addressed household energy needs, but at the same time, they also
reduced greenhouse gas emissions in the watersheds.

Forest conservation. To protect fragile slopes and rejuvenate hydrological flows, the project focused on reducing the felling of trees for fuel
wood, which also addressed the need to protect natural forests as critical habitat for wildlife. Communities were empowered by the state
government to assume responsibility over reserve forests, including practices for restoration of degraded areas. To further reduce pressure on
the native oak forest vegetation, high-value species such as medicinal and aromatic plants were cultivated on the slopes.

By integrating all of the interventions within the same microwatersheds, communities can more effectively contribute to the overall functioning
of production systems, as well as the sustainability of ecosystem services that underpin those production systems and the communities’ liveli-
hoods. These essential services include hydrological flows for irrigation, drinking, and power mills; forest cover to protect the slopes and
conserve native species; and vegetative cover, including high-value perennial grasses for feeding livestock and pine trees, which are a source of
alternative fuels as pine needle briquettes.
