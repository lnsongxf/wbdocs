About KNOWLEDGE & RESEARCH
The World Bank Group’s current partnership with Malaysia is focused on knowledge-
sharing. It is centered on support for Malaysia’s vision to join the ranks of high-income
economies by 2020 through inclusive and sustainable growth, and to share its lessons
with developing countries.

In March 2016, the World Bank Group officially launched its Global Knowledge and
Research Hub in Malaysia. The new Hub is the first of its kind, serving both as a
field presence in Malaysia and as a global knowledge and research hub. It focuses
on sharing Malaysia’s people-centered development expertise and creating new
innovative policy research on local, regional and global issues.

Knowledge & Research reports are flagship work emanating from the teams based
in the Malaysia Hub.

The Malaysia Development Experience Series captures key lessons from Malaysia
relevant for emerging economies in Asia, Africa and elsewhere that are transitioning
out of poverty and into shared prosperity.

Greenback 2.0 Johor Bahru Report: Migrant Workers’ Remittances from Malaysia   3
    Acknowledgements
    This survey is the result of a partnership between Bank Negara Malaysia and the World
    Bank Group. Bank Negara Malaysia and the World Bank Group would like to thank all
    the participating communities, associations, the State of Johor, namely the city of Johor
    Bahru and, most importantly, the migrants who gave us their time and attention during
    the interview sessions.

    In recent years, global remittance flows to developing countries have received increasing
    attention from policymakers and the international community. Remittance flows have
    grown steadily over the years totalling USD582 billion in 2015, of which USD432 billion
    went to developing countries, involving 232 million migrants. More than 700 million
    people depended on these remittance flows and paid an excessive price in remitting
    their money, as the global average cost for sending remittances in 2016 stands at 7.6%.
    The efforts of the international community and the adoption of the “5x5 objective” by
    the G8 and G20 – reducing the average cost by five percentage points – would save
    USD16 billion per year. These funds would simply remain with the migrants and their
    families and could contribute significantly to improve the living conditions of the migrants
    themselves as well as reduce poverty in their countries of origin. Recently, in Brisbane,
    the G20 have renewed their commitment to the cost reduction objective.

    Project Greenback 2.0 aims at increasing efficiency in the market for remittances through
    an innovative approach: promoting change inspired by the real needs of the migrants
    and their families.

    In Project Greenback 2.0, Remittance Champion Cities are selected. Previously, Turin
    (Italy) and Montreuil (France) were selected. In Asia, Johor Bahru (Malaysia) was selected
    as the first Remittance Champion City as it has a large number of migrant workers from
    Indonesia, Nepal, China, Myanmar and Vietnam. The Greenback 2.0 Project, Johor
    Bahru further builds on the ideas and initiatives of the previous Champion Cities and
    implements good practices and lessons learned.

         Foreword
         Remittances have an important role in a country’s development. They are a key source of
         external development finance for many developing countries, contribute to poverty reduction
         and improve social welfare. ASEAN as a region has more than 21 million nationals living
         abroad, and is home to more than 10 million migrants. More than 2 million of these migrants
         live and work in Malaysia. Their families – mostly in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, India and
         the Philippines – depend on the money that they send home to school their children, pay for
         medical care, build homes and generate other sources of income.

         On 29 November 2015 Bank Negara Malaysia Governor Muhammad Ibrahim launched, in
         partnership with the World Bank Group, the Greenback 2.0 Project in Johor Bahru, Malaysia.
         Project Greenback 2.0 aims at increasing efficiency in the market for remittances through an
         innovative approach: promoting change inspired by the real needs of the migrants and their
         families.

         The reasons for BNM’s engagement with Greenback 2.0 are threefold: Firstly, the initiative
         ensures access to formal remittance channels and guarantees a safe transfer of migrant
         earnings. Secondly, it reduces the remittance cost so that migrants keep more of their
         hard-earned money and SMEs can increase their competitiveness. Thirdly, it reduces the
         proportion of remittances that are transferred through unauthorized channels. Through the
         implementation of Greenback 2.0 significant strides have been made, making a real difference
         in the lives of individuals and their families, while helping raise the competitiveness of the
         Malaysian economy and safeguarding the integrity of its financial system.

         Bank Negara Malaysia and the World Bank Group would like to express their appreciation
         to the Project Greenback 2.0 partners, for their support and exceptional commitment to this
         initiative and its important goals. Due to the success of the Greenback 2.0 model, efforts are
         currently undertaken to replicate the model across the country at large and we hope that
         Malaysia’s experience with Greenback 2.0 will inspire other countries in the region to explore
         similar opportunities.

Introduction

This report will share key findings from the survey,
starting with an overview of the global and Malaysian
context of international remittance flows in the last
decade, as a general framework of the study.

Next, the report will present the objectives of the research and related survey design and sampling
techniques for the fieldwork, while a specific methodological note is added at the end of the report on
the fieldwork phase.

The following section articulates findings of the analysis on the 401 interviews collected. Following a brief
description on the demographic and the economic conditions of the informants, this section focuses on
the analysis of the migrants’ remittance behaviours and needs.

Finally the report concludes with a summary of the main findings and provides recommendations on
how to address the barriers and issues faced by the migrants in Johor Bahru pertaining to financial and
remittance services, as well as potential areas of further investigation.

Migration and remittances: The context of the survey

Global context
In 2016, remittance flows to developing countries are projected to reach USD442 billion, marking an
increase of 0.8 percent over 20151 . The importance of these remittance inflows cannot be underestimated.
At the macro level, they provide an important source of foreign exchange and contribute to a country’s
balance of payments. At the micro level, remittances constitute an important source of household income
and support basic consumption, including investments in education, entrepreneurship and healthcare.
Remittance flows are significantly larger than official development assistance (ODA), more stable than foreign
investment to developing countries and are less likely to be volatile in the wake of external shocks, and can
in fact increase in times of crisis (i.e. disasters and humanitarian emergencies) (Figure 1).

In short, remittances generally reduce the level and severity of poverty and lead to higher human capital
accumulation, greater health and education expenditures, better access to information and communication
technologies, improved access to formal financial sector services, enhanced small business investment,
more entrepreneurship, and better preparedness for natural disasters such as droughts, earthquakes, and
flooding as well as reduced child labour2.

The urban workers sample consists of                                           Indonesian migrant workers in Johor Bahru. Since
250 respondents who are employed in the                                        Greenback 2.0 is also implemented in Lombok this

For both samples there was a stronger focus                                    No minimum thresholds were applied in terms of

a larger number of respondents from Lombok,                                    migrant workers who have resided in Malaysia for a

     consists of those who have not sent money to their home country in the past 12 months. These respondents were included to provide insight on
     their knowledge of remittance and willingness to participate in future financial education initiatives.

Sampling method and surveying technique

The urban migrant worker respondents were sourced through the free-find methodology whereby the
interviewers randomly intercepted respondents in areas with higher density of migrant workers. The
interviews were carried out face-to-face at the intercepted location or at the respondent’s preferred location
within the vicinity.

Plantation migrant worker respondents were interviewed using the central location test methodology
whereby the respondents were gathered in one location to be interviewed individually. Three plantation
estates’ management teams recruited migrant workers in their estates who were willing to participate in
the study. The workers who consented to participate in the study were provided with transportation to the
interview location arranged by their employers.

A single questionnaire was used for both segments. The questionnaire comprised of closed-
ended questions only, with questions programmed to be asked or skipped depending on prior
responses provided.

All responses were recorded via a programmed survey link using tablets. The interviews with the
urban workers were conducted in English, Bahasa Malaysia, or Mandarin, depending on the respondent’s
preferred language. Most interviews with plantation workers were conducted in Bahasa Malaysia. To facilitate
comprehension, the plantation respondents were provided the option to view the questionnaire in their
native languages of Bahasa Indonesia or Bengali for questions that require prompt responses. The average
length of interviews was 17 minutes.

Figure 7 provides a breakdown by job type across both segments and reveals that the share of
unskilled blue collar workers in the plantation is almost twice as high than in the urban segment and
the share of skilled blue collar workers in the urban segment is 27% higher than in the plantation
segment. The other job types which belong to the white collar job category are largely represented in the
urban segment, whereas in the plantation segment, workers employed as managers/executives, or those
performing unskilled and other skilled white collar jobs, are hardly represented.

Across segments, Chinese workers are dominating the skilled white collar category. They are the
only community with workers holding titles/job positions as Director/General Manager/Vice President. They
also lead in the owner/partner category, followed by Vietnamese and Indians. It is noteworthy that in the
aforementioned job categories, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal are not represented across
segments.

In the unskilled white collar category, the Vietnamese are leading, followed by the Indian workers.
The representation of other nationalities in this category is negligible (<4%). In the unskilled blue collar
category for the urban segment, workers from India, Indonesia and Bangladesh have the highest percentage
of concentration. The workers in the plantation segment consist of Indonesians and Bangladeshis whose jobs
fall under blue collar job category. However, the division of migrants in the unskilled blue collar category
is different depending on the nationality. Three quarters of Bangladeshi workers belong to this category
whereas only half of the Indonesian workers do.

In the urban segment, higher education levels correlate with higher job positions, but in the plantation
segment, this is not the case. Independent of their education levels (e.g. no education as well as senior/
tertiary education), the workers perform the same type of skilled or unskilled blue collar work.

Industry sector of occupation
Plantation workers exclusively fall under Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing sector. In contrast, the
distribution of the urban migrant workers sample by sector of employment is diversified (Figure 8).
For the urban segment, the service industry employs more than half of the urban migrant workers, with the
accommodation and food services industry share almost being equal to the wholesale and retail trade share
(14% and 15% respectively). The group of migrants involved in other business services represents 16% of
the service industry. The manufacturing and construction industries represent 28% and 16% respectively of
total employment in the sample. Although not shown in detail, there are significant differences in the gender
distribution among specific sectors of employment. Male migrants are concentrated in the construction and
manufacturing sectors while women are overrepresented in the human health and social activities industry.
The composition of the accommodation and food services industry is more gender balanced.

Method and frequency of salary payment/bank
account ownership
In general, across segments, workers are predominantly paid in cash (Figure 11). However, the
differences between plantation and urban workers are substantial. The vast majority (89%) of plantation
workers receive their salary in cash and only one in ten receive them via bank transfer. When compared
with urban workers, one notices that salary payment methods are more balanced with 58% of respondents
receiving their salary in cash and 42% in their bank account. The differences in salary payment methods
across segments impact bank account ownership which is 2.5 times lower for plantation workers compared
with urban workers. Most of the workers receive their salary on a monthly basis. Nevertheless, the group of
workers who receive their salary on a bi-weekly basis is 4.5 times larger in the plantation segment compared
to the urban segment.

Savings and financial inclusion
An entire section of the survey was dedicated to understanding respondents’ saving habits and
financial inclusion levels. The data gathered reveals whether migrant workers are able to save money and
what the mean savings and savings rate is per nationality working in plantations and urban areas.




Savings
Across segments, 94% of workers have savings. Of the 6% who are unable to save money, 83% are
urban workers. Within this group, the inability to save differs among nationalities (Figure 12). Those who did
not have any savings said that they remitted money to dependents instead of saving, or that their monthly
salaries were too low to allow for savings. The former correlates with the nationalities in Figure 13 who have
a higher incidence in remitting money on a monthly basis than other nationalities.

For those who are able to save some of their income each month, the amount can be significant
(Figure 14). In the urban segment the Chinese migrant workers, followed by the Vietnamese, are saving
the most on a monthly basis and migrant workers from Myanmar are saving the least. Indonesian migrant
workers in the urban segment save more than those working in plantations, but Bangladeshi migrant workers
in the plantation segment are saving more than Bangladeshi migrant workers in the urban segment. Overall,

Banking products and services
About 55% of the migrant workers in the urban segment and 22% of the migrant workers in the
plantation segment have a bank account (Figure 16). However, differences within each segment are
significant. In the urban segment only 14% of the Indian migrant workers are “banked” which contrasts
sharply with the Vietnamese migrant workers who, with 91%, are highly banked. The fact that wages for
plantation workers are mostly paid in cash, combined with the remote location of plantations, which are
further from banks, seem to be factors that impact bank account ownership as shown in the discrepancy of
bank account ownership percentages between Indonesian and Bangladeshi workers in both segments.

Those respondents without a bank account were asked about the reasons for not having one
(Figure 17). In the urban segment the number one reason for not having a bank account is simply that
migrant workers do not have a need for one. In the plantation segment, migrant workers state that the
distance to banks is the main reason for not having a bank account. It is interesting to see that there is no
trust issue with banks. Those who do not feel qualified to open a bank account claim they cannot do so
because they do not have the proper documentation (70%), their salary is too low (33%) or they cannot meet
the required minimum balance.

Those who have a bank account mainly use it to save money and this trend is stronger with urban
migrant workers than plantation migrant workers (Figure 18). Using the bank account to remit or
receive money comes second but only half of the migrant workers do so. As a result, only one out of four
urban workers and one out of ten plantation workers use banks to remit money8. Hence, the vast majority of
migrant workers use other regulated or unregulated channels to remit money. A more detailed discussion in
this regard follows below.

Urban workers predominantly opt for a telegraphic transfer when remitting money via their bank
accounts whereas plantation migrant workers prefer account to account services. Only 20% of workers
in both segments use online banking while the use of bank cheques in the plantation segment
is negligible.
8    Bank account ownership for Urban/Plantation workers is 55 percent/22 percent respectively. Half of these use their bank account to remit money.

Remittance Behaviours:
Purpose, Flows and Needs
Sending money to the origin country is a transnational activity, which typically characterises the
migration experience. The analysis of remittance transfers helps us to understand the level and depth of
migrants’ labour market integration at destination and of their connection with the origin households, which
directly influence the frequency, amount and regularity of remittance flows.



Number of recipients and motivations
When the Nepalese, Vietnamese, Myanmarese and Indian migrant workers remit money, they all
do so to support their dependents. They also have the highest average number of dependents since a
percentage of other nationalities do not have any dependents (Figure 19).

As Figure 20 shows, respondents were asked what the remitted money was used for. Consistent with many
other surveys, family maintenance is the main reason, followed by savings, education and health (Figure 20).

Characteristics of remittance flows
Yearly remittances by nationality
With the exception of the Chinese migrant workers, most migrant workers remit between RM5,000 -
RM10,000 on a yearly basis (Figure 21). This corresponds with the monthly savings rate of RM556 across
segments, or RM6,678 savings per year. The Chinese migrant workers is the only group with almost half of
the respondents remitting between RM10,000-RM20,000 per year and is also the only group where 8% are
remitting more than RM20,000 per year. With a monthly income of RM3,833 they earn substantially more
than the average in the urban segment (RM1,544) and even though they have the lowest savings rate (23%),
they still remit the most in total, based on the average yearly remittances across the remittance brackets.

Gender distribution in yearly remittances
With the exception of the RM3,000 - RM5,000 segment, women migrant workers, on average, remit
less than men on a yearly basis (Figure 22). Based on the survey data women migrant workers, on
average, earn 12% more (W: RM1,488 vs. M: RM1,329) but save 5% less (W:37% vs. M: 42%) and remit 14%
less than men migrant workers.

Frequency of remittances by segment and nationality
When measuring the frequency of remittances per year, nationalities of migrant workers behave
differently within segments. In the urban segment, the dominant frequency of remittance is monthly (Figure
23) for Indian, Indonesian, Bangladeshi and Nepalese migrant workers but only once in three months for
Chinese migrant workers, and once in two months for Vietnamese and Myanmar migrant workers (Figure 24).


32                                                        Greenback 2.0 Johor Bahru Report: Migrant Workers’ Remittances from Malaysia

If we compare the Indonesian and Bangladeshi migrant workers
in the urban and plantation segments, we can see that they
behave differently as well (Figure 25). Indonesians in the
plantation segment remit less frequently than their colleagues in                           The receivers
the urban segment (41% remit only once every three months whereas                           can have a
in the urban segment, 60% of the Indonesians remit every month).
                                                                                            role to play in
About 50% of Bangladeshis remit monthly and there is no                                     deciding which
difference among segments. However, the share of Bangladeshis                               remittance
in the plantation segment remitting once in two months is higher                            channel and
than in the urban segment (39% vs. 26%). Interestingly, the group
of Bangladeshi migrant workers who remit only once every three
                                                                                            product to use
months is three times as large for the urban segment than in the
plantation segment (26% vs. 9%).

Source of information on remittance channels
Word of mouth has always been the main source of information on remittances and the survey
results confirm this phenomenon (Figure 26). It is interesting to note that the second most popular source
is “family or a friend in home country” which shows that receivers can have a role to play in deciding which
remittance channel and product to use.

Regulated versus unregulated remittance channels
Awareness of differences between regulated non-bank remittance
channels and unregulated remittance channels
Respondents were asked whether they were
able to distinguish regulated from unregulated                              FIGURE 27. Malaysian Association of
channels by inquiring about their knowledge                                 Money Services Business (MAMSB) logo
on the specific characteristics of a regulated
channel. First of all, regulated remittance channels
are required to display a license from Bank Negara
Malaysia at their premises. Secondly, they need to
have proper business signages and procedures
(e.g. issuance of receipt). Thirdly, for regulated
non-bank remittance service providers, they are
required to display the Malaysian Association
of Money Services Business (MAMSB) logo
(Figure 27).

A rather large group of respondents (40%) replied that they did not know how to differentiate
regulated from unregulated remittance channels (Figure 28). 38% of the remaining respondents knew
that a Bank Negara Malaysia license is required, 33% ackowledged the requirement of proper business
signage and procedures and a mere 5% were aware of the MAMSB logo requirement for non-bank remittance
service providers. Clearly, there is a huge opportunity for education campaigns to increase awareness about
characteristics of regulated remittance channels.

in the plantation segment (12% vs. 8%), although
the difference is not significant.


When we look at the breakdown of the type of regulated channel used per segment, we see that the
main method of sending money abroad is through remittance services providers, followed by banking
services (Figure 30). Money exchangers and post offices are used by less than 5% of the repondents.

When comparing segments, we notice that remittance service providers are almost twice as
popular in the urban segment than in the plantation segment. Banking services on the other hand are
comparatively used more in the plantation segment than in the urban segment (34% vs. 21%).

   of the Money Services Business Act 2011.

Regulated channels: Use by nationality
With the exception of Chinese migrant workers, most respondents prefer to remit money via regulated
(non-bank) remittance service providers (Figure 31). Indonesian migrant workers in the urban segment
use money exchangers (12%) as much as banking services (13%) whereas in the plantation segment, money
exchangers are hardly used but workers do remit money through the post office. Interestingly, Bangladeshi
migrant workers in the plantation sector use money exchangers and post offices although to a limited extent,
while these channels are completely absent in the urban segment.

Since the main reason for remittances is family maintenance/purchase of food, the speed of
remittance services is a basic requirement for most migrant workers. All remittance channels provide
fast remittance speed and typically the recipient would receive the money within one business day.

Related to this basic need of speedy remittances is the ease of collection by the family/dependents.
Hassle-free, straightforward collection of the transferred money is important when selecting the remittance
channel, together with the availability of clear information on fees, transfer speed and collection procedures.
Those who specifically opt for a slower remittance speed may do so because a lower remittance cost
outweighs the importance of speed (Figure 37).

Perceptions of transaction fees
and awareness of remittance cost
components
Remittance cost consisted of transaction fee, exchange rate cost, receiving cost, and
service tax. Through the survey, respondents were questioned to understand their perceptions
of costs associated with remittance transactions. They were asked to estimate the transaction fee
for each average remittance transaction in Malaysian Ringgit excluding other cost components
(Figure 38).

Across both segments 94% of the respondents pay a transaction fee of RM20 or less, with half
paying RM10 or less (Figure 39).



Transaction fee
The percentage of plantation workers that pays RM10 or less for the transaction fee is larger than
that of the urban workers. In general, Indonesian migrant workers pay less than other nationalities with
70% paying RM10 or less. The Chinese migrant workers, followed by the Vietnamese, pay the most per
transaction. However, as mentioned above, the Chinese migrant workers remit the highest amount on a
yearly basis among all surveyed nationalities. When remitting larger amounts, transaction fees typically
increase as well, which explains why the Chinese migrant workers on average pay more than others
(Figure 40).

Awareness of remittance cost components
When asked about the different components of the total remittance cost, most workers mentioned
the transaction fee but only a minority was aware of the other components such as the costs related
to foreign exchange and costs charged to recipients of the remitted amount. The urban workers were
more aware than the plantation workers about the cost components (Figure 41). Only 3% of the urban
workers were not aware of the cost components compared to 20% for plantation workers. The Vietnamese
and Nepalese migrant workers are the best informed and are aware of all cost components. The Indonesian
migrant workers in the plantation segment are the least informed, with about 81% only having knowledge
about the transaction fee and about 14% not being aware of cost components (Figure 42).

Migrants’ use of information and
communication technologies
Smartphone ownership by migrants and access to internet
via smartphone
In 2015, 65% of Malaysians owned a smartphone11 , which is the most used device to search the
internet (52%), followed by the computer (36%) and the tablet (12%). Within Southeast Asia, Malaysia
is the country with the highest internet penetration. According to World Bank’s 2014 figures, close to two-
thirds of Malaysia’s population has internet access12. 86% of smartphone users research products and prices
on their smartphone13. According to a survey conducted by Google & TNS, 35% of Malaysian smartphone
users solely depend on their smartphones for all internet access. This figure is estimated to be the highest
in the world, making Malaysia the top country when it comes to internet access exclusively via smartphones.

The questionnaire included questions on migrants’ ownership of smartphones and use of internet
through their smartphones (Figure 43). Smartphone ownership among migrants (74%) is higher than
the national smartphone penetration percentage, and 90% of migrants use their smartphones to access
the internet. This is particularly relevant as this may encourage new types of remittance services which are
available via the internet or are based on other new technologies. In addition, this will make communication
with remittance senders easier and present the right conditions for initiatives regarding app-based remittance
price transparency tools.

Figure 43 displays the smartphone ownership among different nationalities across segments. Migrant
workers from India and Myanmar have the lowest percentage of smartphone ownership. The Chinese migrant
workers, together with access to the internet via the smartphone, havev the highest smartphone ownership
percentage (100%).

Pick Remit app
Pick Remit, which is a part of Project Greenback 2.0, is a smartphone and tablet app developed by
the World Bank to help migrants make the best choice of services when sending money back home to
their families. Pick Remit helps individuals pick the international money transfer service that best fits their
needs. Remitters choose how much money they would like to send to the destination country and Pick Remit
tells them what are the options available in the area, the fee and exchange rate applied, and conditions of
each service. By choosing the most convenience service, migrants can save and keep more money in their
pockets or just send a little more.

The survey inquired about the migrants’ knowledge of this app. Due to its recent introduction in Malaysia
only 10% of the migrants had heard about this app, via word of mouth (78%), the World Bank website (13%),
or a newsletter (9%). Nevertheless, when introduced to its functions most were enthusiastic and over half
said they would likely use the app in their next remittance transaction.

When asked if they would be willing to try online-based remittance methods (online banking, TT,
online money order, apps), 50% said they would be willing to use these for future remittances. Half
preferred online banking over telegraphic transfers (30%), online money order (25%) and other remittance
apps (15%).

higher than the average income of plantation                           attributed to the lower cost of living at remote

the foreign exchange cost and costs charged to              channel (regulated or unregulated), price, trust and
the recipient.                                              convenience of location are also important.



Use of information and communication technologies
Smartphone ownership and internet use via smartphone is very high across the sample. Therefore, this
can be a very powerful vehicle for promoting transparency and services built on new technologies. E-wallet
services for migrants, allowing online remittances instead of going through traditional channels is expected to
assume a more important role in future. Market players who invest in educating their consumer base, providing
reliable and competitive services and creating trust stand to gain a sizeable market share of remittances.



Policy insights
The survey was able to provide valuable insights for regulators in developing impactful policies.
Embracing technology can be an effective way to address the low level of financial inclusion among migrant
workers, with significant potential to capitalise on the high penetration of smartphone and internet access
among migrant workers. Regulators can encourage more innovative means for conducting remittances
such as mobile remittances. E-remittance applications can overcome geographical barriers and contain
remittance costs as services are offered directly to migrants, by-passing intermediaries or illegal operators.

As part of the initiatives to reduce remittance flows through unregulated channels, the survey
highlighted various awareness gaps among migrant workers that should be reduced or eliminated.
A comprehensive education strategy should target methods for identifying authorised non-bank RSPs and
emphasize the protection afforded by using regulated channels. It should also educate remitters on the total
costs of remittances to help remitters make informed choices between remittance services.

The findings further affirm the relevance of principal-agent arrangements and operation of
temporary remittance kiosks which have helped to improve accessibility, particularly in rural areas
such as plantations. Agents and mobile kiosk arrangements can be a cost effective alternative to bring
remittance services to the migrants in remote areas.

The questionnaire
The questionnaire was drafted following alignment on the key research objectives and scope. Most
of the questionnaire closely emulated the questionnaire used in previous Greenback surveys to ensure
consistency with answering the overarching objectives.


The questionnaire was divided into the following sections:
  •	 Personal background – Demographic information to understand the respondents’ background
  •	 Employment information – Information about the respondents’ employment in Malaysia such as length
     and sector of employment
  •	 ICT literacy – Information about usage of Internet/ devices used in Malaysia, smartphone ownership,
     awareness of Pick Remit, willingness to use Pick Remit in the next transaction
  •	 Banking and financial background and level of financial inclusion – Income profile (main method of
     receiving salary, frequency of receiving salary), saving behaviour, bank account ownership and reasons for
     having or not having a bank account
  •	 Remittance behaviour – Methods used, reasons, and frequency of sending money to home country,
     knowledge of remittance costs, sources of information on remittance, challenges faced when sending
     money to home country
  •	 Awareness of unregulated remittance channels – Awareness of how to identify unregulated channels
     and the risks associated with them
  •	 Participation in financial education training or programs – Interest in participating in financial
     education training or programs, contents expected of the programs




Training of interviewers and pilots
All interviewers were provided with a soft copy of the questionnaire and the survey link prior to
actual fieldwork. Both materials were referred to in a comprehensive field briefing to all field supervisors. In
the field briefing, the project team outlined the research objectives and requirements. All survey questions
were reviewed together with the field supervisors in the field briefing to ensure that all teams are aligned in
the meaning of each question and how questions should be conveyed to respondents.

Following the field briefing, the supervisors conducted another briefing with all the interviewers by
going through the questionnaire. All the interviewers selected for this research received standardised
training and have extensive experience in conducting face-to-face interviews. The survey link was provided
to all interviewers to enable them to familiarise themselves with the contents of the questionnaire.

Prior to the fieldwork, the field supervisors and interviewers conducted six pilot interviews to assess
the complexity of the questionnaire and gauge the length of interview. Feedback on the questionnaire
was then provided to the project team and incorporated into the survey link ahead of the start of fieldwork.

The fieldwork: Sampling strategy
For the urban worker segment, the fieldwork team consisting of 11 interviewers was deployed in
areas with higher migrant worker densities (e.g. near banks and bus stations). The respondents were
also intercepted in residential areas.

The plantation worker segment sampling was directly controlled by the plantation employers who
extended the invitation to the workers to participate in this research. No quotas were imposed in
recruitment, except that the workers should be from Indonesia and with a preference toward migrants from
Lombok. A team of 17 interviewers conducted the interviews at locations determined by the employers.




Feedback from the fieldwork
At the beginning of fieldwork, the sampling was distributed across workers from Indonesia,
Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Vietnam, and China. However, Indian workers were added, resulting in
a redistribution of sample sizes across nationality. The soft quotas set for blue/white collar classification;
occupation industry, gender, and age were also relaxed following feedback from the interviewers that
the demographic distribution of the migrant workers within the sampling areas was falling out in different
proportions. Similarly, the soft quotas for gender and age in the plantation worker segment were relaxed as
the plantation employers were recruiting larger groups of younger male workers.




Data entry, cleaning and analysis
All responses by the respondents were keyed directly into electronic data tablets with a pre-
programmed survey link. After completing several interviews, the interviewers would upload the responses
into an online survey platform which stored all the raw data collected.

The project team had access to all the data collected to do routine checks to ensure that the sample
distribution was falling within acceptable ranges and that the responses are logical and of good
quality. Any responses identified as ambiguous and requiring clarification were highlighted to the field team
and, if required, to the respondent through a phone call. All data cleaning was done on the online survey
platform before the survey was closed for data export.

Upon completion of the fieldwork, the data was exported from the online survey platform in SPSS.
The data was processed to produce Excel data tables for data analysis and report production.
