I. Introduction
That women earn considerably less than men, even for the same job, is well established at the level of
countries and industries.2 The focus is now moving to the corporate world and individual firms. Large
companies and institutions are looking within themselves and asking whether their diversity and inclusion
policies are sufficient to guarantee pay equality: equality both in terms of ensuring that workers who
perform similar jobs receive the same pay and that different people have an equal shot at different jobs.3

In order to determine how the World Bank Group (WBG)—a large multilateral finance institution with a
highly diverse workforce—fared in this context, we examined compensation at the institution, focusing
on differences between men and women and between citizens of Part 1 and Part 2 countries. The
additional emphasis on Part 1 and Part 2 countries is particular to the WBG and the classification roughly
groups staff into those who are from higher (Part 1) and lower/middle-income countries (Part 2).4

Together with the Human Resources group at the WBG we constructed a unique database called the
“Human Resource Longitudinal Database” that contains information on all employees (excluding short-
term consultants) between 1987 and 2015.5 Using this new database we were able to look at both pay
differentials and job composition within the institution for those staff who were hired on the U.S. salary
based plan, which includes all international hires, regardless of their duty station. To conduct this analysis,
we defined and examined two characterizations of salary differences across employee subgroups at the
WBG: The aggregate gap and the career gap.

We define the aggregate gap as the difference in mean salaries between men and women (or Part 1 and
Part 2) employees at the WBG.6 Frequently used in the literature on gender gaps in wages, the aggregate
gap is sensitive to both occupational sorting and differences in salaries within occupations. In the context
of the WBG, the aggregate gap will reflect, in part, the extent to which men and women are hired into

  For recent reviews of the gender earnings gap in the United States, see for instance, Juhn and McCue (2017) and Blau and Kahn
(2016). For international data and comparisons see the World Development Report (2012) on Gender Equality and Development.

  Examples include a recent report by the London School of Economics Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Taskforce (2016) and
Facebook’s report on diversity, accessed on March 2017 at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/07/facebook-diversity-update-
positive-hiring-trends-show-progress. In addition, Gobillon et al. (2014) and Takao et al. (2013) focus on single large firms.

  Part 1 countries do not borrow from the WBG whereas Part 2 countries are eligible to borrow, a decision that was made by each
country upon entering the WBG. As such, the country part classification roughly separates low and middle from high-income
economies. This is necessarily a rough classification since a country’s economic status could have changed considerably over time.
Appendix Table 1 in the report presents a list of Part 1 and Part 2 countries represented at The WBG.
5
  Short-Term Consultants range from people working exclusively at the WBG to those on short contracts with permanent jobs at
other institutions. Although there is considerable movement of staff from consultancy to staff contracts, the data on consultants
are too limited for inclusion in our analysis.
6 Although compensation is a broader term, we focus on current salaries where we have complete data for all years and

employees. A more complete analysis of compensation would integrate pension and benefits information with this longitudinal
database. In addition, as is well known, analysis such as ours reflects one dimension of the overall job experience. Discrimination
can be encountered and is experienced in multiple ways, but this remains outside the scope of our current analysis.
                                                                                                                                 2
different professional positions (“grades” at the WBG) that are highly correlated with their salaries. There
are two reasons for focusing on the aggregate gap. First, summary statistics such as “the average woman
makes 70 cents on the dollar for the average man” are statements about such gaps, without any
conditioning on profession or grade. Second, if productivity distributions are identical for men and
women, then any difference in the aggregate gap reflects discrimination either in hiring grades or in
salaries conditional on the hiring grade.

Reducing the aggregate gap is an important goal for the WBG, but equally important is examining the
career growth of different groups who were hired into the same grade at the same time. For instance,
one frequently voiced concern from staff consultations was the imbalance in staffing at different grade-
levels within the WBG, with particular concern about the lack of representation of women at higher
grades. Therefore in addition to the aggregate gap, we also examined how salaries of different groups of
staff hired into the same grade evolved over time, reflecting raises and promotion rates. We label these
salary differences the Career Gap.

To exploit the longitudinal nature of these data, we developed and implemented a novel dynamic
simulation approach that relates current salary gaps to hiring, promotion and attrition patterns from 1987
to the present.7 We use this dynamic simulation approach to decompose the gaps into differences arising
from the following four factors:8

        Staff Composition Effects: Are women hired in systematically different grades relative to men?
         This is relevant only for the aggregate gap, as the career gap is conditioned on the grade at entry.
        Entry Salaries: For the same position, are women hired at lower salaries relative to men?
        Attrition: Is the distribution of salaries among women who leave different from that of men? If
         so, it would potentially alter the salary distribution of those who remain due to selection effects.
        Salary Growth: Do the salaries of women grow at different rates relative to those of men?

Our first result is that there has been substantial catch-up over time, although aggregate salary gaps
persist. In 1987, the average woman employee earned 52 cents on the dollar compared to the average

  The decomposition relies on simulating counterfactuals in the spirit of the structural labor literature (see for example Keane
and Wolpin’s (2010) decomposition of the white female-black female pay gap). In contrast to these studies, our simulations do
not attempt to capture endogenous responses by agents to the counterfactual change.
8 The pay gaps observed in 1987, the first year of our data, reflect pre-1987 HR policies and thus cannot be decomposed. This

“legacy” pay gap shows up as a residual in our decomposition.


                                                                                                                              3
man at the WBG; in 2015 this had increased to 77 cents.9 The average Part 2 employee earned 84 cents
on the dollar compared to the average Part 1 employee in 1987 and this increased to 87 cents in 2015.

The aggregate gap reflects, in part, how women and men (and Part 1 versus Part 2) are hired into different
grades. At the WBG grades run from GA to GL. Grades GA-GD are the grade levels for Administrative and
Client Services (ACS) staff. GE corresponds to analyst-level staff. GF and GG contain the bulk of
professional technical staff. Staff in the GH level, the first leadership position at the WBG, can be either in
a technical or managerial role. GI (Director) through GK (Vice President) refers to increasingly senior
management positions. GL is the president of the WBG.

Over the period of our data, the fractions of men and women hired at each grade have converged.
However, even in 2015 women were hired into lower grades on average: 78.1% of GA-GD hires were
female whereas 62.3% of GG hires were male. Further, the historical differences in hiring created a
pipeline to higher paid jobs that contain more men. Compositional differences between Part 1 and Part 2
are qualitatively similar to those between men and women. Hires at GE and above are 40.4% Part 2
employees, while hires at GA-GD are 62.5% Part 2. In contrast to the gender differences, however, there
is no pattern of convergence toward parity over time in the shares of Part 1 and Part 2 staff hired at
different grades.

Consistent with these patterns, the decomposition of the aggregate gap shows that 76% of the aggregate
gender gap in 2015 and 61% of the aggregate country part gap in 2015 can be attributed to differences in
grade composition at entry. In addition, differences in salary growth and differences in entry salaries
account for 12% of the aggregate gap across men and women and 16% across Part 1 and Part 2 staff.
Finally, attrition is a more important contributor (14%) for the aggregate gap across Part 1 and Part 2
employees relative to the aggregate gap across women and men (1%).

Career gaps varied across entry grades, which is an important finding in itself. In grades GE and GG, 15
years after joining the WBG any existing gaps in salaries by sex or nationality were small. In all other grades
besides GF, there were insufficient hires in each year for every subgroup to offer meaningful estimates.
For instance, the largest number of men in the GA-GD cohort were hired in grade GB. But even there, only
209 men were hired (an average of 8 men per year) over the duration of our data and there were 12 years
with 3 or fewer men hired into this grade. Similarly, for grade GH, there were 11 years with fewer than 5
women hired into the grade; for higher grades, the numbers were even smaller.

 As a comparison, the aggregate gender pay gap in the United States declined from 26 cents on the dollar in 1989 to 20.7 cents
on the dollar in 2010 (Blau and Kahn, 2016).
                                                                                                                             4
For employees who entered at GF, there were both sizeable salary differences and sufficient sample to
further decompose career gaps. We therefore focus our decomposition of the career gap for staff who
joined the WBG in grade GF between 1987 and 2001. This results in a sample of 1,763 staff who had been
hired as a GF in 2001 or earlier, representing 37.1 percent of all hires at grades GE+ among those cohorts.

Relative to male Part 1 employees, in this sample 15 years after entering the WBG, the annual salary of
female Part 1 employees was $5,036 lower. It was $5,178 lower for male Part 2 employees and $4,139
lower for female Part 2 employees. In percentage terms, for every dollar that male Part 1 employees (who
entered as a GF) earned after 15 years, female Part 1 employees earned 96.52 cents, male Part 2
employees earned 96.42 cents and female Part 2 employees earned 97.14 cents. Our decomposition
results indicate that the bulk of these differences is explained by differences in salary growth (rather than
entry salaries or attrition), which reflects a longer lead time for promotions to grades GG and GH.

Although the data thus show a career gap after 15 years for those who entered as GF, we should caution
that attrition from the WBG may confound any interpretation of this gap. About 8-10 percent of staff
leave the WBG every year, and therefore within 7-9 years, half of original staff hires exit the sample. The
decomposition analysis assumes that, had they not left the WBG, leavers and stayers in the same cohort
would receive the same salaries, conditional on their last salary and entry grade. Our analysis did not find
differences—in the means or distributions of either performance or salaries—of stayers versus leavers,
but it could be sensitive to that assumption.10

These relatively modest career gaps are somewhat surprising given previous analysis by Filmer et al.
(2005), which showed a consistent salary premium for Part 1 men compared to women and Part 2
employees.11 It also runs contrary to the perceptions of staff at the institution. To address this concern,
we first re-examined the Filmer et al. (2005) results and found that the gender salary gap becomes small
in their analysis once starting grades are accounted for—information that was not incorporated in the
Filmer et al. (2005) salary decomposition. The results presented here are therefore consistent with those
of Filmer et al. (2005) as both our analysis and theirs points to entry grades as a critical determinant of
current salary gaps.




10 In addition to examining compensation metrics prior to staff leaving the WBG, we also tried to follow-up a small group of
(randomly) selected staff who had left the Bank and tracked down where they were currently employed using Social Networks
such as Facebook and LinkedIn. Current employment appears to be very diverse, with some staff employed in other international
organizations, academia, the public or private sector, or staying on in a consultancy role at the WBG.
11 Filmer et al. (2005) used a cross-section of salaries among what were in 1997 known as professional staff. They identified salary

deficits for women and Part 2 employees at the World Bank, only half of which could be explained by differences in staff
characteristics.
                                                                                                                                  5
We then examined whether the smaller contributions of entry salaries and salary growth to the aggregate
gap reflects a flat compensation system with a strong preference for equity that seeks to close gaps where
they exist. For instance, at the WBG, the compensation methodology seeks to promote equity within each
grade by accelerating increases for those staff positioned below the midpoint and moderating for staff
positioned above the midpoint, so that over time, equal performance is compensated in an equitable way.
This is supported by the 2015 introduction of a four-zone salary band.

In fact, we found that salary responds strongly to performance ratings at the WBG. Among the cohort of
GF entrants between 2000 and 2005, staff in the lowest performance decile gained 26 percent in real
salaries over a 10-year period while those in the highest performance decile gained 83 percent. We also
did not find evidence for the systematic application of informal management practices that could limit
performance-related pay increases, such as not awarding staff the highest performance rating in two
successive years. The hiring and compensation system at the WBG is thus reasonably successful at
restricting subgroup differences among staff hired in the same grade, while maintaining salary incentives
for high performance. However, it is not as successful in retaining high performing staff as exits from the
institution are not correlated with historical performance.

Our econometric approach to diversity and inclusion issues in a large firm contrasts with a complementary
human resource approach, where individual cases are examined on the basis of cross-sectional data to
ensure compliance with equal pay policies. Our attempt here is to apply the tools available in the labor
literature to the internal labor market of a single firm to generate policy insights for compensation policies
in such environments. The combination of a data-based simulation approach thus bridges the large
literature on subgroup differences in the labor market and growing interest in the organization of large
firms.

In addition, the empirical approach we follow also complements, but is conceptually different from, a
literature that decomposes wage differences across subgroups into those arising from employee
characteristics and those arising from the returns to these characteristics. Given the longitudinal data
available to us, our decomposition allows us to identify the sources of wage gaps and provides a starting
point for further institutional efforts. For instance, relative to the cross-sectional data used by Filmer et
al. (2005), these data allow us to incorporate employee turnover and pipeline effects (historical hiring will
affect gaps today), which could mask or artificially amplify salary gaps in cross-sections. One key finding is
that pay gaps arise at different points in staff careers depending on their entry grade. The organizational
structure that leads to different gaps in different grades merits further debate and it is in understanding


                                                                                                            6
these very specific gaps that incorporating employee characteristics will likely become a critical part of
the analytical work.12

The remainder of this document is as follows. In Section II, we discuss the construction of the data set and
broad patterns in the data that illustrate the institutional context for our findings. Section III provides the
key descriptive findings on salary gaps by gender and nationality in terms of each individual contributor—
composition, entry salaries, salary growth and turnover. Section IV discusses the results of our dynamic
accounting framework, which allows us to decompose the aggregate and career gaps into each of their
sub-components using simulations. Section V concludes.


II. Data
The World Bank Group's Human Resource Longitudinal Database was constructed in order to better
understand salary dynamics and career differences across subgroups such as gender and nationality. The
data set is structured in a panel from 1987 to 2015 with staff uniquely identified through a universal
personnel identifier (UPI) that never changes for an individual, even across disjointed employment spells.
The data are gathered from two human resource databases at the WBG—PeopleSoft/Business
Intelligence and Talent Management—with data from each year taken as a snapshot on June 30.

PeopleSoft/Business Intelligence contains information on the staff’s universal personnel identified (UPI);
compensation and benefits (e.g. salaries); personal backgrounds (e.g. gender, age); professional situation
(e.g. professional grade); location (e.g. HQ or country-office based) and role and movements within the
organization (e.g. promotions and lateral moves). In addition to these, information on the yearly
performance rating (SRIs), which is available from 2000 onwards, is drawn from the Talent Management
database.

Unfortunately, PeopleSoft does not contain reliable data going back to 1987 and multiple changes in the
WBG ranging from types and grades of employees to corrections in the employment spells had to be
carefully dealt with. A brief description of the types of employees and how they have changed over time
is necessary to interpret the results; the accompanying data Appendix and codebook provides further
details.

The most important broad distinction between types of employees at the WBG is between staff members
and consultants. Our data contain all staff members. The data set has no information on Short-Term


12We caution that the WBG’s data on pre-entry characteristics of staff are incomplete. Some of this is because we have staff
members in our data who were hired as far back as 1955, but this is also because pre-entry data on staff are not standardized.
They are based on individual CVs submitted by staff and the information contained in these CVs can vary dramatically. As one
example, the variable that captures the highest educational degree is missing for 55 percent of staff in the data.
                                                                                                                            7
Consultants, who can range from people working exclusively at the WBG to those on short contracts, but
with permanent jobs at other institutions. Although there is considerable movement of staff from
consultancy to staff contracts, the data on consultants are too limited for inclusion in our analysis.

Among staff members, the WBG grades run from GA to GL (the president of the WBG). Grades GA-GD are
the grade levels for Administrative and Client Services (ACS) staff. GE corresponds to analyst-level. GF and
GG contain the bulk of professional technical staff. Staff in the GH level, the first leadership position at
the WBG, can be either in a technical or managerial role. GI (Director) through GK (Vice Presidents) and
GL (President) refer to senior management positions. Staff entering the WBG can do so through multiple
channels. Staff can be recruited through international recruitment by different units, which advertise
positions and hire new employees at the relevant grade level. Staff can be hired through local recruitment,
which does not include international benefits. In addition, staff can also be recruited through the “Young
Professional” process, which is the flagship recruitment program of the institution.13

Apart from these grades, our data also contain information on employees with “Unassigned or Ungraded”
grades. These are of two types. First, a small number are staff outside the salary and promotion structure
of the WBG, such as executive directors and their advisers. Second, prior to a reform in 1998 (which we
discuss in Footnote 15 below) a large fraction of employees without grades were “long-term consultants”,
who were not considered staff members but nevertheless held full time jobs at the WBG. With the reform,
many of them were converted to graded employees, and a new category of ungraded employees with
specific 2-3 year contracts was introduced called Extended-Term Consultants. In 2016, these posts were
abolished as well; our data stop a year prior to this last change. Before 1999, therefore, the unclassified
grade was a highly heterogeneous category, including country managers and Executive Directors (EDs).
After 1999, the grade became more homogeneous, with most regular staff being slotted into normal grade
levels.

1. Sample
Even though the WBG has more than 100 country offices, we restricted our sample to staff in the
Washington D.C. headquarters hired on a US dollar salary plan, commonly known as “internationally
recruited staff”. The main reason for the restriction is the substantial country-specific expertise required
to convert local salaries to dollar equivalents. Given the starting date of 1987 in our data, the dissolution
of the Soviet Union and the emergence of local currencies, the emergence of the euro and the dissolution



13Since 2015, there is an additional recruitment program at the GE-level called the Analyst Program. Before that, there was a

Unclassified.

of local currencies as well as multiple hyperinflations through the period of our data in countries ranging
from Turkey to Ecuador all need to be addressed on a case-by-case basis. While this salary conversion is
possible, it lies outside the scope of the current project and requires close collaboration between country
units and the relevant global practices at the WBG. This restriction becomes particularly worrisome for
our ability to examine Part 1 versus Part 2 differences in the latter period of our sample as the fraction of
local hires increases from 7.4 percent to 37.8 percent over the time period of our data.

Despite the decline in sample resulting from this restriction, our data set continues to represent a large
number of nationalities and citizens of Part 2 countries.14 Figure 1 charts staff nationalities among new
international hires in 1990, 2000 and 2010. In all years, more than 60 countries were represented in
international hiring and over time and the dominance of the top 5 countries (United States, India, Great
Britain, France and the Philippines in 1990) declined from 54 percent of all international hires in 1990 to
44 percent in 2010.15

14 Staff may change their citizenship after arriving at the WBG. The most common citizenship change will be to U.S., and we find
173 such cases in our data among 30,763 staff members. Our understanding is that this low number is driven by the loss of
benefits when people become U.S. citizens, combined with the ability to obtain a Green Card on exiting the WBG after 15 years
of employment.
15 One way that social scientists summarized diversity in populations is through “diversity indices”. For instance, the Blau diversity

index is the expected proportion of people who would be from different groups if two members were picked randomly from the
population. A diversity index of 0 implies that there is no diversity in the population while 1 implies that no two people are from
the same group. At the WBG, the Blau Diversity Index was already very high at 0.87 in 1990 and by 2010, it had increased even
further to 0.92.
                                                                                                                                    9
Additional sample restrictions are as follows:

         Among the 259,618 records corresponding to the universe of World Bank Group headquarters
          employees between 1987 and 2015, we exclude the 4,689 records of Executive Directors and their
          staff, and of “secondments”.16
         We also exclude 229 records because they had missing or anomalous grades (6 records); recorded
          gender changed over time (97 records); recorded salary was 0 (88 records) and; recorded salary
          is clearly outside the grade range in the corresponding year (38 records).17

Finally, given that different data are available in different time periods and that we will examine career
gaps after 15 years of service, the samples for our analysis will differ depending on the specific analysis.
In particular:

         For results on the aggregate gap, we use the entire sample subject to the restrictions discussed
          previously.
         For results on the career gap, we use data on staff who entered as GF between the years of 1987
          and 2000. As discussed in the introduction, this is the only group with sufficient gaps and hiring in
          each subgroup to allow for meaningful decompositions. The time period is determined by the
          need for data 15 years after entry, which limits the last entry date to 2000.
         For questions related to pay and performance, we focus on staff who entered the WBG between
          2000 and 2005. The performance system that is used started in 2000 and the last entry date of
          2005 allows us to examine staff performance over a 10- year period.

2. Institutional Features
Like other multinational firms, the WBG is a large institution with central headquarters in Washington DC
and country offices in over 100 countries. Unlike other multinational firms, however, special
arrangements with the U.S. government allow the WBG to hire and bring in staff to central headquarters
from all around the world. In fact, as Figure 1 shows, U.S. citizens are a minority in the Washington D.C.
office. Compensation at the WBG therefore reflects multiple objectives, balancing the need to incentivize
performance, allow managerial discretion and ensuring equity. For instance, at the WBG, salary bands for
different grades as well as mean increases each year are decided with reference to a “comparator group”



16 Executive Directors are shareholder-appointed members of the supervisory board of the World Bank Group. The United States
government, for example, appoints an Executive Director. Although EDs and their staff are paid by the WBG, their special role
and manner of appointment sets them apart from staff. People on secondments are also excluded because they are not paid by
the WBG.
17 This was defined as (i) less than half the 10th percentile for that year and grade or (ii) more than twice the 90th percentile for

that year and grade.
                                                                                                                                 10
that includes a mix of other international organizations, private sector firms and public sector salaries.
However, to allow for managerial discretion and performance incentives, compensation bands within
each grade are quite wide and in theory, raises can vary substantially around the average increase,
depending both on the performance rating of the employee in the last year as well as their relative
position within the salary band for their grade. To promote equity, employees with salaries above the
midpoint of their grade receive a lower raise for the same level of performance.

These practices have not remained static over the period of our data. In fact, multiple institutional changes
and HR policies have been enacted to further one or more of these objectives. These, in turn could have
affected hiring and turnover as well as the salary structure.18 It is therefore useful to examine basic
summary statistics that deepen our understanding of the underlying dynamics in the data.

3. Summary Statistics
A first characterization of the data is in terms of compositional changes. Figure 2 shows that over the
period of our data, there was a secular increase in the fraction of GE+ level staff as a fraction of total staff
from 64 percent in 1987 to 85 percent in 2015, consistent both with increasing automatization of routine
tasks and shifting of routine tasks from GA-GD to GE+ staff.19 The proportional increase in GE+ staff was
primarily in the technical grades of GE, GF and GH; no change was seen in the proportion of managers to
staff between the years of 2000 and 2015.20




18 An important policy change was a reform in 1998 that changed the pension regimes (from defined benefits to a combination
of defined benefit and defined contribution), the grading system (from ‘narrow’ to ‘broad banding’ thus shifting the WBG from
smaller bands and more frequent promotions to larger bands with fewer promotions) and, importantly for our analysis,
eliminated long-term consultant contracts. Appendix Figure 1 shows all new hires between 1990 and 2005 at the WBG for
ungraded, GA-GD and GE+ staff. The term “ungraded” are those with “unassigned” or “unclassified” grades at the institution—
prior to 1998 these included staff on long-term consultant contracts and country managers. After 1998 these were mostly (see
Technical Appendix 1) staff hired on Extended Term Consultant or Extended Term Temporary contracts with a fixed duration.
New hiring in the ungraded category collapsed immediately after the reform and then picked up, but at much lower levels than
before with the coming of ETCs and ETTs. Many ungraded staff were converted to “regular” staff at different grade-levels where
there is a corresponding spike in “new” hires at those grades in 2008: 59 percent of those who were ungraded in 1998 were
converted over the next 3 years. Managers appeared to have been forward-looking in their hiring decisions with a “dip” in regular
hiring and a large increase in ungraded hiring prior to the reform: between 1987 and 1998, the fraction of all employees who are
ungraded rises from 11.9 percent to 29.3 percent. Prior to the reform, the salary distribution among the ungraded is quite wide
with a difference of over $72,000 (285%) between those in the bottom and top 10% in 1997. In our analysis, we always treat
those who were ungraded prior to 1987 as separate and then re-analyze them as if they had no history with the WBG if we see
them as converted in 1998. That is, we treat a new employee at the institution who enters (say) as GF in 1998 precisely the same
as those who were converted from ungraded to GF. We have checked, in sensitivity analysis, whether this is a valid assumption
and can confirm that the experiences of these staff are no different from those of new entrants at that grade in 1998.
19 There are small differences in the year-to-year changes depending on how we treat the ungraded staff prior to the 1998 reform.

Here we exclude the ungraded staff from the figure, which implicitly assumes the fraction of professional to support staff in the
ungraded and graded staff prior to the 1998 reform was the same.
20 The data do not allow us to identify managers prior to 2000.

                                                                                                                             11

A second characterization recognizes that the composition of employees depends both on hiring and exits.
Figure 3 plots annual exits from the institution as a percentage of regular staff, excluding staff exits due
to mandatory retirement. Exits at the WBG cycle around an average of 9 percent a year.21 Exits were
higher in 1987 and 1988 and then declined to a low of 6 percent before rising again to a peak with a large
institutional reform in 1998 followed by a subsequent trough of 6 percent in 2000. Since then exits
increased again with an 11 percent exit rate in 2015, the last year of our data. One hypothesis consistent
with these patterns is that institutional reforms such as those seen in 1998 and 2012-2013 accelerate the
exits of those who would have left within 2-3 years. Consequently, exits peak in reform years (which are
usually associated with new presidential terms) but then drop because reforms bring exits “forward”. A
second hypothesis—more clearly seen in the first half of our data—is that exits track economic
performance in the U.S., rising when the economy is strong. Regardless of the specific hypothesis, the 9%
exit rate implies that 50% of staff leave the institution every 8 years. These high rates of attrition leave
substantial room for interpreting the remaining salary gaps of those who choose to remain at the




21   Of independent interest, higher exits are not associated with higher age at exit with a mean age at exit of 43.5 years
                                                                                                                              12

analysis to a single firm.22

A final characterization of the data is in terms of salaries. Table 1 shows the mean real salaries of
employees at each grade over time and to focus on changes, we compare all salaries to a base of 100 for
grade GA in 1987.23 To preserve anonymity, we leave blank the cells where there are too few employees
and do not present results for grade GK. The table first demonstrates considerable variation in salaries
within each grade. Typically, there is a difference of 20-40% between the 10th percentile and the 90th
percentile of the within-grade salary distribution. Second, salaries in higher grades exhibit large




22 If b is the exponential decay rate, x the initial stock of employees and t the number of years, then the existing employee stock
with halve when xbt=x/2 or, tln(b)=ln(0.5) or t = ln(0.5)/ln(b). With an attrition rate of 9%, b=0.91 yielding 8 years for halving the
employee stock.
23 We use the consumer price index for the U.S. to deflate nominal salaries—note that price increases in the Baltimore-

Washington area have been higher than for the U.S. as a whole, so using the BW CPI will lower real wage increases further over
the period of our data.
                                                                                                                                  13
progressions over the span of our data, in contrast to lower grades, which is similar to trends in senior
management pay observed in the United States over the period.

Each of these “macro-changes” over the period of our data can affect the salary gap across subgroups.
For instance, the decline in GA-GD level staff, who are predominantly women in jobs with lower salaries
implies that the average salary of women relative to men will rise in the institution. Similarly, differences
in the profile of staff leaving the WBG will affect the salaries of those who remain. Finally, differential
increases in salaries for different grades can affect both aggregate and career gaps. First, as GA-GD staff
tend to be women, their lower salary growth over time will imply that the aggregate gap will also increase.
Second, staff are promoted over time. If men are promoted faster to GH (for instance) relative to women
and GH salaries are growing faster, this will again induce an increase in both the aggregate and career



24 These are salaries of all staff in a given grade, and thus include tenure effects; with zero turnover, salaries will grow with
experience. A second option, in Appendix Figure 2 focuses just on entry-level salaries for different grades over this time period.
Like in Figure 4, with the exception of GI+ staff, real entry salaries have increased slowly over this period with the largest increases
of 15-20% for GH level staff.
                                                                                                                                     15
gaps over time.25 Taken as aggregates, there is considerable room both in the composition of employees
and how they are compensated for differences by subgroups to arise. We turn to this next.


III. Descriptive Findings
In 1987, the mean salary of a female staff member at the WBG was 52% that of a male staffer. By 2015,
this had increased to 77%. The male-female difference can be further separated by country-part and a
clear ordering emerges with the highest salaries for Part 1 males throughout the period of our data (Figure
5). The salaries of Part 2 males are lower, but the large differences are between men and women, with
salaries of both Part 1 and Part 2 females significantly below those of males. Among females, salaries of
Part 1 are again higher than those of Part 2 employees throughout the entire data period.

In Section IV, we develop a dynamic accounting framework to decompose this gap into its respective
components---differences in staff composition (both historical and present); differences in entry salaries;
differences in salary growth over time and; differences in attrition. Here we treat each of these individually
to understand how they could contribute to the aggregate and career gaps at the institution.



25 It
    would be useful to understand these changes in the context of changes in other institutions, but this is easier said than done.
The WBG does have some claim to exceptionality and includes some of the best trained and educated staffers in any institution
from multiple nations in the same location. In addition, data from private firms are usually not available. Finally, the IADB and
IMF have not assembled their HR data in a similar fashion.
                                                                                                                               16
1. Differences in Hiring Grades
In 1988, women comprised 20 percent of all GE+ employees, and this increased to 48 percent by 2015
(Figure 6). On the other hand, among GA-GD level staff, women remain dominant, decreasing in share
from 92 percent to 78 percent.

It is worth emphasizing that in most grades, hiring from all subgroups was so low that sufficient samples
for analysis at the grade-level are hard to obtain.26 Figure 7 shows hiring in each year for Grades GB and
GH; among grades GA to GD, GB has the highest number of male hires and among grades GH+, GH has
the highest number of female hires over the period of our data. Even here, the number of male hires (GB)
and female hires (GH) is small, exceeding 10 hires in only a couple of years (GB) and never more than 10
for GH. There are several years where fewer than 2 GB males or 2 GH males are hired. Figure 7 also shows
new GF and GG hires. Again, there is a female disadvantage (more so for GG) but the gap narrows over
the period of our data and the number of hires across males and females is now sufficiently large that we
can recover a sizeable sample by aggregating a small number of years into a single cohort analysis.

For the decomposition exercise, the stock of employees at different grades reflects both pipeline effects
and new hiring. For example, suppose an employee can rise to GH only after 12-15 years of service at the
Bank if starting as a GF and 5-7 years if starting as GG. In that case, if GHs are predominantly promoted
within the institution, they will be naturally constrained by the number of GFs and GGs 7-15 years in the
past. But in 2000, there were 1,112 female GFs and GGs, relative to just under 2,000 male GFs and GGs.
Although a crude measure of the pipeline (where tenure effects, exits and grade-year interactions will all
become relevant), the example emphasizes that that there is a long lead time between policy changes
and current staffing patterns. These lead times will be longer at the higher grades and will be longer if
promotions rather than external hires form the bulk of employees at these higher grades.




26There were 260 male GF’s, 1634 male GGs and 673 male GH’s in 1987 relative to 177 (GF), 285 (GG) and 25 (GH) females. In
1987, there were 684 female GBs, 1074 GCs and 190 GDs compared to 84 (GB), 114 (GC) and 52 (GD) for men. By 2015, the
number of female GBs and GCs had reduced to 26 and 587 while GDs had increased to 469. And there were only 12 male GBs,
101 male GCs and 84 male GDs.

2. Differences in Salaries
In contrast to the large differences in hiring across grades, salary differences by sex and country part are
smaller in the data. Two figures demonstrate this. Figure 8 presents entry salaries for Part 1 women as
well as Part 2 employees compared to Men Part 1 employees.27 To simplify the comparison we de-trend
the Part 1 male entry salary as the constant blue-line, and compare other groups to this salary. The basic
pattern, abstracting from fluctuations over time that arise due to the small number of hires in specific
grade-year combinations, is that entry salaries have always been fairly equal at the WBG. With the
exception of GG hires where women and Part 2 employees enter at a salary deficit of $2,000 to $5,000,
there is little evidence of systematic gaps in entry salaries over the period of our data. This is a sharp
contrast with a number of findings from the U.S. literature demonstrating significant gaps in entry salaries
for women compared to men.

27 In the recent literature on gender and salaries,entry salaries have played an important role with building evidence that women
are less likely to negotiate over salaries when they first take a job.

Figure 9 shows salary growth for employees at the WBG. The horizontal axis in each figure shows the
number of years that the staff has worked at the WBG, and we aggregate staff with the same number of
tenure years, irrespective of the year in which they joined the institution.28 As with entry salaries, Grades
GC and GE appear to have little difference in salary growth over time. In contrast, Grades GB and GF show
clear declines over time, reaching a $10,000 difference in annual salary after 20 years for GF employees.
Grade GG starts off with a salary deficit for all groups relative to Part 1 males, also seen in the salary at
entry, but there appears to be some catch-up over time. More generally, Figure 10 shows the existing
salary gaps after 15 years of tenure at the WBG, highlighting the larger deficits among staff who entered
as GB or GF, but not GC, GD, GE or GG.

28 For instance, people who joined in 1990 and 1995 will have 10 years of tenure in 2000 and 2005. Therefore, the salary pertaining

to (say) 10 years of tenure is the average salary of those who joined in 1990, but observed in 2000 and those who joined in 1995,
but observed in 2005.

Yet, even these data are not simple to interpret because small sample sizes at entry and continuous exits
from the institution imply that only a minority of an original cohort remains after more than 15 years at
the WBG. For instance, we are unable to show grades GA and GD because the sample of men is too small
for any meaningful comparisons. But even with a grade like GB, where the deficit is quite stark, data are
quite sparse. On average the WBG hires 3 GB males from Part 2 countries each year. Therefore, even if all
GBs remain for at least 15 years, the data for salary differences with 15 years of tenure must come from
those hired prior to 2000; in our data, the total number of such male hires is 56. In reality, 54 percent of
these original hires will have left within 15 years so the 15 year data are really based on comparisons with
the 26 males who remained for that long. One may think that the problems that exits from the institution
cause for cohort analysis are smaller for the GE+ grades, and we turn to this next.

3. Differences in Exits
Figure 11 shows the fraction of staff at each grade who were still at the WBG 15 years after they joined
across men and women and Part 1 and Part 2 employees. The joining years here are 1988-2000. Reflecting
the exit rates that we documented previously, less than 60 percent of staff remain at the WBG 15 years
or longer. Several other patterns are noteworthy. First, among Part 1 employees, the fraction of
employees who remain this long is never higher than 50 percent and is substantially lower for Grades GA,
GB and GG. Second, Part 2 employees remain at the WG longer than Part 1 employees, a difference that
is particularly pronounced among the GA-GD level staff, but also clear among starting GE and GF staff.
Finally, among Part 2 staff, in most grades women are less likely to leave than men. Among Part 1 staff,
the differences vary by grades.

Figure 12 and Table 2 show how these exit rates affect the interpretation of the career gap (exit rates may
differ from those in Figure 11, since the last joining date for these data are 1995, rather than 2000). Here,
we follow GF entrants into the WBG, hired between 1988 and 1996, with “cohort snapshots” after 5, 10,
15 and 20 years. For each of these “cohort snapshots”, we first provide exit rates (Figure 12) and then
career trajectories (Table 2) for Part 1 men, Part 2 men, Part 1 women and Part 2 women separately.
Figure 12 highlights three patterns for this GF entry cohort. First, exit rates rise steadily through the years,
reaching between 35 and 50% for staff with 15 years of experience at the WBG. At 20 years, close to 60

percent of men and 65 percent of women have left the institution. Second, till 10 years, men tend to leave
the WBG at faster rates than women, but after 10 years this pattern reverses, which may be linked to
increasing demand for household care responsibilities. Third, for all the snapshots, Part 1 staff are more
likely to leave than Part 2 staff, with differences that are more pronounced till 15 years after joining the
WBG.

Given these exit rates, without strong assumptions on selection we lack certitude both on the direction
and the magnitude of career gaps across subgroups. If we were to follow a bounds approach, we could
choose to assign the 27% of Part 1 men who have left the WBG at 5 years to the highest grade possible
while distributing the remaining subgroups according to the proportions in the data among those who
remained. This would maximize the advantage for Part 1 men. Alternatively, we could assign this 27% to
GF, which would minimize the advantage among Part 1 men. Although both are unlikely, there is nothing
in the data that would invalidate this assumption. But such `assumption free’ allocations will
fundamentally change the career gaps we observe, and it is quite obvious that the further we move out
from the entry date the less informative these bounds would become. Depending on how we allocate
grades among those who have left will lead us to virtually any conclusion that we wish to draw. The point
here is not to support or reject these assignments, but to claim that without substantial information on
the leavers, even with a 5-year career trajectory, the results are consistent with multiple interpretations.

                                                                                                                                                                      26
Having said that, as an alternative to the bounding approach we can choose to adopt more stringent
assumptions on the composition of those who leave and those who remain at the Bank. These
assumptions are necessarily untested, since we can never know what the career trajectory of those who
left the Bank would have been had they chosen to stay, but we can examine whether in their past
performance the leavers and stayers looked very different. Appendix Table 2 shows the relative salaries
and mean performance ratings of stayers and leavers at different parts of the tenure profile. Strikingly,
we find few differences in their salaries at the point they left, a finding that is consistent with the
hypothesis that leavers are a combination of high and low performers, who are either `pulled-away’ or
`pushed-out’. In the decomposition exercise that follows we will assume therefore that conditional on
their salary before leaving, leavers are identical to stayers. This assumption makes more sense if
performance is a “type of person”, but not if performance is “effort on the job”. If people leave in
anticipation of future shocks to their productivity, this is a particularly poor assumption, but one that will
plague any attempt to analyze performance within a single firm.

Table 2 then shows the career trajectories of those who chose to remain. Rather than focus on salaries,
we examine how the original GF cohort is subsequently promoted to GG, GH and higher as grades and
salaries are tightly tied at the WBG. Several patterns are immediately obvious.

First, the answer to which group is being promoted faster (leaving aside the question of how to assign
counterfactual grades to those who have left) depends on which snapshot we look at. Although Part 2
men perform the best at each cohort snapshot, with 5 years tenure, Part 1 women are very close behind
followed by Part 1 men and Part 2 women. After 10 years, Part 1 and Part 2 women look quite similar in
terms of promotions to GG and GH with Part 1 performing the worst. However, if we look at the fraction
still remaining in their original grade, GF, Part 2 women appear to be performing the worst, followed by
Part 1 and Part 2 men with Part 1 women performing best. After 20 years, Part 2 men are still doing the
best with the highest promotions to GH and GI (31 percent of the original cohort) with Part 1 men close
behind followed by Part 1 and Part 2 women.

Summary

In terms of employee composition, there were key historical differences between men and women and
Part 1 and Part 2 employees at the WBG in terms of the jobs that they were hired into. In 1987, women
were hired into grades GA-GD and men into GE+. Over time, the representation of women and Part 2
nationals into GE+ grades has increased, although, even in 2014, as a fraction of all GE+ staff, they are still
below 50 percent in new hiring. In terms of entry salaries, we find systematic and continuing differences
in grade GG and this deficit is approximately $2,000-5,000 among new hires from 2010-2015. When it
comes to salary growth, there is evidence that even though they enter at similar salaries, the return to
tenure is lower for staff who are not Part 1 males and enter as GF (but not for GG or GE cohorts) and this
deficit increases to $4,000-5,000 after 15 years. In addition to these differences, there are aggregate
changes at the institution over the period of our data, whereby entry salaries have increased more for
higher grades, GA-GD hiring has declined and exit rates have fluctuated in periodic cycles. In what
proportion each of these contributes to the aggregate and career gaps cannot be addressed by examining
each of these components separately. We therefore turn to a dynamic decomposition approach.


IV: Decomposition of Salary Gaps
1. Overview of the Methodology
Our decomposition is based on the following accounting relationship. One can compute the distribution
of salaries in a given year y by combining four pieces of information: (i) the salaries of incumbent
employees in year y-1, (ii) the salary raises received by these incumbent employees, (iii) the entry salaries
received by new hires, (iv) the distribution of salaries among staff who chose to leave the organization in
that year.



                                                                                                            28
The first element, the distribution of salaries at y-1, can be itself obtained by combining the same four
objects in the year y-2 and so on. Ultimately, after iterating this relationship backwards, the distribution
of salaries in year y can be thought of as aggregating four components:

    (i)     “Legacy”: The initial salary distribution in year y0 (which in practice will be the first year in
            which data are available, in our case 1987)
    (ii)    “Salary growth” component: the salary raises between y0 and y
    (iii)   “Entry salaries”: the salaries of new hires between y0 and y
    (iv)    “Attrition”: the salaries of staff who leave the organization between y0 and y

It follows that average salary differences between two groups of employees will aggregate differences
between groups in each of those four components. Our goal is to determine the relative importance of
each component in accounting for salary differences between groups of employees. To do so we simulate
a series of counterfactual salary distributions in which we shut down one source of salary differences after
the other. For example we can simulate what women’s salaries would look like if women were hired at
the same conditions as men (see Figure 13). What would those salaries look like if, in addition, women
received the same salary raises as men, etc. By shutting down each component of the gender gap at a
time, we can determine what percentage of the gender gap is caused by that specific component.

Figure 13: Decomposing the Gender Gap Using Counterfactual Salary Distributions




                                                                                                          29
An important consideration in applying this decomposition concept to the WBG salary data is that
employees are hired at a specific grade. This suggests that our “entry salaries” component should be
subdivided into the grades at which men and women are hired, and the entry salaries they receive
conditional on their hiring grade. This leaves us with five components: attrition, salary growth, entry
salaries, grade composition of hires and legacy.

Appendix 2 describes in detail how the decomposition is implemented using simulations. In brief, the
procedure involves the following steps. First we estimate from our data simple parametric models for
each decomposition component, in each year and for each group of employee that we are concerned
with. For example, we estimate the probability of leaving the bank in 1995 for a Part 1 male employee
hired as a GF, as a function of his current salary. Next, taking as given the initial 1987 distribution of
salaries, we use the estimated models to simulate the salary raise that each employee receives in each
year, whether they leave the WBG in each year, as well as the salaries of new hires, all the way to 2015.
After verifying that the simulations for 2015 reproduce accurately the 2015 data, we can use the
simulation model to produce counterfactual salary distributions in which, for example, the parameters
governing the salary growth for women are replaced by the parameters governing salary growth for men.

The procedure described above decomposes the difference in salaries between two groups of employees
in a given year, which we have called the “aggregate gap”. However, the same method can also be adapted
to conduct an analysis by tenure. The object of interest in that case is salary gaps as they develop over the
employee's careers, which we call the “career gap”. To do so, the data are arranged by years of tenure
instead of by calendar year. Hiring salary, attrition, and salary growth processes are also estimated for
each year of tenure. The simulation algorithm starts by drawing a distribution of entry salaries and
proceeds to simulate salary growth and exits for each year of tenure.

This decomposition method has several strengths. First, the factors identified in the decomposition
correspond to well-defined Human Resources levers. Namely, the policies concerning raises and
promotions, the policies regarding new hires and the policies regarding retention of employees. An
important point regarding the interpretation of the results, is that this decomposition is not concerned
with determining why each of these policies have favored men over women or some nationalities over
others. For example, if male hires receive higher salaries than female hires, we do not attempt to separate
whether this is due to discrimination or to objective differences in qualifications among male and female
candidates. Instead, the type of statement that we can make is for example: “80 percent of salary



                                                                                                          30
differences between men and women originate from differences in the salaries negotiated upon joining
the WBG.”

A second advantage of this method is that it accounts for the role of attrition, which, as documented
earlier, is sizeable. This is because the data allow us to observe employees who have left the Bank and
infer what current salaries would look like if they had stayed in the institution. Note that this is done at
the cost of the assumption that they would have received the same salaries on average as the employees
of the same group, entry grade and cohort who ended up staying and who had the same salary level as
them at the time of their departure. In addition, the decomposition can handle the pervasive non-
stationary or cohort-specific trends exhibited by salaries and employee composition in the data, as
documented in the earlier sections of this report.

The following sections describe the results of our decomposition of the aggregate gender gap, the
aggregate country part gap, the career gender gap and the career country part gap.

2. Decomposition Results: The Aggregate Gender Gap
The aggregate gender gap is defined as the difference between the average salaries of male and female
employees in 2015. The quality of the simulation fit is presented in Figure 14. Both the aggregate gender
gap and the aggregate country part gap for all grades in 2015 is well approximated by the simulations
(bars 1 and 2 and bars 5 and 6). We also implement the decomposition separately for hiring grades GE
and higher. That conditional gap is also well approximated in the simulations (bars 3 and 4 and bars 7 and
8 in Figure 14). We will also decompose the career gap further below into similar components; the final
set of four bars shows the simulation fit for the career gap, by gender and by country part.

Figure 15 shows how the decomposition of the aggregate gender gap is obtained by the methodology
described in the previous section. Equating attrition probabilities across men and women closes 0.6
percent of the gap. Further equating salary growth closes an additional 5.4 percent and equating entry
salaries accounts for another 7.3 percent. These three factors explain together only 13.3 percent of the
gap. 76.2 percent of the gap corresponds to hiring grade composition effects whereby women are
disproportionately hired at lower grades. The remainder of the gap (10.5 percent) can be attributed to
differences between men and women hired before 1987 (the ``initial'' distribution).

For grades GE and higher, the decomposition factors are shown in Figure 15, right graph. The composition
of hires remains the most important factor to explain the gender pay gap. This is not surprising when one
considers, as we have noted in previous sections, that the WBG hired many more men than women at the
higher grades such as GG or GH throughout the period. Note that differential attrition has the effect of
bringing male and female salaries closer together, i.e. it contributes negatively to the gender gap.

3. Decomposition Results: The Aggregate Country Part Gap
The results of the decomposition of the pay gaps between Part 1 and Part 2 employees are presented in
Figure 16. Equating attrition probabilities across Part 1 and Part 2 employees closes 14.5 percent of the
gap. Further equating salary growth closes an additional 6.2 percent and equating entry salaries accounts
for another 10.5 percent. These three factors explain together 31.2 percent of the gap. The bulk of the


                                                                                                                                   32
gap (60.7 percent) again corresponds to the fact that Part 2 employees are on average hired at lower
grades. The remainder of the gap can be attributed to differences predating 1987. Within the GE+
category (Figure 16, right graph), the composition of hires again explains the majority (52 percent) of the
gap.

4. Decomposition Results: The GF Career Gap
We now decompose the pay gaps as they develop over the course of a career. We simulate the salaries
of employees hired between 1987 and 2001 onwards for 15 years. The choice of 15 years reflects a trade-
off between capturing career dynamics at higher grades, which necessitates a long span, and obtaining
results that are relevant to a large fraction of employees, rather than the small subgroup that accumulates
20 years of tenure at the WBG or more. As we discuss in section III.2, most hiring grades are not amenable
to this decomposition, either because the salary gaps are too small, or because there are not enough
individuals of each subgroup hired at that grade. We thus focus on GF hires, a group that includes large
enough gender-by-country part subsamples and exhibits sizeable pay gaps among them. Note that since
grade GF is one of the most common entry grades, we still cover 37.1 percent of all employees in grades
GE+ despite this restriction.

To examine the gender career gap, we first compare male Part 1 and female Part 1 employees hired at
the WBG headquarters at grade GF between 1987 and 2001. As seen in Figure 17, left graph, this gap is
mostly due to differences in salary growth (84.5 percent), while attrition, salary growth and entry salaries

                                                                                                                                 33
conditional on grade explain only 15.5 percent of it. A similar story emerges when comparing male Part
1 employees with male Part 2 employees. In this case (Figure 17, right graph), salary growth more than
explains the total gap (123 percent), and differential attrition works in the opposite direction.

5. Discussion of the Results
The main insight from the decomposition exercise is that in terms of the aggregate gap, the historical and
continuing differences in entry grades are the major contributors. Career gaps arise sporadically across
grades and GF is the only entry grade with sufficient sample and sufficient salary gaps after 15 years for a
meaningful decomposition exercise. These results are at odds with the prior results of Filmer et al. (2005)
and with a prevailing view in the institution that there is considerable difference in the pay and promotion
by sex and nationality at the WBG.

We therefore conclude our analysis with a brief discussion of two further issues. First, we reconcile the
prior results of Filmer et al. (2005) with our findings. Second, we assess whether equity across subgroups
comes at the “cost” of rewarding performance. That is, if salary increases are arbitrary, there is little
reason for differences to arise across subgroups. Whether the WBG both rewards performance and limits
differences by sex and nationality or whether it limits differences by subgroups by limiting rewards to
performance is an important issue in its own right.



                                                                                                                               34
To reconcile our results with Filmer et al. (2005), Table 3 replicates their gender gaps, noting that these
numbers do not account for differences in the entry grades of employees. We consider the 1997 cross-
section in our sample and apply the same sample restrictions, to the extent that we could identify them.
While our samples do not perfectly match, we obtain very similar gender and country part gaps, with large
differences in salaries in favor of Part 1 men and against Part 1 women and all Part 2 employees. We then
look at the subsample of staff hired after 1987, for whom we are able to identify the grade at which they
were hired. The pay gaps are a bit smaller (probably because they are from younger cohorts) but still large.
We then consider subgroups that are homogeneous with respect to their entry grade and these
differences become much smaller and sometimes disappear altogether. In other words, our results are
fully compatible with those of Filmer et al. (2005) and suggest again that differences in entry grades are a
key component of differences in salaries between subgroups at the WBG.

We then examine the link between pay and performance. In 2001, performance ratings were introduced
and staff were graded on a scale of 1 to 5. The system was strengthened in 2005 and again in 2010 to
increase the payoff to higher ratings. Nevertheless, a common belief in the institution is that specific
management practices may limit the ability of the WBG to reward high performers. One such practice is
that staff should not receive ratings of 5 in two consecutive years and they should receive a 3 in the year
that they are promoted.

If we assume that such ratings accurately reflect performance, we can use the performance data available
from 2001 onwards in order to look at the link between compensation and performance. Between 2001
and 2015, with some changes, SRIs in our data are graded from 1 to 5, with 60 percent of staff in any given
year falling in the average grade of 3, and 40 percent in grades 4 and 5. Grades 1 and 2 are for particularly
poor performance, but are seldom used over the period of our data, accounting for less than 0.5 percent
of all performance records.

Patterns in the data are consistent both with rewards to performance and a preference for equality. For
instance, of all staff who received a 5 in a given year, 24 percent went on to receive a 5 the next year
(Table 4). Similar patterns obtain for GA-GD staff, GE to GH staff and GI+ staff and if we restrict our data
only to the 2010-2015 period when SRI budgets tightened (tables available on request). On the other

                                                                                                                      36
hand, as a staff member’s salary increases within the same grade, their subsequent salary increase slows
down. For those who are above the “midpoint” of the salary band at their grade-level, high performance
yields marked compensation increases only if the staff member is promoted. For instance, in our data
there are two variables that show the salary raise in a given year for an employee—the raise that an
employee would receive based on his/her SRI alone and the actual raise that takes into account the
relative compensation of the staff at his/her grade level. In a regression context, the “midpoint” penalty
implies that, after conditioning on grade, an increase in the SRI implies a 1.9 percentage point salary
increase, but there is a 0.6 percentage point penalty for every $10,000 increase in the initial salary.

Similarly, large policies appear not to be reflected in performance ratings. For instance, in 2010, a
significant change was introduced, whereby new hires would be given 3 year contracts with renewal based
on performance. This could have incentivized performance, but we do not see higher SRIs on average for
staff hired in 2011 and 2012. The SRI obtained over the first three years at the WBG remains the same for
staff hired in 2008 (SRI=3.31), 2009 (SRI=3.31), 2010 (SRI=3.34), 2011 (SRI=3.32) and 2012 (SRI=3.25).

An alternate way to assess performance rewards is to examine the diversity in performance of cohorts
over time. Take for instance the 2005-2015 period, where the SRI system has been in place for 10 years
and consider the salary structures of those who were hired between 2000 and 2005. The worst 10 percent
of performers among staff who entered as GF between 2000 and 2005 in a balanced panel over this period
has an average SRI of 3.22; the best 10 percent of performers has an average SRI of 4.30.

These differences in average SRIs led to large variation in pay (Table 5). By 2015, the best 10 percent saw
their salary increase by 83% against 26% for the worst 10 percent. Nevertheless, these rewards are not
seen as clearly through the entire distribution of performance. There is a clear penalty for staff in the
lowest decile, and to a lesser extent, to deciles 2, 3 and 4, and a clear reward for those in the top decile
with muted differentiation among staff in deciles 5 through 9. A hypothesis consistent with these data is
that most of the difference in salaries is due to promotions rather than annual salary raises within the
same grade. The fraction of employees promoted to GH or more within 10 years is lower than 17 percent
for the first 4 deciles, between 30 and 40 percent for deciles 5 through 9, while 5 percent of employees in
the top decile are already at grade GI by that time and 50 percent are GH.

 V. Conclusion
 We have analyzed salary differences at the WBG between 1987 and 2015 in terms of differences by sex
 and by nationality. Our analysis begins with the idea that aggregate and career gaps can be examined as
 an interplay between composition and compensation effects and our decomposition results suggest that
 composition effects play the major role in explaining the aggregate gap in 2015. The career gap in
 general—and especially among GE+ staff where sample sizes are sufficient for meaningful comparisons—
 tends to be small at the WBG with entry salaries, salary growth and exits contributing in different
 proportions depending on the grade at which the employee was originally hired.

 As a research paper, the objective is to establish basic facts that can inform discussion and debate at the
 WBG. One general theme that emerges from this line of work is that pay distributions today are linked in
 complex ways to historical hiring and compensation patterns. Conversely, policies today will have long-
 run effects that need to be carefully considered. For instance, attempts to increase the number of women
 at the GH level through greater hiring at the GF level and promotions would have to account for the fact
 that men tend to leave the institution at a faster rate than women and that overall exits are highly cyclical.
 Consequently, boosting hiring at the bottom of an exit-cycle can have very different long-term effects
 relative to additional hiring at the peak of the cycle. Similarly, one-time salary raises to staff who are below
 a benchmark would have to be evaluated both in terms of their effects on the balance between pay and
 performance as well as the design of the compensation system.


                                                                                                               38
Two specific issues stand out for further attention. First, compositional differences continue to affect the
distribution of staff at the WBG. We do not know whether these differences emerge at the point of hiring
(equally qualified men and women have applied, but men are chosen more often) or at the point of job
applications (fewer qualified women apply relative to men). Data on job applicants are currently not
available in the HR system and further, even for those who are successfully hired into the WBG, data on
personal characteristics are incomplete. For instance, education levels measured as the highest degree is
missing for 55 percent of staff in the data. If compositional differences arise at the application stage, a
very different kind of policy would be required (such as an outreach program) relative to compositional
differences that arise at the hiring stage given an equal application pool across all subgroups.

Second, exit rates from the institution are such that 50% of staff leave within 7-9 years. Little is known
about why staff leave the institution and what jobs they receive outside the WBG. Further, managers may
have flexibility to negotiate, but new tools may need to be leveraged better to retain staff who plan to
leave. Our analysis revealed that those who leave and those who stay look very similar on their
performance at the WBG prior to their exit. Therefore, the institution loses both high and low performing
staff whenever the number of exits rises. Appropriate actions that can be taken to retain high-performing
staff—especially women and Part 2 staff—may be a useful new area for policy or simply be an area that
needs to be better managed within the institution.

Data Collection Description
SUMMARY: The purpose of collecting long-term human resource (HR) data is to provide deeper insight
on career development, including pay and performance, of staff in the World Bank Group. Particular
emphasis is placed on exploring how different dimensions of diversity such as gender relate to pay and
performance. Using data sources such as PeopleSoft and Business Intelligence, data were provided by
different HR teams such as the performance & compensation team. The Development Research Group
(DEC) provided the data and calculations for CPI and PPP adjustments of salaries. Most data came from
PeopleSoft. Variables include the staff’s unique personnel identifier (UPI), the year in which the
snapshot was taken, indicators of employment status, appointment types, duty location countries and
cities, salaries, units, age, performance ratings, salary increases, departments and diversity dimensions.

    I.   Presentation

We describe the methodology for coding and building the “WBG Human Resources Longitudinal
Database”, which is a panel data set on WBG human resource data from 1987-2015. We first present
the overall structure of the database and describe the different data warehouses from which it was
constructed; second, we delineate the general rules and criteria we used for coding and merging; then
we present a selection of important variables, their original and raw coding and definitions in a short
codebook of the variables. We subsequently provide a more extensive explanation of this host of
important variables, the changes and standardizations we applied to them, as well as describing
institutional changes that took place over the course of the years covered.

    II. Overall structure of the database and sources

Structure: This section presents the overall structure of the WBG HR Longitudinal Database and
describes the different data sources used.

        The dataset is structured in a panel format, with each fiscal year representing one part of the
         panel. The overall design is modular. There are two skeletal variables that make up the
         backbone of the dataset: the universal personnel identifier (UPI) and the fiscal year (FY). All the
         other variables were then added to these UPI-years.
             o Universal personnel identifiers never change for an individual, even if the staff member
                 has several breaks in service of employment at the WBG.
             o The dataset runs from fiscal years 1987 to 2015. Each yearly snapshot is taken as per
                 June 30th of that year, which is the end of a fiscal year. The 1988 snapshot, for example,
                 is as of 6/30/1988.

Data Sources: At this time, the WBG does not have a unified data warehouse that contains all human
resource data. The HR longitudinal database is therefore built from multiple sources:

     PeopleSoft/Business Intelligence (BI): The most important source of data is PeopleSoft, which
      contains elements such as WBG staff’s universal personnel identified (UPI); salaries (in net
      terms); salary administration plan (what plan they are on); personal backgrounds (e.g. gender,
      age); professional situation (e.g. professional grade); location (e.g. HQ or country-office based);
      role and movements within the organization (e.g. promotions and lateral moves); and
      compensation and benefits (e.g. salaries). Whether or not an HR analyst has access to
      compensation and benefits data depends on the level of access. The PeopleSoft data can be
      accessed through SAP Business Intelligence.
          o In general, the data are organized into stock and flow data. The stock data are updated
              daily. Daily snapshots are not saved, however. At the end of every month, a snapshot of
              the personnel records is frozen in time and saved for future use. The flow data can be
              accessed through a custom timeframe, including the first and last day of flow data.




                                                                                                           3

           o Through BI, one can only go back as far as fiscal year (FY) 2000, but a custom request to
                the HR Reports department allows one to go back further than the year 2000. This
                meant that construction of the database entailed merging pre and post 2000 data.
     Talent Management: The WBGs Talent Management Unit is responsible for keeping records of
       talent development, including the numbers of identified ‘top talents’ at different grade levels.
       This data also includes observations on the yearly performance rating, also known as SRIs,
       which co-determine salary increases.
     Family Data: Data on the family situation of staff is housed under a separate roof as well. This
       includes variables on the number of members in the household, as well as the marital status of
       the staff member.

Merging: Data from these different sources were merged using the skeletal variables mentioned above
(UPI and Fiscal Years).

Deleted data: After the merging process, the following data were deleted.

       Observations that had year marked as 0.
       1165 observations with a missing salary. This had several reasons:
            o Performance rankings are, on a different time schedule resulting in some employees
                  who received a performance ranking, but by the time we see them in the dataset, have
                  left the WBG. Or, conversely, they were given a `fictional’ SRI for a performance year in
                  which they did not work because they joined in that year. This is due to the retroactive
                  character of the performance ratings. The merge from the performance data created
                  such observations, which cannot be linked to the larger dataset.
            o Some missing data are because we integrated an indicator for whether the staff was a
                  Young Professional from another dataset. The WBG HR systems, however, mark
                  somebody who was once a YP as always a YP. Employees who remain after retirement
                  or exit as short term or part-time consultants will be merged in with their UPI but will
                  not have wage data as they are no longer considered staff.
            o Third, there are staff who go on secondments where they are no longer paid by the
                  WBG, or are on leave without pay, when their salaries also disappear. This happens for
                  several personnel members for some individual or groups of years over their
                  employment spells at the Bank.
       Finally, there are those whose salaries are marked as 0. These are people on special assignment,
        therefore these are also graded Unclassified UCs, and they do not receive any salary that year.

    III. General rules and criteria

In building, standardizing and cleaning the dataset, we used several different general rules and criteria.
    1. General Definitions: In general, we aimed to use and thereby maintain the integrity of the WBG
         internal definitions.
    2. Employee Selection The WBG has several different types of employees. The most important
         broad distinction is between staff members and consultants. Within these two large categories,
         several sub-categories existed. In addition, these sub-categories have shifted significantly over
         time. A third but small category, often captured in the systems as staff members who are
         unclassified, are executive directors and their advisors.
             a. In general, database excludes short-term consultants since little data is available on
                 them, and they are not fulltime staff members. However, so-called long-term

Technical Appendix                                        World Bank Group HR Longitudinal Database

                  consultants (LTCs) as well as its later form – Extended Term Consultants (ETCs) – are
                  included in the database, since these contract types represent full-time consultancy
                  positions with the WBG.
             b. Executive Directors and their Advisors are included in the database, but excluded from
                  the analysis since they are not paid by the WBG but by the governments they represent.
    3.   Variable names and labels: The WBG HR systems variable names and labels were changed to
         increase readability. For example, the label gradecurr was changed to “original unstandardized
         WBG professional grade” or the label `eod’ was replaced with “entry-of-duty”.
    4.   String to numeric: Several numeric variables were marked as string variables by default. This
         included, for example, the yearly snapshot data. We changed these string variables into numeric
         variables where appropriate to make it easier to work with the data.
    5.   Binary variables: We consistently recoded binary variables into zeros and ones.
    6.   Variable Standardization and Modernizations: WBG HR systems have changed multiple times
         over the span of the dataset (1987-2015). As such, data definitions have also changed for
         multiple variables. Where possible, we recoded variables in such a way that the definitions
         reflect the current protocols


    IV. Overview of selected important variables

to understand or work with, or needed conversions or fixes. The variables are divided into six categories.

    V. Selected variables, definitions, fixes and conversions

5.1 Backbone variables

UPI & Year
The UPI & year are the two variables that form the primary keys for the panel dataset. They uniquely
identify the staff member as well as the fiscal year in which we observe them.

5.2 Salary Variables

Salary
Salary is the salary in the system during the snapshot. It does not reflect the actual previous year’s
salary, but the salary in the system at the point of measurement. Salary is always noted as a net salary in
the system. International hires, who do not have a U.S. citizenship nor a green card, do not pay taxes
over their WBG income. U.S. nationals do, but their salaries are recorded as net salaries in the system, to
make them comparable to the salaries of international hires.

       U.S. nationals receive a tax reimbursement through a separate system, to compensate them for
        the differential. After the reimbursement, the salary is not always completely identical to what
        an international hire would have earned, but it approximates it closely.
       Salary increases derive from three sources: overall salary increases, performance-based
        increases and promotion-based increases.
       A promotion to a higher professional grade is associated with the highest salary increase, since a
        staff member moves into a higher salary bracket.
       Increases without promotions follow a different logic. These stem from increases based on
        performance as well as a non-performance based, broader salary increases for staff. Therefore,
        salary at t does not equate the salary at t-1 plus the increase associated with a particular
        performance rating. There is an additional part of the increase which takes place independently
        from performance.
       In addition, the salary increase system is set-up such that those at a lower end of the spectrum
        receive higher increases than those at a higher end of the spectrum. Or, within a professional
        particular grade, individuals who are at a lower part of the salary scale associated with that
        grade receive higher relative increases than those who are at a higher end of the salary
        distribution.
       Since the 1990s, the WBG compensation and benefits team have started conducting a yearly
        analysis to identify salary outliers and rectify them. Using regression analysis, the team looks
        throughout the WBG to look at individuals who earn 10% or more below the salary they can be



                                                                                                         9
Technical Appendix                                        World Bank Group HR Longitudinal Database

        expected to have. If an outlier is identified, the manager of that unit will then be tasked with
        giving them a one-time large increase to rectify this. Outliers receiving over 10% more than what
        can be expected are not corrected.
       On rare occasions, individuals experience a decrease in their nominal salary. This can happen if
        somebody decides to accept a demotion or salary decrease instead of losing their position. Over
        the span of the dataset, there are 34 observations where this is the case.

Salary currency
     A majority of WBG staff are paid in U.S. dollars, but there are also a large number of
        observations who are paid in local currencies.
     In general, staff who are based in the Washington DC Headquarters, are paid in U.S. dollars.
        Local staff can either be paid in U.S. dollars or in their local currency. Generally, international
        hires working in country offices are paid in U.S. dollars whereas locally-hired staff are paid in the
        local currency, with some exceptions.

Paygroup
Paygroup and globalpayrollgroup are the exact same thing, but the globalpayrollgroup replaced the
paygroup variable in FY14. It represents a combination of the salaryadminplan and the salary currency,
but is not a very strong and complete variable.

Salary Administration Plan
The salary administration plan reflects the system a staff is mapped to, but not necessarily the currency
they are paid in. In other words, the salaryadminplan does not necessarily equate the currency of that
salaryadminplan. For example, staff in Russia might be on the Russian (‘RU’) salaryadminplan. This does
not tell us whether they are paid in rubles or in dollars at a given time t. To derive this, one has to look
at the salary currency indicator. The standard WBG two-letter country codes were used to standardize
the salary administration plan and create consistency across the variables.

5.3 Variables on professional background

Grades
The WBG has changed the way in which it marks its professional grades over time. The current system
grades employees from GA to GD for administrative and client services (ACS) staff. GE tends to refer to
analysts, but is a somewhat heterogeneous category. GF to GG refers to professional technical staff. GH
can refer to technical staff or managers. GI refers to directors, GJ to and GK to vice presidents and senior
management and GL is the President of the WBG.

       Over the course of the time covered by the dataset, there were two large changes. The original
        system ranged from A to P. However, a large proportion of staff were not given a particular
        grade at this time (see below).
       After this point, there was a system in which the grades ranged in numbers from 1 to 31. Grades
        1-10 described support staff such as cooks and drivers. Grades 10 to 31 to professional grades,
        with 10 to 17 (GA-GD) referring to different levels of administrative staff, and grades 18 and up
        to professional levels (GE+).
       In 1999 the system changed to its current set of broad banding.
       Throughout the years, there have also been two unclassified categories which are
        heterogeneous containers—UC and UA. Before the system of broad-banding, the UC category



                                                                                                          10
Technical Appendix                                           World Bank Group HR Longitudinal Database

             referred to a broad set of professional groups as well as Long-Term Consultants. The UA
             category also referred to a broad set of professional groups, generally in more administrative
             roles. However, what these two categories describe has changed significantly over time. Today,
             UA refers to Junior-Professional Associates mainly, whereas UC refers to Executive Directors,
             Executive Advisors as well as country managers.
            There are also grades specifically for fulltime consultants. This ranges from ETT1, which is
             extended term temporary level 1, to ETT4 and from ETC1 to ETC4. The latter is the extended
             term consultant. Level 1 refers to a GE level position whereas level 4 is comparable to a GH level
             staff position. These positions were no longer available after 2016.

Organization
The WBG consists of three branches, the World Bank (IBRD/IDA), The International Finance Corporation
(IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). For a few observations, this
organizational demarcation was missing, but could be imputed looking at the years closest to the
missing data.



                                                                                                             11

Entry of Duty
The entry of duty variable (EOD) is problematic, as individual employees can be given several EODs in
different observation-years. This is primarily driven by the fact that the way the WBG recorded the EOD
changed, reflecting therefore system-imposed changes rather than real changes. This is particularly
noticeable from the year 1999 to 2000, when WBG HR Systems changed to record the most recent EOD
rather than the first EOD. In other words, an individual employee who enters the WBG in 1973, left, and
came back in 1976 will have an EOD of 1973 in each of the recorded years until 2000. In the observation-
years post 2000, the EOD will read 1976. This was not fixed in the database, but is important to take into
consideration when conducting analysis on the data.

To provide an example:
Person A starts working from 1983 to 1986 and then took a break from 1986 till 1990, before rejoining
the WBG.
 We start observing this person in 1990 in our data.
The EOD is WRONG for the years 1990 to 2000, as it should have been 1990 throughout, but it was only
reset to 1986 in 2000 when they changed the logic of the recording.

Country Codes:
The WBG has two-letter country codes. This is a standardized matrix used for different country
indicators, for example to show the salary administration plan, or to show the duty country of a staff
member. E.g. the code for the Netherlands is “NL”.

Appointment Type
Appointment type reflects the type of contract a staff member is on. For example, a staff member can
be on a multi-year or open-ended contract. The way in which appointment type was recorded changed
over time. These different definitions were standardized to reflect the current (as of 2015) WBG
appointment type definitions. See the table below for the standardizations:

Appointment Type Standardized                        Unstandardized
HQ Regular                                           HQ Regular or Open-Ended Staff
Term Staff                                           HQ Fixed Term or Term Staff
Local Staff Regular Appointment                      Local Regular
Local Staff Term                                     Local Fixed Term

A2.01 The types of appointments to the staff of the WBG are specified below:

    a. Regular Appointment is a full-time appointment of indefinite duration made before July 1,
       1998.
    b. Local Staff Regular Appointment is a full-time appointment of indefinite duration, made before
       July 1, 1998, of a person recruited to serve at a WBG country office.
    c. Open-Ended Appointment is an appointment of indefinite duration made after June 30, 1998.
    d. Term Appointment is an appointment for a specified duration of a minimum of one year and a
       maximum of five years per appointment except:
          i.                                     a staff member who joins the WBG under the Junior
                Professional Associate Program can be appointed for a maximum of two years, and;

          ii.                                    for a staff member appointed to an Administrative
                Client Support position in the Executive Directors' offices whose appointment will end
                with the term of an Executive Director unless the Executive Director decides that the
                appointment will be renewed, extended or terminated at an earlier date.

    e. An Executive Director's Advisor appointment is coterminous with the term of an Executive
       Director unless the Executive Director decides that the appointment will be renewed, extended
       or terminated at an earlier date.
    f. Special Assignment Appointment is a full-time appointment without pay or benefits (except as
       approved by the Manager, HR Operations, or a designated official) of an official of a member
       country, regional agency, development bank, international organization or private enterprise for
       the purpose of receiving or using experience and contributing to the WBG's work program.
    g. Extended Term Temporary Appointment is a full-time appointment at the equivalent of Grades
       A – D for a minimum of one year, renewable for a second year, subject to a lifetime maximum of
       two years for all Extended Term appointments. Notwithstanding the above, if the manager of an
       ETT establishes a compelling business case that the ETT possesses highly specialized skills and/or
       experience, critical to the business, that cannot reasonably be obtained from others, the Vice
       President of the hiring unit may decide to allow an ETT appointment for up to an additional third
       year.
    h. Extended Term Consultant Appointment is a full-time appointment at the equivalent of grade
       GE or above for a minimum of one year, renewable for a second year, subject to a lifetime
       maximum of two years for all Extended Term appointments. Notwithstanding the above, if the
       manager of an ETC establishes a compelling business case that the ETC possesses highly
       specialized skills and/or experience, critical to the business, that cannot reasonably be obtained
       from others, the Vice President of the hiring unit may decide to allow an ETC appointment for
       up to an additional third year.

Unit Names (PMU, Department, Division)
There are many different demarcations for units inside the WBG. The most encompassing variable is the
PMU, which indicates what vice presidency a staff is mapped to. On a more granular level, there are also
department and division names.

The unit names have changed a lot over time, throughout all the different reorganizations and renaming
exercises undertaken by the WBG. It is therefore extremely difficult, if not impossible, to map the
different unit names to each or to their most recent names. Using the WBG archives, as well as old
documents available to our colleagues, we managed to find the full names for the unit abbreviations.

Education levels
The educational levels are marked in three-letter or two-letter abbreviations in the WBG HR systems. In
addition, the same type of degree often has two different three-letter definitions over the span of time
the panel-data set covers. These were standardized so that each degree type only has one, its more
current, definition left. For an overview of the conversions, see the table below:

It is difficult to use the educational variable for analysis, because educational records are missing for
over 25% of staff. There has been no consistent recording system for educational background. This
information is taken in when staff come on board, and it is filled out on their Personal History Forms
(PHFs) and verified by the Bank. However, the PHFs are not digitized in the HR systems. As such,
educational records are self-reported in the HR systems, making them quite unreliable and incomplete.
For historical data, this problem is unsolvable.

5.4 Variables on Personal Background

Nationalities
Nationalities, contrary to other country indicators, are written in full. This is inconsistent with the other
country code demarcations, so the fully written nationalities were transformed to reflect the two-letter
WBG country code indicators. E.g. “Dutch” was transformed into “NL”.
     Stateless There were also several individual employees who had a missing nationality, or who
        were stateless for a period of time. Their nationalities were imputed using information from
        other years of their employment, when their nationality was not missing. Rather than mark the
        missing years as their nationality only, in some cases they were also recoded as stateless.

Gender
The gender variable is complete and was transformed into a binary 0 and 1 form, from a string variable.

Country Part
Indicates whether the staff’s primary nationality corresponds to Part 1 or Part 2 countries.

SSA/CR
“SSA/CR” stands for Sub-Saharan African and Caribbean: staff who have a primary nationality in the
system (as verified by passport) from the Sub-Saharan African and Caribbean countries. The exception
for SSA is South Africa, which is not included in the numbers.

5.5 Merge Variables

Merges
These variables indicate the merges into stata (append merges) that were conducted in order to build
the dataset, and which data sources these merges drew on.

5.6 Inflation and Purchasing Power Variables

Inflation and purchasing power data
The imported data from the DEC Poverty group works with three-letter rather than two letter codes. To
standardize more, the DEC Poverty data was transformed into the WBG standard two-letter codes. E.g.
“NLD”, demarcating the Netherlands, became “NL”.

      Technical Appendix II: A simple Dynamic
         Accounting Decomposition Analysis


   In this section, we present a conceptual framework that decomposes salary
diﬀerences into the following four factors: diﬀerences in hiring policies, diﬀer-
ences in salary growth, diﬀerences in attrition and “legacy” diﬀerences inherited
from initial conditions. We then proceed to describe how to implement this de-
composition empirically using panel data on individual salaries and a simulation
algorithm.


1    Conceptual framework
Suppose an organization employs individuals of two diﬀerent types denoted as
g . For this exposition we will use the example of gender: females (g = f ) and
males (g = m), but the framework can also be applied to other categorizations.
    In a given year t, salaries wit are distributed according to the probability
density function (pdf): ft (.). We are interested in explaining gender gaps in
salaries, deﬁned as the diﬀerence between corresponding moments of the male
and female conditional distributions: ftf (.) and ftm (.). For example we may
be concerned with the diﬀerence in mean salaries across genders: E (wt /g =
f ) − E (wt /g = m).
    The process that governs how the salary distribution changes over time can
be modeled as follows. At the beginning of year t, nt individuals are employed,
comprising nf                  m
               t women and nt men, with salaries distributed according to ft (.)
                                                                                 f
       m
and ft (.). During the year individuals receive a salary increase. The functions
rf (.) and rm (.) map current salaries into the next year’s salaries. At the end
of the year, hg t individuals of gender g are hired in year t, with salaries drawn

from the hiring salary distribution fht   (.). Conversely, lt individuals of gender g
                                   g
leave, with salary distribution flt (.).
    The distribution of salaries evolves as a function of the objects introduced
above:

                    ft+1 (./g )   =   G [ng    g g      g    g     g    g
                                          t , ft , r , ht , fht , lt , flt ]     (1)
                         ng
                          t+1     =   ng
                                       t   +   hg
                                                t   −    g
                                                        lt                       (2)

    These relationships can be iterated backwards to an initial point (t = 0), de-
ﬁned for example as the ﬁrst year of available data. This yields a decomposition
of gender salary gaps at τ into:


                                               1
                                                     f     m
  1. Diﬀerences in the salary distributions at t=0 (f0 vs.f0 ).

  2. Diﬀerences in hiring policies (hf      f           m      m
                                     t and fht (.) vs. ht and fht (.), t = 0, τ ),

                                   f          m
  3. Diﬀerences in salary growth (rt (.) vs. rt (.), t = 0, τ ),

  4. Diﬀerences in retention (lt ,flt (.) vs. lt ,flt (.), t = 0, τ ),

    In applying this framework empirically, it may be desirable to group em-
ployees according to some permanent characteristic, such as type of occupation.
Doing so allows for further decomposing diﬀerences in hiring policies into (i)
diﬀerences in the number of men and women hired in each occupation and
(ii) diﬀerences in entry salaries conditional on occupation. The decomposition
becomes:
                                                     f     m
  1. Diﬀerences in the salary distributions at t=0 (f0 vs.f0 ),

  2. Diﬀerences in the occupational composition of new hires (hf      f
                                                               t and fht (.)
          m       m
     vs. ht and fht (.), t = 0, τ ),

  3. Diﬀerences in entry salaries conditional on occupation (hf      f
                                                              t and fht (.) vs.
      m       m
     ht and fht (.), t = 0, τ ),

  5. Diﬀerences in retention (lt ,flt (.) vs. lt ,flt (.), t = 0, τ ).
    In our application, we split our sample according to the grade at which an
employee is hired, as it is a key determinant of the salary received at entry, as
well as the subsequent salary growth and propensity to exit.
    We use a simulation algorithm to measure the ﬁve factors identiﬁed above
as they compound over time. Speciﬁcally, we:
  1. Specify and estimate empirical models for the number hires, their entry
     salaries, salary growth for each gender, and the probability of attrition.
  2. Using random draws for the stochastic elements in the model, simulate
     the yearly changes in the salary distributions of men and women, starting
     from the initial distribution f0 .
  3. Validate the simulation model by comparing simulated vs. actual salary
     distributions in the last year of available data.
  4. Quantify each source of gender disparity at a time, by simulating counter-
     factual salary distributions after equating across genders the parameters
     that govern that particular source of disparity.

2     Empirical models of hiring, salary growth and
      retention
This section describes how each factor in the decomposition is modeled empiri-
cally and estimated from the data.

Number of hires - The number of employees of gender g , hg     t , possibly for
each occupation, is directly observed from the data each year and taken as an
exogenous input in the simulations.

                                            e
Entry salaries - The salary of a new hire, wit is drawn from a lognormal
distribution:
                                 e
                           log (wit ) ∼ N1 (µeg   eg
                                             t , σt )                         (3)
                                                                              (4)

                                                            f
Salary growth - We assume that the growth rate of salaries rt is governed
by a log-normal distribution:
                                 g
                           log (rit ) ∼ N2 (µrg   rg
                                             t , σ2t )                        (5)
Furthermore, the mean growth rate depends on the current salary level:
                            µrg   rg   rg
                             t = αt + βt ∗ wit                                (6)

Attrition - The probability of exiting the sample is modeled as a function of
gender and the current salary:
                                                ag    ag
                  p(exitit = 1/t, g, wit ) = Φ(αt  + βt  wit )                (7)
    Two features of the data made occasional departures from these models nec-
essary. First, some years saw widespread salary freezes at the World Bank. To
capture this, salary growth was modeled as a two step process. With some
probability pgt , an employee’s salary stays constant in a given year. Then, con-
ditional on not remaining constant, the salary change is determined by equation
5.
    The second set of adjustments are made necessary by insuﬃcient numbers of
observations for some group/years. For example there may be no or only a few
employees exiting in a given year, rendering the estimate for β ag in equation 7
too imprecise and unﬁt for simulation. The adjustments are as follows:
    1. Salary raises are set to 0 if the number of employees in the corresponding
       cell is less than 2
    2. If the standard errors of parameter β rg in equation 6 or parameter β age
       in equation 7 are greater that 0.005, the salary regressor is dropped from
       the corresponding equation.
    The parameter estimates for our application are presented in table 1.

3     Simulation algorithm
Given the estimated models above, the simulation algorithm updates salaries
from year t − 1 to year t as follows:
    1. Store the simulated annual salaries carried over from t − 1 as a histogram
       with bin size of 1000 dollars.
    2. For each bin in the histogram, and for each individual in the bin, draw a
       salary from a uniform distribution over the support of the bin, and a rate
       at which that salary increases during year t using the ﬁtted value from
       equation 6. Then determine the new bin in which that individual belongs
       after the salary raise.
    3. Determine for each employee whether they exit the sample at the end of
       t using the probability obtained from equation 7.
    4. Build a histogram of entry salaries for each gender and each employee
       group using the number of hires for that group and the distribution of entry
       salaries in equation 3. Add the histogram of entrants to the histogram of
       employees who didn’t exit.
    5. Go to t + 1.


4     Simulation ﬁt
We apply this procedure taking 1987 as the initial year and simulating forward
to 2015. We then compare the simulated 2015 distribution of salaries with its
data counterpart for each group of employee.
   Figures 1 and 2 present the diﬀerence between the mean and the standard
deviations of the distribution of salaries of each group of employees in the data
and the simulations in 2015.

5      Decomposition
The decomposition of the mean salary gap is obtained by simulating salary
distributions under the baseline and ﬁve counterfactual speciﬁcations:

    1. Baseline simulation: all parameters are gender-speciﬁc
    2. Female employees have the same probability of leaving the organization,
                                   f           m
       conditional on their wage: fa (w, t) = fa (w, t).

    3. Condition 2 AND female employees draw their wage increase from the
                                 ˜f
       same distribution as men: µ   ˜g
                                  2 =µ2.

    4. Conditions 2-3 AND at each hiring grade, entry salaries are the same for
       both genders.

    5. Conditions 2-4 AND the organization hires the same number of female
       and male employees at each grade.


                                       5
Figure 2: Simulations ﬁt: standard deviation of salaries by gender, grade and
country part




  6. Conditions 2-5 AND the distribution of salaries and grades among men
     and women is the same at t = 0.
    We compute the diﬀerence in mean salaries from the distributions obtained
after each step and that obtained in the previous step. Denoting as wgs the
wage gap computed after step s, we obtain:
   • Fraction of the 2015 salary gap due to diﬀerences in attrition in 1987-2015:
     wg2 −wg1
     wg6 −wg1

   • Fraction of the 2015 salary gap due to diﬀerences in wage growth in 1987-
              3 −wg2
     2015: wg
            wg6 −wg1

   • Fraction of the 2015 salary gap due to diﬀerences in entry salaries in 1987-
            wg4 −wg3
     2015: wg 6−wg1

   • Fraction of the 2015 salary gap due to diﬀerences in entry grades in 1987-
            wg5 −wg4
     2015: wg 6−wg1

     • Fraction of the 2015 salary gap inherited from the 1987 salary gap:   wg 6−wg1



6      Tenure analysis
The procedure can also be adapted to conduct an analysis by tenure. This
approach allows for an analysis of salary gaps as they develop over the employee’s
careers. The data is then arranged by years of tenure instead of by year. Hiring
salary, attrition, and salary growth processes are also estimated for each year
of tenure. The simulation algorithm starts by drawing a distribution of entry
salaries and proceeds to simulate salary growths and exits for each year of tenure.
    The ﬁt of the simulation model after 15 years of tenure is shown in ﬁgures 3
and 4.
