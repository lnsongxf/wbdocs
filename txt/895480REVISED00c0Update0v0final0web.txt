EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Rising exports contributed to Ethiopia’s remarkable growth performance over the past decade.
Buoyed by favorable external conditions, exports also helped create jobs and earn much-needed foreign exchange.
The way Ethiopia created and nurtured a high-value horticulture industry and expanded its air services exports was
an encouraging example of “self-discovery.”
  A recent drop in export prices, however, has exposed underlying vulnerabilities in export structure
and highlighted the importance of strengthening competitiveness. Ethiopia is vulnerable to such price
swings because unprocessed and undifferentiated agricultural products dominate its exports. While benefitting from
upward price trends since 2003, the recent drop in prices of key commodities led to the worst export performance
in a decade. To overcome this challenge, renewed efforts must aim to improve competitiveness, including through
value addition and export diversification.
  More than “what” is being exported it is the “how” that is hindering potential. There is scope for
improving the quality of existing commodity exports, through basic value addition, such as coffee wet processing or
machine flaying of animal skins. Even in products with a revealed comparative advantage, little upgrading or branding
has occurred to earn higher value per unit over time. By starting to compete on the quality of existing commodity
exports (and not just on price), Ethiopia can reduce sensitivity to volatile international prices thereby supporting the
gradual shift of production and exports into agro-processing and light manufacturing.
  Ethiopia’s export sector is currently too small to contribute to structural transformation. In East Asia,
booming exports helped shift economic activity and workers away from low-productivity agriculture into higher-
productivity manufacturing and sustain high rates of economic growth for decades. In Ethiopia, both exports and the
manufacturing sector remain relatively small. Ethiopia has the lowest ratio of merchandise exports to GDP among
populous countries in the world; it has half as many of exporting firms as Kenya (which has half the population of
Ethiopia), and average exporter size is small.
   The business environment favors incumbent firms and deters new entrants into export businesses,
and even so, no “export superstars” are emerging. The export sector lacks dynamism in terms of firm entry
and exit. Rather than, increasing in scale, new entrants to the export market are already often relatively well established
in other businesses such as trading. This may be due to the fact that smaller firms have limited access to credit, which
would have allowed them to increase the scale and scope of their activities. This is a challenge because rising and
dynamic firms often create more new jobs than established firms. Other factors such as low entrepreneurship and
low regulatory quality in terms of promoting the private sector may also explain this. Despite a favorable environment
for incumbents, they are yet to emerge as multi-product and multi-destination export superstars.
  Ethiopia lags behind its peers in Global Competitiveness rankings and trade restrictions are biased
against exports. Although the country ranks better than its peers on theme-specific business regulatory measures
such as enforcing contracts, its overall Doing Business performance is on the decline. Low regulatory quality also
adds to the cost of doing business for exporters. Furthermore, Ethiopia has more trade restrictions in place than its
peers. However, high levels of nominal and effective rates of protection provide strong evidence of the widespread
existence of an anti-export bias of the tariff regimes throughout the economy. At the same time Ethiopia is under-
tapping a narrow window of opportunity for diversification through full exploitation of available trade preferences.
x   3RD ETHIOPIA ECONOMIC UPDATE – STRENGTHENING EXPORT PERFORMANCE THROUGH IMPROVED COMPETITIVENESS




       A more competitive real exchange rate could support export promotion. Ethiopia’s real exchange rate
    is overvalued. Empirical evidence presented in the report suggests that a 10 percent lower real exchange rate could
    increase export growth in Ethiopia by more than 5 percentage points per year and increase economic growth by
    more than 2 percentage points. The projected positive impact for Ethiopia is based on the predominance of basic
    export commodities that tend to compete more on price rather than on quality. In the presence of macroeconomic
    trade-offs (e.g. currency depreciation would contribute to inflation), changes in exchange rate policy would need to
    be combined with other economic policy measures, such as a further tightening of monetary policy.

    Policy Recommendations

    The following policy recommendations emerge from the analysis:
    1.	 Increase value-addition, quality, and branding of exports.
    2.	 Ease binding constraints related to reliable power supply, credit, and foreign exchange.
    3.	 Redress bottlenecks in trade logistics.
    4.	 Establish Industrial Zones that conform to international best practice.
    5.	 Revise burdensome business rules that obstruct firm entry, especially high start-up capital requirement and pre-
        registration bank deposits.
    6.	 Improve regulatory quality, including the implementation of a pro-competition legal framework.
    7.	 Ensure that the real exchange rate is competitive.

       This report is structured as follows. Chapter 1 discusses recent economic developments in the ‘short view’ and
    has observations on structural change in the ‘long view’. Chapter 2 looks at export performance and competitiveness
    utilizing key elements of the World Bank’s Trade Competitiveness Diagnostic Framework. Chapter 3 summarizes key
    issues and provides policy recommendations.

     share of mining is very small.                                   share of the labor force employed in manufacturing
          Labor productivity levels are highest in sectors            peaked at 25 to 45 percent in countries like the UK,

     their ultimate impact on the economy greatly depends             towards modernization because it absorbs a large

     bines information on labor productivity and sectoral             tasks. Further, labor productivity in manufacturing

     and 2011). The figure illustrates the productivity lev-          manufacturing industries that are less productive tend

RER calculations and theoretical
considerations                                           In the first step, we measure an RER misalignment

Examples of the theoretical relationship                 effect. The Balassa-Samuelson effect captures the effect
between the real exchange rate and exports               of an economy’s productivity on its non-tradable
                                                         goods’ prices. In details, this can be explained as fol-
Two examples show the theoretical impact of RER          lows: We usually observe that the prices of services
adjustments on exports:                                  (like a haircut) are higher in developed countries than
                                                         in developing countries, because wages are higher in

   would become relatively cheaper compared to the       ity. In other words, low productivity explains a large

   the domestic consumption basket becomes lower,             We capture the Balassa-Samuelson effect as
