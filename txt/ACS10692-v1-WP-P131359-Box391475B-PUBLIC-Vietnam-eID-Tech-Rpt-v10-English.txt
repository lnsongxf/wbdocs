Executive Summary

Government ministries and private sector organizations in Vietnam today face the challenge of
having a unique identification number for identifying and authenticating residents at service
delivery. The Government of Vietnam (GoV) recognizes this challenge, and is proactively piloting
a new National Identity System (NID)

GoV has also has expressed interest in exploring the deployment of a full-fledged electronic
identity-based service delivery framework. Such an electronic system could be developed based
on the new NID system being piloted. In response to GoV’s request, the World Bank is conducting
a Technical Assistance (TA) activity to define the vision and strategy, and provide
recommendations pertaining to its implementation. The study pays close attention to innovative
Electronic Identity (eID) systems to enhance the accountability and efficiency of the service
delivery.

The vision and implementation strategy suggested for the Electronic Identity-based Service
Delivery Framework (EISDF) in Vietnam was developed based on the experiences of countries like
India, Estonia and Belgium.       The current state of Vietnam’s information technology (IT)
infrastructure and her institutional framework were also taken into consideration.

The lessons learned from international experiences cover key concepts such as the: (i) extension
of the national identity system capabilities to include elD; (ii) eID profile of the resident which
comprises of a unique National Identification Number (NIN), linked to demographic and biometric
data that is accessible online; (iii) eID profile and NIN creation as a centralized biometric and
deduplication process at the national level to ensure uniqueness; and (iv) eID profile could clearly
establish the resident’s identity to public and private agencies across the country, although it
may not necessarily be used to prove citizenship.

The eID authentication service is one of the key offerings of a central identity authority on a
national infrastructure. The purpose of eID authentication is to enable eID-holders to prove their
identity digitally and online, and for service providers to be able to confirm the residents’ identity
claim in order to correctly deliver services and benefits. Other key services offered include eID
seeding where the NIN is embedded in the service provider databases; electronic Know-Your-
Customer (eKYC) process; electronic payment (ePayment); secure electronic document
(eDocument); and mobile ID.

The technical learning involves setting up a highly secure Central Resident eID Data Store (CRIDS)
to collect the demographic and biometric data gathered from the enrollment process following a


                                                                                       Page 1 of 218
procedure of deduplication. The subsequent NIN is generated at random to prevent fraud and
theft. The biometric data ensure uniqueness and are required to be used in conjunction with the
demographic data.

The eID processes, such as eID authentication, eKYC, mobile ID, etc., may be exposed as a
stateless web services emanating from the centralized eID infrastructure and extracting
information from the CRIDS. The eID authentication may be single- or multiple-factor, and factors
may be demographic, biometric, one-time password (OTP), digital certificate, or their
combination. The interoperability of biometric authentication is supported by defining biometric
device specifications, data standards and common software development kit (SDK), and
application programming interface (API) across multiple device vendors. The IT infrastructure for
running eID processes could be supported by fulltime domestic in-house technical capacity and
in-country proven technology from local vendors. The design of the proposed eID system could
ease the integration of existing/planned services of the GoV with those of the private sector.

The use of mobile ID would simplify eID authentication and eSignatures, by replacing the smart
card and reader with the mobile phone and specialized SIM (could be a physical card, software,
or other relevant subscriber identification mechanisms) issued to residents. The mobile ID could
use biometrics or digital certificate with the implementation of a wireless public key infrastructure
(wPKI) and the mobile gateway of a nationalized mobile network operator (MNO). The biometrics
or digital certificate type authentication and eSignatures could use communication model-based
services on the common standardized workflows, document format and open standards
technologies. The GoV could set up a one-stop eGovernment portal for eServices offered by the
various government agencies, and act as the gateway to all public offices.

The institutional learning also suggests an organizational structure with two separate
government bodies: the overall regulator and overseer of eID services. The individual identity
remains unique and independent of the service provided. There could be a cross-ministerial apex
committee at the highest level of government as the decision makers for eID and related issues.
A scalable public-private partnership (PPP) organizational structure would be needed to deliver
highly secure and high-quality eID. A strong level of security is achieved by restricting direct
access to the online eID process to a few authorized organizations defined as an eID service
provider agency (ISPA); and only an eID consumer service provider (ISCA) registered under the
former may request identity information for delivery.

The mobile ID, biometrics or digital certificate, and eSignature may require a PPP organizational
structure to issue mobile ID SIM and activate them. These responsibilities could be assigned to
one − or more − nationalized MNO, and they could include the generation of biometrics or digital


                                                                                      Page 2 of 218
certificates and timestamps to the certificate service provider (CSP) and timestamp service
provider (TSP), respectively. The eSignature Act (EESA) could define the roles and responsibilities
pertaining to the issuance of eSignatures. The GoV creates the standard committees − with
members from both public and private sectors − and defines the standards such as demographic
and biometric data, technology and business processes.

The operating model learning necessitates the fresh enrollment of residents for eID. This is
recommended − in lieu of reusing previous data entered by different government departmental
applications − to ensure high-quality data. The eID is based on a secure and scalable PPP-based
operating model wherein only the ISPA (public or private) has direct access. The ISCA, in turn,
calls its designated ISPA for assistance with retrieving the eID information to fulfill its service
delivery function. The central government agency responsible for eID could host a public-facing
portal to build technical awareness and to provide technical support to the user-agencies. There
could be a certification process for biometric devices to ensure their compliance with GoV
specifications.

The operating model for mobile ID is also PPP-based, with the mobile ID provided by one or more
operators through local outlets. The resident could activate the service on the handset with the
new specialized SIM. The service provider could request the eID from the resident through short
message service (SMS) using a TSP, referring to the global system for mobile communications
(GSM) subscriber number, and/or require the entry of a personal identification number (PIN) for
authentication. The GoV could set up round-the-clock call centers and online services, such as
DocStop and CheckDoc, to prevent frauds.

The policy intervention learning suggests the creation or update of the Identity Documents Act
(IDA) to establish national guidelines for the creation of the NIN, the National Identity System
(NID) card, and the eID. It could grant the eID equal value to the paper-based identity document.
The ESA could make digital and paper-based handwritten signatures legally equivalent. The
Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) could also be updated to regulate the use of personal data
and databases by public authorities and private agencies. The service providers in both the public
and private sectors may also update their KYC norms to include eID and eKYC functions.

Currently, the most common Proof of Identity (PoI) used by service providers in both the public
and private sectors is the People’s Identity Card issued to residents by the Ministry of Public
Security (MPS). Reliance on this card proves to be a challenge as it is paper-based and issued at
the provincial level, with no mechanism to ensure its uniqueness at the national level. As a result,
service providers may ultimately find this practice costly due to inconsistent and duplicate
identities. The paper-based identity card also results in a greater risk of identity theft.


                                                                                      Page 3 of 218
There is a need for the development of a more robust and effective national identity system. This
could entail a national-level unique identity creation process based on an EISDF. Such a system
is currently under implementation by GoV.

There is also a demand for a national eID for Vietnam residents for Internet-use purposes. This
will encourage the use of eGovernment, foster innovation in public and private eServices, and
strengthen cybersecurity. The eID will enable residents to request and receive services and
benefits from public and private sector agencies anywhere, anytime, and using any device without
the need to be physically present for identity authentication purposes.

The proposed vision for the EISDF would include services such as authentication, seeding, eKYC,
eSignature, ePayment, and mobile ID. The eID could support different types of standardized
tokens based on: (i) “what the user has” such as mobile/OTP/biometrics/digital certificate; (ii)
“what the user knows” such as a PIN; and (iii) “who the user is” such as fingerprints and iris
images.

The implementation strategy for the EISDF would entail the setting up of a shared, centralized IT
infrastructure and common services platform called the eID Service Delivery Platform (EISDP). The
EISDP will be used for delivering eID services and common applications to service providers in
order to uniquely identify residents. The key components of this centrally hosted platform are a
common public portal as the online one-stop shop for all eID services, and common applications
such as CRIDS, Management Information System (MIS), Decision Support System (DSS), Fraud
Analytics, and ISCA/ISPA registration.

The IT infrastructure consisting of hardware and software could be deployed in data centers to
run the applications and eID services. The physical infrastructure would include the Electronic
Identity Authority of Vietnam (EIDAV) data center, the EIDAV disaster recovery data center
(geographically separate from the EIDAV data center) and the NID system's data center. The
safety and security systems include an end-to-end IT network, hardware and software security
systems, and physical infrastructure with multiple-level safeguards designed to limit entry to
authorized personnel using biometric data.

Each ISPA could set up a data center with the required IT infrastructure, software applications and
secure network connectivity to the EIDAV data center to access eID services. Each ISCA could also
set up a data center for hosting its online service delivery applications and Point of Sales (PoS)
terminals where the resident could go to avail of services. The ISCA sets up the required IT
network to connect its outlets to its data center, and then to the ISPA data center to forward its
eID service request to the EISDP, before receiving the response the same way back.


                                                                                    Page 4 of 218
The institutional framework includes operating model recommendations such as the creation of
a separate agency, EIDAV, operating under a responsible ministry for eID, and as the owner and
overseer of the EISDF and eID services. The responsible ministry would could delegate the
responsibility of designing, implementing and managing the operations to EIDAV,, that will serve
as the managed identification service provider (MISP). The public or private sector agencies
wishing to use eID services in their delivery process could register as an ISCA. The ISCA could be
enabled by an ISPA to access the services via the latter’s network. Only an ISPA, public or private,
may register with EIDAV for direct access to eID information to ensure high-level security for the
centralized database. The service provider would be responsible for seeding the NIN into its own
database; it is also responsible for the digitization and centralization of its database. EIDAV could
provide eID tools and guidance to support the service provider in the seeding process. The four
main operating functions for mobile ID service could be SIM provisioning, certification/user
activation, usage, and termination.

The institutional recommendations touch on defining and allocating key roles to the elements of
the organizational structure. EIDAV, operating under a responsible ministry for eID, could have
the key role as the owner and overseer of the implementation and operational management of
the EISDF and eID services. An MISP could be responsible for implementing the EISDF on behalf
of EIDAV. An ISPA could be a public or private sector agency tasked with establishing a secure
connectivity with EIDAV data center to transmit eID authentication requests on behalf of an ISCA,
and then receive response back from eID authentication servers to ensure high-level security.
The ISCA could be a public or private service-providing agency seeking to use eID services, and
the eID-holder could be a resident who has been issued an eID by EIDAV. The key players in the
delivery of mobile ID service, apart from those described above, could be the registration
authority (RA), such as an MNO responsible for the provisioning of specialized SIM to the
residents; a trusted service provider (TSP) that is also a mobile operator, but responsible for
forwarding the mobile ID service request response from EIDAV to the mobile phone of the
resident; and a certification authority (CA) responsible for the issuance and validation of
certificates and signed data in response to the TSP service request.

The policy recommendations consist of updating or creating a new IDA to establish the national
guidelines for the issuance of the NIN, ensuring that the eID has the same legal value as the NID
card, updating the ESA to use the EISDF eID services for the delivery of eSignatures, and
establishing that the eSignature has the same legal value as that of the handwritten kind.

For the eKYC response to be treated as a valid legal equivalent of a paper-based document, the
relevant policies in the government may need to be updated. The service providers in both the
public and private sectors could update their KYC norms to include the NIN/eID, and accept the

                                                                                      Page 5 of 218
eKYC response as the valid KYC. The existing national open standards policy to promote
interoperability could be updated to include demographic and biometric attributes for the eID
profile of the resident in the metadata and data standards, and open standards for biometric data
such as fingerprint images, fingerprint minutiae and iris images. A PDPA may need to be enacted
to regulate the use of personal information by public authorities and private entities.

The proposed communication strategy for building awareness and promoting the adoption of the
framework among key stakeholders includes setting up a public-facing portal, online and
classroom trainings, capacity-building programs targeted at residents and officials/operators,
promotions and incentive programs, technical documentation targeted at software professionals
and technical decision makers who may be interested in availing of eID services.

The implementation of the EISDF may be done in two phases: the pilot and complete rollout. The
pilot phase will see the establishment of the EISDF; and the responsibility of establishing EIDAV
could be delegated to the responsible ministry. This will entail setting up the EIDAV data center
and migrating the residents’ data from the MPS’s current pilot project to the CRIDS. It could also
include the implementation of the following functions: eID authentication, eKYC, eID seeding,
and mobile ID. There could be two ISCAs and one ISPA. For mobile ID, EIDAV could delegate the
design and implementation to either Viettel or the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Group
(VNPT) that could take up the role of the RA and TSP.

The elevated budget estimate for the design and implementation of the pilot project and the
complete rollout is for guidance only. It provides for the possible magnitude of investment
required for the EISDF’s design and implementation. The total investment for the pilot phase
design, implementation and operations management for one year (without the implementation
of mobile IDs) is estimated at USD 54 million. That includes the setup and implementation of the
IT and institutional infrastructures for the centralized EIDAV, one ISPA and two ISCAs. Each ISCA
could have one service delivery outlet in the urban district of Hanoi. The ISPA selected for the
pilot may be Viettel or VNPT; and the ISCA may be the Vietnam Social Security (VSS) or the Bank
of Vietnam (BoV). The RA and TSP could be Viettel or VNPT. The demographic and biometric data
to be stored in EIDAV’s CRIDS could be imported from the database with resident data captured
for its current national identity system pilot. It is estimated that the pilot-captured data covers at
least for one million residents. The budget estimate for the pilot is based on the delivery of
100,000 mobile IDs. The total investment for the complete rollout in five years of operations is
estimated at USD 192 million. This estimate would include augmentation to the capacity of the
IT and institutional infrastructures set up during the pilot. Also to be added are one more ISPA
and about 20 more ISCAs with expected outlets of 124 (one per province and one per 10 districts)
each. Ten additional RAs would be set up with 100 outlets for each RA, and two additional TSPs.

                                                                                       Page 6 of 218
Also included in the cost are the capacity-building efforts, and setup of the framework standards
and government policies that would be required for the implementation of the EISDF and the eID.
The total budget for the design and the implementation of the two phases without the
implementation of optional mobile ID is estimated at USD 246 million.

The budget estimates for the implementation of the optional mobile IDs in the pilot phase is an
additional USD 4 million. This would include the delivery of 100,000 mobile IDs, one RA and one
TSP in the pilot phase. The budget estimates for the implementation of the optional mobile IDs
in the rollout phase is USD 61 million. This would include the delivery of 90 million mobile IDs,
two RAs, one TSP and 124 RA service delivery outlets each. The eID and eID services could not
be viewed as a standalone project. Rather the recommendations for eID and eID services will
require a strong national ID foundation, especially in the areas of legislation, policies and
standards, for a successful implementation.

This document could serve as the foundation for developing a detailed EISDF vision and
implementation plan. The effective implementation of the EISDF would require a detailed
breakdown of its high-level architecture into its technical components, taking into consideration
the detailed as-is status of the IT infrastructure. A detailed implementation plan would also
require policy and organizational structures, an operating model, infrastructure resources, and a
phased rollout of the components.

1.0 Introduction

1.1 Purpose

This study proposes the vision and implementation recommendations for the Electronic Identity-
based Service Delivery Framework (EISDF) in Vietnam. It also delineates the roles to be played by
the diverse stakeholders (private, public, development community, etc.) in the field. The study
recommends various relevant and innovative Electronic Identity (eID) services that can be
implemented to transform and enhance the accountability and efficiency of service delivery across
sectors. These recommendations are based on the stocktaking of international experiences and
identified possibilities based on the country assessment. Special emphasis is placed on eID
systems that operate on mobile phones, and on those that have the potential of being scaled up
by both the public and private sectors in Vietnam.


1.2 Background and Rationale

Evidence shows that national eID service delivery systems offer a variety of benefits to individuals,
businesses and governments. The expansion of national identity systems to eID using digital and
biometric technologies can widen the scope of formal identification systems that is a prerequisite
to development. Clearly, the inability to authenticate one’s self inhibits an individual’s access to
basic rights and services from the public and private sectors.

The eID is considered a key enabler of innovation in the public and private sectors as they
facilitate greater electronic authentication; it also facilitates improved value services that require
a high level of security assurance. The use of eID has economic benefits in terms of reducing
costs and increasing productivity in the public sector, as well as fostering usability of online
services. Increased trust or assurance with regard to identities online − even bi-directional trust
between parties transacting or communicating online – gives all participants an all-around edge.

The eID systems can help reduce identity fraud and enable individuals to avail of services more
securely in a variety of contexts as in mobile banking and mobile applications for health care.
Because identity theft is becoming a substantial challenge, governments from various parts of
the world are putting in place eID-based service delivery systems. Such systems facilitate the
delivery of benefits to those entitled, e.g., the poorest of the poor (those eligible to receive social
benefits, disaster relief aid, etc., as in Kenya or Pakistan) and older people (for instance,
pensioners in Nigeria). They also make possible the delivery of services like conditional cash
transfers (for educational purposes like in India and Tanzania).

                                                                                        Page 8 of 218
The private sector’s role in deploying eID-based service delivery infrastructure could be critical
because it can potentially ensure the financial viability and sustainability of the project. A number
of countries, such as Belgium, Estonia and India, have successfully deployed eID systems based
on Public-Private Partnership (PPP) models.

Most of the government ministries and private sector organizations in Vietnam today face the
challenge of not having a unique identity designation for every resident. This could be due to the
lack of a centrally generated national system of uniquely identifying a resident. The current
national identity card is issued at the commune level; therefore, the identification number issued
to the resident is not unique across the country.

Given this context, the Government of Vietnam (GoV) has expressed interest in exploring the
deployment a full-fledged Electronic Identity-based Service Delivery Framework (EISDF). GoV is
already piloting a new national identity system. In addition, the GoV is putting in place the
necessary prerequisites for its deployment: a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and the issuance of
compulsory national identity cards. The GoV is also planning to develop a National
eAuthentication Framework (NAF) that will create the much-needed enabling environment for
users to access government services and social benefits using eID. Going forward, the GoV is
keen to leverage these infrastructures to maximize public investment and strengthen
eGovernment and public service delivery to Vietnamese citizens, especially the poorest.

Given this background, the study aims to provide the vision and implementation strategy for eID-
based service delivery in Vietnam. The study also pays special attention to innovative identity
services to enhance the accountability and efficiency of service delivery. It will showcase such
systems, and offer options for sharing risks, investments and benefits through PPP.

2.0 Methodology

The methodology of this study is based on a three-step approach, consisting of the following
activities.

    1. Review international eID-based service delivery experiences. This is necessary in order
         to determine the key factors that affect the implementation and adoption of eID, and to
         identify best practices applicable to Vietnam based on common eID concepts, technical
         and institutional aspects, and policies.


    2. Define the vision for eID in Vietnam based on the lessons learned from international
         experiences.


    3. Propose recommendations on the eID vision and implementation strategy based on the
         analysis of the current availability of information technology (IT) infrastructure and
         institutional framework in Vietnam.
                 
The study’s mode of research is described below.

    1. Gather secondary data through desktop and field research in collaboration with the
         relevant stakeholders.


    2. Gather information about international best practices through desktop research,
         particularly information related to international eID-based service delivery.


    3. Conduct extensive in-country consultations with key stakeholders to gather their
         understanding and suggestions for implementation. This includes gathering information
         on the current national identity system, related information and communication
         technology initiatives, the enabling environment and infrastructure.


    4.   Collect inputs from key stakeholders, collaborate with relevant players in related activities,
         and promote the findings among relevant institutions such as the various ministries -
         notably the Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Information and Communications,
         Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, Ministry of Education and Training, Ministry
         of Justice, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Agriculture and
         Rural Development). Other players include the Authority of IT Applications (AITA), the
         State Bank of Vietnam, private banks, major telecommunications companies, and the
         Vietnam Government Certification Authority.

3.0 Lessons Learned from International Experiences

The Government of Vietnam (GoV) has various options to implement Electronic Identity (eID)
services. Some of the key findings in terms of the common concepts, as well as technical and
institutional aspects, that could impact implementation are described below based on
experiences of the countries studied; namely India, Estonia and Belgium. Annex 5 provides
detailed description of the respective experiences of these countries.

Common Concepts. Some of the common concepts in eID services learned from the experiences
of India, Estonia and Belgium are discussed below.

   1. National Identity System Extended to Include Electronic Identity. The NID system of a
       country could be extended to support eID that is verifiable online. The key benefit is the
       availability of mobile identity (ID) which enables service providers to authenticate
       individuals as the same and unique person, anywhere and anytime. It also supports
       removal of duplicate and fake identities thereby enabling higher scalability of services,
       allowing service agencies to use multiple channels for service delivery, reducing
       beneficiary harassment and rent-seeking due to reduced dependency on manual
       processes, supporting more efficient service delivery, providing an electronic audit trial,
       and reducing cost and risk of identity theft.
           a. The NID of a resident could be extended to include a unique eID profile which
               comprises a unique NIN linked to a resident’s demographic and biometric data
               that is accessible online.
           b. The creation of a national eID profile with the NIN would be a centralized process
               with biometric deduplication at the national level to enable a unique identification
               acceptable to all service providers in the public and private sectors as legal Proof
               of Identity (PoI). There would be an infrastructure for the creation of the NID
               system and the delivery of eID services.
           c. The NIN and eID would prove the identity of an individual, but not the citizenship
               of a resident (e.g., India case).
           d. The NIN would identify a resident and provide means to clearly establish the
               identity to public and private agencies across the country. The three key
               characteristics of the NIN would be permanency (it remains the same during the
               entire resident’s lifetime), uniqueness (no two residents may have the same NIN)
               and global usage (the same identifier can be used across applications and
               domains).



                                                                                   Page 11 of 218
2. Electronic Identity Authentication. The purpose of eID authentication is to enable eID-
   holders to prove their identity digitally and online; and for service providers to be able to
   confirm the resident’s identity claim to facilitate service delivery and access to benefits.
       a. The NIN and eID authentication process would be used by service providers to
          establish presence and proof of service delivery, and Know-Your-Customer (KYC)
          credential. It would also serve as a unifier of resident-centric information.
       b. The eID authentication enables beneficiary confirmation to ensure that services
          are being delivered to the right people. It would also supports attendance tracking
          in cases where wages are linked to actual number of days a beneficiary reports for
          the program.
       c. The eID authentication supports identity and address verification for establishing
          KYC credential which is a key requirement for enrolling or opening an account for
          a new customer. The use of the eID authentication would substantially reduce the
          cost of the KYC process. It would also be used as general proof of identity for
          standard security-related requirements in such places as airports, hotels, and
          other establishments; and as identity proof in school examinations. It would also
          be used for demographic data and address verification in service delivery
          databases which would help in database cleansing and management.


3. Seeding of the National Identity Number. In order for service providers to leverage eID
   assistance in delivering their product, they would have to first capture the unique NIN of
   their customers, beneficiaries, and subscribers (CBS). Once this is obtained, the service
   providers will then map and store it with their own unique identifier (e.g., customer or
   beneficiary number) in their respective databases. The process by which the NINs of the
   CBS are included in the database of a service provide is referred to as eID seeding. The
   seeding process would necessarily be preceded by digitization and centralization of
   information in the database of the service provider, and would support both the top-down
   and organic methods.
       a. The top-down method would use existing personal data of the resident from a
          previous enrollment process and would not require direct contact with the
          resident. However, the organic method would require the service provider to
          contact the resident, or vice-versa, for the seeding process to take place. The
          completion of the seeding process would be followed by demographic or biometric
          authentication, especially when no direct update of the service delivery database
          is enabled.




                                                                                Page 12 of 218
       b. The seeding process would be designed to handle common challenges of service
          delivery databases. This includes incomplete data or repeated information across
          different data sources or languages.
       c. The owner-government agency would provide a centralized seeding platform and
          seeding utilities that can be used by the service providers to perform the process
          accurately, faster and seamlessly. This would be critical for a faster adoption of
          eID-enabled service delivery.


4. Providing Support Groups and Artifacts.       The owner-government agency would build
   support groups and a set of artifacts to help the service providers to adopt and implement
   the eID service delivery process. The support groups would include the application
   support team, empanelled consultants, and software vendors to help the service providers
   build the necessary processes and applications. The support documents for guidance on
   leveraging and integrating eID into the service provider solutions would include
   applications onboarding and readiness, the authentication framework, operating model
   and guidelines, criteria, checklists and activity templates for becoming an Identity Service
   Consumer Agency (ISCA) or an Identity Service Provider Agency (ISPA), and eID seeding to
   embed the NIN.


5. Terminal Devices. Terminal devices would be employed by ISCAs (both public and private)
   to provide services to residents. Examples include micro-ATM devices, PoS devices and
   terminals, ATMs and Access Security devices. These devices would host the applications
   of the ISCA and support the mechanism to capture biometrics of residents for eID
   authentication purposes. Any additional features of these terminal devices would depend
   on specific needs of services offered by the ISCAs. These devices would comply with
   specifications issued by the government to protect all the demographic and biometric
   information provided by the residents.


6. Electronic Know-Your-Customer Process. The eKYC process verifies the identity of a
   customer. The service providers would perform the process electronically with explicit
   authorization of the resident. This would allow instant and paperless service delivery to
   residents. The government could implement the eKYC process by using the same
   infrastructure and operating model set up for eID authentication.
       a. In the eKYC process, residents would authorize the government through eID
          authentication using either biometrics or One-Time Password (OTP) to provide to
          service providers their demographic data, along with their photograph, digitally


                                                                               Page 13 of 218
          signed and encrypted. This would help the service providers to perform a
          paperless and realtime KYC process.
      b. The eKYC process would enable service providers to make instant delivery to
          residents that, otherwise, may take a number of days for activation pending
          verification of related documents.
      c. The use of the eKYC process would avoid the cost of repeated KYC processing, the
          cost of paper handling and storage, and the risk of forged proof of identity and
          proof of address documents.


7. Electronic Payment Service. The government could implement the eID-based electronic
   payment mechanism (ePayment) to promote transparency, accountability, efficiency and
   correct targeting in the payment of government program benefits such as social security
   pension, health benefits, etc., to the intended benefits.
      a. The ePayment would also facilitate seamless transfers of all welfare scheme
          payments to a beneficiary’s eID-enabled Bank Account (eBA). The eBA can be
          viewed as a regular bank account which is identifiable through the beneficiary’s
          electronic ID.
      b. At the time of enrollment for eID, residents would provide their existing bank
          account details or request for the opening of a new bank account that would be
          attached to their NIN for all welfare scheme payments.
      c. The ePB would have a database housing a repository of residents’ NIN and their
          corresponding eBA.      This database would be used for        social security and
          entitlement payments from various government agencies.
      d. The solution to financial inclusion would contain the combination of the NIN as a
          payment address and the eKYC function for instant account creation using the
          eID-enabled payments infrastructure. The pilot phase should address key issues
          with regards to the account creation process and procedures, and \assess the
          implications of using the NIN as an account identifier for the national payment
          system.
      e. Using the NIN as the payment address, the money is sent to any resident,
          irrespective of whether they have a bank account or not. If the receiver has an eBA,
          the money would be transferred into it. If the receiver does not have an eBA, an
          instant account would be created, on the basis of the NIN, with a debit freeze.
          Money transferred would be credited to the instant account. The instant account
          would be activated during the first withdrawal on the basis of the eKYC function.




                                                                              Page 14 of 218
   8. Official Email Address of Residents. The government could provide an official email
       address to each resident. The email address would be used for official government
       communications, but it could also be used for private communications. The government-
       provided email address would act as a relay, and residents could specify an email account
       at the time of enrollment where messages may be delivered. All email addresses could be
       publicly listed on the government’s national registry of certification service providers.


   9. Secure Electronic Document Service. The government could provide secure eDocument
       service to enable safe transport of electronic files in an unsafe environment, i.e., the
       Internet. The service would offer the functionality to encrypt and decrypt eDocuments
       using the biometrics or digital certificate mapped to the eID profile of the resident. For
       further details, refer to the Estonia experience in Annex 5.


   10. Mobile ID Services. The government could provide mobile ID service to registered eID-
       holders which would be used for eAuthentication and digital signing with a mobile phone.
       In this scenario, the mobile phone with SIM (refers to cards, software or other subscriber
       identification mechanisms) functions simultaneously as the identity card and the card
       reader.
           a. When using mobile ID service, the resident would get a specialized SIM that
                 enables the service. This would be obtained by signing a service contract with a
                 designated national mobile operator.
           b. The mobile ID may be used anywhere in the world where there is mobile coverage.
                 There would be no need to install the software on the computer for it to work. The
                 software would be installed on the SIM of the mobile phone. It may be used on the
                 latest mobile phones. As smart phone technology becomes more widespread,
                 having the mobile ID option would become increasingly handy, allowing the user
                 to vote, for instance, via a phone’s web browser.

Technical Aspect. Some of the technical learnings in the implementation of eID-based service
delivery derived from the study of international experiences detailed in Annex 5 are listed below.

   1. Defining Unique and Secure National Electronic Identity.
           a. Uniqueness as Crucial Attribute. The national eID profile of the resident would
                 include the unique NIN linked to the demographic and biometric data stored in the
                 Central Resident eID Data Store (CRIDS).




                                                                                   Page 15 of 218
       b. Use of Intelligence is Unwise. Loading intelligence into identity numbers would
           make them susceptible to fraud and theft. Therefore, the NIN would be a unique
           random number assigned to the resident and may not contain any intelligence.
       c. Data Collection through Nationwide Enrollment. The first step in the issuance of a
           national eID would be the enrollment process where a resident’s demographic and
           biometric information may be collected. The uniqueness of the data provided
           would be established through a process called deduplication. After deduplication,
           the NIN would be issued and a letter would be sent to the resident with the
           information details.
       d. Biometric Deduplication for Uniqueness. Ensuring uniqueness means assigning
           one NIN to each person, and one person has only one unique identity number. A
           resident profile would undergo the rigorous demographic and biometric
           deduplication process with 99.99 percent accuracy before being assigned a unique
           identity number. Demographic data alone cannot guarantee uniqueness. However,
           unique identity may be possible by linking demographic attributes with biometric
           attributes like fingerprints and iris images from the individual.


2. Leveraging CRIDS in Electronic Identity Authentication.
       a. The eID authentication process would be exposed as stateless web service over
           hyper-text transmission protocol secure (HTTPS). The usage of open data format
           in extensible markup language (XML) and widely used protocol such as hyper-text
           transmission protocol (HTTP) would allow easy adoption and deployment of eID
           services.
       b. The eID authentication process would work by taking the NIN along with eID-
           holder’s personal identity data as the input and, in turn, sending that input to the
           CRIDS for matching, following which the CRIDS verifies the correctness on the
           basis of a 1:1 match with the eID-holder’s identity information. The service either
           confirms the proof of identity, or verifies the information provided by the resident.
           To protect the resident’s privacy, the service responds only with a “yes/no”; no
           personal identity information is given as part of the response.
       c. The eID authentication process would be made available to the residents to prove
           their identity online anywhere, anytime and in multiple modes. It would support
           single-factor and multi-factor authentication. The NIN  along with attributes
           which could be demographic, OTP, digital certificate, or single/multiple biometrics
           (fingerprints and/or iris images)  may be used to provide single-factor
           authentication. As an alternative, these attributes would be used in combination


                                                                                Page 16 of 218
                    (multi-factor) to achieve the required authentication needs. The NIN, on its own,
                    may not be used a factor for authentication.
               d. The eID authentication process would support multiple types of authentication
                    depending on the input type (demographic, OTP, digital certificate, biometric, or
                    multi-factor). All types of eID authentication requests would take the NIN as one
                    of the input in order to reduce the authentication to a 1:1 match in the CRIDS.
               e. The eID authentication process would support the federated authentication model
                    and would be designed with a view to strengthening the service providers’ existing
                    authentication systems, rather than replacing the existing one. While the federated
                    model would not mandate the existence − or use − of the service providers’ own
                    authentication (if a service provider so wishes, the eID authentication may be used
                    by itself), they would be encouraged to use the eID authentication in conjunction
                    with their own local authentication to render the overall system stronger and more
                    reliable. This could be called the federated model of eID authentication.
               f.   The eID authentication process would contain security and privacy features such
                    as “yes/no” response, digitally signed request/response, response code, response
                    timestamp and self-verifiability of response, encryption and tamper-proofing. For
                    further details on the security and privacy features of the eID authentication
                    process, refer to the India experience in Annex 5.
               g. The eID authentication process would support buffering of data at multiple end-
                    points to enable service delivery in case of intermittent non-availability of network
                    connectivity.


      3. Biometric Data Standards and Devices
               a. Biometric Device Specifications. The terminal device used in the biometric-based
                    authentication process would have the capability to capture the fingerprints and
                    iris images of residents. The government could define the biometric device
                    specifications1 based on open standards so that the related information captured
                    with the device would ensure high-quality data and result in greater accuracy.
               b. Biometric Data Standards. To meet the huge demand for biometric capture devices
                    needed in eID authentication, it may be necessary to source the devices from
                    multiple vendors specializing in biometric authentication. However, this would be

08%20UIDAI%20Biometric%20Device%20Specifications%20_Authentication_.pdf

                                                                                          Page 17 of 218
          possible only if there is interoperability among the devices produced and sold by
          various vendors for data capture and matching. The designated government body
          could define the biometric data standards based on the open standards for
          fingerprint images, fingerprint minutiae, iris images and facial photos to achieve
          interoperability. The ISO 19794 series of biometric standards for fingerprint, facial
          and iris recognition set by the International Standards Organization (ISO) are the
          most widely accepted, and best embody previous experiences of the US and
          Europe with biometrics.
       c. Biometric   Specifications.   The   biometric   Software   Development    Kit   (SDK)
          Application Programming Interface (API) specifications would provide a single
          unified interface across multiple modalities (face, fingerprint, and iris) for SDK
          developers of biometric device vendors to expose their functionality to various
          modules of the Electronic Identity Services Delivery Platform (EISDP). This would
          enable vendor neutrality as the use of standard APIs and open standards would
          eliminate proprietary and vendor-specific features. It would also promote
          interoperability by using standard interfaces, common data format definitions and
          protocols across the components that expose similar functionality. The open API
          would also allow best-of-breed algorithms to be used for special purposes. The
          API exposes quality check, segmentation, sequencing, extraction and matching
          functionalities. The specifications would be published on the government public
          portal.
       d. “Best Finger Detection” Technology. The EISDP would expose the “best finger
          detection” as a stateless web service. This would be called by the service providers’
          application to detect a resident’s finger providing the most accurate among
          successful matching results. The resident would then use the best finger to ensure
          a better success rate in biometric eID authentication. The chances of getting a
          match may vary due to differences in quality across all fingers. This variation may
          also be present due to the manner in which the resident normally interacts with a
          typical fingerprint scanner, and different fingers may inherently have varying
          amounts of identifying information depending on the size of the finger and the
          commonness of the pattern it carries. Hence, the detection of the best finger for
          biometric eID authentication would improve the accuracy of the results.


4. Reliable and Trustworthy Electronic Identity IT Infrastructure with in-House Technical
   Support and in-Country Proven Technology. The government could build a reliable and
   trustworthy eID infrastructure assisted by fulltime technical support. The technical


                                                                               Page 18 of 218
   solution would be based on already proven technology provided by local software or
   technology vendors. The solution would be scalable, flexible, and standards-based for
   expansion to other services, as well as forward-looking to enable cross-border use.


5. Domestic in-House Technical Capacity in Electronic Identity IT Infrastructure and Services.
   The government could develop in-country technical capacity that would be self-sufficient
   in designing and implementing the eID IT infrastructure and services. This is preferable
   to relying on foreign software or technology vendors to provide and guarantee support
   for a critical piece of national infrastructure. A reliance on non-local vendors would have
   a detrimental impact on the country’s day-to-day functioning going forward. Because of
   these considerations, a bespoke software model could be developed. In case the
   government decides to use the shrink-wrapped solution from external vendors, then it
   could build in-house capabilities to implement and manage the solution.


6. Designing Electronic Identity for Easier Integration into Services of Providers. The
   government could design the implementation of the eID services in such a way that it
   enables integration with the existing and planned primary service delivery systems of
   providers. This will allow functionalities such as eSignature, electronic authentication and
   document encryption. The government could implement the following measures to meet
   the integration requirements.
       a. Employment of Standardized Workflows in the Service Delivery Process. As an
           example, standard workflow for eSignature using a common document format
           would be employed. For further details, refer to the Estonia eSignature
           implementation described in Annex 5.
       b. Centrally Issued Unique National Identification Number. A centrally hosted
           database of the NIN issued to residents would be implemented. There would be a
           reliable and trustworthy eID infrastructure to enable the delivery of identity
           services. For further details on the centralized eID database and IT infrastructure,
           refer to the India experience described in Annex 5.
       c. Central Single Point of Access to Public Services. The eID authentication would be
           used as a secure token for the various services where access would be provided
           by a central single point of entry: the eCitizen portal.


7. Designing Mobile ID Services to Promote Adoption of Electronic Identity Services. In
   Estonia, the adoption of eID improved with the implementation of mobile ID services since
   the penetration of mobile phones in the country was more than 100 percent.              The


                                                                               Page 19 of 218
           improvement was brought about by the ease of use of the mobile phone as an
           authentication device, as compared to a smart card reader attached to the PC. For further
           details on the mobile ID implementation experience in Estonia, refer to Annex
           5. Some of the technical design lessons learned from Estonia’s implementation of mobile
           ID services are mentioned below.
               a. Mobile authentication and mobile signing methods would accept the NIN, and
                    personal identification number (PIN) and phone number as input parameters.
                    Using a mobile number as the only input parameter may result in security issues
                    since it is public information.         Therefore, including a PIN and the NIN would
                    improve security.
               b. The technical design of the mobile ID would be based on the implementation of
                    the Wireless Public Key Infrastructure (wPKI), e.g., a wPKI specification2 in which
                    the mobile phone operates as a smart card reader with display. The
                    communication between the personal computer (PC) and the mobile phone would
                    be through the mobile signing/authentication function and gateway of the Global
                    System for Mobile Communications (GSM) operator.
               c. The mobile gateway would use a standard technology such as Over-The-Air3 (OTA)
                    to communicate and run the applications on the SIM of the mobile phone without
                    being physically connected to the card.
               d. The signing/authentication function would send the signing/authentication
                    request (wPKI request4) to the back-end system of the MNO using the Internet
                    Protocol (IP) network which, in turn, sends the request to the mobile gateway. The
                    gateway would forward the request to the resident’s mobile phone by Short
                    Message Service (SMS).
               e. The mobile phone would support the necessary technical features in order to use
                    it for mobile ID functions. For instance, Estonia has published the technical
                    specifications for the mobile phone to enable mobile ID services. The

                                                                                                   Page 20 of 218
                   specifications include support for the GSM Phase 2+ standard5, the SIM application
                   toolkit6 with OTA updates, and compliance with GSM standards7.
      8. ESignature and Digital Certificate Authentication.
               a. The eSignature architecture would be based on the universal open standards for
                   giving, processing and verifying eSignatures. It may be able to connect to any new
                   or existing piece of software. The components of the system would include a
                   stand-alone client program, a web portal and a web service based on Simple
                   Object Access Protocol (SOAP) enabling easy integration of the functionality of
                   digital signing, signature verification and authentication with other information
                   systems.
               b. Like Estonia, the government could choose a communication model using
                   standardized workflows and common document format such as the XML Advanced
                   Electronic Signatures Standard (XAdES). The XAdES defines a format that
                   structurally enables storage of signed data, signature and security attributes
                   associated with the eSignature; therefore, it would accommodate a common
                   understanding among systems.
               c. The Gov could define digital certificates and smart card standards based on open
                   standards to promote interoperability. For further details on the international
                   experiences of leveraging open and widely used standards for digital certificates
                   and smart cards, refer to Annex 5.
               d. The government could provide software that may be installed on residents’
                   Internet-connected device (laptop, desktop, etc.) to enable them to use their ID
                   card electronically to access public and private eServices, digitally sign documents
                   and encrypt documents for safe transfer. The software would be collectively
                   referred to as ID-software. The government could provide residents the
                   instructions on its public website for installing ID-software on the device. For
                   further details on the ID-software, refer to the Estonia experience in Annex 5.
               e. Some of the commonly provided software as part of the framework could include:

                       digital certificate authentication and signing capabilities in their software.
                    ii. Service such as the online certificate status protocol (OCSP) server for
                       realtime and long-term validity of certificate. For further details, refer to
                       the Estonia experience in Annex 5.


   9. One-stop Common eGovernment Services Portal. The government could design a
       common eGovernment services portal for delivering all eServices from its various
       ministries   and    departments   with   Single   Sign-On    (SSO)   capabilities   using   eID
       authentication.

Institutional Aspect. Some of the institutional learnings, including the organizational structure
and operating models, taken from the study of international experiences as detailed in Annex 5
are listed below.

Organizational Structure

   1. Separate Government Organization as the Overall Regulator and Overseer of eID Services.
       For any service agency, establishing both the identity and the service entitlement of the
       beneficiary is necessary. Though the individual identity would be unique and independent
       of the type of service being sought, entitlement is quite specific to the service being
       availed and it has to be established by each service agency separately. Hence, as in the
       three countries studied (India, Estonia and Belgium), instead of assigning the roles and
       responsibilities of eID services to an existing ministry, a new government organization
       could be created as the overall regulator and overseer of the eID services. For further
       details, refer to Annex 5.


   2. Cross-ministerial Apex Committee as Decision Makers for eID Services and Related Issues.
       An apex committee at the highest level of government, headed by the president/prime
       minister, could be constituted. Members could be ministers from key ministries such as
       finance, law, information and communication, labor and employment, etc., who will have
       the function of managing all issues relating to the eID system, including its organization,
       plans, policies, programs, schemes, funding and methodology to be adopted for achieving
       its objectives. However the apex body should have sufficient technical capacity and
       operational control for it to be feasible. The apex committee should also participate with
       the software development user groups as well as the international development agencies
       to maintain openness of standards while installing best practices around privacy and
       protection of the residents’ data.

                                                                                     Page 22 of 218
3. Scalable PPP-based Organizational Structure to Deliver Highly Secure and Quality eID
   Services. The need for scalability requirements to meet the exponential growth in the
   demand for eID services could be met by designing a scalable organizational structure
   based on the PPP model. In this model, the government could define roles in the
   ecosystem that would be outsourced to the private sector. The organization for delivering
   the service would be small to begin with, but may be scaled out as the demand for the
   service increases.
      a. The need for high security in the management of Personal Identity Data (PID) in
          the CRIDS may be achieved by limiting access to the data center to only a few
          authorized organizations that play the role of ISPA.
      b. The mobile ID would be implemented using PPP between the government agency
          responsible for eID and the MNOs. The government agency could delegate the
          responsibility of supplying mobile ID SIMs to the MNOs. The user registration and
          mobile ID activation would be performed by the Registration Authority (RA) which
          would take the request for user registration and service activation from the
          resident. The role of the RA would be performed by the MNOs working alongside
          the public security department of the government. The request for the generation
          of a new certificate would be delegated to the Certification Authority (CA) of the
          Certificate Service Provider (CSP).
      c. Biometrics or digital certificate-based eID services such as eID authentication
          would be set on a PPP organizational structure in order to ensure that the services
          are scalable and meet the service-level agreement (SLA) as defined by the
          government. The government could delegate the role of certification center to the
          government agency defined in the ESignature Act (ESA), which would in turn hire
          the private service providers to implement and deliver the service on its behalf.
          The certification center would be responsible for managing the operations of
          services such as lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP), OCSP, and other
          certificate-related processes, end-user distribution channel through its parent
          retail outlets, development and maintenance of the ID-software and installation
          packages, instruction manuals and video instructions published on the
          government public portal, and call centers.
      d. In order to delivery smart card-based biometrics/digital certificate-enabled eID
          services, the government could outsource the functionality of card personalization
          to the empanelled and certified private sector vendors. The vendor would be
          responsible for both the physical and electronic personalization of the card. The


                                                                             Page 23 of 218
             vendor would receive the card application from the government agency to
             manufacture, print and engrave the personal data on the card, generating the keys
             on the chip and embedding the certificates on the card.
          e. The ESA would define the roles and responsibilities involved in the processing of
             eSignatures. Some of the roles could be assigned to CSPs that would certify
             residents identifiable by name and PIN. The CSPs would be legal entities fulfilling
             specific legal requirements, while timestamping service providers (TSPs) would
             provide the timestamp that is simply a data unit that proves that certain data
             existed at a certain moment.


   4. Biometric Data Standards Committee. The government could form a national-level
      committee to define the biometric data standards applicable to the biometric capture,
      extractor and matcher devices, algorithms and software. They would be based on the
      existing national and international standards that are widely used in the industry. The
      committee would have members from the government, academia and industry experts;
      the standards would be established in consultation with the other government
      departments and service providers in the private sectors.


   5. eID Services, IT Infrastructure and Services Owned and Managed by IT Ministry. The
      government could have a ministry/department responsible for IT-related policies and for
      delivering IT services to the government departments implementing eGovernance. This
      department would be responsible for providing technical support and nationwide-shared
      IT infrastructure and services that can be used by the government agency responsible for
      eID service delivery.


   6. Privacy Commission. A privacy commission could be created reporting directly to the
      highest authority (the Parliament or the President’s office) to ensure that all privacy rules
      pertaining to identity data and their usage are respected at all times.

Operating Model

   1. Fresh Enrollment of Residents for eID Services for High Quality eID Data. The quality of
      the personal data in the databases of service providers is lacking and fraught with
      problems of fraud and duplicate/ghost beneficiaries. To prevent this from seeping into
      the eID database, the personal data − both demographic and biometric − would be
      collected and verified using the enrollment process. This would ensure that the data
      collected is clean from the start of the program.


                                                                                   Page 24 of 218
2.   Introducer System in Inclusive eID Services. The EISDF system would be inclusive and be
     made available to all residents, including those who do not have any form of identification
     document. There could be an “introducer system” for residents who do not have any form
     of identification, and eID would be their first form of identification.   The introducer is a
     person who stands as the guarantor for the residents’ personal demographic data to be
     fed into the eID system. It is noted that such system could be fraught with issues, and will
     need to be tight monitoring by civil society and have a clear grievance feedback loop local
     stakeholders.


3. Secure and PPP-based Scalable eID Service Delivery Operating Model. The operating model
     for delivering eID services using the EISDP would be scalable and based on the PPP model.
        a. The operating model would ensure the security of the CRIDS by having only a
            limited number of registered ISPAs to have direct connectivity to the eID services
            via the web.
        b. Any agency that would like to avail of eID services offered by the EISDP would need
            to sign up as an ISCA and enter into an agreement with the owner-government
            agency. To do so, the ISCA would need to go through an ISPA.
        c. The ISPA could establish secure connectivity to the eID services on the EISDP to
            transmit requests on behalf of ISCAs, and then receive response back from
            services.
        d. The ISPAs could build and maintain their secure connectivity to the EISDP in
            compliance with the standards and specifications set by the owner-government
            agency.
        e. There could be a registration process for engaging the players (ISPA, ISCA, etc.)
            that will be delivering eID services to the government and private organizations.
            The process would be simple, but at the same time it would include the necessary
            checks and balances to ensure that the agencies selected are capable of delivering
            the services. There would be a clearly defined step-by-step process for applying
            as an ISPA or ISCA, and it could include the list of supporting documents required
            of each of them as published on the public portal.


4. Technical Awareness and Adoption. There could be a public-facing portal for building
     technical awareness and for providing technical support to the user-agencies in both
     public and private sectors. It would publish technical documentations such as standards




                                                                                  Page 25 of 218
   and API specifications on the portal used by software professionals who are interested in
   incorporating eID services into their applications.


5. Biometric Device or UID Certification for eID-enabled Applications. There could be a
   certification process for biometric devices to ensure their compliance with specifications
   defined by the owner-government agency. The responsibility of implementing the
   certification process would be delegated to the department in the Ministry of Information
   Communications (MIC) that is responsible for delivering quality assurance services in the
   area of electronics and IT in the country’s network of laboratories and centers. It could
   maintain a list of certified vendors’ biometric devices. The vendors who may wish to have
   their biometric device certified will have to follow the certification process defined by the
   department.    The process would be published on the public portal by the owner-
   government agency.         Alternatively the devices could use India’s UID certification
   standards, as it could reduce cost, and improve overall security and efficiency.


6. PPP-based Scalable and Secure Mobile-ID Service Operating Model.
       a. Secure Login. As in Estonia, a typical scenario for mobile ID-enabled eID
          authentication used for logging into a secure site, e.g., a bank account of the
          resident, could be:
               i. The resident clicks the “Log in with mobile ID” option on a supported
                  website.
              ii. The resident is prompted to enter his/her mobile number and PIN.
              iii. The website displays a unique verification code.
              iv. The phone beeps and displays a screen indicating that a connection is
                  being made.
              v. The phone screen displays the eID authentication service name and
                  verification code.
              vi. If the service name is correct and the verification code corresponds to the
                  displayed number on the page in the computer, then it is safe to press
                  “Accept”.
             vii. The user is prompted to enter a mobile ID PIN on the phone.
            viii. The screen on the phone disappears and the website is automatically
                  reloaded with a logged in screen.
       b. Mobile ID Provisioning. The national mobile operators in the country could issue
          the mobile ID through their local stores. The resident could go to the nearest
          mobile operator to get a mobile ID SIM. The service provider would forward the


                                                                                Page 26 of 218
     application to the MNO and inform the resident where to pick the new SIM. The
     resident would be required to have his/her identity card with valid certificates for
     getting the mobile ID and would have to sign a contract (mobile ID subscription
     agreement) to complete the transaction. The government could delegate the
     responsibility of issuing the mobile ID to the national mobile operators. The MNO
     identifies the user using the identity card and on successful authentication, hands
     over the new SIM to the resident. As part of the provisioning, the SIM would be
     attached to a unique secure signature creation device (SSCD) for the resident, and
     the SSCD can later be used for issuing a qualified certificate. The SSCD certificate
     would be declared active for a particular SIM and made available to all the TSPs.
     The MNO would provide a unique code to the resident for activation of the
     qualified certificate.
c.   User Registration/Certificate Activation. The resident would activate the service
     on the handset with the new specialized SIM. To activate the mobile ID service or
     to apply for certificates, the resident would have to go to the website of the public
     security department, the RA. The resident would have to fill an online application
     form and enter the ID card into the card reader and follow the instructions. The
     purpose of the certificate activation process would be to create and activate a
     qualified certificate. The resident would issue a request to activate the qualified
     certificate using the mobile phone with the new SIM. The RA would initiate signing
     by responding to the resident’s mobile device to sign the personal data. The
     resident would verify the data, and then sign it by inputting the device certificate
     activation code. The RA would now receive the personal data signed. The RA would
     attach additional data, including the device certificate, before forwarding the
     request for certification activation to a CA. The CA would create and activate a
     qualified certificate and publish it.
d. Usage. A service provider would request service, such as eID authentication, from
     a TSP and would use a GSM subscriber number and/or personal identification code
     to identify the resident. The TSP would generate the signature request and send it
     to the resident’s mobile phone. The resident would sign the request by entering
     assigned PIN. The TSP would now receive the signature data. The TSP would check
     the validity of the signature data, as well as the validity of the certificate. The
     service provider would then receive the eID-related services from the TSP.
e. Termination. It may be possible for the resident to stop using the mobile ID for
     several reasons, among them: the resident may not be using the service,
     lost/compromised the SSCD, the qualified certificate expired, or the resident may


                                                                          Page 27 of 218
                have violated the user-CA agreement. In case of certificate revocation, the RA
                would inform the CA about it and the CA would immediately revoke the certificate.
                At this point, the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) may be updated. In case of SIM
                blocking due to loss or SIM damage, the device certificate would be taken out of
                the list of valid SSCD available to all TSPs.
           f.   Mobile ID Fees. The mobile operator may charge the resident fees for the mobile
                ID service. The charge would include a one-time subscription fee, as well monthly
                fees. If the mobile ID would used outside the country, each mobile ID transaction
                would be charged at the cost of sending one text message based on the package
                price list.


   7. Readily Available ID-software and Devices to Drive Adoption. In order to drive the
       adoption of eSignatures within the region, the compatible software and technology would
       be made available quickly to the parties looking to incorporate eSignatures into their
       applications.


   8. Round-the-clock Call Center and Online Services to Prevent eID Fraud. To prevent eID
       fraud, the government could set up a call center operating 24/7 year-round and provide
       DocStop and CheckDoc services. DocStop would help avoid the risk of fraudulent use of
       eID documents, as well the financial consequences. DocStop would enable the resident
       to block the identity card and eID profile immediately in case related information is lost,
       stolen or compromised. The resident would have to call the toll-free DocStop number to
       report the incident. The service is available 24/7 year-round. The CheckDoc would enable
       the resident to verify in realtime the validity of the eID documents; it would also identify
       the stolen, lost, expired, invalid or never-used eID documents. To use the service, the
       resident or the user-organization would have to register by filling in a registration form.
       The website may be accessed by using the username and password provided on successful
       registration.

Policies

   1. Know Your Customer. Service providers in both the public and private sectors such as
       those in banking, insurance, capital markets, telecom, LPG, railways, etc., may update
       their KYC norms to include eID as the valid KYC.




                                                                                   Page 28 of 218
2. Biometric Data Standard Policy. The government could define a policy at the country level
   to standardize the use of biometric data for purposes of identification and authentication
   of residents.


3. ESignature Act. The government could pass a EESA to ensure that the eSignature of the
   resident issued by the designated government agency is valid certificate and has legal
   binding, making it equal to paper-based handwritten signature. The handwritten and
   eSignatures would be made equivalent in both the public and private sector by this Act.
   The EESA would also state that public service departments must accept digitally signed
   documents. The EESA would ensure that each eSignature uniquely identifies the signatory,
   binds the individual to the signed data, and guarantees that the signed data cannot be
   tampered with retrospectively without invalidating the signature itself.


4. Rules and Regulations for Certificate Service Providers. One of the core components of
   the ESA could be the establishment of rules and regulations with regard to CSPs that would
   issue digital certificates to users and manage related security services. The ESA would
   mandate stringent financial and procedural requirements to ensure that CSPs are set up
   and managed properly to perform their function to the highest possible standard.


5. Rules and Regulations for Timestamp Service Providers. The ESA would also regulate
   timestamping by the TSPs. These service providers would adhere to similar laws and
   regulations as those applied to CSPs. The timestamp is simply a piece of data that attests
   to the occurrence of an event at a specific time. The ESA would ensure that the
   timestamped data are not tampered with or amended without invalidating the timestamp
   itself.


6. Personal Data Protection Act. The PDPA regulates the use of personal data and databases
   by public authorities and private entities. The Act would mandate a data protection
   inspection department within the government to oversee that the requirements of the Act
   are being met; it would also enforce compliance, if necessary. The strategy for the
   protection of the identity card would be to keep to a minimum the private data on the
   card. Instead, the data would be kept in highly secure databases at authorized centers. A
   person would use the card as the key (authorization method) to accessing his/her
   personal information in the database. Requests by third parties (e.g., representatives of
   authorities) for private data would be logged, and logs would be made available online to
   the individual upon request (via the citizen’s portal).


                                                                              Page 29 of 218
7. Identity Documents Act. The government could pass, or update if existing, an Identity
   Documents Act (IDA) affecting related documents to establish national guidelines for the
   creation of the NIN, and the issuance of an identity card and an eID for the residents of
   the country.
       a. The IDA would grant equal value to the eID as compared to the current paper-
          based identity documents for all legal purposes.
       b. The IDA would decide the purpose of the card and the NIN in terms of proof of
          citizenship. In India, the unique ID number (UID) is used as the proof of identity
          only, and does not confer citizenship. For further details, refer to the India
          experience in Annex 5.
       c. The IDA would state that the deduplicated and processed residents demographic
          and biometric data used for the personalization of the card would also be entered
          into the national population register pursuant to the Population Register Act.

4.0 Current Identity Usage and Service Delivery Issues Faced
in Vietnam

An understanding of the current identity systems and identity-related service delivery issues
faced by the residents and service providers in the public and private sectors in Vietnam are
described below. This understanding was developed based on discussions with various
stakeholders in Vietnam and secondary online desktop research.


4.1 Understanding of Current Identity Systems in Vietnam

People’s Identity Card: Common Proof of Identity Document in Vietnam




                               Figure 4.1: People’s Identity Card

The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) issues the People’s Identity Card (ID card) and an identity
number to all the residents of Vietnam. Service providers use it as the Proof of Identity (PoI)
document to establish the identity of a resident. The ID card is a paper-based card issued to all
residents above the age of 14 by the MPS department at the provincial level. The card bears the


                                                                                 Page 31 of 218
resident’s name, address, age, height, weight, date of issue, and one fingerprint; it is valid for
ten years. Roughly 98 percent of the Vietnam population owns this card.

Current Identity Creation and Authentication Process during Service Delivery in Vietnam




             Figure 4.2: Current Identity Authentication Process for Service Delivery

In Vietnam, as in other countries, both public and private service agencies across the country
typically require PoI before providing services to individual residents. For any agency, establishing
both identity and entitlement of the beneficiary is necessary before offering any service to a
resident, be it opening a bank account, withdrawing or depositing money, getting a tax code,
receiving pension, or for travel. Individual identity may be unique and independent of services
availed, but entitlement is very specific to the service desired; therefore, they have to be
established separately. For instance, the issuance of a health insurance card involves individual
identity (name, address) verification and health insurance entitlement identification.

Identity establishment typically involves two steps: identity creation and identity authentication.
Identity creation is the mechanism of defining an individual’s identity by providing identity
token(s) to the person in some form (physical and/or electronic). This is typically a one-time
activity. Identity authentication is a process of verifying “who an individual claims to be” by



                                                                                     Page 32 of 218
checking the identity tokens assigned to the individual. This can be manual, electronic or a
combination of both.

The service providers in both the public and private sectors typically follow their own process of
identity creation, in addition to the service entitlement identification. To illustrate, the Vietnam
Social Security (VSS) maintains a separate database of beneficiaries and their service entitlement
identification for each of the welfare programs such as social and health insurance. A separate
identity token for each of the programs are provided to the resident for identity authentication
and entitlement verification.

Each service provider in Vietnam uses the ID card and other valid PoI documents such as a
passport for identity establishment to generate a new service provider-specific identity card. The
same identity card is used to establish service entitlement. The resident presents the service
provider-specific identity card for authentication and entitlement at the time of the service
delivery.

VSS. The VSS is in the process of centralizing its beneficiary databases from different programs,
namely the social and health insurance which are available at present at the local level. Currently,
the identification of the unique citizen across the program databases is a challenge as the IT
systems and the databases are distributed with no common data standards for storing the
citizens’ basic information. Moreover, each database stores a separate identity system for the
identification of the beneficiaries. The identification number on social and health insurance books
are not consistent. There is a need for a unique identification number to be assigned to the
citizens that they can use throughout their life. The VSS is waiting for the GoV to issue the national
identity number (NIN) to citizens so that it may be better able to manage the social and health
insurance programs.

Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs. The Bureau of Employment under the Ministry of
Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA) currently has to maintain two separate and disjointed
databases for the supply and demand sides of the labor market due to different data fields used
in the identification of the beneficiaries in the databases. The data for the demand side of the
database is collected primarily from government agencies, government-owned enterprises and
private businesses. The data fields used for the identification of the citizens in this database is
based on the ID card or passport. The supply side of the databases uses the household book for
the identification of the beneficiaries. The beneficiary is given a unique code using the
geographical location codes from the government of the permanent address of the beneficiary,
namely region code, province code, district code, commune code, household number and family
member number. The ministry is currently executing a pilot in two districts for capturing the


                                                                                     Page 33 of 218
supply side of the database using the ID card as the primary identification document so that it
can be connected to the demand side of the databases. The ministry also has to update the
databases annually to maintain the accuracy of the information – a time-consuming and
resource-intensive process. The ministry would be able to avoid the necessary annual update and
consolidate the databases automatically with the availability of a unique identification system for
citizens. This system could also be used by the private sector and other government agencies
for identification of their employees and the citizens in general. The ministry captures the data
of beneficiaries from age ten and up in the labor market database. The ministry wishes to
recommend that the government lower the minimum age for requiring the national identity
number to ten years old. Currently, the proposal is to commence the identity card issuance at
14 years of age.

Ministry of Education and Training. The Ministry of Education and Training (MoET) is designing a
centralized Education Management Information System (EMIS) for all schools in Vietnam to
streamline the management of its operations. The ministry provides free Internet connection to
all schools in the country and is in the process of developing the electronic databases of students
and teachers across the country. The electronic database of the 20 million students in the country
could be ready in three years. The MoET expressed the need for a unique identification of citizens
which would help to accurately identify students and teachers across the schools. Currently, the
ministry experiences difficulty in identifying students who moved from one school to another
over the years. There are similar challenges with the identification of teachers and their training
requirements.

Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health (MoH) is working on a number of government programs
which provides citizens benefits such as health insurance, free HIV medicines, etc., based on their
identification. They have been unsuccessful for the last ten years in trying to build a unique
patient identity system in which each patient would have one identification number for use in
different hospitals and in the delivery of other health care services. This unique patient identity
could be used by the patient throughout his/her life for identification purposes and for
maintaining an Electronic Health Record (EHR). The ministry is keen to leverage the national
identification system and the unique identity number in its system for the verification of patients.
The MoH expressed their concern over the lack of awareness of the benefits of the National
Identity (NID) and Electronic Identity (eID) systems among the citizens. Hence, there is a need for
awareness programs on the benefits of the NID to citizens, and on the use the computer and
other devices in the effective delivery of health care.

State Bank of Vietnam. Officials of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) expressed their concern over
the problem of not being able to verify the identity of a person uniquely in the issuance

                                                                                    Page 34 of 218
eSignatures. On the other hand, they have already issued eSignatures to 7,000 employees of SBV
and other commercial banks. Primarily, the eSignatures are used for Internet bank payments, and
signing financial results and government reports. Different PoI documents are used for the
verification of the identity of a citizen, namely ID card, passport, driver’s license, etc. Having a
single NID with a unique number could solve the current issues of identity theft and duplication.

Vietnam    Post   and   Telecommunications      Group    and   Viettel   Group.   The   two   largest
telecommunication providers in Vietnam, the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Group
(VNPT) and the Viettel Group, each have a customer base of about 50 million customers. Both
groups have expressed the need for a unique identification system for the verification of the
identity of the citizens at the time of registration of new customers. Currently, they provide
various online value-added services on the computer and mobile phones such as eBanking,
mBanking, utility bill payments, etc. They are also planning to have a new SIM with eSignatures
for the electronic filing of tax returns, ePayment and mobile banking. They agreed that the
mobile-based ID is feasible from the technical capability perspective; however, there is a need
for legal measures for the enforcement of the issuance and the usage of the new eID.

Vietcom Bank. Like the other institutions that have been mentioned in this chapter, the Vietcom
Bank also faces the challenges of verifying the identity of citizens at the time of registration of a
new customer in their system. This is due to having to use more than one PoI for verification. It
has had cases where the individual has opened two different bank accounts with two different
identities using two different PoI. For this reason, it has also been unable to get an accurate credit
history of citizens from the Credit Information Center (CIC). The bank’s officials have expressed
the need for the NID which would enable them to uniquely identify the citizens at the time of
registration. They could also expect the government to provide the necessary guidelines and
technical support in the integration of their systems into the new eID system, and to ensure that
both the old ID card and new eID are valid during the transition period.


4.2 Key Identity Issues Faced during Service Delivery in Vietnam

The current approach to identity creation and identity authentication mechanism has resulted in
the following issues.

Lack of a Unique Resident Identification

The ID card currently in use is issued to the resident at the local province level with a locally
generated identification number scheme, and there are issues with resident identification number
synchronization between the national and provincial levels. Hence, the same identity number


                                                                                     Page 35 of 218
could be issued to more than one resident across provinces and it could be difficult to uniquely
identify a resident by using the ID card alone. It is noted that the GoV recognizes the following
issues and is proactively conducting pilots and seeking legislative changes to address them.

High Cost, Inconsistent and Duplicate Service Provider-specific Identity Creation and
Authentication Process

The service providers in both the public and private sectors typically follow their own process in
the customer/beneficiary identity creation. This is in addition to service entitlement identification
at the time of service delivery as per their needs, with limited or no interoperability as most of
the identity tokens are accepted for specific purposes and at specific locations only. The current
identity system can work only in assisted mode since most of the identification tokens provided
by the service agencies are physical tokens based on “what you have”. This results in a higher
setup cost for the authentication mechanism of each service provider. Moreover, this process
gives limited scalability and cause extreme inconvenience to the residents.

The service providers’ identity creation process is different from one another in terms of the
personal information captured, to the extent that verification and validation of that information
results in the creation of multiple identities for the same resident. For instance, the VSS maintains
a separate database of beneficiaries and their service entitlement identification for each of their
welfare programs (social insurance, health insurance, etc.). A separate identity token, such as a
card, is issued for each of the programs. This results in leakages of welfare benefits due to the
creation of a large number of duplicate and fake identities within the same benefit program.
Service agencies are unable to correlate the different benefits given to a resident through various
programs, as they are unable to even verify the correct entitlement. This challenge potentially
lowers the impact of welfare programs.

Paper-based Identity Card Leads to Higher Risk of Identity Thefts

With a paper-based ID card that is issued at creation process, there is a higher risk of identity
theft and misuse of photocopies when submitted as PoI. It is easy to forge physical documents
and difficult to identify fakes and copies. Also, such documents cannot be used to verify that the
person carrying the token is indeed the person it identifies, except when it also contains a photo.

Furthermore, the current ID card is subject to misuse since there is no authentic audit trail and
instead relies on an exhaustive manual audit mechanism.




                                                                                     Page 36 of 218
5.0 Vision for Electronic Identity Service Delivery Framework
(EISDF)




                Figure 5.1: Electronic Identity Service Delivery Framework (EISDF)

In order to eliminate the issues currently facing service providers with regard to unique
Customer/Beneficiary/Subscriber (CBS) identification and identity authentication, there may be a
need for the development of a more robust and effective national identity system (NID) that
includes the creation on the national level of a unique Electronic Identity (eID) and an eID services
referred to as EISDF (Figure 5.1). The NID is being implemented by GoV. Such a system put in
place will help achieve the vision of eGovernment and foster innovation in public and private
eServices as well as strengthen cybersecurity. The eID would enable the resident to request and
receive services from public and private sector providers anywhere, anytime, and by using any
device. The focus of this chapter is to develop the vision for the EISDF.



                                                                                     Page 37 of 218
5.1 High-level Description of EISDF

Services Offered. Some of the key services that may be delivered with the implementation of the
EISDF are explained below.

   1. Electronic Identity Authentication Service. The EISDF would facilitate the delivery of a
       national-level electronic-based service for the unique identification and identity
       authentication of residents physically or online. It would be used by service providers in
       the public and private sectors for delivering eID-enabled services using eID-enabled
       applications to their CBS.


   2. Electronic Identity Seeding Service. The EISDF would provide eID seeding service, which
       enables the use of eID authentication by mapping the CBS profile to its unique National
       Identity Number (NIN) generated at the national level on registration.


   3. ESignature Service. The EISDF would put into effect the use of eSignatures by residents
       on eDocuments in transactions with the public and private sectors. This would enable
       paperless eService workflows and do away with the need for physical signatures.


   4. Electronic Know-Your-Customer Service. The EISDF would provide a centralized Electronic
       Know-Your-Customer (eKYC) process by which a service provider is able to identity its
       CBS electronically with the explicit authorization of the latter. The eKYC, being eID-based,
       would furnish an instant, non-repudiable Proof of Identity (PoI) and Proof of Address
       (PoA), along with date of birth and gender. In addition, it would also yield the resident’s
       mobile number and email address to the service provider, which further streamlines the
       process of service delivery.


   5. Electronic Payment (ePayment) Service. The EISDF would provide a centralized eID-based
       ePayment service through the Electronic Identity Service Delivery Platform (EISDP). With
       ePayment, government agencies would be able to make fund transfers of public program
       benefits such as social pension, health benefits, scholarships, etc., to the intended
       beneficiaries. While the emphasis in the report is on Government-to-Citizen payments, if
       the electronic payment service is made available to the business and citizen communities,
       it could be used for Business-to-Citizen, Citizen-to-Business and Citizen-to-Citizen
       payments.




                                                                                   Page 38 of 218
      6. Mobile ID. The EISDF would provide a centralized mobile ID service in collaboration with
           mobile network operators to verify the resident’s identification through their mobile
           phones. Having the mobile ID as an identification mechanism should also facilitate the
           growth of mobile applications and adoption in Vietnam.

EISDF Key Concepts. Some of the key concepts for enabling the seamless delivery of the eID
services are described below.

      1. Centralized National-level Identity Service Provider. The envisioned EISDF would be
           owned, designed and implemented by a centralized government-owned national-level
           identity service provider.


      2. Electronic Identity-enabled Applications and Service Delivery. Service delivery applications
           that may use eID functions to identify and authenticate the resident would be referred to
           as “eID-enabled applications”. The use of eID-enabled applications may be broadly
           referred to as “eID-enabled service delivery”.


      3. Centralized National-level Identity Creation Process. The EISDF would be based on a
           central identity creation system operated by a national government agency which issues
           the eID. A centralized process for identity creation ensures uniqueness of the eID. Hence,
           the service providers using the EISDF for identity authentication of their CBS do not need
           to recreate a separate process for its purposes. This would prevent the generation of
           multiple identities for the same resident by multiple service providers.

           This mechanism would eliminate the need for duplication of effort in identity creation by
           the service providers, and result in a reduction of the overall cost of identification.

           The framework could also leverage advancement in technology to enable providers to
           deliver a higher quality of service to the residents and empower them to prove their
           identity anywhere, anytime, and in multiple modes using the global and irrevocable eID.

      4. Identity that is Digital, Online-verifiable and Interoperable. Going digital and online has
           always proven to increase access, convenience and transparency to the common man.
           Given that Vietnam has good Internet penetration8 with fiber optic cables laid all the way
           to the commune level and wireless broadband connectivity at the village level with more

                                                                                                      Page 39 of 218
           than 100 percent mobile penetration9, there is an increasing demand from the CBS for
           eServices in both the government and private sector organizations. The eServices would
           require a digital and online-verifiable eID for delivery. The EISDF could also leverage
           advancement in technologies with the use of the eID which is digital, online-verifiable and
           standard-based interoperable for unique identification of residents.


      5. Identity Based on NIN, Demographic Attributes, and Biometrics. The EISDF would leverage
           the use of the eID as defined by the identity creation process of the new NID system. The
           unique eID would be defined in terms of a person’s demographic attributes (name,
           gender, age, address, etc.), biometrics (fingerprints, iris images) and the central
           government-issued NIN. Demographic data alone may not guarantee uniqueness;
           however, they would be linked to the biometric attributes of the individual to create a
           unique identity for NIN generation.


      6. Global and Irrevocable NIN. The NIN identifies the residents and would give them the
           means to clearly establish their identity to public and private agencies across the country.
           The NIN would have three key characteristics:
           a. Permanence: It remains the same throughout the lifetime of a resident.
           b. Uniqueness: One resident has one identity number, and no two residents throughout
               the country have the same identity number.
           c. Globalness: The same identifier can be used across applications and domains from
               different service providers in the country.


      7. NIN Uniqueness through Biometric Deduplication. The NIN would be issued by GoV during
           the initiation process called enrollment where a resident’s demographic and biometric
           information are collected and the uniqueness of the provided data is established through
           a process called deduplication. The deduplication process would include running the
           demographic and biometric information captured during enrollment through the rigorous
           1:1 mapping of the two sets of data to yield 99.99 percent accuracy before assigning a
           unique identity number to the resident. Post deduplication, the NIN may be issued and a
           letter containing the details sent to the resident.

                                                                                       Page 40 of 218
         The digital and online-verifiable eID could reduce the risk of resident identity theft and
         remove the issues of photocopied fake documents. It is easy to forge paper-based identity
         documents compared to the digital-based identity which is verifiable online.

         The eID would be issued using the Personal Identity Data (PID) based on an individual’s
         paired demographic and biometric information following the national policy of the
         government to ensure interoperability.

   8. Standardized Identity Supported by Tokens. The EISDF would support standardized
         identity tokens of different types depending on the identity authentication and eSignature
         requirements of the service providers or their specific programs. The EISDF would support
         three different types of identity tokens: a personal identification number (PIN), or “what
         the user knows”; a mobile/One-Time Password (OTP)/digital certification, or “what the
         user has”; and fingerprints or iris images, or “who the user is”.      Identity tokens are
         described in detail in Annex 1. The eID of the resident would be assigned multiple identity
         tokens to be used, as appropriate, for authentication and eSignature based on the
         business need of the service being rendered.

Common Security and Privacy Considerations. The eID functions, as envisaged, would become
available online across various domains and applications on a daily basis. Any online service may
come under various kinds of attacks, including organized large-scale ones. This means that the
delivery of secure eServices is of utmost importance. The design of the eID would include security
and privacy measures at different levels to ensure high-level protection. They are described
below.

Security Considerations

   1. Security of Resident Data Captured during Service Request. The eID system would ensure
         the security of the personal identity data (PID block) captured on the front-end devices
         and applications through several means.
            a. Encryption and Tamper-proofing. The EIDSF would encrypt the data on the capture
                device before transmitting it over the network. The encrypted data would not be
                stored unless it is for buffered authentication for a short period of time and it
                would be deleted after transmission. Biometric and OTP data captured for the
                purposes of authentication would not be stored in the database on a permanent
                basis. The service would also support Hash-based Message Authentication Code
                (HMAC) to ensure that the PID block is not tampered in transit.




                                                                                    Page 41 of 218
b. Trusted Service Delivery Ecosystem. The EIDSF would provide a mechanism for the
     registration and authentication of the terminal device, operator and other
     participants to form the trusted service delivery ecosystem. The digitally signed
     service delivery application on the terminal device would be used to identify the
     trusted devices and applications. The operator would be authenticated in the case
     of operator-assisted devices.
c. Digitally Signed Service Request and Response. In addition to the encryption of
     data, the registered provider digitally signs the service request and the service
     response is signed by the owner-government agency to establish trust and non-
     repudiation mechanism between the provider and the agency. The source of the
     application programming interface (API) call is heavily authenticated to ensure no
     malicious calls are processed. Digital signing of the response by the government
     agency would ensure that the integrity of the response is maintained and that the
     provider can trust the fact that the response, indeed, came from the right
     authority. This feature would allow applications to move eID verification fully
     online thereby avoiding paper processing and reducing the overall cost.
d. Response Timestamp. The eID service response to a request would have a
     timestamp to allow applications to verify “when” the service was delivered or the
     resident authentication was done. Applications would also use it for audit
     purposes. This can be useful in filtering the time range of when a particular NIN
     was issued during the authentication process.
e. Audit and Certification Mechanism. The EISDF would provide the mechanism for
     data and transactions audit and certification. The metadata and the responses
     would be stored for audit purposes for over a period of time for a minimum of six
     months. There could be standard audit and certification processes for application
     devices and overall networks across the ecosystem. Every service request would
     generate a unique response code that can be used for audit and troubleshooting
     purposes. This code would uniquely distinguish every transaction across the
     system, quite similar to the unique authorization code issued for every credit card
     transaction.
f.   Fraud Analytics. The EISDF would avail of the Fraud Analytics software, a detection
     tool suite that identifies suspicious claims at the onset.
g. Anti-Virus Software. Software to prevent malware/virus attacks would be put in
     place, along with other network security controls and end-point authentication
     schemes.

2. Security of End-to-end Network. The eID service delivery would use a protected network
   for transmission of data using a secure channel such as the secure sockets layer (SSL) and
   a secure leased line or similar private lines as a defense against network attacks which
   result in denial of service (DoS).   The service design would also ensure high availability
   and redundancy in case some parts of the network are compromised or unavailable.
   Service providers and their partners (agents, application providers, etc.) would put
   appropriate network security in place to guarantee their systems are protected from
   attacks.


3. Securing Service End-points/CRIDS. If centralized EISDF is exposed over a public network
   such as the Internet to partners, it is expected to come under DoS/Distributed DoS (DDoS)
   attacks. Since many applications in the country could heavily depend on functions such
   as eID authentication, it is strategically important not expose them over any public
   network like the Internet, and not create a “single point” of attack that can potentially
   affect multiple services. There are means to fully protect the eID from unauthorized
   external systems’ direct network attack that could result in DoS and data theft. They are
   explained below.
       a. Identity Service Provider Agency. The EISDF service would be kept in the secure
          zone and exposed through multiple network end-points. The design would
          include the creation of authorized organizations like Identity Service Provider
          Agencies (ISPAs), and exposing authentication service solely through their secure
          private connections using leased lines. This is strategic in ensuring multiple end-
          points always exist to provide authentication service in a secure, and always
          available, fashion.
       b. License Key Usage. The EISDF would support the concept of license key similar to
          that issued in software licensing: a pattern of numbers and/or letters provided to
          license users. It ensures that only authorized service provider can access the
          authentication service. It provides a mechanism to enforce specific feature usage,
          expiry, etc. It also allows the service providers to extend the service API to their
          partner-agencies and to trust their requests.


4. Standards-based Security Management. The EISDF would implement standards-based
   security management; which includes information security management, potential
   security controls and control mechanisms, the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) process, the
   information security management system (ISMS), and implementation and risk
   assessments. The eID authentication function would support standards such as the ISO


                                                                              Page 43 of 218
       27001i for information security management, the ISO 27002ii for potential control and
       control mechanisms, the ISO 27003iii for guidance on the use of the PDCA process, the
       ISO 27004iv to establish the effectiveness of the ISMS implementation, and the ISO 27005v
       for risk assessment, etc.

Privacy Considerations

   1. “Yes/No” Response. This feature would be applicable to the authentication function only.
       The eID authentication would allow applications to “verify” the identity claimed by the
       resident at service request while still protecting their data privacy. The eID authentication
       function would only respond with a “yes/no” and no personal identity information is
       returned as part of the response. This is one of the key strategic options to ensure resident
       data privacy − that there is no mechanism to “get” data of a resident through the
       authentication API.

       To illustrate, the authentication API involves questions and answers handled in this
       manner: “Resident claims his/her name is so-and-so, is this correct?”. While eID
       authentication may respond to a “yes/no” answer, it does not provide any scheme to ask
       questions such as: “What is the address of the resident whose national identification
       number is such-and-such?”

   2. Self-Verifiability of Response. The eID authentication and eKYC response would provide a
       true electronic version of identity verification and proof for verification. It would allow
       decoupling of the response usage from the actual service request which generates the
       response. The response would be used long after its generation and would be used
       multiple times as required. The current practice of identity verification is done by
       collecting “attested” copies of documents. Attesting allows the system to “trust” the fact
       that the copy is indeed verified against the original. At a high level, the eID authentication
       response would allow the service provider agencies to self-verify the following:
             Is this authentication indeed verified by the eLD-issuing government agency?
              ESignature would allow this check. This is akin to checking if an authorized officer
              has signed.
             Is this authentication for a given NIN?
             Was this authentication done within the last “n” months? A timestamped response
              allows this. It is useful to know if the authentication proof is recent.
             What was authenticated? “Usage flags” within “info” allows this check.
             Was name, date of birth, etc., verified?
             Was biometrics used?


                                                                                    Page 44 of 218
          Was full or partial address verified?
          Is the address verified during authentication the same as what is now provided by
           the resident? Hash value of demographic data would be used to uniquely identify
           secret information.
          In the case of the pension system, residents need to annually establish the fact
           that they are alive. This is currently done by having residents go to an authorized
           officer to sign a declaration. With eID authentication, an agency would authenticate
           a resident independently and provide the response to the pension system. The
           pension application can answer the question, “Has the person with such-and-such
           NIN been biometrically authenticated in the last six months?”, by simply verifying
           the extensible markup language (XML) response. Then it is determined whether
           that person is alive or not.
          The eID authentication response is similar to the paper-based document currently
           in use which says, “To whom it may concern,” and which is signed by an authorized
           officer on a specified date with the document clearly stating that “the person with
           such-and-such NIN has the name and address as given below”.
          The eID response would be viewed simply as an electronic version of the paper-
           based document and may be trusted and self-verified by a third party application.


3. Asynchronous Service Call via Transaction ID. The eID can be called by the service provider
   applications in an asynchronous mode, that is, data transmission is intermittent rather
   than in a steady stream. The transaction ID could be used by service providers to assign
   a logical business transaction identifier while integrating eID services. This feature would
   allow the request/response scheme to be made synchronous or asynchronous without
   worrying about how to correlate a request to its particular response. Whenever there is
   integration between two independent systems, it is critical that every transaction has a
   common “identifier” for correlating the request and response; it could also serve audit
   purposes later. For instance, when conducting a payment transaction, a bank would have
   to keep track of it across the flow. Service response contains the same transaction code
   that was in the request allowing applications to correlate a response with a particular
   request.


4. Buffered Service. The eID system supports “Buffered Service” in which the PID of multiple
   eID-holders are collected and buffered at the service request device, then transmitted at
   a later time. The buffered service process, therefore, varies slightly from that of the
   normal case until the service requests are transmitted from the service request device.


                                                                               Page 45 of 218
       From this point, the model and process are similar to the normal scenario: the buffered
       set of service requests are checked, structural validation of data is performed and
       forwarded to the service request processing server. Upon receiving the service result for
       each request, the service provider application forwards the same to the service request
       device that has placed the requests. Although the service request device may transmit
       multiple requests at the same time, each request would be treated as a separate
       transaction in the server and each request would have its own auth code. It is the
       responsibility of the service provider to ensure that the service request devices being used
       are capable of managing buffered service (including the capability to store multiple
       requests, transmit them at the same time, and receive and store the results of multiple
       requests). There would be an upper limit for the time duration that requests can be
       buffered. This duration may be determined by specifications defined by the owner-
       government agency. Since buffered service is provided only for supporting occasional
       connectivity issues on the field, buffering of requests would be done only on service
       request devices, and not on the servers of service providers.

Common Identity Service Usages. Service providers could use the eID system provided by the
EISDF mainly for the following three broad usage types:

   1. Establishing Know-Your-Customer Credentials
           a. KYC for various services. Identity and address verification would be a key
              requirement for the service providers to enroll a new CBS or to open a new account
              for an individual. Examples are issuance of a new tax code, telephone connection,
              bank account or Internet service account for an online business. The service
              provider in all such cases would be able to verify applicant identity and address
              using eID authentication. This is expected to substantially reduce the cost of the
              KYC process to service providers.
           b. General Proof of Identity. The PoI is a standard security-related requirement, e.g.,
              for entry to the airport, and to qualify for various examinations in hospitals or
              schools where a large number of cases of impersonation are reported every year.
              Various Internet, social-networking and eCommerce websites could also use eID
              authentication to verify customers and subscribers whenever it is required to
              establish the true identity of the person doing a transaction.
           c. Demographic Data and Address Verification.	The demographic data of the CBS in
              the databases of service providers could also be verified; this process would help
              in the database cleansing and management to weed out duplicate and ghost
              identities.


                                                                                   Page 46 of 218
2. Establishing Presence and Proof of Delivery
       a. Beneficiary Identity Verification.	Various social sector programs, where beneficiary
          identity needs to be verified before delivery of the service, are expected to be the
          most common users of the eID authentication service. Examples of its use include
          subsidized food and kerosene deliveries to below poverty line beneficiaries, health
          service delivery to health insurance beneficiaries, job applications registration by
          beneficiaries, etc. Identity verification would ensure that services are delivered to
          the right beneficiaries.
       b. Attendance Tracking. Another key purpose of eID authentication would be in
          establishing the presence of the beneficiary of the programs at the site for
          attendance tracking. For example, student and teacher attendance tracking for
          education-related activities, and labor attendance tracking for employment-
          related programs where outlay is linked to actual number of days the beneficiary
          reports for the program.
       c. Financial Transactions. Banks would authenticate the customer using the eID and
          other bank-related identity information (account number, user ID, along with
          password/OTP) before enabling financial transactions such as fund transfers and
          fund withdrawals.


3. Unifying Resident-centric Information. The (NIN) would be used as the common identifier
   to link related databases. The application for linking these databases would be for:
       a. A 360-degree view of the resident across social welfare programs, namely
          education loan assistance programs, subsidized health programs for newborn
          children and pregnant women, old age pension, etc. Such views could be used to
          improve the effectiveness of the government programs and to ensure benefits
          reach the targeted individuals.
       b. Healthcare and patient records database at the local, regional and national level.
       c. Credit bureaus for customer rating information.
       d. National employment and skills database, and tracking of individuals through the
          lifecycle.
       e. Large entities such as banks and insurance companies that need to implement a
          single-customer view across services.

5.2 Electronic Identity Services Detailed Description

The section below describes eID services and their specific features.


5.2.1 eID Authentication Service




        Figure 5.2: Functional View of the Electronic Identity Service Delivery Framework

The EISDF would provide eID authentication as the highly scalable, secure and available national
online platform for the verification of the eID of a resident. The NIN and eID profile of the resident
would be verifiable online using the demographic and biometric attributes over mobile, landline
and broadband networks.

The eID authentication would be used by holders to prove their identity digitally and online, and
for service providers in both public and private sectors to confirm the residents’ identity claim in
order to supply services and give access to benefits to their CBS. The service providers would be
able to deliver different types of eID authentication to their CBS in both the self-service mode
using mobile, kiosks or Internet-connected devices, and the operator-assisted mode using the
point of sales (POS) terminal at designated locations as shown in Figure 5.2. The supported
scenarios are detailed in Annex 1.


                                                                                     Page 48 of 218
The eID authentication is based on the prerequisite that residents could be uniquely identified
using the NIN assigned to them. The service could take the NIN along with the eID-holders’ PID
as the input which, in turn, verifies the correctness of the data provided on the basis of a match.
The service would send a “yes/no” response to either confirm the PoI or verify the information
provided by the resident.

Electronic Identity Authentication Service Types. Since the eID is meant to empower residents to
prove their identity anytime, anywhere and in multiple modes, the proposed authentication
service would support multiple types of authentication.

Support for Single-factor and Multi-factor Authentication. The eID system would support single-
factor and multi-factor authentications. The NIN, by itself, would not be a factor for
authentication. All authentication types would require the NIN for every request to reduce
transaction to a 1:1 match.     The NIN along with demographic attributes or single/multiple
biometrics would be used to provide single-factor authentication, and these attributes could be
used in combination to provide a multi-factor authentication to achieve the required
authentication needs.

eID Authentication Service Classification Based on Type of Authentication Attributes. The
authentication types would be classified based on the attributes used and could support the
following types that can be used by the service providers depending on their business needs:

       Type 1: Demographic authentication would use any single/combination of the
       demographic attributes such as name, address, date of birth, gender, mobile number and
       email address. It would be used on a periodic basis to check validity of the credentials, or
       for cleaning up the service provider database by removing duplicates. Service providers
       can also use the demographic authentication for identifying CBS prior to any transaction.

       Type 2: OTP authentication would use a single-use password. It would be delivered to a
       mobile or email address on request initiated by the resident or an application. It would be
       used for authenticating residents for Internet and mobile transactions as well as in cases
       where deployment of biometric technology is difficult or not practical. The OTP feature
       would enable the authentication to be further strengthened by verifying the possession
       of the mobile by the resident. The eID authentication would be supported by biometrics
       and/or OTP. While the biometrics provide one factor (who you are), OTP provides an
       additional factor (what you have). Service provider applications would use OTP as what-
       you-have factor to provide single-factor authentication, or along with biometrics as who-
       you-are factor for achieving two-factor authentication. In a nutshell, the OTP


                                                                                   Page 49 of 218
       authentication request would be initiated by the resident using Short Message Service
       (SMS)/Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) portals; it can also be initiated by
       the service providers’ application on behalf of the resident using OTP API. Notice that OTP
       authentication is always delivered to the resident’s mobile or email, and the application
       is expected to capture that during authentication so that OTP would be validated along
       with authentication.

       Type 3: Digital certificate or biometrics authentication would use eSignature issued to the
       eID-holder by the designated authority in Vietnam. The service provider would issue a
       smart card with digital certificate/biometrics, or use the mobile ID to authenticate the
       resident. It could be used for authenticating residents for Internet and mobile transactions
       and in cases where deployment of biometric technology is difficult or not practical and
       the business scenario requires higher security assurance level.

       Type 4: Biometric authentication would use fingerprints and/or iris images. It would
       require the resident to be present to provide fingerprint/iris image capture on a device.
       Biometric authentication would be required in scenarios such as KYC, financial
       transactions, and attendance tracking. The biometric matching feature supports one or
       more fingerprint matching using either fingerprint minutiae resolution (FMR) or
       fingerprint image resolution (FIR), and iris matching using iris image resolution (IIR).

       Type 5: Multi-factor authentication would use fingerprints and/or iris images, and/or
       digital certificate/biometrics, and/or mobile/OTP. It could be required in cases where
       there is a need for greater assurance.

Electronic Identity Authentication Type Based on Assurance Needs. The service provider would
select the authentication type such as single-factor or multi-factor depending on the level of
assurance required by them of their CBS. The selection criteria would depend on the risk, impact,
implementation cost and volume of authentications. These are described in detail in Annex 1.

Authentication Assurance Increases with Biometric Attributes. Demographic authentication (Type
1) is based on demographic attributes and does not guarantee “proof of presence”; hence, it is
associated with a lower level of assurance when compared to authentication based on biometric
attributes, digital certificate and OTP. The OTP authentication (Type 2) or digital certification
authentication (Type 3) is based on the OTP attribute or the digital certificate, respectively, and
the PIN which guarantees “proof of presence” of the mobile/email registered by the resident or
the availability of the digital certificate and the PIN. This process is associated with a higher level
of assurance when compared to demographic authentication type. However, since the


                                                                                      Page 50 of 218
mobile/email registered by the resident or the certificate and the PIN on the smart card or the
mobile phone can be shared with family members or friends, it does not guarantee “proof of
presence” and is, therefore, associated with a lower level of assurance when compared to
authentication based on biometric attributes. Biometric authentication indicates presence of that
individual; therefore, it provides the highest level of assurance. The assurance potentially
increases as different biometric modalities such as fingerprints and iris images are introduced
into the process.

Supports Federated Authentication Model. Most current authentication systems of service
providers in Vietnam may be described as “local” (i.e., created, managed and/or valid for a few
services, situations or entities) and “revocable” (wherein an existing identity factor would be
revoked and reissued as a result of expiry, compromise or other valid reasons). Such revocable,
local authentication systems come with a set of strengths and limitations. The EISDF, on the other
hand, may be described as “global” (because of it is created and managed by a single national
entity and it is applicable across situations, service providers and services) and “non-revocable”
(because the eID factors such as fingerprints and iris images cannot usually be revoked or
replaced). Global, non-revocable/permanent authentication systems come with their own set of
strengths and limitations.

In the federated authentication model, the global/irrevocable eID authentication co-exists with
and strengthens the local/revocable authentication. It is expected that such a federated approach
would result in authentication systems that are stronger and more reliable than those that are
based only on either the global/irrevocable model or the local/revocable model.

Hence, the EISDF could be designed with a view to strengthening the service providers’ existing
authentication systems, rather than replacing them. While the federated model would not
mandate the existence or use of a service provider’s own authentication (if a service provider so
wishes, it could use only the EISDF by itself), it may be encouraged to use the EISDF in conjunction
with its own local system to render the overall system stronger and more reliable.

The proposed authentication service in the case of multi-factor authentication could support the
federated authentication model in which the service provider can use both factors from the
proposed eID system, or one factor from the proposed eID system plus a second factor from
another entity including that of the service provider itself. For example, a bank could choose a
combination of biometrics and OTP as authentication factors from the proposed eID system, while
another bank could opt for biometric authentication from the proposed system in conjunction
with an ATM card/OTP issued by the bank itself.



                                                                                    Page 51 of 218
5.2.2 Electronic Know-Your-Customer Service
A fundamental building block of service delivery is the eKYC process; which establishes a
resident’s identity along with the address and other basic information such as date of birth and
gender. Typically, this KYC information is combined with other information to determine
eligibility – be it for scholarship, loan, social security pension, mobile connection, etc.

The EISDF would provide a centralized eKYC service as part of the EISDP; through which the KYC
process can be performed electronically with explicit authorization by the resident. The eID-
based eKYC service would provide an instant, electronic, non-repudiable PoI and PoA along with
date of birth and gender. In addition, it would provide the resident’s mobile number and email
address which further helps streamline the process.

The service provider could use the eKYC function primarily for performing the KYC process during
the registration of a new customer or beneficiary, or for linking the resident profile stored its
database with the NIN/eID database. The service would be accessible only to authorized service
providers using the secure network of the ISPA. The EISDF could provide a mechanism for
registering service providers to use the eKYC function.

The eKYC process could be performed at an agent’s location using biometric authentication as
well as remotely using an OTP on a website or mobile connection. As part of the eKYC process,
the residents could authorize the owner-government agency − through eID authentication using
biometrics/digital certificate/OTP − to provide their demographic data, along with their
photograph, digitally signed and encrypted to service providers.

The owner-government agency could publish the eKYC API specifications on their public portal.
The authorized service provider could invoke the eKYC function using the eKYC front-end
application. The application could capture the NIN along with the biometric/digital
certificate/OTP of the resident to form the eKYC XML by encapsulating the PID block, encrypting
the XML, affixing the eSignature and sending it to the eKYC system using the secured private
network of the ISPA. The eKYC system would authenticate the resident. If the authentication is
successful, it would respond back with a digitally signed and encrypted demographic data and
photograph in XML format. The demographic data and photograph, in response, are encrypted
with the public key of the service provider.

Some of the key features of the service could be:

   1. Paperless. The service would be fully electronic and document management may be
       eliminated.



                                                                                      Page 52 of 218
   2. Consent-based. The KYC data would only be provided upon authorization by the resident
       through eID authentication, thus protecting resident privacy.


   3. Eliminates Document Forgery. Elimination of photocopies of various documents that are
       currently stored in the premises of various service providers reduces the risk of identity
       fraud and protects resident identity. In addition, since the eKYC data is provided directly
       by the owner-government agency, there is no risk of forged documents.


   4. Non-repudiable. The use of resident authentication for authorization, the affixing of a
       eSignature by the service provider originating the eKYC request, and the affixing of a
       eSignature by the owner-government agency when providing the eKYC data would make
       the entire transaction non-repudiable by all parties involved.


   5. Low-cost. Elimination of paper verification, movement and storage could reduce the cost
       of the KYC process to a fraction of what it is today.


   6. Instantaneous. The service could be fully automated, and KYC data would be furnished in
       realtime, without any manual intervention.


   7. Machine Readable. Digitally signed electronic KYC data provided by the owner-
       government agency would be machine readable, making it possible for the service
       provider to directly store it as customer record in its database for purposes of service,
       audit, etc., without human intervention, thus making the process low-cost and error-free.


   8. Secure and Compliant with IT Policy. Both end-points of the data transfer are made secure
       through the use of encryption and eSignature following the national IT security policy,
       thus making the eKYC document legally equivalent to a paper-based document. In
       addition, the use of encryption and eSignature would ensure that no unauthorized parties
       in the middle can tamper or steal the data.


5.2.3 Electronic Identity Seeding Service
The EISDF would provide eID seeding service which is a process by which the NIN of a resident is
included in the database of service providers to enable eID authentication. The process allows
the service provider to map the CBS profile to the NIN. The objective is not to replace the unique
identifier currently employed by service providers, but to seamlessly enable eID authentication
using the NIN without impacting any other interface that the service providers maintain for their
customers.

                                                                                  Page 53 of 218
This could help to weed out duplicates and fake identities in the database of service providers
and reduce the leakages of welfare benefits. This could also enable the service providers to
correlate different benefits of various programs using the unique NID-mapped profiles of the
CBS. The practice could result in proper delivery of entitlements and a greater impact of welfare
programs. The repeated need for KYC checks during service delivery would be avoided by seeding
NIN in the databases of service providers.

Service providers would be responsible for seeding their databases with the NIN/eID information.
The EISDF would provide them the necessary tools, expertise, best practices, and consulting
advisory on request for the implementation of the seeding process. Some of the tools which
would be provided include seeding utilities and a centralized National eID Seeding Platform
(NESP); they are detailed in Annex 1. The eID seeding process would be a combination of several
sub-processes, and no one solution may apply to all cases. Therefore, it is essential that every
seeding process is thoroughly analyzed and planned before proceeding with the actual seeding.

The eID seeding process would necessarily be preceded by data digitization and centralization in
the service provider database. The EISDF would support top-down and organic methods of
seeding. In the case of the top-down method, the service provider would use the already available
database of the residents to compare with the profile of the residents in the service delivery
database; it would not contact the residents for the seeding process. However, in the case of the
organic method, the service provider would contact the resident, or vice-versa, for updating of
the NIN in its database. After the completion of top-down seeding and organic seeding where no
direct update of the database is enabled, the next step is to conduct a demographic
authentication of the data in the service delivery database. This is to ensure that the seeding
process has been done correctly.


5.2.4 Electronic Payment Service
In order to promote transparency, accountability, efficiency and correct targeting in the benefits
delivery of government programs such as social pension, health care, scholarships, etc., the EISDF
could provide a payment mechanism called National eID-based Electronic Payment Service (NEPS).
The NEPS would leverage eID authentication and the eID-Enabled Bank Account (eBA) for routing
the money to any resident on the basis of an eID. The NEPS would provide a centralized national
eID Payment Bridge (ePB) which would maintain the repository of the NIN/eID and the
corresponding eBA mapping for all the eID-holders in Vietnam. The residents could provide their
primary bank account details for receiving the government benefits at the time of NID enrollment
for the eBA. In case a resident has not provided bank account information at the time of
enrollment, an instant account could be created on the basis of the NIN/eID and serve as the eBA


                                                                                  Page 54 of 218
for the resident with a debit freeze. Money transferred would be credited to the instant account
that could be activated during the first withdrawal on the basis of eKYC.

The eID owner-government agency, along with other relevant government and private
stakeholders, could appoint a government agency to be responsible for implementing and
managing the NEPS.

Government departments would have to register with the NEPS as users of its service in the
disbursal of government benefits payment through registered sponsor banks. Sponsor banks"
are banks (both commercial and government owned) in Vietnam who may provide their service
to the government departments in the disbursal of government benefits to the residents of the
Vietnam. The bank would have to register with NEPS as the sponsor bank in order to provide their
services to the government departments. Both the public and private sector banks could register
with the NEPS as a sponsor banking institution to cater to user-agencies registered with the NEPS.
A user-agency could submit an ePB file with the NIN/eID of a beneficiary, the user-agency
identifier, the welfare scheme reference number, and the amount to be paid to the beneficiary’s
bank in a pre-defined format to the sponsor bank. ePB file is pre-defined formatted file that is
generated by the government agency which captures the payment details for all the beneficiaries
in the given welfare schemes. This file is sent to the sponsor bank IT system electronically. The
sponsor bank validates the data and attaches the Bank identification number (BIN) in the ePB file
and submits it to the NEPS system.

The sponsor bank could add its NEPS-issued Bank Identification Number (BIN) to the ePB file and
upload it onto the NEPS server. The NEPS processes the uploaded file, prepares the beneficiary
bank file and generates a settlement file. The destination bank would then download the incoming
file for credit processing after the settlement file has been processed. Using the credit file, the
destination bank could use their Core Banking System (CBS) to credit the funds to the bank
account of the beneficiary.

The beneficiary bank would provide the mobile-based or web-based application used by the
beneficiaries to withdraw funds, check their account balance, and allow for the initiation of
electronic payments. The issue of how the propose application allows for fund withdrawal could
also be examine in a pilot phase. The application would authenticate a beneficiary by using the
eID before enabling the beneficiary to access the account for any transaction. For the resident
who does not have access to a mobile-based or web-based application, he/she may walk to a
bank branch to perform the transaction. The resident also may use the micro-ATM with the
Banking Correspondent (BC) nearby to perform the same transaction to avoid travel time and
effort involved in having to go to a bank branch that is inconveniently located.


                                                                                   Page 55 of 218
This could promote the use of the formal banking system and electronic payment for financial
transactions by residents of Vietnam. It could also enable a faster channel for receiving all welfare
payments without middlemen, and promote ease of accessing bank accounts at anytime and
anywhere.

For government departments, the use of eID as the primary key could eliminate ghost and fake
beneficiaries and lead to better targeting. It could also reduce the time and cost of payment
processing and provide electronic audit trail and end-to-end visibility of all payments to improve
the transparency and accountability within departments.

For banks, use of the eID system could help in having a unique identification of their customers,
encourage electronic payments and, thus, reduce cash management costs. It would enhance the
reach to customers in remote areas using the BC and micro-ATM model, and enable greater
customer acquisitions.

It would be worth noting several considerations with the above proposed concept:
      It assumes that one person has only one bank account;
      The person has to go to the ID authority in case there is a change in bank account
       number;
      If a bank is not involved in the sending side, then the ID authority has to start dealing
       with funds; and
      If a person’s Id number is not tagged with an account number.

While this approach might work in the context of Vietnam, there are other alternatives that could
be considered. For example, the agency responsible for the benefit payments can simply maintain
the ID and the bank account number. If there is a concern on ownership of bank account number,
the agency can validate the name, etc. with the ID agency and also with the bank. This way a
recipient deals with the agency has a direct on-going relationship.



5.2.5 ESignature Service
The EISDF could provide a centralized eSignature service as part of the EISDP for the resident to
be able to digitally sign eDocuments, thereby enabling an end-to-end eService by providers in
Vietnam. The service would provide a universal system for giving, processing and verifying
eSignatures. It can be connected to any new or existing service delivery application using the
common standardized workflows in the form of the common document format applicable to each
service independent of the service provider. The service would use a digital certificate issued to
the resident by the competent government agency of the Vietnam. The digital certificate would
be issued to the resident at the time of enrollment in the eID system, or the resident would



                                                                                     Page 56 of 218
request for the digital certificate separately after the issuance of the eID. The issuance of the
digital certificate would require the availability of the NIN.

The EISDF could provide software for use by residents in signing the eDocuments. The software
would include base and intermediate libraries, client utility, web services and end-user
applications. The client utility can be installed on the residents’ Internet-connected
desktop/laptop/smart phone and used to sign eDocuments with the eID card or the mobile ID,
check the validity of eSignatures, and open and save documents inside the signature container.
The client utility can be made available to anybody to download for free from the EISDF public
portal. The portal could also provide the instructions for the installation of the software by the
residents on their device. The working of the client utility using the desktop or Internet browser
is detailed in Annex 1.


5.2.6 Mobile ID Service
The EISDF would provide mobile ID service for digital signing of eDocuments and for
authentication of eID-holders. The mobile ID allows residents to use their mobile phone as a form
of secure eID for authentication and eSignature. Like the ID card, it could be used in accessing
secure eServices and digitally signing documents, but with the advantage of not requiring a card
reader. The eSignatures and its associated digital certificate could be issued to residents who
needs such a service, as massive implementation for all residents is likely not feasible from a
process and management perspective.

Qualified eSignatures are advanced eSignatures that are based on a qualified certificate and which
are created by a Secure-Signature-Creation Device (SSCD). Usually, the latter implies the use of
a specific smart card. As an off-the-shelf personal computer (PC) or notebook would not contain
a reader for the simple use of a smart card − the procedure required before the card can actually
be used − it can be quite time-consuming and costly to have to install one. In the case of mobile
ID, there is no need for installation of any card reader and no complicated installations are
required for its use. It can be used anywhere in the world where there is mobile coverage.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has ranked Vietnam at the eighth position in
the world in terms of mobile subscription density. Therefore, the mobile ID could be a good
option for faster adoption of the use of eID. As smart phone technology becomes more
widespread, having the mobile ID option would become increasingly handy, allowing further
adoption of eID for use in mobile applications. This could also help the top mobile network
operators (MNOs) in Vietnam to increase their revenue per subscriber without adding new virtual
subscribers.



                                                                                  Page 57 of 218
The system would be based on a specialized mobile ID SIM, which the resident should request
from the mobile phone operator. The two certificates along with their private keys could be stored
on the mobile SIM with a small application for authentication and signing.

The government could delegate the responsibility of issuing the mobile ID to the national mobile
operators, namely Viettel, Mobiphone, Vinaphone, etc., through their local stores. Residents
would go to their nearest mobile operator with their ID card with valid certificates for issuance of
the mobile ID. The resident simply signs a contract (mobile ID subscription agreement) with the
mobile operator to get the mobile ID, and activates the service on the handset with the new
specialized SIM. To activate the mobile ID service or to apply for the certificates, the resident
would go to the website of the EISDF to submit an application online.

The mobile operator could charge the resident for the mobile ID service. The charges would
include a one-time subscription fee and monthly fees. If the mobile ID is used outside of Vietnam,
each mobile ID transaction could be charged at the cost of sending one text message as specified
on the package price list.

The mobile ID could be used by the residents for logging in to secure sites; for instance, a bank
account:

   1. The resident would click the “Log in with mobile ID” option on a supported website.


   2. The resident would be prompted to enter his/her mobile number and personal
       identification code.


   3. The website would display a unique verification code online.


   4. The phone would beep and display a screen indicating that a connection is being made.


   5. The phone screen would display the authentication service name and verification code.


   6. If the service name is correct and the verification code corresponds to the displayed
       number on the page on the computer screen, then it would be safe to press “Accept”.


   7. The user would be prompted to enter a mobile ID PIN on the phone


   8. The screen on the phone would disappear and the website is automatically reloaded with
       a logged in screen.


                                                                                    Page 58 of 218
6.0 Implementation Strategy Recommendations

The implementation strategy for the vision of the Electronic Identity Service Delivery Framework
(EISDF) could include the high-level technical architecture options for the development of state-
of-the-art, highly scalable and secure Electronic Identity (eID) service delivery IT infrastructure
and platform. This will support an institutional and legal framework including an organizational
model, an operating model and the identification of national policies needed for the governance
and regulation of such a framework. It could also include the communication strategy to develop
awareness and provide tools to key stakeholders to promote the adoption of the framework in
Vietnam. The section below describes some of the implementation strategy recommendations
related to the eID framework, technical options, communication strategy, institutional and policy
framework for the EISDF. It is to be noted that the proposed implementation strategy
recommendations will depend heavily on the foundation set by the National ID program.


6.1 Technical Recommendations

   1. Electronic Identity Service Delivery Platform (EISDP). The shared centralized IT
       infrastructure and common services platform could be designed and implemented using
       common standard mechanisms and open standards-based technologies for facilitating
       elD-related processes performed by service providers in the government and private
       sector organizations. Service providers could delegate the common elD-related processes
       such     as    unique     identification    and     identity   authentication      of    their
       customers/beneficiaries/subscribers (CBS) online to the EISDP, instead of recreating their
       own mechanism for identification and authentication. This could remove the duplicate
       efforts of identity creation and in turn could reduce the overall cost of the service delivery
       process. This could also enable standardized and interoperable identity and identity
       authentication process for the residents across all service providers in Vietnam.


   2. Key Technical Components of EISDP.
           a. Public Portal. The EISDP could provide a common public portal for sharing public
               information related to identity services for the residents, technical content,
               development and testing environment for software developers to help them
               develop eID-enabled software applications, and service management and
               monitoring applications for various stakeholders accessible over the Internet and
               intranet. The portal could provide user registration and authentication capabilities



                                                                                    Page 59 of 218
   for accessing the protected content on the portal. For further description and
   technical details about the public portal, refer to Annex 4.
b. Electronic Identity Services and Common Applications. Some of the elD functions
   and common applications required by service providers in the unique
   identification and identity authentication of residents could be hosted on the
   EISDP, rather than repeatedly hosted by service providers. The common eID
   functions and applications that could be hosted on the EISDP are:
       i. The eID system and eID authentication, electronic Know-Your-Customer
          (eKYC) application, eID seeding, ePayment, eSignature and mobile ID
          services.
       ii. Common applications: Management Information System (MIS), Decision
          Support System (DSS), Fraud Analytics, registration and management
          applications of Identity Service Provider Agencies (ISPAs) and Identity
          Service Consumer Agencies (ISCAs), and application and IT infrastructure
          management systems.
      iii. The Centralized Resident Identity Data Store (CRIDS)/EISDP could host an
          updated version of the centralized and highly secure database of the eID
          (NIN + demographic and biometric data) of the residents.
c. IT Infrastructure (hardware and software). The EISDP could support the IT
   infrastructure recommendations as described below. For the detailed description,
   refer to Annex 5.
       i. The eID services could generally be exposed as stateless web services.
       ii. Both the eID services and common applications could be hosted on two
          separate scalable, highly available virtualized web farm with clustered
          virtual web servers within the centralized data center.
      iii. The IT infrastructure could support server virtualization and capabilities
          for the management of virtualized and physical IT infrastructure
          environment.
      iv. The Electronic Identity Authority of Vietnam (EIDAV) data centers would not
          have direct access to the public network. It would only be accessed by the
          registered ISPA using dual redundant private leased line connectivity
          between the ISPA and EIDAV’s data centers.
       v. Adequate security measures could be designed to prevent any malicious
          access outside of the private network by hosting web farms in a secure
          zone of the network infrastructure protected by firewall, and the separate
          isolated network with the redundant switches.


                                                                       Page 60 of 218
       vi. The data could be stored on the servers and storage devices in the data
           zone that is separated from the secure zone using the firewall. The data
           storage system could be designed to be highly available and scalable.
      vii. The disaster recovery center could have the same configuration and
           capabilities as that of the production data center, and operate in the active-
           active mode.
     viii. The portal and development environment servers could be accessible over
           the Internet and could be completely isolated from the servers and the
           network of the secure and data zones in the De-Militarized Zone (DMZ).
           The servers for the public portal and development environments could be
           hosted on a different segment of the network completely separated from
           the servers in the secure and the data zones.
      ix. The residents’ eID data in the CRIDS could be populated and updated on a
           regular basis using a centralized national-level identity creation process.
           Instead of recreating the identity creation process, the CRIDS could be
           populated by reusing the resident database created by GoV for issuing the
           national identity system (NID) card and the national identity number (NIN)
           to the residents of Vietnam.
       x. Given that the NID card and the NIN would be issued at the national level,
           there could be a single process for identity creation and verification of the
           identity; hence, the problem of multiple identities for the same resident
           could be solved. The NID card could be used as the centrally issued national
           identity token to identify the residents uniquely and the NIN could be used
           as the unique identifier for the eID of the resident in the envisioned EISDF.
      xi. There could be a periodic transfer of the new residents’ data from the NID
           system to EIDAV as and when new residents are enrolled, until all the
           residents have been issued the NIN and NID card. A secure operational
           model for transferring updates, such as address change, to the resident
           data stored in the CRIDS and the NID resident database on an ongoing
           basis could be designed.
d. Physical Infrastructure. The EISDF could include the implementation of the physical
   infrastructure such as the data centers at various locations based on the topology
   and   implementation     requirements    for   the   EISDF.   The   EISDP’s   physical
   infrastructure that could be part of the overall physical infrastructure of the EISDF.
   The figure below describes the possible topology of the physical infrastructure to
   be established for the implementation of the overall EISDF.


                                                                         Page 61 of 218
               Figure 6.6 - EISDF Physical Infrastructure Topology


EISDP physical infrastructure could include the following components and for
further details on each of the component, refer to Annex 4.
    i. EIDAV Data Center. The EISDP could be hosted at the national-level
       centralized data center, namely the EIDAV data center. Since all the EISDF
       eID services could be hosted at this data center and the eID services could
       be used by the mission-critical applications of the government and the
       private sector organizations, this data center could be designated as a
       national critical infrastructure.
   ii. EIDAV Disaster Recovery Center. The disaster recovery center could be built
       in a different geographical location, such as a different city in a different
       seismic zone from EIDAV data center. The disaster recovery center could
       provide the failover support for eID services, applications and IT
       infrastructure of EIDAV data center. It could work in the active-active mode
       and could host the eID services and applications to provide load balancing



                                                                     Page 62 of 218
                   and fault tolerance solution to EIDAV center; it could also fall back to the
                   EIDAV center in case of any failures.
               iii. NID Data Center. The NID data center could host the national identity
                   information database, and the latter could be used to populate the citizen
                   database in the EIDAV data center for identity services delivery.
       e. Safety and Security Systems. EISDP could provide the common security functions
            and be hosted on the platform. Some of these functions could include end-to-end
            security of the network using the standard network security practices at multiple
            levels such as the usage of encrypted channels, IP filtering, authentication of
            systems and devices, creation of security zones, network protection through
            firewalls and the Network Intrusion Protection System (NIPS), auditing, etc. The
            physical security infrastructure could have a multiple level of security system for
            entry of authorized personnel, biometric-based access, etc.
       f.   Operations Management. The operations monitoring and management system
            could include technical, institutional and policy-level solutions across the physical
            and technology infrastructure, identity services and applications, and the
            information delivery interfaces of the EISDP.


3. ISPA Data Center. The ISPAs could be government or private agencies that could establish
   a secure private network between their data center and the EIDAV data center compliant
   with EISDF standards and specifications. The ISPAs offer their EISDF-compliant network
   connectivity as a service through their data center to ISCAs and transmit the latter’s
   identity service requests to the EISDP. Some of the technical recommendations for the
   ISPA data center are described below and for further details, refer to Annex 4.
       a. Only the ISPA data center may send identity service requests to the EIDAV data
            center. The ISPA data center could be the critical infrastructure in the delivery of
            the eID services; hence, the design of the data center could include a disaster
            recovery solution with a remote data backup support.
       b. The EISDF could publish on their public portal the process for any government or
            private agency to register as an ISPA. The portal could also publish the detailed
            technical guidelines for setting up and operating an ISPA data center.
       c. ISPA applications and their respective databases could be hosted on the highly
            scalable and fault-tolerant virtualized servers. The data center could also include
            the required hardware and software for security, data backup, monitoring and
            management of the data center.




                                                                                 Page 63 of 218
4. ISCA Data Center. The ISCAs could host their service delivery applications in the ISCA data
   center and integrate them with the eID services for unique identification and identity
   authentication of their CBS. The ISCA data center could connect with the Point of Sales
   (PoS) terminals and with the designated ISPA data center. Some of the technical
   recommendations for the ISCA data center are described below and for further details,
   refer to Annex 4.
       a. The ISCA could host their web-based service delivery applications in their data
            center, and client-based applications on their PoS terminal; which could send their
            eID service request to the ISCA data center that forwards it to the ISPA data center
            via a secure network.
       b. The ISCA applications and their respective databases could be hosted on the highly
            scalable and fault-tolerant virtualized servers. The data center could also include
            the required hardware and software for security, data backup, monitoring and
            management of the data center.
       c. The EISDF could publish the ISCA registration process and the detailed technical
            guidelines for setting up the ISCA data center on EIDAV’s public portal.
       d. The ISCA would have to update their service delivery applications and PoS
            applications to integrate with the EISDF eID service Application Programming
            Interface (API) calls following the technical guidelines provided by the EISDF in
            order to ensure a secure and fail-proof delivery of services.
       e. The PoS applications could be centralized web-based or rich client-based
            applications connected to EIDAV-compliant biometric devices such as fingerprint
            capture, iris scan, and photo camera devices used to collect the biometric data of
            the resident.


5. Electronic Identity Authentication Services. Some of the technical recommendations for
   the implementation of the eID authentication services are listed below, and for further
   details, refer to Annex 4.
       a.   The eID authentication service could provide several ways in which residents can
            authenticate themselves using the system and could support “demographic
            authentication” and/or “biometric authentication” and/or digital certificate/OTP.
       b. The eID authentication service could be exposed as stateless web service using
            the open data format in extensible markup language (XML), widely used protocol
            such as hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP) and open standards-based
            technologies. These could enable easy adoption and deployment of eID




                                                                                Page 64 of 218
     authentication    services.   For   further   details   on   the   open    standards
     recommendation, refer to Annex 4.
c. To support strong end-to-end security, only registered ISPAs and ISCAs could be
     allowed to use the service using the unique registration code and license keys to
     enable non-repudiation and message integrity. To avoid request tampering and
     man-in-the-middle attacks, encryption of data could happen at the time of
     resident data collection on the capture device, and no data have to be stored in
     the devices or log files.
d. The EISDP, ISCA and ISPA could maintain audit records for all the authentication
     request metadata along with the response to enable issue resolution, audits and
     business intelligence.
e. The servers of the EISDP, ISCAs and ISPAs could support buffering of
     authentication requests and responses to support occasional lack of network
     connectivity among ISCA, ISPA and EISDP data centers.
f.   The eID authentication service could take the NIN along with the eID-holder’s
     personal identity data (PID) as the input which, in turn, submits the data to the
     CRIDS for matching, following which the CRIDS verifies the correctness of the data
     provided on the basis of a 1:1 match with the eID-holder’s identity information
     available with it. The service would respond with a “yes/no” response to either
     confirm the Proof of Identiy (PoI) or verify the information provided by the resident.
g. In all forms of eID authentication service types, the NIN could be submitted along
     with the single/multiple authentication factors so that authentication is reduced
     to a 1:1 match.
h. The implementation of demographic authentication could include the matching of
     the basic demographic attributes of the resident, such as name, address, gender,
     etc., captured as part of the service request input data with the PID data stored in
     the CRIDS. The demographic data fields and the matching design are further
     described in Annex 4.
i.   The biometric authentication service type could allow service provider applications
     to verify if the resident is “who he/she claims to be”. Several applications may
     require physical, in-person verification to ensure only the right resident is being
     served and right beneficiaries are being authenticated for service delivery. The
     implementation of biometric authentication service could include fingerprint
     and/or iris matching. The biometric data captured by the input device should
     comply with open standards to promote interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in
     situation. For further details, refer to Annex 4.


                                                                          Page 65 of 218
      j.   The One-Time Password (OTP) authentication service could enable the resident to
           initiate the OTP authentication request by using Short Message Service
           (SMS)/Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) portals or it can be
           initiated by the service provider application on behalf of the resident using OTP
           API. The OTP authentication could always be delivered on the resident’s
           mobile/email, and the application could capture that during authentication so that
           the OTP can also be validated along with authentication.
      k. The digital certificate/biometrics authentication service could enable the resident
           to insert their NID card into the card reader attached to the Internet-connected
           desktop for authenticating on the service provider application. The service
           provider application would read the digital certificate/biometrics on the card and
           initiate a call to the web service for authentication using the digital
           certificate/biometrics exposed as the API from the eID authentication service.
      l.   The digital certificate/biometrics authentication could also be initiated using the
           mobile ID. The resident would be able to select the mobile ID option for
           authentication on the service providers’ website. The resident could enter his/her
           mobile number and NIN on the website. The application, in turn, calls the eID
           authentication service API for mobile ID which could respond by providing the
           unique code on the website. It could also connect with the mobile phone and
           invoke the eID authentication application on the mobile phone and display the
           same unique code.
      m. The authentication service design could be extensible and support different
           tokens such as the mobile phone, Near Field Communication (NFC) token, smart
           card, etc., today and in the future. This could be useful in adding second factor
           (“what resident has”) for a self-service transaction from the resident.
      n. The authentication response could be used as the digital PoI and proof of address
           (PoA) at a later point in time by adding the meta-information of the PID details in
           the authentication request to the authentication response.


6. Electronic Know-your-customer Service. Some of the technical recommendations for the
   implementation of the eKYC service are listed below:
      a. The eKYC service could enable the KYC process to be performed electronically with
           explicit authorization by resident. The eID-based eKYC service could provide an
           instant, electronic, non-repudiable PoI and PoA along with date of birth and
           gender.




                                                                               Page 66 of 218
       b. The technical architecture and security designs could be the same as that of the
           eID authentication service.
       c. The service could be made available only to registered ISCAs and ISPAs; and is
           performed at an agent location using biometric authentication, as well as remotely
           using an OTP on a website or mobile connection.
       d. Residents       could   authorize   the   ISCA   through   eID   authentication   using
           biometrics/digital certificate/OTP to provide their demographic data along with
           their photograph digitally signed and encrypted to service providers.
       e. The eKYC service response could be an encrypted and digitally signed XML
           containing demographic data along with the photograph of the resident. It could
           be used as the eKYC document by the service provider, for delivering services to
           the citizen.


7. ESignature service. When a legal document is signed, all parties involved in the signed
   activity act on a set of basic assumptions regarding the signature:


      The signer intended to sign the document.
      The signer is who the person claims to be and is authorized to sign the document.
      The signature is that of the signer and is unique to the signer.
      The signature binds the signer to whatever the document states.
      The document will not be changed once the parties have signed it.
      A signature on one document is not transferrable to another document.
      The signer cannot later deny or repudiate the signature in an attempt to invalidate his
       or her relationship to the document.

   The Need for eSignatures
   An eSignature is the electronic equivalent of a handwritten signature. eSignatures have
   appealed to governments and businesses around the world due to the following reasons:
          Accelerate transactions — The requirement for handwritten signatures often result
           in lengthy delay in a transaction.        eSignatures make possible long-distance
           transactions, in which parties are in different time zones or in different countries.
           In addition, digital signatures greatly reduces the amount of travel for in-person
           meetings, the cost of courier service, and the number of days and salaried hours
           needed to complete transactions.
          Reduce the amount of paper — Many public and private agencies and
           organizations still seek "the paperless office" because of the desire to cut down
           on the time, staffing, and storage space required to handle paper-based
           transactions.

                                                                                 Page 67 of 218
       eSignatures are divided into two separate categories — (1) digital signatures and (2)
       electronic signatures, which is distinguished primarily by the presence or absence of
       Public-Key Cryptography (PKC).


       Digital Signatures

       The term digital signature refers to the encryption and decryption technology used as the
       foundation for a variety of security implementations. Based on public and private key
       cryptography, digital signatures are used in secure messaging, public key infrastructure,
       virtual private networks, and electronic signatures.

       Contrary to what the name might suggest, a digital signature alone is not a type of
       electronic signature. Rather, digital signature encryption could be used by electronic
       signature applications to secure the data and verify the authenticity of a signed record.
       Further, a digital signature alone does not capture a person’s intent to sign a document
       and be legally bound to an agreement or contract.

       Electronic Signatures

       An electronic signature employs digital technology to bind a signature to an electronic
       document. In its most-secure solutions offered by service providers, the signature is
       bound to the document in such a way that neither the document nor the signature can be
       altered without invalidating the document.

       An electronic signature is, like its paper equivalent, a legal concept. According to the U.S
       Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, an e-signature is an
       “electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to, or associated with, a contract or other
       record and adopted by a person with the intent to sign a record.” A digital signature, on
       the other hand, refers to the encryption / decryption technology on which an electronic
       signature solution is built. A digital signature alone is not a type of electronic signature.
       Rather, digital signature encryption secures the data associated with a signed document
       and helps verify the authenticity of a signed record. Used alone, it cannot capture a
       person’s intent to sign a document or be legally bound to an agreement or contract.

eSigning Process

   1. Channel: The resident fills out an application form on the organization’s website, visits a
       retail branch, contacts a representative or the call center.




                                                                                    Page 68 of 218
2. Access: The resident is provided with a link to the e-signing process from within the
   application process itself, or an email containing the link is sent to the resident inviting
   him / her to the e-signing session.


3. Authentication: The resident enters his / her personal information or credentials, and is
   brought into the e-signing session. For in-branch signing, the resident presents his / her
   credentials in paper format.


4. Consent: The resident is presented with the E-SIGN Consent form, as required by law. If
   he / she does not consent to the use of electronic signatures, the resident is provided
   with the ability to sign the documents using pen and paper.


5. Presentation: The resident is presented with all required documents and legal disclosures
   on-screen. The documents can also be printed and presented in paper format for in-
   person signing sessions.


6. Affirmation: The resident indicates his / her acceptance of legal disclosures and signs and
   initials documents by clicking on a button on-screen, or by hand-scripting his / her
   signature on a signature capture pad, iPad or other mobile device.



7. Delivery: The resident is provided a secure, tamper-proof copy of the e-signed documents
   in electronic format, or in paper format.




8. Mobile ID Service. Some of the technical recommendations for the implementation of the
   mobile ID service are listed below and for further details, refer to Annex 4.
       a. The mobile ID service could be based on SIM enabled by Wireless Public Key
           Infrastructure (wPKI) and supported by standard protection profile. The SIM could
           be procured through secure environment and supported mobile phones.
       b. The SIM could have Secure-Signature-Creation Device (SSCD) module, with two
           key pair; one for authentication, and the other for signing/non-repudiation
           purposes.
       c. The mobile ID service could be hosted on the EISDP as stateless web service and
           the service provider would have to integrate it into their service delivery
           application. The service delivery application could be hosted on the ISCA data
           center and could, in turn, call the mobile ID service hosted at the EIDAV data center
           with the NIN, mobile number and PIN.




                                                                                Page 69 of 218
      d. In turn, the service validates the mobile number provided as the input with the
           mobile number stored in the CRIDS for the resident. After successful validation, it
           would call the Trusted Service Provider (TSP) web service hosted in the TSP data
           center over the secured Internet connection with the mobile number, verification
           code and PIN.
      e. In response, the TSP service could generate the verification code and send it to the
           ISCA website. It could also generate the signature request with the verification
           code, mobile number and PIN and sends it to the resident’s mobile phone using
           Over-The-Air (OTA) and SMS gateway of the TSP over the wireless network in SMS
           form.
      f.   The specialized OTA SMS activates the identity verification application on the SIM
           card. It could display the verification code which is the same as that displayed on
           the computer of the resident. The resident validates the verification code displayed
           on the mobile device with the one displayed on the computer and then signs the
           request by entering the PIN.
      g. On successful authentication, the resident logs in to the secure website.
      h. The mobile ID service would require SIM provisioning, user registration, certificate
           activation and termination of the service. Further technical details related to these
           operations are detailed in Annex 4.


9. Electronic Identity Seeding Service. Some of the technical recommendations for the
   implementation of the eID seeding service are listed below.
      a. A seeding utility would be a desktop client utility for seeding the NIN in the
           resident profile stored in the database of the service provider. The ISCA could
           download the utility from EIDAV’s portal and install it on its server as the
           executable. The utility provides the capability for data extraction, consolidation,
           normalization and matching, and connects to different data sources to pull the
           relevant PID from the reference databases. It could also pull the data from the
           relevant data tables in the database of the service provider. For further details on
           the functioning of the utility, refer to Annex 4.
      b. The National Electronic Seeding Platform (NESP) could be a web application hosted
           on EIDAV’s public portal. Residents and authorized users (“seeders”) of the service
           providers login to submit the seeding request and verify the request (“verifiers”).
           The NESP would access the resident data stored in the CRIDS using the web
           services, and the resident data in the service enablement database using the web
           services or by setting the service enablement database in the NESP. The web


                                                                                Page 70 of 218
               service for accessing the resident data in the service enablement database could
               be hosted on the ISCA server in the ISCA data center. The other option is to
               replicate the service enablement database into the database server in the EIDAV
               data center as part of the NESP. The NESP could also provide the mechanism to
               call the eID authentication service hosted on the EISDP for performing the
               demographic and biometric authentication for seeding validation.


6.2 Institutional Recommendations

Some of the institutional recommendations related to the operating models and organizational
structure that would be required for the implementation of the EISDF from the technical and
operating perspectives are listed below.


6.2.1 Operating Model


Electronic Identity Authentication Service

The eID authentication service could be used by the service providers across Vietnam. It would
be governed by a highly scalable operating model based on Public-Private Partnership (PPP) to
meet the demands of the service providers today and in the future. Some of the operating model
recommendations for eID Authentication Service are:

   1. The eID authentication service could be a delivered as part of the EISDF to all service
       providers in Vietnam. Hence, it would be managed and owned by a responsible, national-
       level ministry for delivering eID services such as eID authentication to service providers
       and not be responsible for any service entitlement. The responsible ministry could set up
       an agency, EIDAV, for such a purpose.


   2. The responsible ministry would delegate to EIDAV as Managed Identification Service
       Provider (MISP) the responsibility to design and implement the eID authentication service
       and host it in the EIDAV data center as part of the EISDP. EIDAV could hire a solution
       integrator (SI) vendor to implement the service using tender. It could also implement the
       registration process for the eID authentication service on the public portal of EIDAV.


   3. The public or private service providers wishing to utilize eID services such as eID
       authentication to enable its services could sign up as an ISCA and enter into an agreement
       with EIDAV.

                                                                                  Page 71 of 218
   4. The ISCA, in turn, could engage with a public or private ISPA. In order to ensure high
      security of the centralized store of the resident database that is on the EISDP, only a
      limited number of qualified ISPAs could be allowed to connect directly to the servers in
      the centralized EIDAV data centers.


   5. The ISPA could establish secure connectivity to the eID services servers in the EIDAV data
      center to transmit service requests such as eID authentication on behalf of ISCAs and
      receive response back.


   6. EIDAV could provide standards and specifications that the ISPAs have to comply with to
      build and maintain their secure connectivity to the services in the EIDAV data center.


   7. The ISCA could have the option to connect to EIDAV’s servers by itself or through an
      existing ISPA.


   8. Furthermore, the service provider wishing to use eID services such as authentication could
      be given the option to choose to become an ISCA, or it may access eID services through
      an existing ISCA. In the latter case, it could become a sub-ISCA of the existing ISCA which
      it engages.

eKYC Service

Some of the operating model recommendations for eKYC service are described below.

   1. Like the eID authentication service, the eKYC service could be managed and owned by
      EIDAV.


   2. The service provider wishing to utilize the eKYC service to enable its services would sign
      up as an ISCA with access to the eKYC service, and enter into an agreement with EIDAV.


   3. The ISCA, in turn, would engage with the ISPA to route the service request and receive
      response back from the eKYC service hosted in the EIDAV data center through the secure
      network of the ISPA.


   4. The eKYC service could be performed at an agent location using biometric authentication
      as well as remotely using an OTP on a website or mobile connection. As part of the eKYC
      process, the resident would authorize the owner-government agency through eID

                                                                                 Page 72 of 218
       authentication using biometrics/digital certificate/OTP to provide their demographic data
       along with their photograph digitally signed and encrypted to the service provider.


   5. The resident could go to the ISCA and, with the help of an operator or using an Internet-
       connected device, access the application to input data for the eKYC service request. The
       response is received in encrypted XML that is used as the eKYC document by the service
       provider in the service delivery to the citizen.


   6. The resident may keep the eKYC response for later use when requesting service from the
       registered service providers in Vietnam.




Electronic Identity Seeding Service

Some of the operating model recommendations for eID seeding service are described below.

   1. Service providers using eID services in their service delivery process would be responsible
       for seeding the eID/NIN in their service enablement database for unique identification of
       their CBS.


   2. The implementation strategy for NIN/eID seeding in the service enablement database of
       service providers would be a combination of several sub-strategies and no one solution
       may apply to all cases. Therefore, it would be essential that every seeding process is
       thoroughly analyzed and planned before proceeding with actual seeding.


   3. As the prerequisite to eID seeding, service providers could prepare their service
       enablement database by performing data digitization and data centralization on it. If a
       service provider already has its service enablement database digitized and centralized,
       then there is no action required from the eID seeding perspective. For detailed description
       of data digitization and centralization, refer to Annex 4.


   4. Based on data availability and other requirements, the service provider could choose
       between the top-down approach and the organic strategy for NIN seeding in their service
       enablement database. For detailed description of eID seeding strategies, refer to Annex
       4.




                                                                                  Page 73 of 218
   5. In the case of the top-down approach, the service provider could use the offline seeding
       utility or the eID Seeding Platform (eSP) for the NIN seeding in one batch. In the case of
       organic seeding, the service provider could use the eSP for seeders to send the seeding
       request and for the residents to respond; the residents could also come forward
       voluntarily.


   6. The service providers would have to register with EIDAV to use the offline seeding utility
       and register online on EIDAV’s public portal as the seeders and verifiers to use the eSP
       platform.


   7. The service provider could register as the ISCA on the public portal of EIDAV to perform
       the demographic authentication of its CBS profile in its database using the eID
       authentication service to validate the seeding process. In cases where demographic
       authentication fails, the service provider could investigate the reasons for failure. Some
       of the reasons could be:
           a. The NIN was seeded into an incorrect record. This could potentially happen in
              cases of partial or fuzzy match.
           b. The resident updated his/her PID in the Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR)
              due to marriage, change of address, update of incorrect information, etc.
           c. There was an incomplete KYR+ form or incorrect data captured during enrollment
              (e.g., incorrect health insurance card number).


   8. Biometric authentication could be enabled for operator-assisted touch-points where a
       direct update of service delivery database takes place.


   9. The eID seeding services could be designed to address some of the common challenges
       during the seeding process. For common seeding challenges and their resolutions, refer
       to Annex 4.




Mobile ID Service

Mobile ID service could be governed by a highly scalable PPP-based operating model with four
main operating procedures; namely SIM provisioning, certificate activation, usage and
termination. The operating procedures are operated by entities that are defined in the
organizational structure for mobile ID services later in the document. The recommendations on
the operating procedures are defined below,

                                                                                 Page 74 of 218
Figure 6.1: Operating Model for Mobile ID Service – SIM Provisioning/Certificate Activation

1. SIM Provisioning
         a. The resident wishing to use mobile ID service may go to the nearest outlet of a
             mobile operator that is registered with EIDAV as the approved registration
             authority (RA).
         b. The RA could provision the specialized SIMs with SSCD function that has the
             capability to issue a qualified digital certificate/biometrics for authentication and
             signing purposes.
         c. The RA could verify the identity of the resident by his/her NIN and biometrics
             using the eID authentication service. The RA could be registered as the ISCA with
             EIDAV to submit the eID authentication service request to the registered ISPA.
         d. On successful eID verification, the RA would issue the specialized SIM along with
             the secret activation code to the resident in a face-to-face procedure.
         e. The RA would declare the SSCD’s device certificate active for that particular SIM
             and that information is made available for all TSPs.


  2. User Registration/Certificate Activation
         a. The resident using his/her mobile phone would initiate the SIM activation
             application stored on the SIM. The resident would send a request to have the
             qualified certificate activated.
         b. The RA would respond to the request by initiating action on the resident’s mobile
             device to sign the PID. The PID would include the NIN along with other
             demographic details.

                                                                                 Page 75 of 218
      c. The resident would verify the data and sign it by inputting their device certificate
           activation code.
      d. The RA would receive the signed PID and add supplementary data including the
           device certificate, then forward the request for certificate activation to a
           certification authority (CA). The RA also sends the service request to EIDAV via a
           registered ISPA to update the resident’s identity record with the mobile number.
      e. The CA would create and activate a qualified certificate, and make it available to
           all TSPs and EIDAV.
      f.   The resident would be notified of the operation status and given the opportunity
           to change the pin.


3. Usage




                Figure 6.2: Mobile ID Service Usage Operating Model

      a. The resident would use the mobile ID for eID authentication on a secure site,
           e.g., online banking.
      b. The resident would access the secure website of the ISCA. The supported website
           would have the option to click the “Log in with mobile ID” button.
      c. The resident would be prompted to enter his/her NIN, registered mobile number
           and PIN.
      d. The ISCA system would call the EISDF mobile ID web service with the identity
           service request giving the NIN, mobile number and PIN via the ISPA to the TSP.




                                                                             Page 76 of 218
            e. EIDAV’s mobile ID service would validate the mobile number provided with the
                  stored mobile number for the given NIN and forward the service request to the
                  TSP along with the mobile number, verification code and PIN. The service would
                  generate the verification code and send it to the ISCA website.
            f.    The TSP would generate the signature request with the verification code, mobile
                  number and PIN and send it to the resident’s mobile phone.
            g. The resident would check the verification code on his/her mobile phone with the
                  one on the website and sign the request by entering the PIN.
            h. The TSP would receive the signature data and send it to the CA to validate the
                  signature data and the certificate.
            i.    The TSP would forward the response received from the CA to the ISCA via EIDAV
                  and the ISPA.
            j.    On successful authentication, the resident logs into the secure website.


    4. Termination
            a. The resident could stop using the mobile ID service in several ways:
                       i. The resident informs the RA of his/her wish stop using the service.
                      ii. The resident informs the RA of lost/compromised SSCD.
                      iii. The qualified certificate expires.
                      iv. The RA finds out that the user has violated the user-CA agreement, or
                          other laws governing mobile ID service.
            b. In cases of certificate revocation, the RA will inform the CA of certificate
                  revocation. Then the CA immediately revokes the certificate and circulates the
                  updated certificate revocation list (CRL) to all TSPs.
            c. In case of SIM blocking due to loss or SIM damage, the device certificate would
                  be taken out of the list of valid SSCDs available to all TSPs.


6.2.2 Organizational Structure
   The section below provides recommendations on the key roles in the organizational structure
   to operate and manage the EISDF eID services. For detailed description on the roles and
   responsibilities, refer to Annex 4.

   1. Electronic Identity Authentication Service: Key Roles
          a. Electronic Identity Authority of Vietnam. EIDAV could be created with the mandate
                 of generating the eID and providing EISDF-based eID services such as eID
                 authentication to eligible service providers in the public and private sectors. This
                 will enable business functions that require establishing the identity of CBS as well

                                                                                     Page 77 of 218
   as employees. EIDAV could be the overall regulator and overseer of the EISDF eID
   services ecosystem. It could also own and manage, either by itself or through an
   agency, the CRIDS that contains the NIN and the corresponding PID. EIDAV could
   manage the CRIDS and the eID authentication server through an MISP.
b. Managed Identification Service Provider. The MISP could be the entity that offers
   eID services such as authentication on behalf of EIDAV. EIDAV could hire one or
   more MISP depending on the service request volume. EIDAV would have the
   responsibility of implementation and operating the technical architecture of the
   EISDP as the MISP in the pilot phase.
c. Identity Service Provider Agency. The ISPA could be government or private
   agencies that establish secure connectivity with the EIDAV data center in
   compliance with the standards and specifications set by EIDAV to transmit eID
   authentication request on behalf of ISCAs and receive response back from eID
   authentication servers. Only agencies contracted with EIDAV as ISPAs may send
   service requests related to eID authentication; no other entity can directly
   communicate with the identity services. An ISPA would be bound to EIDAV through
   a formal legal contract. The ISPAs could offer their EIDAV-compliant network
   connectivity as a service to one or more ISCA and may transmit the ISCAs’
   authentication requests to the EIDAV authentication server. Possible of ISPAs are:
       i. A government department such as an MIC telecom department could
          become an ISPA and establish a secure EIDAV-compliant leased line
          connectivity to the eID authentication servers; through which several
          ministries/departments in the country could channel their authentication
          requests.
       ii. A telecom carrier such as Viettel Group or VNPT could obtain EIDAV’s
          approval and establish a secure connection with EIDAV and offer ISPA
          services to ISCAs.
      iii. A nationalized bank such as the Bank of Vietnam (BoV) could establish a
          secure EIDAV-compliant connectivity to eID authentication servers and
          offer authentication services and, possibly, value-added services to itself
          and other smaller banks.
d. Identity Service Consumer Agency. The ISCA could be any government or private
   agency that seeks to use eID services such as authentication to enable one or more
   of its services. An ISCA could have the option of connecting to the authentication
   server by itself (in which case it needs to get an approval from EIDAV to become
   an ISPA), or through an existing ISPA for transmitting its service requests. An ISCA


                                                                       Page 78 of 218
     could also send a service request from other entities that are “sub-ISCAs”. The
     ISCA could act as the aggregator offering authentication services to sub-ISCAs and
     offer value-added services such as multi-party authentication, MIS reports and
     authorization to the sub-ISCA. An ISCA would have to enter into a formal contract
     with EIDAV in order to access EISDF eID services. Potential ISCAs could be:
         i. The Vietnam Social Services (VSS) which seeks to authenticate a target
            resident before issuing one of its benefits.
        ii. A bank which seeks to authenticate its customers before allowing them a
            financial transaction such as withdrawal or transfer of funds.
        iii. The administration department of a high-security zone that seeks to
            authenticate individuals seeking entry into the premises.
        iv. A social networking or eCommerce website that seeks to authenticate
            customers or subscribers during the registration process.
e. Sub-ISCA. Any legal entity registered in Vietnam desiring to use the EISDF eID
     services could become an ISCA, or it could access identity service through an
     existing ISCA. In the latter case, it could become a sub-ISCA of its chosen ISCA.
     The sub-ISCA would not have a direct contractual relationship with EIDAV. Only
     the ISCA is contracted to EIDAV and would be responsible for all service requests
     flowing through it, including those originating from its sub-ISCAs. The following
     are some possible sub-ISCA:
         i. A government department at the provincial level could become an ISCA;
            and ministry branches/departments in the region could access the eID
            services as sub-ISCAs.
        ii. A small business like a local bank which does not want to directly engage
            in a formal contract with EIDAV, but still needs to use identity services, may
            choose to become a sub-ISCA of an ISCA.
        iii. Several entities could combine under a single ISCA for business reasons,
            e.g., several hotels could access eID authentication as sub-ISCAs of a hotel
            association that becomes an ISCA.
f.   Authentication Devices. These could be electronic devices that form a critical link
     in the eID authentication service. These devices would collect PID from eID-
     holders, prepare the information for transmission, transmit the packets for
     authentication and receive the results. They could be either operator-assisted or
     self-operated. Examples of eID authentication devices include desktops, laptops,
     kiosks, handheld mobile devices, etc., that are, if required, connected to biometric




                                                                          Page 79 of 218
          devices for capturing fingerprints and iris images. They could be operated by an
          ISCA/sub-ISCA or its agents.
       g. Electronic Identity-holders. A holder of an eID-based identity is any eligible
          individual who has enrolled with and obtained a unique NIN and NID card. In the
          context of eID authentication, eID-holders are usually associated with ISCAs/sub-
          ISCAs as CBS or employees, and in this capacity seek access to ISCA/sub-ISCA
          services. In order for them to gain access, their eID is authenticated using their
          PID in the database. Depending on the authentication type sought by the
          ISCA/sub-ISCA, the eID-holders would provide their demographic and/or
          biometric information.


2. eKYC Service: Key Roles
       a. Electronic Identity Authority of Vietnam. As in the eID authentication service,
          EIDAV could be the overall regulator and overseer of the eKYC service and
          supporting ecosystem. EIDAV could determine the operating and engagement
          model for the eKYC service and define the eligibility criteria for the MISP and ISCAs.
          EIDAV could also determine standards and specifications that could be adhered to
          by all those participating in the eKYC ecosystem (including ISPA, ISCA and sub-
          ISCA).
       b. Managed Identification Service Provider. The MISP could offer eKYC service on
          behalf of EIDAV. The MISP’s main areas of responsibility could include eKYC
          transaction operations (i.e., receive authentication request, execute a match of PID
          received by calling eID authentication service and transmitting the result), network
          operations, data center operations, availability of eKYC service, service-level
          agreement (SLA) with ISCA, if any, and monitoring operations and performance
          metrics.
       c. Identity Service Provider Agency. The eKYC service should only be accessible
          through the secure network of the ISPA.
       d. Identity Service Consumer Agency. The ISCA could be any agency that seeks to use
          eKYC service to enable its services. An ISCA could use eKYC service to enable one
          or more of its services. It could enter into a formal contract with EIDAV in order to
          access EIDAV eKYC service. The ISCA could ensure that the eKYC request
          originating at the service request device is compliant with the standards and
          specifications prescribed by EIDAV and complete before transmitting the request
          to its ISPA. For further details, refer to Annex 4.




                                                                               Page 80 of 218
      e. Sub-ISCA. Any legal entity registered in Vietnam wishing to use eKYC service to
           enable its services could become an ISCA, or access eKYC service through an
           existing ISCA. In the latter case, it becomes a sub-ISCA of the ISCA it partners with.
      f.   Electronic Identity Service Devices. The eID device for eKYC service could be the
           same as that used for eID authentication, and have the capability to capture the
           inputs required for eKYC service. It could be operator-assisted or self-operated.
           Examples of eID service devices include desktops, laptops, kiosks, handheld
           mobile devices, etc., that are, if required, connected to biometric devices for
           capturing fingerprints and/or iris images. These could be operated by an
           ISCA/sub-ISCA or its agents.
      g. Electronic Identity-holders. In the context of eKYC service, eID-holders would
           usually be the CBS or employees associated with ISCAs or sub-ISCAs, and in this
           capacity seek access to ISCAs/sub-ISCA services. In order for them to gain access
           to the services, they need to provide their KYC data for registration in eKYC service.
           It would be the responsibility of eID-holders to provide consent to the
           performance of eKYC service.


3. Mobile ID Service: Key Roles
      a. Registration Authority. The RA would typically be the nationalized mobile operator
           such as Viettel, Mobiphone, Vinaphone, etc., responsible for the provisioning of
           the specialized SIM with SSCD functionality to residents at their service outlets
           across the country. A mobile operator would have to register with EIDAV to become
           an RA. The mobile network operator (MNO) could work with the national ID project
           in the provisioning of specialized SIM.
      b. Trusted Service Provider. The TSP could also be the MNO responsible for
           forwarding the mobile ID service request from EIDAV to the mobile phone of the
           resident over the mobile network. It could also be responsible for sending the
           signed data from the mobile phone to the CA and responding back to EIDAV with
           the authentication response. Mobile operators would have to register with EIDAV
           to become an authorized TSP.
      c. Certification Authority. The CA could be responsible for issuing the certificate; it
           is also responsible for the validation of the certificate and signed data in response
           to the TSP service request. The CA may be competent government entities, such
           as VGCA.




                                                                                Page 81 of 218
         d. Electronic Identification Authority of Vietnam. In the case of mobile ID, EIDAV could
              host the service in its data center and would register and hire all the ecosystem
              entities in various roles for the scalable delivery of the services.
         e. Identity Service Consumer Agency. The ISCA could be any agency that seeks to use
              the mobile ID service to enable its services. An ISCA can use mobile ID to enable
              one or more of its services.
         f.   Identity Service Provider Agency. The ISPA could be an agency that establishes
              secure connectivity with the mobile ID service hosted on the servers in EIDAV data
              center to transmit authentication requests on behalf of ISCAs and receive the
              response.
         g. Mobile Phone Device with Specialized SIM. The mobile phone with specialized SIM
              issued by the RA could initiate the mobile ID service request on the device using
              the application and the private keys stored on the SIM.
         h. Resident-User. The resident-user could be the individual who has registered with
              the RA to get the specialized SIM with SSCD capability and activated digital
              certificate/biometrics along with private key on the SIM.




6.3 Policy Recommendations

  In order to ensure successful implementation of the EISDF in Vietnam, it may be supported
  by national policies to enable the governance structure to provide an auspicious environment.
  Some of the recommendations for the policy interventions are described below.

  1. The GoV could update the relevant policies to enable eKYC response as the valid legal KYC
     document equivalent to the paper-based KYC document for service delivery by the service
     providers.


  2. Service providers in both the government and private sector such as banking, insurance,
     capital markets, telecom, LPG, railways, etc., could update their KYC norms to include the
     NIN/eID and eKYC response as the valid KYC.


  3. The GoV could define a national policy or update the existing one on data and metadata
     standards to include the data and metadata formats of both the demographic and
     biometric data fields of the resident to be stored in the centralized national eID database.
     There could be a national policy for KYR specifications that complies with the data and
     metadata standards.

                                                                                     Page 82 of 218
4. The existing national policy on the adoption of open standards to promote interoperability
   could be updated to include eID data format. It could also include standards for biometric
   data such as fingerprint images, fingerprint minutiae, and iris images.


5. The existing national policy on the ESignature Act (EESA) could be reviewed and updated,
   as needed, to include requirements on the use of digital certificates or biometrics in the
   EISDF as defined in the technical recommendations previously discussed in this chapter.
   As a rule, handwritten and eSignatures could be equivalent in both the public and private
   sectors. The ESA could also state that public service departments could accept digitally
   signed documents. The ESA could ensure that each eSignature uniquely identifies the
   signatory, binds the individual to the signed data, and ensures that the signed data cannot
   be tampered with retrospectively without invalidating the signature itself.


6. The ESA could mandate stringent financial and procedural requirements to ensure that
   Certificate Service Providers (CSPs) and Timestamp Service Providers (TSPs) are set up and
   managed properly to perform their function to the highest possible standard.


7. The existing national policy on IT security could be updated to include the security
   requirements of the eID and the EISDF as defined in the technical and institutional
   recommendations previously discussed in this chapter.


8. The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) could regulate the use of personal data and
   databases containing personal information by public authorities and private entities.
   There could be an independent data protection inspection department outside the
   government; which ensures the requirements of the Act are met and enforces compliance
   if necessary. It will report directly to the apex body within the Prime Minister’s office.
   Requests by third parties (e.g., representatives of authorities) for private data could be
   logged and the logs made available online for the individual on request via the citizen’s
   portal.


9. The use of open standards-based technology in eGovernment implementation could be
   promoted with the national policy on open standards. It would include standard
   specifications for biometric devices, list of approved vendors of biometric devices and
   standard specifications for dedicated leased line for the ISPA, etc.




                                                                                 Page 83 of 218
  10. The GoV could pass an act an Identity Documents A (IDA) to establish national guidelines
     for the creation of the mandatory NIN, NID card and eID for the residents of the country.
     The law would also state that the eID may have the same legal value as that of the NID
     card, and decide the purpose of the card and of the number in terms of proof of
     citizenship. It could state that the deduplicated and processed resident demographic and
     biometric data used for the personalization of the card could also be entered into the
     national population register pursuant to the Population Register Act. There could be a
     legal provision in the form of a decree for transferring the resident data from the NID
     system to EIDAV’s CRIDS for EISDF eID services on a regular basis.


  11. The GoV may expedite the enrollment of residents into the new national ID program and
     delivery of national ID to all the residents. This may help in the faster delivery of the pilot
     of eID as the eID is based on the resident data collected from the national ID program.


6.4 Communication Strategy Recommendations

  The communication strategy could include the steps to be taken to build awareness and
  promote adoption of the framework among the key stakeholders; such as service providers
  in public and private sectors and residents of Vietnam. Some of the recommendations for the
  communication strategy are described below.

  1. EIDAV could set up a public-facing portal for awareness building among the stakeholders
     in the eID ecosystem, and to provide support to the users of the eID authentication
     services by publishing documentations related to technical solutions and updates.


  2. There could be capacity-building programs in the form of online and classroom trainings
     targeted at the residents and officials/operators in the government and private sector
     agencies.


  3. EIDAV could publish a set of technical documentations targeted at the technical
     stakeholders in the eID authentication ecosystem which could include the technical
     decision makers, technical architects and developers within EIDAV, and other service
     providers responsible for the design, development and maintenance of the eID
     authentication system.


  4. EIDAV could also publish a set of technical documentations targeted at the software
     professionals working in the technology domain such as technical decision makers,

                                                                                   Page 84 of 218
       technical architects and developers in the government and private sector service provider
       agencies interested in incorporating eID authentication services into their applications.
       An example of technical documentation would be the eID authentication services API
       specifications.


   5. In order to improve the adoption of the EISDF eID services by providers in the government
       and the private sector, EIDAV could set up the development and testing environment in
       the form of a publicly available URL (e.g., https://auth.eidav.gov.vn) that could be made
       accessible over the Internet and be used by the software developers of service provider
       agencies in the development of related applications.


   6. In order to improve the adoption of the EISDF eID services such as eID authentication,
       EIDAV could provide a reference implementation of an eID authentication client library for
       packaging and encrypting authentication data block in different programming languages.
       A mechanism could be put in place to promote the development of other programming
       language bindings among members of the software programming community for
       submission to EIDAV. Developers may be able to download these libraries along with
       EIDAV public key, all digitally signed by EIDAV for use within their application.


   7. The GoV could set up awareness campaigns among the service providers in the
       government and the private sector to leverage the benefits of the EISDF in their business
       processes.


   8. Awareness campaigns, promotions and incentive programs targeted at early users,
       individual residents and the private sector agencies to improve the adoption of the
       national identity could be planned and set up. The EISDF eID services could be offered
       free of charge to service providers in the pilot phase to promote the adoption of the
       services.


6.5 Pilot Implementation Recommendations

The implementation of the EISDF in Vietnam could be done in two phases: the pilot and the
complete rollout. The pilot implementation could be conducted upon the finalization of the
National ID numbering format. Some of the pilot phase implementation recommendations are
listed below.

   1. Electronic Identity Service Delivery Platform

                                                                                   Page 85 of 218
       a. Formation of EIDAV: The creation of an independent department in the
           government for eID generation and the EISDF eID services delivery and
           maintenance.
       b. Central Resident Identity Data Store process initialization and periodic update.
               i. Instead of recapturing the PID of residents for the CRIDS, it could be
                  recommended to reuse the PID captured and processed for generation of
                  the unique NIN and NID card.
              ii. There may be a legal provision in the form of a decree for transferring the
                  resident data from the NID system to EIDAV’s CRIDS for the implementation
                  of EIDSF eID services.
              iii. The PID to be stored in the CRIDS could include the biometric and
                  demographic data of the resident.
              iv. There could be a periodic transfer of new residents’ data from the NID
                  system to EIDAV as and when new residents are enrolled by the ministry
                  until all the residents have been issued a NIN and the NID card.
               v. It is recommended to have a secure operational model for transferring the
                  updates in the CRIDS and the NID resident database such as address
                  change, etc., on an ongoing basis.
       c. EIDAV    would    set   up   the   EIDAV   data   center   following   the   technical
           recommendations for the EISDP as discussed previously in this chapter.
       d. EIDAV could set up the registration process for ISPAs and ISCAs on their public
           portal. The national telecom operators in Vietnam have the required capabilities
           to set up the dedicated secure connectivity to the National Identification Authority
           of Vietnam (NIDAV) center. The NIDAV could select the Viettel Group and/or the
           VNPT to take up the role of ISPA in the pilot phase.


2. Electronic Identity Authentication Service
       a. EIDAV, as the MISP, would have the responsibility of designing and implementing
           the eID authentication service then host it its data center on the EISDP. It could
           also implement the registration process for eID authentication service on the
           public portal of EIDAV.
       b. EIDAV could hire the SI vendor to implement the service using a tendering process.
       c. The service providers in the government departments and private sector could
           register with EIDAV on the public portal for eID authentication service. On approval
           by EIDAV, the service providers could install the eID authentication service API on
           their service delivery application using their point-of-delivery device following the


                                                                                 Page 86 of 218
            guidelines provided by EIDAV. Then the setting up of the hardware, software,
            process and network would be performed.
       d. EIDAV would to update the IT policies in Vietnam to enable eID authentication
            service as an acceptable means of identity verification by service providers.
       e. In order to promote the adoption of the service, it could be offered free of charge
            to service providers.
       f.   EIDAV could set up awareness campaigns for residents and services providers.
            There could be capacity-building programs in the form of online and classroom
            trainings targeted at the residents and officials/operators in the government and
            the private sector. There could be software development training programs
            targeted at the developer community in the service provider agencies.


3. Electronic Identity Seeding Service
       a. EIDAV could make available the offline seeding utility, the Electronic Seeding
            Platform (eSP), and the registration process on the public portal of EIDAV by
            delegating the operation to the chosen SI vendor selected using the tendering
            process.
       b. The government, along with EIDAV, could select one service provider each from
            the government and the private sector to pilot the implementation of the eID
            seeding service. Public and private entities that may be considered for the pilot
            could be the VSS and the VNPT or Viettel, respectively.
       c. The selected service providers could prepare the service enablement database by
            performing the data digitization and centralization.
       d. The selected service providers could register as ISCAs by following the registration
            process provided by EIDAV on its public portal.
       e. The ISCA could also register for downloading the seeding utility and for requesting
            access to the eSP. It could also provide the option to import the service enablement
            database or provide the web service details at the time of registration.
       f.   The ISCA could implement the strategy chosen for seeding by setting up the
            programs for collecting the data. On completion of the seeding, the ISCA could
            perform the seeding validation using the eSP, the seeding utility, and export the
            updated service enablement database to their server in their data center.


4. Electronic Know-your-customer Service




                                                                                Page 87 of 218
       a. EIDAV have the responsibility to design and implement the eKYC service and host
            it in its data center as part of the EISDP. It could also make available the registration
            process for eKYC service on the public portal of NIDAV.
       b. EIDAV could hire the SI vendor, selected under the tendering process, for
            implementing the eKYC service.
       c. The selected service providers could register for the eKYC service on EIDAV public
            portal. On approval by EIDAV, the service providers could install the eKYC service
            on their application following EIDAV guidelines. At this point, the setting up of
            the hardware, software, process and network may be performed.
       d. EIDAV would update the IT policies in Vietnam to enable the eKYC response as a
            valid legal KYC document equivalent to the paper-based version.
       e. EIDAV could work with the government departments such as the VSS, the Ministry
            of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA), the Ministry of Environment (MoE),
            the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and private sector organizations such as the BoV,
            Viettel, etc., to update their KYC norms to include the NIN and the eKYC response
            as the valid KYC document.
       f.   In order to promote the adoption of the service, it could be offered free of charge
            to the service providers.


5. Mobile Identity Service
       a. EIDAV would have the responsibility to design and implement the mobile ID service
            and host it in the EIDAV data center as part of the EISDP.
       b. EIDAV could delegate the implementation and operation of mobile ID services to
            the national telecom operators such as Viettel and VNPT.
       c. The selected telecom operator could leverage its existing SIM manufacturers to
            build new mobile ID SIMs following the technical specifications provided.
       d. The telecom operator could set up the necessary infrastructure in its outlets for
            SIM provisioning to perform the role of mobile ID RA.
       e. The telecom operator could provide training to residents in user registration and
            activation of their mobile ID and also in using the mobile for eID authentication.
       f.   The telecom operator could implement the process of the provisioning of digital
            certificate by the VGCA. The VGCA could also provision OCSP service for digital
            certificate validation at the time of identity authentication using the mobile ID
            service.
       g. The service provider wishing to use the mobile ID as the mechanism for eID
            authentication would need to update its existing service delivery application to use


                                                                                    Page 88 of 218
     the mobile ID service. The telecom operator could extend support to the service
     provider in installing the mobile ID service into its service delivery application.
h. The service providers could provide online and offline training to their end-
     customers to use the mobile ID for validating their identity.
i.   The mobile operator could set up the necessary technical infrastructure in its data

                                                                           Page 89 of 218
7.0 Budget Estimates

7.1 Estimation Basis

The budget estimate for the design and implementation of the Electronic Identity Service Delivery
Framework (EISDF) includes the budget for the initial pilot project and the subsequent complete
rollout of the framework in the country. The high-level budget estimate for the implementation
of the vision of the framework is based on the information of the Government of Vietnam (GoV)
and the proposed private sector setup. The estimates have been calculated based on the average
investment index estimation method. This method leverages the budget estimates of the
representative typical projects from a large number of similar projects so as to estimate the
typical project investment scale based on which the investments of the project and the planned
total budget estimates are calculated. The budget estimates provided here are for guidance only
and may not necessarily be used for budgeting purposes. It may, however, keep the GoV and
implementation agencies abreast of the possible magnitude of investment required for the design
and implementation of such framework. Further due diligence would be required to arrive at the
accurate estimates based on the implementation details with knowledge of the current setup and
additional capabilities to be added for the implementation of the framework.


7.2 Budget Details

The budget estimates include the design, implementation and operation of the centralized
infrastructure for the Electronic Identity Authority of Vietnam (EIDAV), Identity Service Provider
Agencies (ISPAs) and Identity Service Consumer Agencies (ISCAs). The budget estimates for the
mobile IDs, Registration Authority (RA), and Trusted Service Providers (TSPs) is also provided to
implement the optional mobile ID service. The estimates include the cost of the physical
infrastructure (construction of new buildings, electricity, water, and furniture) and IT
infrastructure (hardware, software, networking equipment). The latter also includes design and
development of software applications, and development of the standards and operational
processes. In addition to the infrastructures, the cost takes in to consideration the salaries of
staff and the capacity-building programs for all the stakeholders in the ecosystem. The operating
cost includes the budget for running and maintaining the infrastructure and institutional setup
for a period of one year for the pilot, and for five years for the complete rollout in the country.

The project could be implemented in two phases. The first phase could be the pilot phase
followed by the complete rollout phase.


                                                                                     Page 90 of 218
7.2.1 Budget Estimates for Pilot Phase without Mobile IDs

The budget estimates for the pilot phase include the setup and implementation of the IT and
institutional infrastructures for the centralized EIDAV, one ISPA and two ISCAs. Each ISCA would
have one service delivery outlet in the urban district of Hanoi. The ISPA selected for the pilot could
be either Viettel or the Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT), and the ISCA could
be Viettel or the VNPT and the Vietnam Social Security (VSS). The RA and TSP could be Viettel or
the VNPT. The resident demographic and biometric data to be kept in EIDAV’s Centralized
Resident Identity Database Store (CRIDS) would be imported from the database of the resident
data captured by the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) for their national identity pilot. It is assumed
that the resident data captured in this national identity pilot going on currently is at least for one
million residents. The breakdown of the capital and operating budget estimates for the pilot
phase is detailed in the table below.

                        Table 1: Breakdown of Pilot Phase Budget Estimates

As shown in the table above, the total investment for the pilot phase is estimated at USD 54.2
million. It includes the capital cost of USD 47.16 million and the operating cost of USD 7.04
million for the first year.

The breakdown of the pilot phase capital budget estimate is described below.

    1. EIDAV IT and Institutional Infrastructures. Budget estimate for the design and
        implementation of the centralized physical, IT and institutional infrastructures is at USD
        38.94 million. It includes the design and implementation of the centralized EIDAV data
        center, the disaster recovery center and the geographical data backup center. The budget
        estimate for each data center includes the setup of the physical building, interiors,

8.0 Annexes




              Page 102 of 218
Annex 1

1.        Types of Identity Tokens

An individual identity may be created and authenticated by providing three types of identity
tokens:

What the user knows. Examples are username, password, PIN, and secret questions and answers.
They may be used for electronic authentication only. They are never used for physical
authentication as, once they are known to another person, they lose their value for identity
verification.

What the user has.		 Examples are paper identity card, health insurance card, access card, ATM
card, and mobile phone. For this type, authentication may be done electronically and/or manually
on the form of the token. For instance, paper identity card and health insurance card may only
be manually authenticated, while ATM card and access card may be electronically authenticated.
These are currently the most common forms of identity token in Vietnam.

Who the user is. Examples are fingerprints, iris patterns, facial photo, body marks, and voice.
For this type, authentication can be both electronic and manual. However, manual authentication
is done mostly on the facial photo that is printed on an identity card.


II.       Service Providers’ Authentication Type Selection Criteria

The authentication type selected by the service provider may be based on the following criteria:

      1. Level and type of risk, and impact on the resident in case of inaccurate authentication at
          the time of service delivery. Type of risk and impact on the resident include inconvenience
          and distress, financial loss, and breach of security and privacy.

      2. Level and type of risk, and impact on the service provider in case of inaccurate
          authentication on the business transaction. Type of risk and impact on the service
          provider include financial loss, business squeeze, breath of security and privacy, and
          threat to national security.

      3. Cost and logistics of implementing a certain type of authentication.          For instance,
          biometrics will require investment in devices and resident presence, while OTP requires
          residents to have a mobile phone.




                                                                                    Page 103 of 218
       4. Volume of authentications based on number of beneficiaries and frequency of
          authentication required. For instance, stronger assurance level may be appropriate for
          KYC purpose of one-time account opening or service issuance compared to a lower
          assurance requirement for frequent transactions such as delivery of services.

   In cases where there is higher risk of identity misuse, multi-factor authentication may be
   considered to eliminate occurrence of such instances.


III.      Supports Self-service and Operator-assisted Service Delivery Scenarios

   Scenario 1: Operator-assisted transaction using the PoS terminal at the designated service
   delivery location

       1. In this scenario, the resident could go to the designated service delivery location (e.g.,
          public or private) to request a service. The resident presents the NIN and the required
          demographic, biometric and digital personal identity data for reading by the terminal
          device of the service provider. In the case of digital certificate or biometrics, the terminal
          device would have the capability to read it from the smart card with the use of a card
          reader or from the mobile ID.
       2. The service operator feeds the resident’s identity data to the eID authentication-enabled
          application software that is installed on the authorized terminal device. In the case of
          mobile ID, the residents would authenticate themselves by providing the PIN on their
          mobile phone.
       3. The software application packages the input parameters, encrypts, and sends them to the
          centralized EISDF eID authentication service over a mobile or broadband network.
       4. EISDF eID authentication service returns with a “yes/no” based on the match of the input
          parameters.
       5. Based on the response from the eID authentication service, service provider conducts the
          transaction accordingly.

   Scenario 2: Self-service transaction using mobile, kiosk, or Internet-connected device

       1. In this scenario, the resident may conduct a self-service transaction using the eID
          authentication service on the mobile or on an Internet-enabled device such as tablet, PC,
          kiosk, laptop, etc.
       2. The resident inputs the transaction data on the mobile/Internet-connected device to
          access the mobile/Internet-enabled service delivery application of the service provider.




                                                                                      Page 104 of 218
      3. The   resident   provides   the   NIN,   the   necessary   demographic     data   or   digital
         certificate/biometrics along with OTP in addition to service provider-specific attributes
         (may be domain specific account number, password, PIN, etc.). In the case of digital
         certificate, the resident may also use the mobile ID supported by EISDF. Biometric data
         such as fingerprints are also possible although not yet common on the mobile or PC.
         However, the EISDF could provide the standard specification for the biometric device (UID
         or otherwise) and circulate the list of approved vendors of such device.
      4. Steps 3, 4, and 5 are the same as in scenario 1 above.

  Scenario 3: Testing environment for Service providers and software developers

      1. Service providers may use the development and testing environment provided by the
         EISDF to build their software application that could use the eID authentication service.
      2. The EISDF could provide a public URL (e.g., https://auth.EIDAV.gov.vn ) where software
         developers may go to access the APIs for eID authentication services.
      3. This would help in checking the installation of the eID software on the service provider
         devices and servers.




IV.      Electronic Identity Seeding Utilities and Platform

  Seeding Utility

  The EISDF could provide the seeding utility to service providers to perform common activities
  including data extraction, consolidation, normalization and matching. The service provider would
  need to register in the system and sign the agreement to use the utility for only the intended
  purposes. Some of the features of this tool may be:

      1. Source Data Extraction. The utility would be able to connect to different data sources to
         pull the relevant Personal Identity Data (PID) from the reference database. It would also
         pull the data from the relevant data tables in the service delivery database of the service
         provider.

      2. Matching and Seeding. The utility would provide the capability in which one or more PID
         equivalent fields (name, date of birth, age, gender) from resident records in the service
         delivery database may be matched with equivalent fields in PID records from the reference
         database. The mapping thus created may be exported to Excel for further review and
         approval by a competent authority appointed by the service provider. The utilities’


                                                                                    Page 105 of 218
       functionality of match and seed would be limited only to the creation of the mapping and
       their export. It is expected that based on mapped data, service providers would create
       custom SQL scripts to update the service delivery database.

   3. Demographic Authentication. In order to verify whether seeding has been done accurately,
       it is essential that the resident records in the service delivery database are authenticated
       demographically. The objective of demographic authentication is to check whether the
       NIN and PID fields are mapped correctly and are in line with the data in the CRIDS. Post
       demographic authentication, the authentication status may be marked as “pass/fail”. In
       the case of “fail”, error code may indicate and explain the reason for authentication failure
       that may be used for investigation purposes. The prerequisite to demographic
       authentication is service provider enrollment in the system to call the eID authentication
       service for demographic authentication.

Centralized eID Seeding Platform

The EISDF could provide the centralized eID Seeding Platform (eSP) as part of the Electronic
Identity Service Delivery Platform (EISDP) which would enable converging various seeding
channels into one central staging area. The eSP would be accessible to operators in various
service delivery organizations for the verification of seeding and inclusion into their service
delivery databases. It would support efficient and seamless seeding of the NIN into the service
provider databases, thereby enabling faster adoption of eID-enabled service delivery in Vietnam.

The seeding requests would go to the eSP from various input channels. A seeding request is a
submission of the NIN and corresponding beneficiary/subscriber/customer identifier (ID) to be
linked to the service delivery system.

The eSP may be published on the public portal of EIDAV and may be accessed by the resident
directly to submit the seeding request. Authorized users from service provider organizations may
have login-based access to submit seeding requests (“seeders”) on behalf of residents.
Authorized users from service provider organizations may have login-based access to validate
seeding requests (“verifiers”). Verifiers may process seeding requests by comparing the PID of the
resident from the CRIDS (made available to eSP through web services) with the PID of the resident
from the scheme beneficiary database (made available on eSP either through a web service or
setup on the eSP database itself by the scheme administrator).

V.      ESignature

 eSignatures are divided into two separate categories — (1) digital signatures and (2) electronic
 signatures, which is distinguished primarily by the presence or absence of Public-Key
 Cryptography (PKC).

 Digital Signatures

 The term digital signature refers to the encryption and decryption technology used as the
 foundation for a variety of security implementations. Based on public and private key
 cryptography, digital signatures are used in secure messaging, public key infrastructure, virtual
 private networks, and electronic signatures.

 Contrary to what the name might suggest, a digital signature alone is not a type of electronic
 signature. Rather, digital signature encryption could be used by electronic signature applications
 to secure the data and verify the authenticity of a signed record. Further, a digital signature alone
 does not capture a person’s intent to sign a document and be legally bound to an agreement or
 contract.

 The digital signature for which the most full-featured and, arguably, the most secure type of e-
 signature relies on Public-key cryptography to authenticate identity. Public-key cryptography
 involves a pair of mathematically related keys:

 •      The "private key," known only by the signer, can be used to sign a message that only the
 corresponding "public key" holder can verify.

 •      The public and private keys are very large, randomly generated prime numbers, and it is
 computationally infeasible to distinguish one from the other. By issuing and managing public and
 private keys, public-key infrastructure (PKI) enables very strong authentication, integrity and
 nonrepudiation.

 •      Because the crypto functions bind mathematically with a hash (a unique representation)
 of the document, any change negates the signature (the hash of the document being the
 document encoded with a one-way hash algorithm).

 Further, because a Certification Authority vouches for the certificate holder, PKI can provide a
 higher level of assurance of signer identity and authentication. The primary risk related to a digital
 signature is the compromise of the private key.




                                                                                     Page 107 of 218
In a PKC-based signature, the encrypted hash could match the message content; otherwise, the
digital signature is void. Thus, a digital signature cannot be copied from one message and applied
to another because it is bound to specific message content — any changes to the message could
invalidate the signature. Because the signature is based on a protected private key known only to
the user, the safety of the key is of critical importance. Figure 1   10is   a graphic representation of
the digital signature process. Table 1 provides an outline of the signing and encryption process.

            Public and Private            participants could acquire one another's public keys
            Keys                          (similar to looking up a number in a telephone book).
                                          Public keys are often stored and retrieved from
                                          directories or are included with a signed e-mail message.
                                         At no time does the private key of either party leave the
                                          owner's possession.

          Sender Uses Hash        A hash function is a one-way algorithm that transforms a
          Function to Create       string of characters into a shorter fixed-length value. The
          Hash or Message          result of this calculation is commonly called the "hash" or
          Digest                   "hash value."


          Message Signed          The sender's private key is then used to encrypt the hash
          With Digital             to produce the digital signature, which is appended to
          Signature                the message.


          Message Sent            This digitally signed message is sent "in the clear" to the
                                   recipient. Once the message has been sent, any further
                                   change to the message contents will result in the digital
                                   signature being corrupted (because any change in the
                                   message will result in hash values no longer matching).


          Message Verified        The recipient generates the hash from the message itself
          Through Matching         using the same one-way hash function.
                                  The encrypted hash that came with the message is
                                   decrypted using the sender's public key, and the results
                                   are compared.
                                  If the two hashes match, the message can be treated as
                                   genuine and authentic. Nonmatching hashes can indicate
                                   impersonation, message alteration or an error in
                                   transmission. In any case, the message is considered
                                   corrupted or a forgery.


          Message Encrypted       To ensure the confidentiality and privacy of the message
          (Optional)               content, the entire message can be encrypted using the
                                   recipient's public key.


          Message Decrypted       If the sender has encrypted the entire message, the
          (If Applicable)          message is returned to clear text through decryption
                                   using the recipient's private key.


          Time Stamping           The digital signature can be "time stamped" to allow the
                                   transaction to be traced in the future or to verify that a
                                   transaction was conducted in a timely fashion.

An electronic signature employs digital technology to bind a signature to an electronic document.
In its most-secure solutions offered by service providers, the signature is bound to the document
in such a way that neither the document nor the signature can be altered without invalidating the
document.

An electronic signature is, like its paper equivalent, a legal concept. According to the U.S
Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, an eSignature is an “electronic sound,
symbol, or process attached to, or associated with, a contract or other record and adopted by a
person with the intent to sign a record.” A digital signature, on the other hand, refers to the
encryption / decryption technology on which an electronic signature solution is built. A digital
signature alone is not a type of electronic signature. Rather, digital signature encryption secures
the data associated with a signed document and helps verify the authenticity of a signed record.
Used alone, it cannot capture a person’s intent to sign a document or be legally bound to an
agreement or contract. Table 2 below details the basics of an eSignature.

            An electronic document,
            transaction or record
            requiring a legal signature



            Intent to Comply              The very process of creating the e-signature is what is
                                          known legally as an "affirmative act," making clear to
            The intent to agree           the signer that the signature is a legal agreement.
            to/comply with the
            content of the document
            or nature of the
            transaction
            Mark or Representation        This signature could clearly identify what is being
                                          signed and be attached in such a way that the signer is
            A mark or representation      associated with the document.
            unique to the signer that
            becomes an integral part      The signature could be generated from information in
            of the document,              the secure, sole possession of the signer or in a way
            transaction or record         that is uniquely bound to the individual.




                                                                                      Page 110 of 218
           Verification                 In the most-secure e-signature applications, verification
                                        is accomplished by matching the eSignature against a
           Verification that the mark   known piece of authentic information.
           or representation is
           indeed that of the signer
           for nonrepudiation and to
           avoid fraud, forgery and
           impersonation




Types of eSignature — Biometric

In a biometrics-based signature, the characteristics of a fingerprint, the iris of an eye, a sound
or the dynamics of a handwritten signature are encoded digitally and then stored and transmitted
by computer to verify identity. These unique human characteristics can be linked to a specific
person's biological information, separating the person scientifically from anyone else. The key
steps in ensuring identity are similar to those for paper signatures. With biometric data, a 100
percent match is not probable. The government or the private sector could determine the
acceptable parameters. If the parameters are too generous, false matches can allow access by
unauthorized persons, and if the parameters are too strict, false negatives will deny legitimate
users. Table 3 shows the authentication process used to verify a fingerprint signature.


                       Table 3. Biometric Authentication for a Fingerprint Signature
           Create Reference        Person's fingerprint is scanned to create reference template
           Template                to be stored in a central database or token, along with other
                                   personal information.
           Store in Database       Reference template is stored in central database or token,
                                   along with other personal information.
           Authenticate Request To authenticate, person places finger on reader. Reader
                                   sends digitized fingerprint (sample) to central database.
           Authentication          Sample is compared with reference template. If it matches —
           Through Matching        within a certain tolerance threshold — the person's identity
                                   is authenticated.




Signature pads or tablets are the end-user interface for some types of signature products. These
portable devices have screens (similar to those on handheld computers) on which the user
physically signs with a stylus or pen. While standard imaging technology permits an image such

                                                                                 Page 111 of 218
as a pen-and-ink signature or document to be scanned and the results stored, signature pads
permit the signature to be captured in a way that permits analysis of additional characteristics,
such as handwriting speed and stylus pressure. For the user, these devices have the advantage
of being similar to a pen-and-ink signature, which improves the acceptance of signing within the
workflow and shows strong intent. The resulting signatures are verified when the stored digitized
image is compared for verification.

Types of eSignature — Neither Digital nor Biometric

Most signatures in the broad electronic signature category or do not exclusively rely on
cryptographic methods. In jurisdictions such as the U.S. and Canada, electronic signature law
allows a wide variety of electronic signature types.

For example, if a government body or a private sector firm issues a customer an ID and password
that are to be used in an electronic transaction, and the resulting records of that transaction
could be signed and stored, then the affirmative act of completing the transaction using the
issued ID and password can be deemed sufficient verification of the customer's identity. When
this type of e-signature is used, it is highly recommended that some notice is displayed to the
user indicating that by clicking on an "Agree," "Save" or "Sign" prompt, the user is acknowledging
the transaction.

Additionally, the signer can be authenticated by requesting that he or she provide some
information based on knowledge that the signer and the recipient share. For example, the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service has successfully used a combination of a tax filer's self-selected PIN and
other data elements to verify the filer's identity.

This type of signature does not guarantee that tampering with the record, will not go undetected.
However, if strong user ID issuance procedures are followed, and administrative controls on the
records database and archival storage procedures are maintained, the government body or the
private sector firm may deem such an approach as "good enough."

Assessment on signatures

For many applications, the implementation of simple electronic signatures will be adequate. For
example, a user ID and password logon could be required to access a document that is classified
as non-confidential. The use of digital signatures based on PKC, while offering more attributes,
may not always be needed. In fact, many organizations choose electronic signatures not for
security but to reduce the paperwork and time that could be required for a conventional paper
transaction.

With PKI, it's virtually impossible for a person to forge a signature because of the public/private-
key relationship. Although the public key is distributed freely to anyone with whom the public-


                                                                                  Page 112 of 218
  key owner wishes to communicate securely, successful fraud could also require access to the
  private key. Because the private key cannot be derived from the public key, gaining access to the
  private key could require social engineering (tricking someone who knows the key into revealing
  it) or hacking (such as gaining access to the workstation that holds the private key) by
  unauthorized persons inside or outside the company.

  PKI-based digital signature techniques do cost more than simpler electronic signature methods.
  The government’s and resident’s needs, not technology, could drive the choice as to which
  method is "best" for a given transaction.




VI.       Client Utility for ESignature

  The resident starts the client utility on his/her computer and selects the document to be signed
  in the application. Using the GoV-issued National Identity Data (NID) card in the ID card reader
  attached to the computer, the resident signs the document selected. The application reads the
  digital signing certificate from the ID card and creates a eSignature using the private key by
  providing the PIN. After the eSignature is created, the validity of the signer’s certificate is obtained
  in the format of Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) response and stored within the signed
  document. The EISDF may provide the OCSP service to validate the eSignature. The client
  application calls the OCSP web service hosted in the EISDP by providing the authentication
  certificate of the resident, and the hash of the eSignature. The hash of the eSignature is received
  back within the OCSP response. The OCSP service acts as the digital eNotary confirming
  signatures created locally with a smart card.

  The EISDF may also provide the option to sign the document using the Internet browser on their
  computer by connecting to the EISDF public portal. Its functions are similar to the client program
  and may be used to generate and verify the eSignature. In addition, it may be used to sign the
  document by a number of people. It allows designating the people whose signatures are needed
  on the document and they can all sign it on the same portal. Every user has a directory of his/her
  documents which no one else sees, but where anyone can send documents to be signed by the
  user.

  The signed document includes within the container: the original documents, the certificate used
  for signing, signing time, place of signature, signer role, and certificate validity information,
  namely, OCSP response and OCSP responder certificate. There is no need for any further external
  information to verify the signature validity.



                                                                                        Page 113 of 218
The service providers can include the functionality of the eSignature into their service delivery
applications using the base and intermediary libraries provided by the framework.

The framework enables long time validity of the eSignature by maintaining the log of the OCSP
responses and changes in the certificate validity.




                                                                                Page 114 of 218
Annex 2: Demographic Data Matching Strategy and Rules

I.       Name Matching Rules

Name Matching. For the name of the resident, there could be a support for “exact” and “partial”
matching strategies. When using “exact” matching strategy, the name is compared for an exact
match with the name stored in the CRIDS. Though comparison is case insensitive, all the words
of the name should be specified in the exact same order as provided by the resident. When using
“partial” matching strategy, the name is compared with that in the CRIDS based on the following
rules:

     1. Words from the name can appear in any order in the “name” attribute. For example, if the
         name is stored as “Pham Dang Nguyen”, then any of the inputs - “Nguyen Pham Dang”,
         “Pham Nguyen Dang”, “Dang Pham Nguyen” or any other combinations – may result in a
         successful match.
     2. Usage of specific titles may be allowed in the “name” attribute. These are ignored for
         matching purposes. Supported titles are “Mr.”, “Mrs.”, “Ms.”, and “Dr.”. No other titles are
         currently supported. For example, if the name is stored as “Pham Nguyen”, then any of
         the inputs – “Dr. Pham Nguyen”, “Ms. Pham Nguyen” or “Mrs. Pham Nguyen” - may result
         in a successful match.
     3. The following special characters, if present in the “name” attribute, are ignored during
         matching:
            a. Period (.)
            b. Comma (,)
            c. Hyphen (-)
            d. Asterisk (*)
            e. Open and close parentheses [ ( ) ]
            f.   Open and close brackets ( [ ] )
            g. Apostrophe (`)
            h. Single quote (’)
            i.   Double quote (”)
            j.   Forward slash (/)
            k. Backward slash (\)
            l.   Hash (#)
            m. Leading, trailing, and two or more contiguous spaces are removed before
                 matching. For example, if a resident’s name is stored as “Pham Nguyen”, then
                 “Nguyen, Pham” may result in a successful match.


                                                                                   Page 115 of 218
           n. Input may not contain any additional words or initials that are not present in the
              database. This may result in an unsuccessful match and authentication failure. For
              example, if the name is stored as “Pham Nguyen”, then, “Pham Dang Nguyen” or
              “Pham Dang” or “Pham D Nguyen” may result in unsuccessful matches as the words
              “Dang” and “D” are not present in the CRIDS database.
           o. When the threshold value for the partial match is other than 100 percent, then
              inputs can have some words omitted, or initials can be used in place of the full
              word. The match is considered successful as long as the input contains a minimum
              number of matching full words as determined by the value of threshold value for
              the partial match. For example, if the name is stored as “Pham Dang Nguyen”, and
              the threshold value is specified as 60 percent. It means that 60 percent of total
              words should match. In the case of “Pham Dang Nguyen”, 60 percent of three
              words is 1.8 that is rounded up to two.

              Thus, any of the following inputs may result in a successful match:
                   i. “Pham Nguyen” matches because it has the minimum two full words
                  ii. “Nguyen, Pham Dang” matches because it has the minimum two full words
                      in any order, and the comma (,) is ignored.
                 iii. “Pham D Nguyen” matches because it has the minimum two full words in
                      any order, and “D” is the initial of “Dang”.

              The following inputs may result in an unsuccessful match:
                   i. “Pham” does not match because the number of words is less than the
                      specified minimum.
                  ii. “Pham D N” does not match since the initials are not counted as full words;
                      hence, the number of matching full words is less than the specified
                      minimum.
                 iii. “Pham S Nguyen” does not match because, while “Pham” and “Nguyen” are
                      matching full words, “S” does not match as the initial of “Dang”.
       4. The matching strategy may support both languages, i.e., English and Vietnamese. The
           name in Vietnamese may be a Unicode string and may use phonetic matching against
           the data stored in the CRIDS.


II.    Address Matching Rules


      1. Address Matching. For the address of the resident, there could be support for both
         “exact” and “partial” matching strategies. There is a “threshold value” defined for


                                                                                Page 116 of 218
   “partial” matching strategy that defines the percentage of full words from the address
   stored in the CRIDS database that should be specified in the input data of the service
   request for the match to be considered successful.
2. Normalization. The address value in the input data for the service request and the
   residents’ address stored in CRIDS are both normalized using the following rules before
   comparison. The following characters/phrases are ignored:
     a. Period (.)
     b. Comma (,)
     c. Hyphen (-)
     d. Asterisk (*)
     e. Open and close parentheses [ ( ) ]
     f.   Open and close brackets ( [ ] )
     g. Apostrophe (`)
     h. Single quote (‘)
     i.   Double quote (“)
     j.   Forward slash (/)
     k. Backward slash (\)
     l.   Hash (#)
     m. Care of labels, such as “C/O”, “S/O”, “D/O”, “W/O”, “H/O”
     n. “No.”
     o. Leading and trailing spaces are trimmed and multiple consecutive spaces are
          replaced with single space.
3. When using “exact” matching strategy, the normalized address attribute of the input
   data is compared for an exact match with the normalized resident’s address.
4. When using “partial” matching strategy, the normalized address attribute is compared
   for a partial match with the normalized resident’s address. Following are the rules of
   partial match:
     a. Words may appear in any order.
     b. Following additional normalizations are applied to both the input data address
          value and the address stored in CRIDS database:
     c. Commonly used words are replaced with their shortened version:
            i.    “apartment” => “apt”
           ii.    “street” => “st”
           iii.   “road” => “rd”
           iv.    “main” => “mn”
            v.    “cross” => “crs”


                                                                         Page 117 of 218
            vi.     “sector” => “sec”
           vii.     “opposite” => “opp”
          viii.     “market” => “mkt”
           ix.      Suffixes typically used with numbers such as “st”, “nd”, “rd”, and “th” are
                    removed. For example, 21st is converted to 21, 44th is converted to 44,
                    etc.
5. When used with threshold value other than 100, some of the words can be omitted in the
   input. Match is considered successful if the minimum numbers of full words that should
   match, as determined by the threshold value, are present in the input. Here is a scenario
   where a partial matching strategy with 60 percent threshold value is applied to the
   following value as resident’s address: c/o Pham Dung Nguyen, Apartment #12, Trong
   Building, Chua Boc street, Quan Dong Da, Hanoi, Vietnam, 560055
       a. This may be the normalized address: Pham dung nguyen apt 12 trong building
          chua boc st quan dong da Hanoi vietnam 560055
       b. These are examples of matching and their result:
                  i. “s/o Pham Dung Nguyen, Trong Building, apt #12, chua boc st, hanoi -
                    560055” may be normalized to “pham dung nguyen trong building apt 12
                    chua boc st hanoi 560055” – which results in a successful match as 12
                    words are matched (more than 11 words which is the rounded up 60
                    percent of the total, 17).
                  ii. “s/o Pham Dung Nguyen, Trong Building Hanoi 560055” may be
                    normalized to “pham dung nguyen trong building hanoi 560055” – which
                    results in an unsuccessful match since only 8 words are matched when a
                    minimum of 11, representing 60 percent, was requested.
6. The matching strategy for address may also support the address both in English and
   Vietnamese, using the phonetic matching.

I.      Detailed Description of Technical Components of EISDP

Public Portal Features

     1. Public Information and Mobile Services. The Electronic Identity Service Delivery Platform
        (EISDP) could provide the common public portal for sharing all public information related
        to Electronic Identity (eID) services accessible over the Internet. The portal could support
        Internet browser on laptops, desktops and mobile devices. The portal could have
        information that is publically available to all users, and some content could require
        registration and authentication. The public portal could provide registration capabilities
        for accessing the protected content on the portal. The portal could also provide
        information related to the registration process for eIdentity Service Provider Agencies
        (ISPAs) and eIdentity Service Consumer Agencies (ISCAs).


     2. Developer Information and Services. The portal could also provide the content for software
        developers to help them develop their EISDP eID services-enabled software applications.
        The developers’ content could include technical user guides, sample codes, blogs,
        discussion groups and a test environment for applications.


     3. The portal could be hosted on the load-balanced web farm on virtualized web servers at
        the centralized Electronic Identity Authority of Vietnam (EIDAV) data center. The portal
        software could have content and user management capabilities and support multi-lingual
        capabilities.


     4. The development environment could include the installation of the eID services such as
        authentication, electronic Know-Your-Customer (eKYC) and mobile ID services as
        stateless web services. The data could be hosted on active-active cluster-based database
        servers with Storage Area Network (SAN).


     5. The public portal and development environment could have failover support from a
        disaster recovery system that is in a geographic location different from that of the data
        center. The system could failover to the disaster recovery site in case of failures. The data
        from the public portal and development environment database could be replicated in an
        asynchronous mode to the backup site.



                                                                                   Page 123 of 218
IT Infrastructure (Hardware & Software)

The EISDP could be the common IT infrastructure and shared services for delivering Electronic
Identity Service Delivery Framework (EISDF) eID services. It may be hosted in the two tier 3 EIDAV
data centers in active-active mode. The detailed deployment architecture is described below.

   1. The EIDAV data centers – namely, production and disaster recovery − could be hosted in
            the active-active mode with failover support for each other.


   2. The data centers could be connected to each other using the fiber optic cable-based dual
            redundant private leased line connectivity. The data centers do not have direct access to
            the public network. It may only be accessed by the registered ISPA using the dual
            redundant private leased line connectivity between ISPA and the two EIDAV data centers.

3. The bandwidth requirements could be computed based on the expected volume of
   transactions from ISCAs.
       a. Approximately     5K    average   bandwidth   is   required   for   each   Application
            Programming Interface (API) call.
       b. Handling about one million transactions per hour requires about 280 transactions
            per second (tps) on average. Considering a 30-40 percent spike, bandwidth for
            about 400 tps needs to be planned for. This turns out to be around 16 Mbps
            (400*5K*8 bits/sec)
       c. The ISPA may start with an 8 Mbps link and expand as the volume increases.


4. The eID services could generally be exposed as stateless web services. It could be hosted
   on the virtualized web farm with clustered virtual web servers. It could run the hypervisor
   with virtual machine manager software on a separate server. It could help to manage the
   provisioning and de-provisioning of virtual machines on the servers. The server
   hypervisor and virtual machine management software suite may be installed to manage
   the overall physical and virtual IT infrastructure for the two data centers. It may also
   implement the failover support using the migration of the virtual machines across the
   physical servers and across the data centers.


5. The eID services business applications such as ISPA and ISCA registrations, management
   and monitoring applications, reporting and Management Information System (MIS)
   applications, analytics applications, intranet portal, and mailing solution could be hosted
   on another virtualized web farm with clustered virtual web servers.


6. Both web farms could be hosted in a secure zone of the network infrastructure protected
   by firewall, and the separate isolated network with the redundant switches to prevent any
   malicious access outside of the private network.


7. The data could be stored on the servers and storage devices in the data zone that may be
   separated from the secure zone using the firewall. The data storage system may include
   the cluster-based database server with SAN storage connected to the database servers in
   the active-active mode. The SAN storage may be connected to the database server using
   the redundant storage switches over the one gigabit fiber optic cable. The storage capacity
   of the SAN storage media may be based on the expected volume of transactions from
   ISCAs.


                                                                               Page 125 of 218
       a. Approximately about 5KB of data is used for storage of one transaction.
       b. For 10 million transactions per day, the SAN storage may require 50 GB of storage
            size.
       c. If online data storage of one month of is required, then 1.5 TB of online storage is
            required on the SAN storage beyond which it could be moved to tape.
       d. Approximately, the size of national ID data for one resident is 5 MB. This includes
            the demographic and biometric data. The biometric data may include 10
            fingerprints, photograph, and 2 iris scans. The total size needed to store data of
            91 million residents of Vietnam growing at a rate of 10 percent could
            approximately be 500 TB (100 million x 5 MB) by 2015.
       e. The total SAN storage capacity for the ID data of all Vietnam residents and one
            month of transaction data could be approximately 500 TB.
       f.   The total cost of the 15K RPM SAS disk could be USD 800,000 − based on the cost
            of USD 1,600 per one TB.


8. The SAN traffic could use one Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) in the data zone for data transfers
   between the web servers in the secure zone and database clusters within the data zone.
   It could also be used for SAN traffic between the storage media and the database cluster
   servers. The network architecture may include cabling, network cards, aggregation layer
   switch, and Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches. The capital cost may include core networking
   switches, cabling, network adapter card, aggregation layer switches and ToR switch costs.
   The operational cost could include power usage and cooling, electronics and underlying
   infrastructure updates, projected growth, management and risk factors costs.


9. The disaster recovery center could have the same configuration and capabilities as that of
   the production data center and could operate in the active-active mode.


10. The EISDF could also provide a public portal that could be accessible over the Internet.
   The public portal, apart from providing information-related Identity services to the
   individual residents and organizations, could also provide information targeted at the
   software developers who may want to design their own eID-based applications. The public
   portal could also expose the development environment for testing applications. The
   technical deployment architecture for the public portal and the development environment
   is described below.




                                                                             Page 126 of 218
Figure 8.2: Technical Deployment Architecture for the Development Environment and the Public
                                            Portal




   11. The public portal and the development environment could be hosted in EIDAV production
      data center with failover support from the EIDAV disaster recovery center. They could have
      a fault tolerance and load-balanced solution across both centers.


   12. The public portal and development environment servers could be accessible over the
      Internet and could be completely isolated from the servers and the network of the secure
      and data zones in the De-Militarized Zone (DMZ). Their servers could be hosted on a
      different segment of the network completely separated from the servers in the secure and
      the data zones.


   13. The public portal could be hosted on the virtualized web farm on virtual machines hosted
      on two clustered physical web servers.



                                                                               Page 127 of 218
   14. The development environment could expose the identity functions as stateless web
       services on the virtualized web farm on virtual machines hosted for clustered physical
       web servers.


   15. The management server could run the virtual machine manager software. It could help to
       manage the provisioning and de-provisioning of the hypervisor and virtual machines on
       the servers. The server hypervisor and virtual machine management software suite could
       be installed to manage the overall physical and virtual IT infrastructure for the two data
       centers. It could also implement the failover support using the migration of the virtual
       machines across the physical servers and across the data centers.


   16. Both web farms could be hosted in the DMZ and could be made accessible over the
       Internet.


   17. The development environment database and the documents in the content management
       server may be hosted in the secure data zone separated from the DMZ by firewall.


   18. The sample identity database for the development environment could be hosted on the
       clustered server connected to the SAN using the latter’s dual switches over the fiber cable-
       based Ethernet network.


   19. The storage capacity of the SAN could be approximately 15 TB.



Physical Infrastructure

The EISDF could include the implementation of the physical infrastructure such as the data centers
at various locations based on the topology and implementation requirements for the EISDF. The
figure below describes the topology of the physical infrastructure to be established for the
implementation of the EISDF.




                                                                                 Page 128 of 218
                      Figure 8.3: EISDF Physical Infrastructure Topology

EIDAV Data Center Features

   1. The EISDP could be hosted at the EIDAV data center. All EISDF identity functions could be
      hosted at this data center and the services could be used by the mission-critical
      applications of government and private sector organizations; therefore, this data center
      could be designated critical infrastructure.


   2. The data center could be designed as a tier 3 data center with 99.982 percent up time.
      The   design   could   include   building   architecture,   facility   topology,   engineering
      infrastructure and technology infrastructure.    The facility topology could include space
      planning. The engineering infrastructure could address mechanical systems involved in
      the maintenance of the interior environment of a data center such as Heating, Ventilation,
      and Air Conditioning (HVAC). It could also include electrical infrastructure such as utility
      service, distribution, switching, and bypass from power sources, Uninterrupted Power



                                                                                   Page 129 of 218
       Sources (UPS), etc. The electrical system design could adhere to the Power Usage
       Effectiveness (PUE) requirements and energy standards.


   3. The data center building could be constructed in an area of 1,000 square meters. The
       building could have server room, central control room, network management center, UPS
       distribution room, power distribution and management room, fire control room,
       conference and display room, etc.

EIDAV Disaster Recovery Center Features

   1. The disaster recovery center could be built in a different geographical location such as a
       different city in a different seismic zone from the EIDAV data center. It could provide the
       failover support for the identity services, applications and the IT infrastructure of the
       EIDAV data center. It could work in the active-active mode and could host the identity
       services and applications to provide load balancing and fault tolerance solution to the
       EIDAV data center in case of failures.


   2. The building size may be the same as the EIDAV data center’s 1,000 square meters. The
       building specifications could also be the same with respect to mechanical, electrical and
       telecommunication infrastructure designs.


   3. The network between the two data centers could be the dual redundant private leased line
       connectivity.

NID System Data Center Features

   1. Thedata center could be the same as that which hosts the national identity database.


   2. The National Identity Data (NID) could be used to populate the EIDAV database. The data
       could be transferred using a highly secure database replication mechanism.


   3. There could be a dual redundant dedicated private leased line setup between the NID
       system's data center and the two EIDAV data centers.


Safety and Security System

The EISDP could provide the common security services that could be used by the services hosted
on the platform. They are discussed below.


                                                                                 Page 130 of 218
   1. The end-to-end network security could be implemented using the standard network
       practices such as usage of encrypted channel, usage of digital certificates, IP filtering,
       authentication of systems and devices, network protection through firewalls and
       Network-based Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS), auditing, etc.


   2. Multiple levels of network security through the creation of DMZ, application and data
       zones, and protecting all these zones using multiple firewalls, NIPS, and strong access
       control and audit schemes.


   3. The servers hosting the services could be exposed only to authorized service providers
       through secure private connections using leased line to ensure multiple end-points exist
       to provide service in an always-available mode.


   4. The physical security infrastructure could have multiple levels of security system for
       authorized personnel entry such as biometric-based access, among others.


Electronic Identity Authentication Service

The eID authentication may be done using demographic data and/or biometric data and/or One-
Time Password (OTP)/digital certificate. There could be several ways for residents to be
authenticated and they are discussed below.

   1. The eID authentication functions may be exposed as stateless web service over Hyper-
       text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). The use of open data format in Extensible Markup
       Language (XML) and widely used protocol such as Hyper-text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
       may enable easy adoption and deployment of eID authentication. The eID authentication
       may be exposed as formatted Uniform Resource Locator (URL) with input data sent to this
       URL as an XML document using content-type application/XML or text/XML. The
       corresponding response from the service may also be in XML format.


   2. The eID authentication functions could be exposed in the form of APIs that could be used
       by the service providers to incorporate the eID authentication service types and features
       in their service delivery application.




   3. The EISDP could maintain an updated version of the residents’ eID information, i.e., the
       National Identity Number (NIN) + demographic and biometric data, in the Centralized


                                                                                Page 131 of 218
   Resident Identity Data Store (CRIDS). The eID authentication services could be hosted on
   the eID authentication server; and the CRIDS, on a separate database server. The two
   servers could be hosted in the highly secure EIDAV data center.


4. In order to ensure a highly scalable and fault-tolerant solution that meets the response
   time Service-level Agreements (SLAs), the eID authentication services and the CRIDS could
   be hosted on load-balanced and cluster-based set of servers. The eID authentication
   services, along with the CRIDS, could be hosted on a secure zone and exposed only to
   authorized service providers through private connections using leased line to ensure
   multiple end-points exist to provide service in an always-available mode.


5. To support a strong end-to-end security and avoid request tampering and man-in-the-
   middle attacks, it is essential that data encryption take place at the time of data capture
   from the device. For security reasons resident data collected for eID authentication may
   not be stored in the devices or log files. It is also essential for ISCAs and ISPAs to maintain
   audit records for all the authentication request metadata along with the response.


6. The eID database in the CRIDS may be populated and updated on a regular basis using a
   centralized national-level identity creation process. Instead of recreating this process, the
   EISDP could reuse the resident data collected by the GoV in issuing the National Identity
   Data (NID) card and the NIN.


7. Given that the NID card and NIN is now being piloted by the MPS at the national level,
   there could be a single process for identity creation and verification. Hence the problem
   with multiple identities for the same resident could be solved. The NID card could be used
   as the centrally issued national identity token to identify the resident uniquely, while the
   NIN could be used as the unique identifier for the eID of the resident in the envisioned
   EISDF.


8. The eID authentication function could take the NIN along with the eID-holder’s Personal
   Identity Data (PID) as the input which in turn submits the data to the CRIDS for matching,
   following which the CRIDS verifies the correctness of the data provided on the basis of the
   match with the eID-holder’s identity information available with it. The service may
   respond with a “yes/no” response to either confirm the proof of identity or verify the
   information provided by the resident.




                                                                                Page 132 of 218
9. In all forms of eID authentication, the NIN could be submitted along with the
   single/multiple authentication factors so that the result is reduced to a 1:1 match.


10. The authentication function could search and select the residents’ information record in
   the CRIDS using the NIN; thereafter the demographic/biometric inputs are matched
   against the stored data that was provided by the resident during the enrollment/update
   process.


11. The implementation of demographic authentication type may include the matching of the
   following basic demographic attributes:
       o     Name in English and Vietnamese
       o     Address
       o     Gender
       o     Date of birth (full date or just the year)
       o     Age (verifying if a resident is above/below a given age)
       o     Phone (verified mobile number of the resident)
       o     Email (verified email address of the resident)


12. The demographic data matching features could be implemented based on the following
   design.
       o     Name Matching. This may allow verification of the residents’ name against their
             record stored in the CRIDS. The name-matching feature may implement various
             strategies that could be an exact match or a partial match with configurable match
             tolerance levels so that based on the application needs (i.e., having a strict match
             against a slightly loose flexible match), different strategies can be used. For
             example, while a bank application may choose a partial matching strategy, a
             passport/visa application may choose an exact matching one since it requires a
             resident’s actual full name (as found in the CRIDS). Another example: a resident
             with NIN 123443211234 and whose name in the CRIDS is “Kim Pham Nguyen”
             wants to open a bank account. The banking application does a demographic
             authentication using the eKYC process where the application may choose not to
             require an exact full name matching, but instead allows a partial name matching.
             If the application uses partial matching strategy and prescribes a match value (or
             threshold) of 50 − meaning 50 percent or more of full words match those in the
             CRIDS – and the latter is obtained, then the customer account may be created. The
             rules for name matching are described in detail in Annex 2.


                                                                                Page 133 of 218
o   Date of Birth Matching. This may allow complete date of birth or just the year.
o   Age Matching. Some citizen benefits offered by the government may have age
    requirements. This feature may compare the age of the individual stored in CRIDS
    with the age provided at the time of service delivery.
o   Mobile and Email Matching. This feature may compare the mobile number and
    email address stored in the CRIDS with those provided by the individual at the time
    of the service delivery.
o   Address Matching. Some services such as banking, communication, and
    government welfare in Vietnam depend on address verification to complete the
    initial transaction and initiate the KYC process. Currently, verifications are done
    through paper-based documents that are also the basis of transaction trail
    preservation in the fulfillment of regulatory requirements. Address matching may
    be done online by verifying the address against the CRIDS data. The common
    address structure defined by EIDAV with the help of relevant ministries,
    departments, and other agencies may be used for storing and matching urban and
    rural addresses in electronic format. Address matching at this level may support
    the following.
        i. Structured address matching allows fields such as village/city, commune,
           district, province, zip code, etc., to be matched individually or in
           combination. This feature could enable address verification by the service
           provider applications and could give the option to validate the address
           using the eID standard address structure in full or in part. The proposed
           standard address structure is defined in Annex 3. For example, while
           issuing a SIM, the telecom operator application may capture the address
           and simply verify the province and district or zip code to ensure that the
           resident belongs to a particular telecom circle. To enter data in the
           application faster, the NID card could contain a 2-D barcode or Quick
           Response Code (QR code) written in XML format that can be read with a
           standard    web/mobile     camera.   Service      provider   applications   are
           encouraged to scan the 2-D barcode on the NID card so that the address
           field is populated in a structured fashion. If an application does not scan
           barcodes, but needs to have the address data manually entered from the
           NID card as a single string, then the unstructured address-matching
           scheme may be used. The detailed matching strategy for unstructured
           address is defined in Annex 2. The structured address may contain the
           following fields that can be verified individually or in combination:


                                                                         Page 134 of 218
                          Fields that are free flow (as provided by the resident)
                                  Care of person name
                                  House identifier (single string containing house, apartment,
                                   or building number, name, etc.)
                                  Street Identifier (single string containing street number,
                                   name)
                                  Landmark details
                                  Locality name and details
                          Fields that are based on codified master data
                                  Village/town/city name
                                  Region name
                                  Province name
                                  District name
                                  Commune name
                                  Zip code
                                  Post office name
               ii. Unstructured address matching is used when the service provider
                   application captures the address manually from the NID card or from the
                   information provided by the resident. This allows an address to be
                   captured as a single string and be matched against the address in the
                   CRIDS. Although this option is easy for verifying existing or manually
                   entered data, it requires matching without strict order and without all parts
                   of the full address being there. For this reason, eID authentication may
                   allow partial matching strategy during address matching and applications
                   may be allowed to choose the match tolerance level based on their needs.
                   In general, while structured matching provides greater accuracy, the
                   unstructured kind allows flexibility.


13. Biometric authentication could allow service provider applications to verify if the resident
   is “who he/she claims to be”. Several applications require physical, in-person verification.
   Biometric authentication could have the following features:
       o   Fingerprint matching.     This may allow one of multiple fingers to be used for
           matching depending on the needs of the application. Use of multiple fingers allows
           better fusion strategy on the authentication server for greater accuracy.
           Authentication using fingerprints could either be Fingerprint Minutiae Recognition




                                                                               Page 135 of 218
              (FMR) or Fingerprint Image Recognition (FIR). While applications for FMR could
              operate on low bandwidth network, those for FIR could require higher bandwidth.
          o   Iris matching. In general, iris matching is more accurate than fingerprint matching.
              Iris matching relies on Iris Image Recognition (IIR).


   14. The biometric data captured as input data may comply with open standards. FMR could
       comply with ISO 19794-2 finger minutiae format with no proprietary extensions allowed.
       FIR could comply with ISO 19794-4 image format that could contain a compressed or
       uncompressed image, of type PNG, WSQ, or jpeg2000. IIR could comply with ISO 19794-
       6 image format that could be of type png, or jpeg2000.


   15. In order to improve accuracy and reduce the number of matches, the authentication
       request could contain the biometric “position hint” for each biometric template. Position
       hint is used on the server to optimize the match. The valid position hint values are
       LEFT_IRIS, RIGHT_IRIS, LEFT_INDEX, LEFT_LITTLE, LEFT_MIDDLE, LEFT_RING, LEFT_THUMB,
       RIGHT_INDEX, RIGHT_LITTLE, RIGHT_MIDDLE, RIGHT_RING, and RIGHT_THUMB.

ISPA Data Center Features

   1. The Identity Service Provider Agency (ISPA) may be a government or private sector entity.
       The ISPAs offer their network connectivity to Identity Service Consumer Agencies (ISCAs)
       and transmit latter’s identity service requests to the EISDP. Only agencies contracted with
       the EISDF as ISPAs may send identity service requests to the EIDAV data center. The ISPA
       registration process, as well as the detailed technical guidelines for setting up and
       operating an ISPA date center, could be published on the EISDF public portal.


   2. The ISPAs could setup dual redundant and dedicated private leased line connectivity
       between its data center and the EIDAV data center. An ISPA data center could be a critical
       infrastructure in the delivery of the identity services; hence, its design could include a
       disaster recovery solution with a remote data backup support. The ISPAs could setup their
       data center with the capability to extend assistance to the ISCAs. The technical
       deployment architecture for that data center is described in Figure 8.4.




                                                                                  Page 136 of 218
          Figure 8.4: Technical Deployment Architecture for ISPA Data Center

3. The bandwidth requirements for the ISPA data center may be computed based on the
   expected volume of transactions from ISCAs. Approximately 5K bandwidth is required
   for each API call. Further, handling about one million transactions per hour could require
   280 Transactions Per Second (TPS) on average. Considering a 30-40 percent spike, the
   bandwidth for about 400 TPS could have to be planned for. This turns out to be around
   16 Mbps (400x5Kx8 bits/sec). Based on the above estimates, the ISPA could start with
   an eight Mbps link and expand as volume increases.


4. An ISPA could provide a pair of routers to the EIDAV data center for terminating leased
   line. Network devices such as routers and switches may be installed to enable connectivity

                                                                            Page 137 of 218
       between the ISCA and ISPA data centers. An ISPA could deploy at least two servers in the
       active-active mode for hosting in its data center. The servers may be clustered and
       virtualized with dual quad-core blade/rack servers with 64 GigaByte (GB) Random Access
       Memory (RAM).


   5. A firewall server could be deployed for securing the network between ISCA and ISPA, and
       between ISPA and EIDAV. In addition to the firewall, an ISPA could deploy network
       intrusion detection and prevention systems as well as anti-virus and anti-malware
       systems to ensure protection against attacks.


   6. To prevent single-point failure of the audit database, two database servers in high
       availability active-active clustered mode could be deployed. The SAN storage may be
       connected to the database servers using switches and a fiber optic-based network.


   7. Six months of audit data could be maintained by the ISPA. Considering an audit data size
       of 5K per transaction, ten million transactions per day could require the ISPA to have 50
       GB a day, or 1.5 TB a month. Beyond one month, data could be moved to a backup
       storage. In order to ensure high availability of the data, the audit transaction data could
       also be backed up at a remote site using asynchronous replication.


   8. The ISPA may setup separate servers: one for MIS reporting and billing, and another for
       management and monitoring of the virtualization, network, servers, database, backup,
       replication and applications. The server class operating system and the hypervisor could
       be deployed on all physical servers in the data center.


   9. The host Virtual Machine (VM) and guest VM could be set up using the VM Manager
       deployment on the management server. The ISPA server software may be deployed on
       the VMs. The database software could be installed on the database servers, while any
       Enterprise Monitoring Software (EMS) could be deployed to effectively oversee the
       production system.

ISCA Data Center Features

   1. The Identity Service Consumer Agency may be a government or private sector entity that
       registers with the EISDF to avail of services in the identification and authentication of its
       clients. The ISCA identity service requests could be coursed through an ISPA, sole direct
       channel to EIDAV.

                                                                                  Page 138 of 218
2. The ISCA registration process, as well as the detailed technical guidelines for setting up
   and operating an ISCA data center, could be published on the EISDF public portal. The
   ISCA could provide itself a disaster recovery solution with remote data back up support
   as prescribed by the EISDF guidelines for ISCA data center.


3. The ISCA could set up network connectivity to be able to send request to and receive
   response from its designated ISPA. It could be recommended that the ISCA have a private
   leased line; however, it could be allowed to use existing broadband or GPRS Internet
   connectivity.


4. The ISCA could develop its own service delivery application that could integrate the
   identity service API calls. The technical guidelines provided by EISDF could be followed to
   establish a secure and fail-proof delivery of services.


5. The ISCA could host its own web-based service delivery applications in their data center
   and its client-based application on the PoS terminal that is integrated into the EISDF.
   Requests could be sent from the PoS terminal to the ISCA data center that could then
   forward them to the ISPA via a secure network.




                                                                             Page 139 of 218
      Figure 8.5: Technical Deployment Architecture for ISCA Data Center and PoS



6. Depending on business requirements, different identity services such eKYC, mobile ID,
   etc., may be employed. The business establishment could use demographic, biometric, or
   a combination of the two types of authentication.


7. The PoS software may be a centralized web-based or rich client-based application. The
   PoS   terminal   could   be   equipped   with   EIDAV-compliant   biometric   devices   for
   fingerprinting, iris scanning, and facial photography. The data captured could then
   conform to data standards as defined by EIDAV.




                                                                            Page 140 of 218
8. The PoS application could package the demographic and biometric data following EIDAV’s
   technical guidelines for eID authentication. The package could include data encryption
   using symmetric key and, in addition, the private key of the ISCA as assigned by EIDAV.
   The data packaged may be transmitted over the network between the PoS terminal and
   the ISCA data center.


9. The ISCA data center could secure the incoming traffic from PoS terminals using firewall,
   intrusion detection, anti-virus, and anti-malware systems. It may be hosted on a separate
   server. It may also host the hardware security module for private key management.


10. The ISCA server application receives the incoming encrypted data, processes it and
   forwards the validated data packages to the ISPA. The ISCA server application could be
   hosted on the ISCA servers that are two virtualized and clustered servers in active-active
   mode. The process of virtualization could be handled by the management server that is
   hosted separately.


11. The MIS capabilities could be hosted in the ISCA data center for internal and external
   reporting and data analysis.


12. Two database servers in high availability active-active clustered mode could be deployed
   for the audit database to prevent single point of failure.


13. The SAN storage could be connected to the database servers using SAN switches and fiber
   optic-based network. Six months’ worth of audit data could be maintained by the ISCA.
   Considering 5K audit size per transaction and one million transactions per day, the ISPA
   could require five GB of storage size daily. For one month, 150 GB of storage could be
   needed; beyond one month, data could be moved to the backup storage.


14. The SAN storage data could be backed up in-site and off-site using asynchronous
   replication.


15. Monitoring software to effectively oversee production system could be deployed. Any EMS
   may be used.




                                                                            Page 141 of 218
16. The ISCAs could be assigned a unique alphanumeric code by EIDAV at the time of the
   registration to uniquely identify the ISCA. The ISCA could send its unique ISCA code as
   part of service request input parameters to identify itself to EIDAV as the registered user
   of the eID authentication service.


17. The ISCAs could automatically validate the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate and
   ensure it is validated against the revocation list online.


18. The ISPA may host a server in its data center that could send the service request from the
   ISCAs to the authentication server in EIDAV data center. The ISPA server could add one of
   its valid license keys to the service request package from the ISCAs. The authentication
   server may accept the request only from valid ISPAs and only from their registered static
   IP addresses coming through a secure private network.


19. EIDAV could define a standard XML data format for inputting authentication service
   requests. The format may enable the storing of both the demographic and biometric data.
   The demographic data in the data fields could comply with the Know Your Residence (KYR)
   specifications and could support data capture in both English and Vietnamese. The format
   could support the provision for defining the language for the demographic data for the
   service request.


20. The audit trail could be stored and maintained by ISCAs, ISPAs and EIDAV on their servers;
   each service request and response in XML documents could be kept for a defined period
   of time to allow for issue resolution, audits and business intelligence.




21. Since the technical architecture is based on stateless protocol, there could be a unique
   Transaction Identifier (Transaction ID) attached to every service request and response in
   order to track the proceedings in the full round trip across the various systems. It is highly
   recommended that ISCAs use this attribute for correlating requests with responses for
   auditing and verification.


22. License Key. Each ISCA could be assigned a valid license key by EIDAV that could be used
   in the authentication process. The license key could be a unique alphanumeric string of
   length up to 64 characters, and could have expiry built into it. The administration portal




                                                                               Page 142 of 218
           of EIDAV could provide a self-service mechanism for the ISCA administrator to generate
           a new license key and renew before expiry.


      23. Session Key. The session key is single-use symmetric key that may be employed for
           encrypting all request and response messages in one communication session. The session
           key, possibly a 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), could be generated by the
           ISCA using encryption facilitated by the public key of EIDAV digital certificate or
           biometrics. It is further encoded using the base-64 encoding to enable transmission over
           the HTTPS. The encoded and encrypted session key may be added to the XML document
           sent as the input data in the service request. The encryption of the key could ensure that
           it is known only to the ISCA involved and EIDAV − and is not captured by the man-in-the-
           middle attacks on the wire.


      24. The PID captured on a device is encrypted on the capture device itself for security reasons.
           The PID, which may include both binary biometric and demographic textual data, could
           be further encoded to stream over the HTTPS protocol that is designed to deal with the
           textual data. The authentication services may provide both options of encoding the binary
           and textual data into either the base-64 encoding11 to transfer the binary data over media
           that is designed to deal with textual data, or in binary format based on Protocol Buffers
           standard12. The base-64 encoding of the PID and further packaging of the input data with
           enveloping XML may be done on the device or the ISCA server depending on ISCA needs.
           Device capability, protocol between devices and the ISCA server, and data format used
           between devices and the ISCA server, etc., could be taken into consideration when making
           the choice.


      25. The authentication service design may be extensible and support different tokens such
           as mobile phone, Near Field Communication (NFC) token, smart card, etc., today and in
           the future. This may be useful in adding second factor authentication (“what resident has”)
           for a self-service transaction by the resident. EIDAV could support the new national ID
           card, mobile ID, registered mobile phone, and resident email ID as token types.

                                                                                     Page 143 of 218
      26. The ISCA could work with the Telco operator to obtain the mobile number of the mobile
          device from which a service request is being made in order to ensure that the request is
          originating from the registered mobile number of the resident.


      27. Each authentication request may capture the token type and value of the token used for
          initiating the service request.


      28. Tampering of Personal Identity Data. In ensure that the PID is not tampered with during
          transport from device to authentication server, the former may compute the SHA-256
          hash of the PID XML string before sending. The hash value computed could be added to
          the XML document that is sent as the input data to the service request. Also, when the
          authentication server receives the request XML document, it may re-compute the hash of
          the PID and compare it with the hash value received in the service request. If the values
          do not match, it rejects the authentication request with an error code stating the PID has
          been tampered with.


      29. Ensure message integrity and prevent non-repudiation. ESignature could be used to
          ensure integrity of the message during transmission and prevent non-repudiation of the
          source of the service request. The service request XML document may be digitally signed
          using the XML eSignature of the ISCA or ISPA, depending on which agency creates the final
          request XML document. By signing the XML document, it is certified that the message
          security and integrity between servers are intact and that the request was indeed sent by
          the signer.


      30. The eSignature could be procured by the ISCA and the ISPA from the valid certification
          authority as per the ESignature Act13. The eSignature may be a class II or class III
          certificate. The digital certificate may include two parts: X.509 certificate representing the
          public key, and the private key that is used for digital signing. The private key could be
          stored securely and the certificate owner could have the responsibility of ensuring that it
          is not compromised. The EIDAV authentication server could check to ensure that the
          certificate belongs to the ISCA or the ISPA and that it had been issued by the valid
          certification authority. Hence, it is mandatory that “O” attribute of “Subject” in the X.509
          certificate does match the name of the agency.

                                                                                            Page 144 of 218
      31. There could be a capability to timestamp the capture of authentication input on a device.
          The format of the timestamp could be “YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss” and may be derived
          from the ISO 8601. Time zone may not be specified and is automatically defaulted to ICT
          (UTC +7.00). The timestamp plays a critical role; hence, it is recommended that devices
          are time-synchronized with a time server.


      32. The ISCA and ISPA servers could support buffering of authentication requests and could
          send requests to the authentication server to support occasional lack of network
          connectivity on the field. The maximum time that requests may be buffered (queued)
          could be defined by the National IT Security and the National Identity Service Delivery
          Framework (NISDF) IT Operation policy. All requests with timestamp value older than the
          prescribed limit could be rejected.


      33. As per EIDAV’s security policy, if the number of failed attempts crosses the upper limit,
          the resident record in the CRIDS may be put on hold. The upper limit may be dynamically
          computed based on various heuristics and it may not be a static number.


      34. The response from authentication service is an XML document. For privacy reasons, it
          does not return any personal data of the resident and responds only with “yes/no”.


      35. The authentication service could provide a mechanism to validate the authenticity of the
          response for non-repudiation purposes. In order to enable verification and audit, the
          authentication response could be digitally signed by EIDAV and the signature could be
          part of the response. The signature could be verified using the EIDAV public key and the
          signature could comply with the W3C XML signature standard14. The ISCAs could preserve
          the authentication response for each request that originates from their server for non-
          repudiation purposes.


      36. The authentication response could provide a mechanism to co-relate the response with
          the request by passing the same transaction identifier that came with the request back in
          the response. It could also include the timestamp when the response is generated.

                                                                                  Page 145 of 218
37. In order to enable a mechanism wherein the authentication response could be used as the
   digital Proof of Identity (PoI) and Proof of Address (PoA) at a later time, the response could
   add the meta information to the PID details included in authentication request. This could
   include the SHA-256 hash value of the NIN, the SHA-256 hash value of the demographic
   part of the PID block and the encoded usage data in HEX format of the various
   demographic attributes usage of this authentication request. The design of the encoded
   usage data for India Aadhaar system is described in Annex 5.


38. The eID authentication service may be originated from either a “registered” or a “public”
   terminal device. The public devices are those without a secure container to store the keys.
   The connectivity between the public devices and the authenticator could use a secure
   protocol such as HTTPS.


39. For public devices, data could be encrypted with a dynamic session key using AES-256
   symmetric algorithm (AES/ECB/PKCS7Padding). The session key, in turn, could be
   encrypted     with   2048-bit     EIDAV    public   key    using    asymmetric     algorithm
   (RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding). The session key may not be stored anywhere, except in
   memory, and it may not be reused across transactions. When using public devices, it is
   highly recommended that an OTP be used.


40. The steps for packaging and encrypting the service request on the “public” device are:
       a. The NIN, demographic and biometric details  as required by the application 
            are entered into the device along with other factors such as OTP, if it is used. If
            OTP is used, the request for it is sent to the eID authentication server along with
            the NIN. The eID authentication server sends the OTP back to the resident’s
            registered mobile phone as a Short Message Service (SMS) and to the registered
            email address.
       b. The ISCA/Sub-ISCA application generates a one-time session key.
       c. The authentication “data” XML block could be encrypted using the one-time
            session key and then encoded (base 64).
       d. The session key could then be encrypted with the EIDAV public key.
       e. The ISCA application on the device could send the encrypted block along with
            Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) data to the ISCA server.
       f.   The ISCA server could form the final authentication XML input for service request,
            including license key and transaction reference (txn attribute), and send the data
            to the eID authentication server through an ISPA network.


                                                                               Page 146 of 218
               g. The eID authentication server decrypts the session key with the EIDAV private key.
                    The data block is then decrypted using the session key.
               h. The resident’s decrypted biometric and demographic information − and optional
                    OTP − are taken into account during the matching process based on the input.
               i.   The eID authentication server responds with “yes/no” in the digitally signed XML.


      41. Authentication Audits. The eID authentication could record all the authentication requests
          and their responses for audit purposes. By providing the NIN and the authentication
          response code, the ISCA could request EIDAV to confirm the result of an authentication,
          along with the authentication factors that were presented in that request. National IT
          Security and EISDF IT Operation policy could determine how long these audits could be
          maintained.


      42. All authentication responses could be digitally signed by EIDAV and the ISCAs could be
          advised to validate the response integrity and may keep track of these for audit purposes.
          In addition, attributes such as timestamp and demographic usage data within the
          authentication response may be used to verify if the request was indeed for a particular
          NIN, if the request indeed had a biometric factor, or when the authentication was done,
          etc. Such self-verifiability of the authentication response may allow third party
          applications to trust and electronically verify the digitally signed response quite similar to
          that of an offline trust establishment honoring a notarized document.


      43. In order to ensure that the solution is widely adopted and is interoperable with the existing
          systems, it is recommended that technologies that comply with open standards be used.
          Some of the open standards that may be look into are:
               a. Demographic data standards. There could be a standard for capturing necessary
                    demographic data of the resident so that this identity information works across
                    various systems and ensures interoperability across various government and
                    private agencies that use the EISDF. It is important that the capture and verification
                    of basic demographic data for each resident is standardized across all partners of
                    the EISDF. For instance, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) set up
                    the Demographic Data Standards and Verification Procedure (DDSVP) committee15
                    for this purpose.

               b. Biometric standards. EIDAV could set up a committee for defining the biometric
                    standards based on the national and international standards; it could also define
                    best practices, expected accuracy, interoperability, conformity, and performance
                    in biometric standards. For instance, the UIDAI set up a committee for biometric
                    standards16.

Mobile ID Service Features

      1. Assuming the use of a physical card for the SIM, the card to be used for mobile ID service
           should be produced in a secure environment and could comply with the protection profile
           defined by the European Committee for Standardization Workshop Agreement (CWA)

   14169 with Evaluation Assurance Level 4+ (EAL4+) according to Common Criteria (CC)
   security standard (ISO/IEC15048). The SIM vendor should provide the certificate upon
   request from the Certification Authority (CA) for a particular SIM product.


2. The SIM could have the Secure-Signature-Creation Device (SSCD) module with two key
   pairs: one for authentication, the other for signing/non-repudiation purposes. The
   signing key may be protected by a PIN.


3. The application that may be stored on the SIM is the Over-The-Air (OTA) SMS interface
   for authentication transaction, eSignature transaction, changing of PINs, unblocking
   private keys with PIN Unlock Key (PUK) code, decryption of encrypted data, and decryption
   and display of text message.


4. The mobile phone could support at least Phase 2+ SIM Toolkit.


5. The estimated cost of the production of SIM with Wireless Public Key Infrastructure (wPKI)
   capabilities may be USD 1-2 with digital certificates or biometrics, and application loaded
   on the SSCD area.


6. EIDAV may have to provide the standard technical specifications for the wPKI-enabled SIM
   for mobile ID services and supported mobile phones.


7. SIM Provisioning Design




                                                                             Page 149 of 218
           Figure 8.6: SIM Provisioning Technical Architecture

a. The EIDAV portal could provide the registration applications for entities that could
   be involved in mobile ID services as Registration Authority (RA), Trusted Service
   Provider (TSP), ISCA, ISPA and CA.
b. The RA could set up outlets for SIM provisioning, user registration and certificate
   activation.
c. The RA could host the application for resident identity validation on the servers in
   its data center and provide access to the Internet at the outlets for performing
   identity validation of the resident at the time of SIM provisioning. The identity
   validation application may have the same technical architecture as the ISCA
   application that could call the identity authentication service provided by EISDF for
   biometric authentication. The outlets could install biometric readers with the
   application for identity verification of the resident.
d. The RA may also host the web application for activating the device certificate of a
   SIM and circulating it to TSPs. EIDAV may host a web service in its production data




                                                                      Page 150 of 218
           center for the purpose of disseminating device certification activation details to
           TSPs. The RA outlets could call this application over the Internet.


8. User Registration/Certificate Activation Design




       Figure 8.7: User Registration/Certificate Activation Technical Architecture

       a. The user initiates the SIM activation application on the mobile phone. The
           application sends the activation request over the wireless Global System for Mobile
           communication (GSM) network to the Short Message Service Center (SMSC)/SMS
           gateway hosted in the RA data center. The SMSC forwards the request to the SIM
           activation application hosted in the back-end servers in the data center.
       b. In response, the application sends the request for signature on the personal
           identity data via the OTA and the SMS gateways. The resident verifies the data and
           signs it by inputting the device certificate activation code.
       c. The RA receives the signed personal data and includes other information such as
           the device certificate; it then forwards the request for certificate activation to the
           designated CA over a secure Internet connection. The RA also sends the service
           request to EIDAV via a registered ISPA to update the resident’s identity record with
           the mobile number.



                                                                                 Page 151 of 218
      d. The CA creates and activates a qualified certificate and publishes it to inform TSPs
         and EIDAV.


9. Usage Design




                  Figure 8.8: Mobile ID Usage Technical Architecture

      a. The service provider integrates the service delivery application into the mobile ID
         service and hosts it on the ISCA data center. The service delivery application has
         the option to click the “Log in with mobile ID”.
      b. The ISCA system calls the EISDF mobile ID web service hosted on the EIDAV data
         center with the NIN, mobile number and PIN of the resident via the ISPA.
      c. The EIDAV mobile ID web service validates the mobile number provided using the
         stored mobile number for the given NIN in the CRIDS.




                                                                            Page 152 of 218
           d. After successful validation, it calls the TSP web service hosted in the TSP data
                center over the secure Internet connection with the mobile number, verification
                code and the PIN.
           e. In response, the TSP service generates the verification code and sends it to the
                ISCA website. It also generates the signature request with the verification code,
                mobile number and PIN; then it sends it to the resident’s mobile phone using the
                OTA and SMS gateways of the TSP over the wireless network in SMS format.
           f.   The specialized OTA SMS activates the identity verification application on the SIM
                card. It displays the verification code that is the same as that displayed on the
                computer of the resident. The resident validates the verification code displayed on
                the mobile device with the one displayed on the computer and signs the request
                by entering the PIN.
           g. The TSP receives the signature data and calls the Online Certificate Status Protocol
                (OCSP) service of the CA to validate the signature data and the certificate.
           h. The TSP forwards the response received from the CA to the ISCA via EIDAV and the
                ISPA.
           i.   On successful authentication, the resident logs into the secure website.


   10. Termination Procedure
           a. In cases of certificate revocation, the RA informs the CA of certificate revocation
                and the CA immediately revokes the certificate and publishes the updated
                Certificate Revocation List (CRL) for the benefit of the TSPs. It also alerts EIDAV via
                the ISPA to update the identity record in the CRIDS and deactivate the mobile ID
                service for the resident along with the reason.
           b. In cases of SIM blocking due to loss or SIM damage, the device certificate is taken
                out of the list of valid SSCDs available to TSPs. EIDAV is alerted via the ISPA to
                update the identity record in the CRIDS and deactivate the mobile ID service for
                the resident along with the reason.


Electronic Identity Seeding Service

Seeding Utility could be a desktop program available for download from EIDAV’s public portal
after successful registration.

   1. The ISCA downloads the utility from the portal and installs it on its server as the
       executable.




                                                                                     Page 153 of 218
   2. The utility provides the capability for data extraction, consolidation, normalization and
       matching. The utility connects to different data sources to pull the relevant PID from
       reference databases. It also pulls the data from the relevant data tables in the service
       delivery database of the service provider.


   3. The utility provides the capability in which one or more PID equivalent fields (name, fate
       of birth, age, gender) from resident records in the service delivery database may be
       matched with equivalent fields in PID records from the reference database. The mapping
       thus created may be exported to Excel for further review and approval by a competent
       authority appointed by the service provider. The utility’s match-and-seed functionality is
       limited only to the creation of the mapping and its export. Based on mapped data, the
       service provider may create custom Structured Query Language (SQL) scripts to update
       the service delivery database.


   4. The     utility    also   enables   the   validation   of   the   seeding   by    performing
       demographic/biometric authentication using the eID authentication service. The ISCA
       registers with EIDAV to call eID authentication service.

Prerequisites to eID Seeding

The eID seeding process is necessarily preceded by data digitization and centralization.

Data digitization essentially means collation of service delivery data in an electronic format
(database/Excel or similar) from where data can be retrieved using standard SQL queries from a
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) − the latter may be MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle,
Sybase, DB2 or similar. It is also important that the personal identity data slowly become
consistent across multiple systems. The EISDF is also an initiative to standardize personal identity
information, and the eID data may be used to clean the existing data.

Data centralization primarily manages availability and accessibility of distributed service delivery
data. The objective here is to allow the seeding utility to access the service delivery data and all
related information in at least the read-only mode. For example, in Vietnam pensioners’ data
may be made available in data silos across districts. A consolidated view of the entire data may
allow the Vietnam Social Security (VSS) to improve its service delivery while at the same time
eliminate the problem of having one person avail of the same benefit from two different districts.

eID Seeding Strategies




                                                                                  Page 154 of 218
The EISDF may support two ways of seeding the service delivery database with the eID/NIN: the
top-down method and the organic method.

Top-Down method may use as input the resident PID captured at the time of enrollment for
generating the NID and NID card, and the national population database available with GoV. In this
method, the PID fields in the reference database created using the NID database are compared
with the equivalent fields in the service delivery database in order to find a suitable match. Upon
finding a match, the NIN from the reference database is seeded into the service delivery database
of the service provider. Depending on the resident PID fields captured at the time of the
enrollment in the NID system, the EISDF may support two possible scenarios for unique matching
of resident record. Consider the example where the health insurance card number was captured
in the resident data fields at the time of the enrolment in the NID system. The field health
insurance card number, along with the resident’s name, may then be used to find a matching
unique record in the health insurance database maintained by the VSS.

Another scenario could be a case where there are no extra fields captured during the enrollment
for the NID card. In such a case, one or more PID fields may be used for matching. Consider the
example of the service delivery database of the telecom provider with customer ID.

                           Customer Table of Telecom Company’s Database

As shown above, the PID fields (name, date of birth, address) from the NID enrollment database
are matched with the PID equivalent field in the service delivery table and − based on match
percentage of individual fields − an overall match score is calculated. It may be ideal to have a
100 percent match for seeding to take place, but that may happen rarely; therefore, it may be
assumed that if the match score exceeds a predefined threshold (possibly 80 percent) then a
match may take place.

The capture of additional information during NID enrollment could make seeding simple; it could
be used for matching records between the PID and the service delivery tables whose unique
identifier has been captured previously. The presence of a health insurance card number, an
employment card number, or any other unique identifiers could prove beneficial to finding a
match.

Organic method may require the service provider to contact the resident, or vice-versa, to update
the NIN/eID in the service delivery database. It may involve creation of touchpoints where the
resident voluntarily, or in response to service providers’ call, initiates inclusion of his/her NIN/eID
in the service delivery databases. This approach can be implemented in interactive or batch
modes.

In the interactive mode, the resident may approach the service provider for the following reasons:

    1. To avail of department-specific benefits scheme and/or services. The touchpoints could
         be in the field or in the service provider offices.



                                                                                                           Page 156 of 218
   2. In response to a campaign by the service provider for NIN/eID registration to serve specific
       benefits and services.
   3. The resident voluntarily approaches the service provider to register the NIN/eID for a
       specific service.

In the batch mode, the service provider gives the list of data pair (eID/NIN, KYR+) to be processed.
The service provider could launch a new scheme where offline data entry is done with an
application form submitted by the resident; it could also use the existing scheme for new
enrollees.

The departments may leverage one or more channels of communication with the residents in
order to capture their NIN/eID. Some of the channels that may be used are:

   1. Document Collection at Touchpoints. Residents may hand over copies of their NID card
       and registration form with the service provider (e.g., for health insurance card). The
       service provider later updates the service delivery database based on the information
       supplied.


   2. SMS. The service provider enables an SMS-based application. Residents are expected to
       send an SMS containing the NIN and a registration number to the service provider. For
       example: UPD <NIN> <Health Insurance Card Number> is sent to a number 59999
       (illustrative only). The application at the back-end seeds the NIN into the database by
       using the health insurance card number as key. For the verification of information
       supplied, the service provider needs to conduct a demographic authentication after
       seeding.


   3. Operator-assisted Update at Touchpoints. The service provider enables direct seeding of
       the NIN/eID at resident touchpoints where residents are expected to come along with
       supporting documents such as the NID card and a service registration document. A
       resident is authenticated both demographically and biometrically before the NIN is seeded
       in the service delivery database.


   4. Email. Similar to the SMS-based approach, an email is sent in a pre-defined format along
       with scanned copies of supporting documents as attachments. Upon receiving the email,
       the back-end application extracts the required information from the email and seeds the
       database appropriately. In case of failure, the resident is informed by a reply email.




                                                                                  Page 157 of 218
   5. Post/Courier. This is similar to the previously mentioned document collection approach;
      however, in this case document collection takes place through the post/courier.


   6. Interactive Voice Response. A telephone-based Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
      application captures the NIN and registration number in an interactive manner. Upon
      capturing the required information, the back-end application seeds service delivery
      database appropriately. Demographic authentication may be conducted after seeding for
      verification.


   7. Self-service Web Portal. The service provider may open up a web portal for residents to
      update their beneficiary identifier number or account number, along with the NIN. Service
      providers may do a demographic authentication at the back-end before updating their
      database with the NIN/eID.

Common Seeding Challenges and Solutions

The eID Seeding services may be designed to address some of the common challenges during
seeding. Below are some of the common challenges for which necessary processes or
workarounds may be designed to overcome them.

   1. Complete data is not captured in service delivery databases. Data are often entered
      manually by semi-skilled operators resulting in incomplete and incorrect entries in the
      service delivery database. Lack of an adequate Quality Assurance (QA) process by service
      providers also contributes to the problem. A data digitization strategy may address this
      potential issue.


   2. Similar information across different data sources do not have exact match between them.
      It has been observed the same data across different tables are not entered similarly. Take
      the case of names “Hau Hung Vuong” and “H H Vuong” which refer to same person.
      Seeding may support exact/partial match of various data fields; therefore, such issues
      may be handled during data cleansing and normalization.


   3. Data in service delivery database is in Vietnamese. Matching of data in the same language
      can be done with standard comparison algorithms, but if the information in the database
      is in different languages (e.g., English and Vietnamese) there is no way a match can be
      made. If a match could made, then the algorithms need to be made extremely intelligent
      and complex unless data level changes are made in the database.



                                                                               Page 158 of 218
      4. All the required data is not available. Careful planning and coordination with support
         groups need to be done. As an example, codec information for encoding and decoding
         may be made available in cases where only codes are stored (often in the gender field,
         male is stored as 1 while female is 2).


      5. Normally available tools become incapable to handle high volume of data. Normally
         people prefer using Microsoft Excel for data handling. However, it has been observed that
         after a few thousand records are entered into an Excel sheet, the response time of the
         tool deteriorates significantly. In such cases, alternative database tools may be
         considered; e.g., import data into a database (MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle, etc.).


      6. Mobilization of residents. In the case of organic seeding, the mobilization of residents is
         required in order to complete seeding. A multi-channel organic seeding approach needs
         to be employed for effective mobilization.


II.      Organizational Structure: Roles and Responsibilities

Electronic Identity Authentication Service

Responsibilities of the Electronic ID Authority of Vietnam

      1. EIDAV could implement a mechanism to get the latest update on the PID of residents from
         the NID system of the NID system on a regular basis.


      2. EIDAV could provide EISDF identity services such as authentication to ISCAs that wish to
         use them for establishing the identity of eID-/NID-holders before conducting business
         with the latter.


      3. EIDAV could determine the operating and engagement model for EISDF identity services.


      4. EIDAV could determine the rules regarding the use of eID, NIN and EISDF identity services.


      5. EIDAV could determine the eligibility criteria for Managed Identification Service Providers
         (MISPs), facilitate the application and registration process and enter into contract with
         them.




                                                                                   Page 159 of 218
6. EIDAV could determine the eligibility criteria for ISPAs, facilitate the application and
   registration process and enter into contract with them.


7. EIDAV could determine the eligibility criteria for ISCAs, facilitate the application and
   registration process and enter into contract with them.


8. EIDAV could determine standards and specifications that could be adhered to by all those
   participating in the EISDF identity services ecosystem − including ISPAs, ISCAs and sub-
   ISCAs. The standards and specifications could include systems and processes, and
   specifications pertaining to API, infrastructure (including devices), process, technology,
   certification (if applicable), audit, security and SLAs (if applicable). In summary, EIDAV
   could determine minimum standards and specifications for EISDF identity services, while
   ecosystem partners could extend and add more specifications and standards to meet their
   domain and application needs.


9. EIDAV could publish documents on its website giving the standards and specifications it
   prescribes. EIDAV could choose to certify all applications that could be used by ISCAs (and
   sub-ISCAs) to enable their eID authentication operations. This could include:
       a. Certification (by itself or through approved independent agencies) of applications
           (such as those driving the authentication process in the ISCA systems) that may be
           used by ISCAs and other participants in eID authentication.
       b. Certification of fingerprint and iris sensors, and extractor pairs that could be
           incorporated in authentication devices. It is the responsibility of vendors of
           relevant equipment to get their products certified by the Standardization Testing
           and Quality Certification (STQC) department of the Ministry of Information
           Technology (MIT).


10. EIDAV could reserve the right to conduct audits of all key players in the EISDF identity
   services ecosystem including ISPAs and ISCAs − either by itself or through EIDAV-
   appointed/approved independent audit agencies − to examine compliance with
   prescribed standards and specifications. As part of these audits, EIDAV/audit agency
   could inspect the premises, operations and systems, infrastructure, security, etc., of the
   entity being audited.


11. EIDAV could retain the right to take appropriate action against parties not complying with
   its specifications, including disqualifying them from using EISDF identity services system


                                                                             Page 160 of 218
       or terminating their contract after an appropriate grace period for remedial action as
       specified in the respective contracts.


   12. EIDAV could provide a framework for the dispute resolution mechanism of the EISDF
       identity services ecosystem.


   13. In the future, if any charges are associated with EISDF identity services, EIDAV could decide
       on the charges or establish the framework for determining charges.


   14. EIDAV could play any role, when necessary, to ensure that the system continues to offer
       uninterrupted services and run successfully.

Responsibilities of a Managed Identification Service Provider

The MISP’s main area of responsibility includes EISDF Identity transaction operations (i.e., receive
authentication requests, execute a match of PID received with the identity information on the
CRIDS, and transmit the result) involving networks, data centers, availability of identity service,
SLAs with ISCAs (if any) and monitoring of operations and performance metrics.

Responsibilities of an Identity Service Provide Agency

   1. The ISPA adheres to its contract with EIDAV by complying with EIDAV standards and
       specifications, including the SLA if relevant.


   2. The ISPA ensures that all its infrastructure and operations − including systems, processes,
       IT and biometric infrastructure, security, etc. − are compliant with EIDAV standards and
       specifications.


   3. When the ISPA receives a service request such as authentication from an ISCA, it is
       recommended that the ISPA perform basic checks on the service request input before
       forwarding it to the EISDP server. The request is forwarded to the authentication server
       only if it is compliant and complete. Otherwise, it is returned to the ISCA with appropriate
       error message (which then forwards it to the authentication device with necessary
       instructions).


   4. On receiving the response from the authentication server, the ISPA transmits the result of
       the transaction to the ISCA that placed the request.


                                                                                  Page 161 of 218
5. It is highly recommended that the ISPA maintain a log of all identity transactions it
   processes. The log could be retained for a specified duration determined by EIDAV and
   may be shared with other entities, but only on a need-basis. The log may capture
   transaction details such as NIN, requesting ISCA, timestamp, etc., but not PID associated
   with an authentication transaction. The storage of the transaction log could comply with
   the applicable laws of the country.


6. In conducting its operations, the ISPA complies with all applicable laws and regulations in
   the country in the area of data security and management.


7. The ISPA ensures that its identity service systems are audited by an information systems
   auditor certified by a recognized body before commencing of its operations. The ISPA may
   provide a certified audit report to EIDAV from time to time confirming its compliance with
   prescribed standards, directions, specifications, etc.


8. The ISPA ensures that its operations and systems related to identity services are audited
   by an information systems auditor certified by a recognized body on an annual basis. The
   ISPA may provide a certified audit report to EIDAV from time to time confirming its
   compliance with prescribed standards, directions, specifications, etc. In addition, EIDAV
   may reserve the right to audit the ISPA (by itself or through EIDAV-appointed/approved
   agencies). During such audits, the ISPA cooperates fully with EIDAV/audit agency and
   provides access to its premises, procedures, records, systems, personnel and any other
   relevant part of its authentication operations. In case of non-compliance, EIDAV may take
   appropriate action such as termination of contract after an appropriate grace period for
   remedial action. The cost of the audits may be borne by the ISPA.


9. The ISPA keeps EIDAV informed of the list of ISCAs it serves. On entering into contract
   with a new ISCA, the ISPA informs EIDAV (along with details sought by EIDAV) before
   commencing service to the ISCA. Similarly, when an ISPA disengages with an ISCA, the
   ISPA informs EIDAV within seven days of the disengagement.


10. The ISPA may have a contract with the ISCA to provide any value-added services to the
   latter. However, such value-added services do not form part of identity services.


11. The ISPA is responsible to EIDAV for all its authentication related operations as covered in
   the contract between EIDAV and the ISPA. Even if the ISPA outsources part of its operations


                                                                              Page 162 of 218
        to other entities, the responsibility for the operations and authentication results lies with
        the ISPA.


    12. In case of investigation of an authentication-related fraud or dispute, the ISPA extends
        full cooperation to EIDAV (or its agency) and/or any other authorized investigation agency.
        This    includes     providing   access      to   its   premises,   records,   systems,   personnel,
        infrastructure, any other relevant resource/information and any other relevant aspect of
        its authentication operations.

Eligibility Criteria

The eligibility criteria of an ISPA are enumerated below.

    1. The agency may be:
            a. A central/provincial government ministry/department or its Public Service
                 Undertaking (PSU) owned and manage by the central/provincial government; or an
                 authority constituted under a central/provincial act; or a not-for-profit
                 company/special purpose organization of national importance; or a company
                 registered in Vietnam meeting the following requirements.
                        i. Financial capabilities. An annual turnover of at least VND 100 million in the
                           last three financial years.
                       ii. Technical capabilities.
                       iii. A Telecom Service Provider (TSP) operating pan-Vietnam fiber optics
                           network and having a minimum of 100 MPLS Points of Presence (PoP)
                           across all provinces; or a Network Service Provider (NSP) capable of
                           providing network connectivity for data, voice transmission and having an
                           agreement with a TSP that has 100 MPLS PoPs; or a System Integrator (SI)
                           having the necessary arrangement with a TSP/NSP as described above.
            b. The agency has not been blacklisted by the central/provincial government, or any
                 of its PSU, in the last five years.


    2. The agency demonstrates its capability to undertake the design, configuration,
        implementation and maintenance of the infrastructure and systems required of an ISPA
        following EIDAV specifications; it certifies that the necessary human resources with the
        requisite skills are in place to perform its intended functions. The decision of EIDAV with
        regard to entering into contract − or not − with a potential ISPA could be final.




                                                                                           Page 163 of 218
   3. The ISPA may enter EISDF identity services ecosystem through the appointment process
       determined and conducted by EIDAV. Entities wishing to become an ISPA may apply with
       EIDAV by providing the necessary information along with supporting documents where
       relevant. EIDAV examines the application and approves qualifying applicants as ISPA.
       Approved ISPAs enter into contract with EIDAV and are permitted to build secure leased
       line connections to EIDAV authentication server; the connections comply with EIDAV
       standards and specifications.


   4. Each ISPA contract may be for a specified duration, at the end of which an ISPA may be
       free to apply for a renewal. EIDAV evaluates the renewal application and approves the
       renewal of qualifying applications.

Responsibilities of an Identity Service Consumer Agency

   1. The ISCA informs EIDAV of each transaction it wishes to have an authentication service
       performed on and the appropriate authentication type it wishes to avail of. The choice of
       authentication type indicates the specific identity information to be sought from the eID-
       /NID-holder to enable that service. The choice of authentication type is a decision of the
       ISCA alone; none of the other entities, including EIDAV and its ISPA, are responsible for
       this decision. It is possible for an ISCA to change the authentication type of any service if
       it so desires, and makes it known to EIDAV.


   2. The ISCA adheres to the processes and the ISCA onboarding checklist provided by EIDAV
       for getting started with EISDF identity services. As and when there are any changes in the
       parameters, the ISCA keeps EIDAV informed of the list of its services that are enabled by
       authentication. This process may be done in a self-service mode, such as an online update
       through EIDAV portal.


   3. The ISCA establishes its identity services-related operations (including systems,
       processes, technology, infrastructure, security, etc.) in compliance with EIDAV standards
       and specifications.


   4. The ISCA is responsible for the provisioning of network from authentication devices to the
       ISCA server and between the ISCA and ISPA servers; it ensures compliance with EIDAV
       security specifications. In addition, it is responsible for procuring and deploying any
       hardware/software/certificate/etc. that are compliant with eID authentication standards.



                                                                                  Page 164 of 218
5. The ISCA ensures that devices used for eID authentication are procured, deployed, and
   managed by them or their agent(s) in compliance with EIDAV specifications and standards
   published by EIDAV from time to time.


6. The ISCA logs all its identity service transactions and maintains them for a specified period
   of time. The log may capture details of an authentication transaction, but not the
   corresponding PID. The storage of transaction logs could comply with applicable laws and
   regulations of the country. The details of logs stored, the duration of storage and any
   other aspect of data storage could be determined by EIDAV specifications, regulations
   applicable to the ISCA service and industry, the ISCA’s own requirements and other
   applicable laws and regulations.


7. It is highly recommended that the ISCA deploy a Fraud Analytics module that is capable
   of analyzing identity services-related transactions to identify fraud cases and patterns. If
   the ISCA is a victim of a fraud, or identifies a fraud pattern through its Fraud Analytics
   system, it shares all necessary information with EIDAV.


8. The encrypted PID block may not be stored, unless it is for buffered authentication for
   only a short period of time; and after transmission, it is deleted. Biometric and OTP data
   captured for the purposes of eID authentication may not be stored on any permanent
   storage or database. The ISCA ensures that all relevant laws and regulations are adhered
   to in relation to data storage and data protection in their systems; it also ensures that
   their agents (if applicable) and authentication devices are in compliance.


9. In cases where the authentication devices are operated by ISCA personnel (or that of its
   agent), it is the ISCA’s responsibility to ensure that adequate training on the operation is
   given to its service representatives.


10. The ISCA ensures that its eID authentication systems are audited by an information
   systems auditor certified by a recognized body before commencing its operations; the
   ISCA provides a certified audit report to EIDAV confirming from time to time its compliance
   with prescribed standards, directions, specifications, etc.


11. The ISCA ensures that its eID authentication operations and systems are audited by an
   information systems auditor certified by a recognized body on an annual basis to confirm
   compliance with EIDAV standards and specifications; the audit report is shared with EIDAV


                                                                                Page 165 of 218
   upon request. It is the ISCA’s responsibility to ensure that its sub-ISCAs and agents are
   also audited regularly. In addition, EIDAV may reserve the right to audit the ISCA’s
   operations and systems (and their agents, if applicable) by itself or through its appointed
   auditor. During these audits, the ISCA cooperates fully with the audit agency and provides
   them necessary access to its premises, procedures, records, systems, personnel and any
   other relevant aspect of authentication operations. In case of non-compliance, EIDAV may
   take appropriate action (such as termination of a contract after a suitable grace period for
   remedial action). The cost of these audits may be borne by the ISCA.


12. The ISCA is responsible for identifying exception-handling mechanisms and back-up
   identity authentication mechanisms when the eID-based federated authentication fails.
   Authentication failures may occur in the process, infrastructure (including power, IT,
   devices, network connectivity), or biometric reading (where the eID-holder’s biometric
   data cannot be acquired or used for some reason).


13. When an ISCA partners with a sub-ISCA, the ISCA informs EIDAV of the partnership before
   starting to serve the new sub-ISCA. Similarly, when a sub-ISCA disengages with the ISCA,
   the ISCA informs EIDAV within seven days (or a period specified by EIDAV) of
   disengagement. The process of such updates is envisaged to be in a self-service mode
   (such as an online update through EIDAV portal). When an ISCA engages with a sub-ISCA,
   it generates a sub-ISCA code to identify the specific sub-ISCA. When informing EIDAV of
   its engagement with the sub-ISCA, the ISCA also informs EIDAV of the new sub-ISCA code.
   When transmitting identity service requests from a sub-ISCA, the ISCA always includes
   the sub-ISCA code so that the eID authentication transaction log can track the origin of
   all authentication requests. It is necessary that for each sub-ISCA, a separate license key
   is used so that the engagement and disengagement of sub-ISCAs can be easily
   accomplished by creating and revoking their respective license keys.


14. It is the ISCA’s responsibility to ensure that all sub-ISCAs under it are regularly audited
   for compliance with EIDAV specifications. In case of non-compliance or default, the ISCA
   may report it to EIDAV and take correction action according to EIDAV guidelines.


15. When an ISCA engages a sub-ISCA, from EIDAV perspective, the ISCA is responsible for
   the connectivity between the sub-ISCA’s authentication devices and the ISCA systems.




                                                                              Page 166 of 218
    16. Even if the ISCA outsources part of its operations to third party, the responsibility for the
        identity services operations and results lies with the ISCA. The ISCA is also responsible for
        ensuring that the identity service operations of the third party comply with EIDAV
        standards and specifications, and that they are regularly audited by approved independent
        audit agencies.


    17. In case of investigation of an authentication-related fraud or dispute, the ISCA extends
        full cooperation to EIDAV (or its agency) and/or any other authorized investigation agency.
        This includes providing access to its (and, if applicable, their agents’) premises, records,
        personnel, systems, relevant resource/information and any other relevant aspect of
        authentication operations.


    18. An ISCA proactively informs EIDAV of any misuse of eID data, authentication services, or
        any compromise of eID-related data or systems within its network.

Eligibility Criteria

The eligibility criteria of an ISCA are enumerated below.

    1. The agency may be:
             a. A central/provincial government ministry/department or a PSU owned and

                 of national importance; or a bank/financial institution/telecom company.
             b. A legal entity registered in Vietnam that seeks to use eID authentication to enable
                 its services. Applications from such agencies may be considered and approved by
                 the ISCA approval board to be constituted by EIDAV.


    2. The agency demonstrates the capability to undertake the implementation and
        maintenance of the infrastructure and systems required to become an ISCA. The decision
        of EIDAV regarding engagement of an ISCA could be final.


    3. Agencies seeking to use eID authentication to enable their services may apply with EIDAV
        by    providing   the   necessary   information   along   with   the   required   supporting
        documentation, as well as the information on the ISPA through which the ISCA could
        connect to the authentication server.




                                                                                   Page 167 of 218
    4. On receipt of the necessary information (and documentation, if relevant), EIDAV approves
        an ISCA. On approval, the ISCA and EIDAV enter into contract.

Responsibilities of a Sub-ISCA

The responsibilities of a sub-ISCA could be similar to that of an ISCA. The responsibilities of an
ISCA covered above could be applicable to the sub-ISCA as well.

Eligibility Criteria

    1. An entity desiring to become a sub-ISCA identifies the ISCA it wishes to engage with and
        applies with that ISCA by providing the necessary information and supporting
        documentation, if necessary.


    2. The sub-ISCA commits to comply with EIDAV standards and specifications in their eID
        authentication operations.


    3. The ISCA informs EIDAV of the engagement with the sub-ISCA and commences its services
        to the latter.

Authentication Devices

Deployment Criteria

    1. Authentication devices may be deployed in the eID authentication ecosystem by the ISCA,
        sub-ISCA or the agents of ISCA/sub-ISCA or the eID-holder.


    2. The ISCA/sub-ISCA is responsible for the provision of network from devices to the sub-
        ISCA/ISCA server and on to the ISCA/ISPA server; it is also responsible for ensuring
        network security. In addition, they may be responsible for procuring and deploying any
        hardware/software/certificate/etc. that comply with eID authentication standards.


    3. The ISCA/sub-ISCA is responsible for the installation of eID authentication standards-
        compliant hardware/software/certificate/etc. on the Internet-connected device of their
        customers/beneficiaries/subscribers (CBS).

Features of Authentication Devices

    1. They are compliant with EIDAV standards and specifications.


                                                                                 Page 168 of 218
   2. Biometric authentication devices are compliant with EIDAV biometric data standards and
       are certified to be so by the designated department in the government.


   3. Biometric authentication devices employ “best finger” detection exposed by the EISDP.


   4. Biometric authentication device vendors equip their product using Software Development
       Kit (SDK) Application Programming Interface (API) specification published by EIDAV to
       ensure interoperability.


   5. Authentication devices may be operator-assisted or self-operated.


   6. They are capable of collecting relevant information from NID-/eID-holders, preparing
       authentication data packets (PID block), performing structural validation of data,
       transmitting data packets and receiving authentication results along with instructions on
       next steps, if any. Collection of eID information by the authentication devices is carried
       out in compliance with EIDAV specifications.


   7. Authentication devices are deployed such that they cannot retain eID-holders’ biometric
       and OTP data captured for the purposes of eID authentication during a transaction, except
       in case of buffered authentication described below, in which case they may be able to
       store encrypted data for a certain period of time.


   8. In terms of data storage, authentication devices comply with all applicable laws and
       regulations of the country.

Responsibilities of the eID-/National ID-holder

   1. eID-/NID-holders consent to be authenticated with their eID-based PID and present it
       voluntarily to access the ISCA/sub-ISCA services.
   2. It is the eID-/NID-holders’ responsibility to keep their PID in the CRIDS valid and current.
       They do so on a periodic basis or on a need-basis, as the case may be. Some instances
       where an update may be necessary:
           a. To inform releavant GoV agencies of a change in address
           b. To update the collection of fingerprints on a periodic basis
           c. To correction any errors



                                                                                 Page 169 of 218
    3. eID-/NID-holders may approach EIDAV in case they have reason to believe that their eID
        PID has been compromised by any of the agents in the authentication ecosystem.
    4. eID-/NID-holders proactively inform EIDAV of any misuse of eID data or authentication
        services.

The rights, responsibilities and obligations of eID-/NID-holders are covered in detail in the eID-
/NID-holder’s Charter.

Eligibility Criteria


Eligible individuals seeking eID identity enter the eID authentication ecosystem when they enroll
with the NID system by providing their demographic and biometric identity information. On
successful completion of the enrollment process, each eligible individual obtains his/her unique
NIN. This identity information is stored against the corresponding NIN in the CRIDS.


eID Seeding Service

The operating model for eID seeding service could be managed and operated by the following
EISDF organizational structure entities that could have well-defined roles and responsibilities.
The key roles and responsibilities are described below:

    1. The National Identification Authority of Vietnam could provide the necessary tools,
        expertise, best practices, and consulting advisory on request to the service providers for
        implementing the eID seeding, such as:
            a. Seeding utility and the National Electronic Seeding Platform (NESP) for use by the
                 service providers.
            b. Necessary documentation on its public portal.
            c. Online registration on its public portal for ISCAs to access relevant tools.


    2. The Identity Service Consumer Agency could be a service provider interested in availing
        of identity verification functions for use in its service delivery process; it could be
        responsible for the seeding of the NIN/eID in its service enablement database. Among its
        responsibilities are:
            a. Preparing its service enablement database by performing data digitization and
                 centralization.
            b. Choosing its seeding strategy: top-down or organic method.
            c. Registering with EIDAV for using the offline utility and NESP.



                                                                                   Page 170 of 218
          d. Performing      the   demographic     and    biometric   authentication    using   eID
               authentication.
          e. Setting up the required communication channels with the CBS, if using organic
               seeding.


eKYC Service

The operating model for the eKYC process may be managed and operated by the same
organizational structure entities involved in the eID authentication service. The key roles and
responsibilities from the eKYC perspective are described below.

   1. National Identification Authority of Vietnam. As in eID authentication, the NIDAV could be
       the overall regulator and overseer of the eKYC process and supporting ecosystem. Its
       functions:
          a. To provide eKYC access to ISCAs wishing to use it in business operations as a
               prerequisite extending their service to eID-/NID-holders.
          b. To determine the operating and engagement model for the eKYC.
          c. To determine the rules regarding the usage of eKYC.
          d. To ensure that the eligibility criteria for the MISP include the design and
               implementation of the eKYC as part of the responsibilities.
          e. To determine the eligibility criteria and entry process for ISCAs to access the eKYC
               service, facilitate the application and registration for its use, then enter into
               contract with them.
          f.   To determine the standards and specifications that could be adhered to by all
               (including ISPAs, ISCAs and sub-ISCAs) that participate in the eKYC ecosystem.
               The standards and specifications include systems and processes; it also includes
               specifications for API, infrastructure, devices, processes, technology, certification
               (if any), audit, security, and SLAs (where applicable). In summary, the NIDAV could
               determine the minimum standards and specifications for eKYC, while ecosystem
               partners may extend and add other specifications and standards to meet their
               domain and application needs.
          g. To publish documents on its website on eKYC-related standards and specifications
               it prescribes. The NIDAV could choose to certify all applications that could be used
               by ISCAs (and sub-ISCAs) in enabling their eKYC operations − by itself or through
               approved independent certification agencies.




                                                                                  Page 171 of 218
2. Managed Identification Service Provider. The MISP could offer eKYC service on behalf of
   the NIDAV. Its main area of responsibility could include eKYC transaction operations (i.e.,
   receive authentication request, execute a match of PID received by calling eID
   authentication service and transmit the result), network and data center operations,
   availability of eKYC service, SLAs with ISCA (if any) and monitoring operations and
   performance metrics.


3. Identity Service Provider Agency. The sole channel to the eKYC process could be through
   the secure leased line network of an ISPA.


4. Identity Service Consumer Agency. The ISCA could be any agency that seeks to use the
   eKYC service to enable its service delivery. Each ISCA may use the eKYC process to enable
   one or more of its services. An ISCA enters into a formal contract with the NIDAV in order
   to access it. The ISCA ensures that the eKYC request originating from its device is
   compliant with the standards and specifications prescribed by NIDAV and duly completed
   before transmission to its ISPA.
       a. The eKYC service delivery workflow requires a call to the authentication service for
          getting the consent of the resident. Hence the ISCA, in addition to its eKYC service
          responsibilities, could also have all the responsibilities involved in the delivery of
          authentication service.
       b. The ISCA adheres to the processes and the ISCA onboarding checklist provided by
          NIDAV for getting started with the eKYC service. As and when there are any
          changes in the parameters, the ISCA keeps the NIDAV informed of the list of its
          services that are enabled by eKYC. This exercise may be done in self-service mode,
          such as an online update on the NIDAV portal.
       c. The ISCA may up its eKYC-related operations (including systems, processes,
          technology, infrastructure, security, etc.) in compliance with NIDAV standards and
          specifications.
       d. The ISCA may use the network provided by the ISPA between Identity service
          devices, and ISCA and ISPA servers, for authentication service. In addition, it could
          be responsible for procuring and deploying any hardware, software, certificate,
          etc., in compliance with eKYC standards.
       e. The ISCA logs all its eKYC transactions and maintains them for a specified period
          of time. The log captures details of an eKYC transaction, but not the corresponding
          PID. The storage of transaction log complies with applicable laws and regulations
          of the country. Details of the log stored, the duration of storage and any other


                                                                              Page 172 of 218
            aspect of data storage could follow NIDAV specifications, regulations applicable
            to the ISCA service and industry, the ISCA’s own requirements and other applicable
            laws and regulations.
       f.   The Fraud Analytics module deployed by the ISCA could be capable of analyzing
            eKYC-related transactions to identify fraud cases and patterns.
       g. In cases where the Identity service devices are operated by ISCA personnel (or their
            agents’), the ISCA could be responsible for ensuring that it gets adequate training
            for performing eKYC-related tasks.
       h. The ISCA ensures that its eKYC-related systems are audited by an information
            systems auditor certified by a recognized body before commencing operations;
            the ISCA provides a certified audit report to the NIDAV from time to time
            confirming its compliance with prescribed standards, directions, specifications,
            etc.
       i.   The ISCA is responsible for identifying exception-handling and back-up
            mechanisms when the eKYC function fails. Failures may occur in the process,
            infrastructure (including power, IT, devices, network connectivity) or biometric
            reading (where eID-holder’s biometric data cannot be acquired or used for some
            reason).
       j.   When transmitting eKYC requests from a sub-ISCA, the ISCA always includes the
            sub-ISCA code so that the log can track the origin of all transactions.
       k. Could the ISCA outsource part of its operations to third party entities, the
            responsibility for the eKYC operations and results could still lie with the ISCA. The
            ISCA could also be responsible for ensuring that the eKYC-related operations such
            as those performed by third party entities comply with NIDAV standards and
            specifications. The ISCA could likewise ensure that the third party entities are
            regularly audited by approved independent audit agencies.
       l.   In case of investigation of an eKYC-related fraud or dispute, the ISCA extends full
            cooperation to the NIDAV (or its agency) and/or any other authorized investigation
            agency. This includes providing access to its premises, records, personnel,
            systems, relevant resource/information and any other relevant aspect of
            authentication operations − as well as those of its agents.


5. Sub-ISCA. Any legal entity registered in Vietnam wishing to use eKYC service to enable
   its services could become an ISCA or it could access it through an existing one. In the
   latter case, it becomes a sub-ISCA of the ISCA it engages with.




                                                                               Page 173 of 218
   6. Identity Service Device. It may be the same device as that used for eID authentication and
       it could have the capability to capture the inputs required by eKYC service. It could be
       operator-assisted or self-operated. The device may be a desktop, laptop, kiosk, handheld
       mobile, etc., that are − if required − integrated with or connected to biometric tools for
       capturing fingerprints and/or iris images. It could be operated by the ISCA or a sub-ISCA,
       or agents of the ISCA/sub-ISCA.


   7. eID-/NID-holders. In the context of eKYC service, they are usually associated with ISCAs
       or sub-ISCAs as customers, employees or associates; as such, they seek access to
       ISCA/sub-ISCA services. For them to gain access, they need to provide their KYC data for
       registration in the eKYC service. The eID-/NID-holders are responsible for providing
       consent to the eKYC process.


Mobile ID Service

Mobile Phone with Specialized SIM

A mobile phone with specialized SIM has SSCD capability, activated digital certificate or
biometrics, and a private key.    It is issued by the RA and hosts the mobile service request
application and the private keys stored on the SIM.

Responsibilities of a Registration Authority

The RA could typically be a nationalized mobile operator such as Vittel, Mobiphone, Vinaphone,
etc., responsible for the provisioning of specialized SIMs with SSCD functionality to residents at
its service outlets across the country. For a mobile operator to become an RA, it could have to
register with EIDAV.

The RA could be responsible for user registration and certificate activation of mobile ID service
provided to residents. It could also be responsible for termination of service due to such reasons
as resident’s request, lost/compromised SSCD, certificate expiry, or violation of the user-CA
agreement.

Responsibilities of a Trusted Service Provider

The Trusted Service Providers (TSPs) could be the mobile operator responsible for forwarding the
mobile ID service request from EIDAV to the mobile phone of the resident over the mobile
network. It could also be responsible for sending the signed data from the mobile phone to the
CA, and getting back to EIDAV with the authentication response.

                                                                                 Page 174 of 218
Mobile operators may have to register with EIDAV to become an authorized TSP. The TSP provides
the wPKI service to EIDAV and the ISCAs and it could be responsible for monitoring PKI-related
problems and providing support for their resolution.

Responsibility of a Certification Authority

The CA could be responsible for issuing and validating the certificate; it could also validate the
signed data in response to the TSP request.

Responsibility of the Electronic Identification Authority of Vietnam

EIDAV could host the mobile ID service in its data center, and register and hire all the ecosystem
entities that could play roles in this scalable delivery of services.

Responsibility of an Identity Service Consumer Agency

The ISCA could be any agency seeking to use mobile ID functions to enable its services. Each ISCA
may use mobile ID to enable one or more of its services. The ISCA could be responsible for
integrating its service delivery application (websites) to the mobile ID service provided by EIDAV.

Responsibilities of an Identity Service Provider Agency

The ISPA may be an agency that establishes secure leased line connectivity with the mobile ID
service hosted on the mobile ID servers in EIDAV data center. It transmits authentication requests
on behalf of an ISCA and receives the response back from the mobile ID server.

Responsibilities of a Resident User

The resident may obtain the specialized SIM from the RA service outlet. To acquire one, the
resident could have to provide his/her NIN and demographic data to allow verification of identity
through authentication at the RA service outlet. The resident could validate his/her identity-
related data on the mobile phone during the registration process after which, the resident
acquires the PIN and activation code. Henceforth, the resident could be responsible for the card.




                                                                                  Page 175 of 218
Annex 5: International Experiences

Many countries have launched the national Electronic Identity (eID) system and are at various
stages of deployment and usage. Since many nations have only recently begun their rollouts,
adoption levels are expanding daily as more citizens receive their eID and government agencies
and businesses launch new services that make use of this platform. While no country has achieved
universal adoption and use, some countries have made more progress than others. This section
identifies the various eID services implemented by three countries, notably India, Estonia and
Belgium; and how the eID has improved the quality of citizen/customer service delivery. It also
looks at the experiences of these countries and highlights the key factors that have impacted the
successful implementation and increased usage of the eID system.


I. India

1.     In India, an inability to prove identity was one of the biggest barriers preventing the poor
from accessing benefits and subsidies. The Government of India did not provide a national
identification document with a unique number to the residents. In the absence of resident identity
creation at the national level, service agencies typically followed their own process for identity
creation and entitlement identification for their customers/beneficiaries/subscribers (CBS). The
tokens provided by service agencies to individuals were used for both identity authentication and
entitlement verification. As part of the identity creation process, most of the service agencies
required the individuals to furnish physical identity documents or service utilization bills provided
by other service agencies like Permanent Account Number (PAN) card, passport, driver’s license,
telephone bill, etc. Only 50 million Indians had a passport, close to 100 million had a PAN card,
and approximately 200 million had a drivers’ license, but there was a vast section of the
population who did not have any identity proof. This approach resulted in a situation where a
part of the population had multiple identity tokens, while a significant portion did not have any
at all as they did not avail any of those services. Also, only certain identity tokens were accepted
as identity proof at the national level, e.g., PAN card, passport, and ration card. In order to achieve
the goal of financial inclusion and reduce the poverty within the country, it was felt there needed
to be an identification system to cover those who did not possess any proof of identity so that
they could participate in the social programs and avail of benefits they were entitled to.


2.     The move to have an identity creation system resulted in the following challenges:
       a. Multiple identities for the same person due to the lack of a national mechanism to
           uniquely identify an individual.



                                                                                     Page 176 of 218
       b. Limited or no interoperability as most of the identity tokens were accepted for a
            specific purpose and at a specific location only.
       c. Leakages of welfare benefits owing to the creation of numerous duplicates and fake
            identities within the same benefit program as it was impossible to uniquely identify
            the individuals.
       d. High risk of resident identity theft and misuse of photocopied identity documents
            submitted as proofs, it being easy to forge paper-based documents.
       e. Duplication of effort in identity creation in silos by each service agency increased
            overall cost of identification, and caused extreme inconvenience to the individuals.
       f.   Creation of separate identity for each program for the same individual results in
            service agencies unable to correlate different benefits given to an individual through
            various programs resulting in the inability to verify correct entitlements and a
            potentially lower impact from welfare programs.


3.     Most of the service agencies issued physical identity tokens of the “what the user has”
type like cards for PAN, ration, pension, National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS),
etc., which can only be authenticated manually. This identity authentication mechanism presented
the following challenges:
       a. Higher setup cost with limited scalability. It works only in the assisted mode.
       b. Difficulty in identifying fake documents and copies.
       c. Inability to verify that the person carrying the token is the rightful owner unless it
            carries the person’s photo.
       d. Difficulty in recognizing misuse − there is no authentic audit trail mechanism; instead
            it requires exhaustive manual checking.


4.     Given this context, the Government of India embarked on the Unique Identification (UID)
project in January 2009 with the mission to issue a unique identification number that became
known as Aadhaar. The Aadhaar may be verified and authenticated in an online cost-effective
manner that is robust enough to eliminate duplicate and fake identities.


5.     The Aadhaar identifies a resident and provides the resident the means to clearly establish
his/her identity to public and private agencies across the country. The three key characteristics
of Aadhaar are: (a) permanency (it remains the same throughout an individual’s lifetime); (b)
uniqueness (one resident has one ID; no two residents have same); and (c) globalness (the same
identifier can be used across applications and domains).




                                                                                 Page 177 of 218
6.        The Aadhaar is provided during the enrollment process when a resident’s demographic
and biometric information are collected and the uniqueness of the data is established through a
process called deduplication. Post deduplication, an Aadhaar number is issued and a letter is sent
to resident informing of the details.


7.        The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has adopted the use of biometrics
technology as part of its core strategy in meeting its goal of preventing issuance of duplicate
identity number to a resident. The biometrics used are fingerprint and iris scans. The
deduplication process involves matching the biometric data of the resident against those of every
resident in the database to ensure uniqueness. Only after this process is a 12-digit Aadhaar
number issued.


8.        For any service agency, establishing both identity and service entitlement of the
beneficiary is necessary. Though individual identity may be unique and independent of services
desired, entitlement is very specific to the service being availed of and it has to be established by
each service agency separately. Hence, instead of assigning the role and responsibilities of the
authentication service to an existing ministry, the UIDAI was created as the overall regulator and
overseer of the Aadhaar authentication system.


9.        The UIDAI was established under the Planning Commission. It was created by an executive
order under the aegis of the Planning Commission to ensure a pan-departmental and neutral
identity for the authority and, at the same time, enable a focused approach to attaining the goals
set for the Eleventh Five-Year Plan that covered 2007-2012. Its role was to develop and
implement the necessary institutional, technical and legal infrastructure to issue unique identity
numbers to Indian residents. The UIDAI was created as a statutory body under a separate
legislation to fulfill its objectives. The law also stipulates rules, regulations, processes and
protocols to be followed by the different agencies partnering with the UIDAI in issuing and
verifying unique identity numbers.


10.       The UID only provides identity19.	The UIDAI purview is limited to the issuance of a unique
identification number linked to a person's demographic and biometric information. It is not
responsible for issuing the card. The UID may only guarantee identity, not rights, benefits or
entitlements.

                                                                                           Page 178 of 218
11.    The UID number does not contain intelligence. Loading intelligence into identity numbers
makes them susceptible to fraud and theft. The UID is a random number.


12.    A steering cabinet committee headed by the Prime Minister and a group of ministers from
key ministries such as Finance, Agriculture, External Affairs, Law and Justice, Communication and
Information and Technology, and Labor and Employment among others, was constituted with the
function of managing all issues related to the UIDAI, including its organization, plans, policies,
programs, schemes, funding and methodology to be adopted for achieving the objectives of that
authority.


13.    The project included the establishment of the national identity infrastructure for the
creation and usage of the national unique identity that is digital and verifiable online.            It
addressed the existing challenges faced by service agencies in identity establishment. Following
are its key benefits.
       a. Since it works anywhere in India, it is portable identity that is verifiable online.
       b. It does away with duplicate and fake identities thereby plugging leakages of welfare
             benefits.
       c. It authenticates the individual every time as that same and unique person anywhere
             and anytime; therefore, it ensures that the rightful claimant gets the service or benefit.
       d. It has higher scalability of services with online authentication, allowing the service
             agencies to use multiple channels for service delivery.
       e. It reduces beneficiary harassment and rent seeking due to lower dependency on
             manual processes.
       f.    It is a more efficient service delivery process and reduces the cost of identity
             establishment.
       g. It eliminates the need to submit physical copies of identity documents and reduces
             the risk of identity theft associated with physical documents usage.
       h. It has a built-in electronic audit trail allowing service agencies to track their service
             delivery process more effectively.


14.    The UID proves identity, not citizenship. The UID is proof of identity and does not confer
citizenship.


15.    The previous identity databases in India were fraught with problems of fraud and duplicate
or ghost beneficiaries. To prevent this from seeping into the new database, the UIDAI decided
not to use the data that existed previously. Instead, it undertook a new enrollment process for


                                                                                     Page 179 of 218
the proper collection and verification of residents’ demographic and biometric information. This
ensured that the data collected is clean from the start of the program.


16.       The UIDAI introduced the “introducer system” for residents who do not have any form of
identification and where the UID could be the first form of identification they have access to. This
was to enable financial inclusion so that much of the poor and underserved population could get
a UID. The introducer could be a person who stands as the guarantor of a resident’s personal
demographic data in the UID system.


17.       The main service offered to the residents and service providers in both public and private
organizations is Aadhaar authentication. The purpose of authentication is to enable Aadhaar-
holders to prove their identity digitally and online, and for service providers to confirm the
residents’ identity claim before supplying services or giving access to benefits.


18.       Typically, an individual identity is defined in terms of demographic attributes, i.e., name,
gender, age and address. But demographic data alone cannot guarantee uniqueness. Uniqueness
of identity, however, is possible by linking demographic attributes with biometric attributes like
fingerprint and iris patterns of the individual. Aadhaar is a unique 12-digit randomly generated
identity number assigned to the resident.               It is linked to the resident’s unique personal
demographic and biometric data stored in the centralized database, the Central Identities Data
Repositoty (CIDR). For the sake of uniqueness, there is one identity number to one person, and
one person has one unique identity number. To achieve this, the resident profile is run through
a rigorous demographic and biometric deduplication process with 99.99% accuracy before
assigning the unique identity number to the resident profile.


19.       The incentives in the UID system are aligned towards a self-cleaning mechanism. The past
patchwork of multiple databases in India gave individuals the incentive to provide different
personal information to different agencies. Since deduplication in the UID system ensures that
residents have only one chance to be in the database, individuals are encouraged to provide
accurate data. This incentive may become especially powerful as benefits and entitlements are
linked to the UID.


20.       Aadhaar authentication20 is the process in which the unique identification number, along
with the holder’s Personal Identity Data (PID), is submitted to the CIDR at UIDAI for matching,



20   Aadhaar Operating Model - http://www.uidai.gov.in/images/authDoc/d3_1_operating_model_v1.pdf

                                                                                             Page 180 of 218
following which the CIDR verifies the correctness on the basis of the match with the Aadhaar
holder’s identity information available with it. The UIDAI either confirms proof of identity or
verifies the information provided by the resident. To protect resident privacy, the Aadhaar
authentication service responds only with “yes/no”; none of the PID is mentioned in the response.


21.       The authentication services are available to the resident to prove his/her identity
anywhere, anytime and in multiple modes. A service provider can choose either single-factor or
multi-factor authentication. The Aadhaar, by itself, is not a factor for authentication. The
Aadhaar, along with demographic attributes (name, address, etc.) or One-Time-Password (OTP)
or single/multiple biometric attributes (fingerprint, iris, etc.), may be used to provide single-
factor authentication. Alternatively, the three attributes may be used in combination for a multi-
factor authentication process.


22.       Authentication services are of different types21 depending on the authentication attributes
used.
          a. Type 1: Demographic. This uses demographic attributes (name, address, date of
               birth/age, gender, mobile, email) singly or in combination. It can be used periodically
               to check validity of the credential,s or for cleaning up the service provider database
               by removing duplicates.
          b. Type 2: OTP. This uses a one-time password that is delivered to a mobile number or
               email address on request initiated by a resident or an application. It may be used for
               authenticating residents for Internet and mobile transactions, as well as in cases where
               deployment of biometric technology is difficult or not practical.
          c. Type 3: Biometric. This uses fingerprint and/or iris scans. It requires residents to be
               present to allow fingerprint and iris capture on a device. It is used when biometric
               authentication is considered essential as in Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process,
               financial transactions, attendance tracking, etc.
          d. Type 4: Multi-factor. This uses biometric scans and OTP/mobile. As it is a multi-factor
               authentication, therefore, it provides greater assurance.




21   Aadhaar Authentication Framework -
http://www.uidai.gov.in/images/authDoc/d2_authentication_framework_v1.pdf

                                                                                     Page 181 of 218
23.        The features22 in the Aadhaar authentication service include demographic and biometric
data matching. It also offers OTP usage, “yes/no” response, digitally signed request/response,
response code, response timestamp, self-verifiability of response, encryption and tamper-
proofing.


24.        Federated Mode of Aadhaar Authentication. Most current authentication systems could be
described as “local” (i.e., pertaining to and/or valid for a few services, situations or entities) and
“revocable” (in which an existing identity factor could be revoked and reissued as a result of
expiry, compromise or other valid reasons). Such revocable, local authentication systems come
with a set of strengths and limitations. The Aadhaar authentication system, on the other hand,
could be described as “global” due of its applicability across situations, service providers and
services. It is also “non-revocable” since Aadhaar identity factors, such as fingerprints and iris
scans, cannot generally be revoked or replaced. Global, non-revocable/permanent authentication
systems come with their own set of strengths and limitations. In the federated authentication
model, the global-irrevocable Aadhaar authentication co-exists with and strengthens the local-
revocable kind done by authentification user agencies. It is expected that such a federated
approach may result in authentication systems that are stronger and more reliable than those
that are based solely on either the global-irrevocable model or the local-revocable model.
Aadhaar authentication has been designed with the view to strengthening the service providers’
existing authentication systems, rather than as a replacement. While the federated model does
not mandate the existence or use of a service provider’s own authentication (if a service provider
so wishes, it could use only Aadhaar authentication by itself), service providers are encouraged
to use Aadhaar authentication in conjunction with their own local authentication to render the
overall authentication system stronger and more reliable. This is called the federated mode of
Aadhaar authentication.


25.        Aadhaar and identity authentication are used by the service delivery provider mainly for
establishing presence and proof of delivery, KYC credentials, and as a unifier for resident-centric
information.


26.        In the case of establishing presence and proof of delivery, confirming beneficiaries is a
common usage of the authentication services that ensures that the services are delivered to the
right individuals. It supports attendance tracking in the cases where wages/outlays are linked to

                                                                                    Page 182 of 218
the actual number of days a beneficiary reports for the program. It also facilitates financial
transactions as when a bank authenticates a customer using Aadhaar as well as bank-related
identity information (account number/user ID along with OTP, etc.) before enabling fund transfers
or withdrawals.


27.       In the case of establishing KYC credentials, Identity and address verification is a key
requirement for enrolling a new customer or opening a new account for an individual. The service
provider in all such cases can verify applicant identity and address using Aadhaar authentication.
This is expected to substantially reduce the cost of KYC in providing these services. It can also
be used as a general Proof of Identity (PoI) for standard security-related requirements such as
entry to areas like airports; and in various examinations (medical or scholastic) where a large
number of impersonations are reported every year. The application of authentication in
demographic data and address verification in service delivery databases may help in their
cleansing and management.


28.       The Aadhaar is a common identifier to link related databases. It enables the State view of
residents across schemes, e.g., the number of schemes accessed by a resident. It provides a
potential linkage of Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), a government scheme to decrease neo-natal
and maternal death; Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS); and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan
(SSA), an education program. A linking of services could facilitate the tracking of health and
education for every child, healthcare and patient records database (local, regional and national
levels); credit bureaus could be able to avail of customer rating information; there could be a
national skills registry and tracking of individuals through the lifecycle; and large institutions
could have a single customer view across services provided by banks, insurance companies, etc.


29.       The UIDAI has defined a scalable operating model with key players, their roles,
responsibilities and obligations in the Aadhaar authentication model23. Any agency that could like
to utilize Aadhaar authentication to enable its services may sign up as an Authentication User
Agency (AUA) and enter into an agreement with the UIDAI. The AUA in turn may need to engage
with an Authentication Service Agency (ASA). An ASA is an agency that has established secure
leased line connectivity to the CIDR at the UIDAI to transmit authentication request on behalf of
AUAs and receive response back from the CIDR. The ASAs build and maintain their secure
connectivity to the CIDR in compliance with the standards and specifications set by the UIDAI. An
AUA has the option of connecting to the CIDR by itself or through an existing ASA. Further, an



23   Aadhaar Authentication Operating model - http://www.uidai.gov.in/images/authDoc/d3_1_operating_model_v1.pdf

                                                                                              Page 183 of 218
agency desiring to use Aadhaar authentication could choose to become an AUA or it could choose
to access the authentication services through an existing AUA. In the latter case, it becomes a
sub-AUA of the AUA it engages with.


30.        Terminal devices are devices employed by AUAs (both government and non-government)
to provide services to the residents. Examples include micro-ATM devices, Point of Sales (PoS)
devices, Position Detection System (PDS) terminals, and MGNREGA (a program which guarantees
the right to work), terminals and Access Security devices. These devices may host the applications
of the AUA and support biometric capture mechanism to collect biometrics of residents for
authentication purposes. Any additional features of these terminal devices may depend on the
specific needs of services offered by AUAs. These devices could comply with specifications issues
by the UIDAI to protect all the biometric and demographic information provided by the residents.
Terminal devices are registered with the Aadhaar system for encryption key management and are
referred to as registered terminal devices. Public terminal devices are not registered.


31.        Biometric Device Specifications. The terminal device used in Aadhaar biometric-based
authentication has the capability to capture fingerprints and iris images of the resident at the
time of the service delivery. The UIDAI has defined its specifications24 based on open standards
so data captured using the device could ensure high data quality and result in greater accuracy.


32.        The fingerprint-based biometric system is at the core of the UIDAI deduplication and
unique identification of the resident. Fingerprinting, the oldest biometric technology, has the
largest market share of all biometrics modalities globally. The fingerprint industry also has a
variety of suppliers and a base of experienced professionals necessary to implement the unique
identity management solution at the scale that India required. Face is the most commonly
captured biometric, and frequently used in manual checking. However, stand-alone, automatic
face recognition does not provide a high level of accuracy, and can only be used to supplement
a primary biometric modality.


33.        Biometric Device Certification for UID Application. The UIDAI has adopted a certification
process for biometric devices to ensure the latter’s compliance to UIDAI specifications. The UIDAI
has delegated the responsibility of implementing the certification process to the Standardization

Testing and Quality Certification (STQC) directorate under the Department of Information
Technology (DIT). The directorate provides quality assurance services in the area of electronics
and IT through countrywide network of laboratories and centers. It maintains a list of certified
vendors’ biometric devices that may be used by service providers for biometric authentication.
Vendors who could like to get their biometric device certified have to follow the certification
process defined by the STQC that is published on the UIDAI portal25.


34.        Best Finger Detection Service. Based on the results of a series of Proof of Concept (PoC)
studies on Aadhaar biometric authentication, it was learned that a resident being fingerprinted
for authentication may give prints of varying quality across all the fingers. Therefore, the accuracy
or the chances of being matched may vary due to these differences. This variation may also be
present due to the manner in which the resident normally interacts with a typical fingerprint
scanner, and the various fingers may inherently have different amount of identifying information
depending on the size of the finger and the commonness of the pattern it carries. Hence, the
UIDAI provides the Best Finger Detection (BFD)26 as stateless web service that can be called by the
service providers’ service delivery application to detect a resident’s finger that has the greatest
accuracy and yields successful matching results. The resident may then use the best finger to
ensure a high success rate in biometric authentication.


35.        Biometric Software and Programming Specifications. The UIDAI has published on its public
portal the Aadhaar biometric Software Development Kit (SDK) and Application Programming
Interface (API) specifications27 that provide a single unified interface across multiple modalities
(face, fingerprint, and iris) for SDK developers from biometric device vendors to expose their
functionality to various modules of the Aadhaar system. This promotes vendor neutrality as the
use of standard APIs and open standards could eliminate proprietary and vendor-specific
features. It also promotes interoperability by using standard interfaces, common data format
definitions, and protocols across the components that expose similar functionality. The open API
allows the best of the breed algorithms to be used for special purposes. The API exposes quality
check, segmentation, sequencing, extraction and matching functionalities.

36.        The Aadhaar authentication supports the use of multiple factors. These factors include
demographic data, biometric data, PIN, OTP, possession of mobile, or combination thereof.
Adding multiple factors increases the strength of authentication depending on the factors.
Applications using Aadhaar authentication need to choose appropriate factors based on their
needs. However, not all factors are implemented at this time.


37.        The UIDAI has published on its public portal the Aadhaar authentication API
specifications28 that are used by the AUAs and ASAs to integrate the authentication service call
into their service delivery application. They include API data format, protocol, and security
specifications.


38.        The Aadhaar authentication services are exposed as stateless service over Hyper-text
Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). The usage of open data format in Extensible Markup Language
(XML) and widely used protocol such as HTTP allows easy adoption and deployment of Aadhaar
authentication.


39.        In order for service provider agencies to leverage the Aadhaar authentication service in
delivering their services, they capture and store the 12-digit Aadhaar number (UID) with the
unique identifier (customer or beneficiary ID, etc.) in the service delivery databases. The process
by which the UID of residents are included in the service delivery database of service providers
for enabling Aadhaar-based authentication during service delivery is referred to as Aadhaar
seeding29.


40.        Going forward, the Aadhaar may form the basic, universal identity infrastructure with
which registrars, government and other service providers across the country may be able to build
their identity-based applications. These features, in turn, are expected to serve multiple
transformational benefits in development and equitable growth through proper identification.
Eventually, they will lead to better targeting by development schemes of the government and the
private sector, ensuring that all fake, duplicate and ghost records are weeded out from databases
so that leakages resulting from such records are avoided. In the same vein, they will increase the
reach and efficiency of delivering many goods and services like PDS, banking and finance,

telecom, health, insurance, education, etc. and could no longer need repeated KYC checks on
residents. The seeding process, however, has to necessarily be preceded by data digitization and
centralization.


41.    Data digitization essentially means collation of service delivery data in an electronic
format (database/Excel or similar) from where data can be retrieved using standard Structured
Query Language (SQL) queries. It is also important that personal identity data slowly becomes
consistent across multiple systems. The Aadhaar is also an initiative to standardize personal
identity information, and Aadhaar data may be used to clean the existing data.


42.    Data centralization primarily manages availability and accessibility of distributed service
delivery data. The objective here is for the seeding process/utility to be able to access the service
delivery data and all related information in at least the read-only mode. For instance, in one state
pensioners’ data may be available in data silos across districts. A consolidated view of the entire
data may facilitate the social welfare department of the state to improve the service delivery in
its programs, while also being able to ensure that the same person is not availing double benefits
from two different districts. In case service delivery data is already digitized and centralized, then
no action is required from the seeding perspective.


43.    There are two ways of seeding the service delivery database with the Aadhaar number:
top-down method and organic method. The former uses enrollment information available in the
Know-Your-Residence + (KYR+) and the Electronic Identity (eID)/UID files as input, while the
latter requires a service provider to contact the resident, or vice-versa, for the purpose of
updating the individual’s personal information through a process decided by the service
providerError! Bookmark not defined.. The completion of the seeding process may be followed
by the demographic/biometric authentication, especially where no direct update of the service
delivery database is enabled.


44.    There are some common challengesError! Bookmark not defined. faced during the seeding
process and an understanding of these challenges has resulted in necessary precautions taken
early during the planning process. Some of the common challenges faced are: the complete data
were not captured in the service delivery databases; similar information across different data
sources do not have an exact match among them; the data in the service delivery database is in
a local language; all the required data are not available; and the regular tools cannot handle high
volume of data.




                                                                                    Page 187 of 218
45.        The seeding process typically involves data extraction, consolidation, normalization and
matching. For performing these activities, the UIDAI developed GingerError! Bookmark not
defined., an in-house tool which may be used by service providers after signing a contract
agreeing that the tool is not to be used for purposes other than what it was intended for.


46.        Remote Aadhaar Seeding Framework.                 The UIDAI designed and implemented the
centralized platform hosted by UIDAI, namely the Remote Aadhaar Seeding Framework30 (RASF)
with the objective of enabling the states to expedite their seeding efforts for a faster adoption of
Aadhaar-enabled service delivery. The service provider may use the centralized platform to seed
its service delivery database in a seamless manner by inserting the seeding request and validating
the data; this operation is performed by authorized users from the service providers.


47.        Government and private sector service providers such as those in banking31, insurance32,
capital markets33, telecom34, LPG35, and railways36 have updated their KYC norms to include
Aadhaar as the valid KYC credential.


48.        For stakeholders wishing to leverage the Aadhaar Identity solution in their service delivery
applications, the UIDAI has created a support group and a set of artifacts. The support structure
includes an applications group at the UIDAI, and empanelled consultants and software vendors
to help service providers build necessary processes and applications. Further, there are detailed
support documents for guidance on leveraging and integrating the Aadhaar solution such as:
           a. Applications Onboarding and Readiness for service delivery providers.
           b. Authentication Framework, Operating Model and Guidelines.
           c. Criteria, checklists and activity templates for becoming an AUA or an ASA.
           d. Aadhaar seeding solutions for service delivery databases to embed Aadhaar number.


49.        The UIDAI has defined the registration process for the selection of key players (ASA, AUA,
sub-AUA, etc.) in the delivery of authentication services to the government and private
organizations. The process is simple enough for aspiring agencies to adopt but, at the same time,

it includes the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the agencies selected for the role
are capable of delivering the services. The UIDAI clearly defines the step-by-step process in
applying for the position and provides the supporting documents applicable to each player.


50.        Technical Awareness and Adoption. The UIDAI has setup a public portal37 for building
technical awareness and providing technical support to the user agencies in both public and
private sector. It publishes technical documentations on the portal on a regular basis targeted at
software professionals working in the technology domain and interested in incorporating Aadhaar
authentication into their applications.


51.        eKYC Service. The UIDAI has implemented eKYC service38 through which the service
providers can perform the KYC process electronically with explicit authorization by the resident.
In the eKYC process, the residents authorize the UIDAI through Aadhaar authentication using
either biometric data or OTP to provide their demographic data, along with their photograph
digitally signed and encrypted, to service providers. This helps the service providers perform a
paperless KYC on the residents in real time as part of their service delivery process using the
eKYC function. This could enable service providers to make instant service delivery to residents,
which otherwise could take a few days for activation pending verification of KYC documents,
digitization, etc. Also eliminated are the cost of repeated KYC, paper handling and storage, and
the risk of forged Proof of Identity (PoI) and Proof of Address (PoA) documents.


52.        Aadhaar Payment Bridge (Aadhaar as a Payment Address). The UIDAI implemented the
Aadhaar Payment Bridge (APB) using Aadhaar-enabled payments Infrastructure: a system that
routes money to any resident on the basis of the Aadhaar number. This system facilitates
seamless transfers of all welfare scheme payments to beneficiary residents’ Aadhaar-Enabled
Bank Account (AEBA). At the time of Aashaar enrollment, residents provide their existing bank
account details or request for the opening of a new account that may be attached to their Aadhaar
number for all welfare scheme payments. The APB maintains a repository of residents’ Aadhaar
number with the corresponding primary bank account number used for receiving social security
and entitlement payments from various government agencies. The APB uses the compulsory
Aadhaar number as the primary key for all entitlement payments. This may weed out fake and
ghost identities from the system and ensure that the benefits reach the intended beneficiaries.

53.       The UIDAI solution to financial inclusion makes use of the combination of Aadhaar as a
payment address and the eKYC for instant account creation with the Aadhaar-enabled payment
infrastructure. The funds are able to reach residents with an Aadhaar number, irrespective of
whether they have a bank account or not. If they have an AEBA, the money can be transferred into
it. If they do not have one, an instant account may be created on the basis of the Aadhaar number
with a debit freeze. The money that is transferred is credited into the instant account which is
activated during the first withdrawal on the basis of the eKYC function.


II. Estonia

1.        Estonia has one of the most advanced eSocieties in the world. An incredible success story
that grew out of the partnership between a forward-thinking government, a pro-active ICT sector,
and a switched-on, tech-savvy population. Seventy-eight percent of the population aged 16-74
years uses the Internet39 (Statistics Estonia). Seventy-one percent of households have Internet
capabilities (Statistics Estonia, 2011) and all the Estonian Schools are connected to the Internet.


2.        Estonia did not have any national personal identification document – neither physically
nor electronically. Hence, Estonia implemented the eID system to identify its citizens and alien
residents within the country using the ID card as the primary identification document.


3.        The ID card provides two main functions. The first is as a physical form of identity – used
as a regular ID in conventional real-world situations, anywhere one may typically need to prove
identity, age and so on. The second function is for electronic identification − it enables citizens
to use the same card to electronically authenticate to websites and networks, and/or to digitally
sign communications and transactions, as required.


4.        The first electronic ID card was issued in 2002; it was issued to 130,000 residents that
first year40. As of January 2012, more than 1.1 million people in Estonia (almost 90 percent of
inhabitants) had ID cards41. The Estonian ID card is used for delivering auxiliary identity services
and it is the mandatory document for personal identification of residents from the age of 15. It
can be used for signing documents electronically, for personal identification, and for data

encryption functions. The card has two certificates in X.509 v3 format and two associated private
keys protected by a PIN saved on the ID card: (a) a certificate for digital personal identification,
data signing and encryption; and (b) a certificate for digital signing, enabling the cardholder to
issue a eSignature. On ID cards issued after January 1, 2007, the certificates are valid for as long
as the card itself, i.e., five years; and there is no need to renew the certificates.42 The card bears
the personal digital file containing the residents’ personal profile43. The card is a smart card and
complies with ISO/IEC 7816 standard. The ID card was created to function both as a physical ID
and an electronic ID and may be valid for up to ten years. In emergency cases (e.g., loss of the
card), the certificates can be suspended, if required – disabling the ability to use the card for
electronic authentication and transactions.


5.         The digital certificates issued in association with the ID card scheme are qualified
certificates as per the European Digital Signature e directive 1999/93/EC44.


6.         Apart from physical identification for service delivery, the key eID services delivered are
eSignature (digitally sign eDocuments), authentication (electronic authentication of the resident),
and document encryption. They are used by service providers in the government and the private
sector as the common auxiliary services enabling service delivery.


7.         The digital personal authentication service authenticates the resident electronically at the
time of the eService delivery using the personal identification certificate on the eID document.
The personal identification certificate contains the information about the resident and the
resident can prove that it is him/her by entering the PIN. Desktop and web applications use this
information to identify the users at the time of service delivery.


8.         The eSignature enables residents to sign eDocuments digitally using the signing
certificate and a pair of keys on their eID document (ID card or mobile phone) apart from the
identification certificate. The Estonia ESignature Act (ESA)45 passed in 2000 ensures that the
eSignature of the resident given with the signing key pair on the e-ID token that have the validity

certificate has legal binding and is equal to a traditional signature. Estonia is one of the few
European countries where the electronic signature functionality is not optional.


9.     The certificates contain the cardholder’s name and personal ID number, and the
authentication certificate also contains an official email address unique to each cardholder.
Estonia provides an official email address to each citizen. The email address is used for official
government communications, but it can also be used for private communications. A citizen’s
email address is in the format “firstname.lastname_NNNN@eesti.ee” where NNNN represents four
random digits. Every cardholder can also receive email at the address “ID_CODE@eesti.ee” where
ID_CODE represents the personal ID number of the citizen. Estonia does not provide an email
service to its citizens; instead, the email address acts as a relay, and citizens specify an email
account where the messages are delivered. All email addresses are publicly listed on Estonia’s
National Registry of Certification Service Providers’ certificate directory.


10.    The government implemented reliable and trustworthy identification infrastructure in
Estonia, receiving high acceptance by citizens and businesses and hence becoming a success in
terms of effectiveness and efficiency of its use in everyday life.


11.    Given that the eID infrastructure is a very sensitive area in the public administration of
Estonia, it has been designed to be highly reliable and provides fulltime technical support. The
technical solution is based on the already proven technology that is provided by inner country
software and vendors. The solution is scalable, flexible, and standards-based for expansion to
other services as well as forward-looking to also enable cross-border use.


12.    The digital stamp is a service that allows legal entities (e.g., companies) to sign documents
digitally. It is an equivalent of the ID card for companies. This confirms that the document comes
from the company that has signed it and that the document has not been changed in the interim.
Signatures (also in large quantities) can be attached to invoices, payment orders, confirmations,
certificates, bank statements (e.g., SEB bank offers an automatically digi-stamped bank
statement), etc. The company is issued a USB crypto-stick that has an X.509 certificate and,
similar to the eSignature, when the stamp is used, a container in DigiDOC format may be created
that contains the signed data.


13.    The eID documents offer the functionality to encrypt and decrypt eDocuments using the
authentication certificate. This function is primarily meant for the safe transport of files in an
unsafe environment (e.g., the Internet) as opposed to the long-term storage of data.


                                                                                   Page 192 of 218
14.        In Estonia, the usage of eID is regulated by the ESAError! Bookmark not defined. and the Identity
ocuments Act46, on the basis of which the Estonian ID card is issued. Estonia launched its
electronic ID card program in February 1999 when the Estonian Parliament passed the Identity
Documents Act. The Act became effective January 1, 2000, and established national guidelines
for the creation of a mandatory national identity card for the citizens of Estonia and permanent
resident aliens of the age of 15 years and above. Before this, Estonia did not have a national
personal identification document.


15.        The Identity Documents Act also states that the deduplicated and processed residents
demographic and biometric data used for the personalization of the identity card is also entered
into the National Population Register pursuant to the Population Register Act47.


16.        The specific legislation associated with eSignatures, the ESA, was passed separately by
the Estonian Parliament (Riigikogu) on March 8, 2000, and came into force on December 15,
2000. This law regulates the framework and rules required to effectively govern a national Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) and eSignature infrastructure. The primary aim of the ESA was to give
electronic signatures the same level of trust and assurance as handwritten signatures. As a rule
the handwritten and eSignatures may be equivalent in both the public and private sector. The ESA
also states that public service departments could accept digitally signed documents. The ESA
requires that each eSignature may uniquely identify the signatory, bind the individual to the
signed data, and ensure that the signed data cannot be tampered with retrospectively without
invalidating the signature itself.


17.        Rules and Regulations for Certificate Service Providers. One of the core components of
the ESA was the establishment of rules and regulations with regard to Certificate Service Providers
(CSPs) that issue digital certificates to users and manage related security services. The ESA
mandates a number of stringent financial and procedural requirements to ensure that CSPs are
set up and managed properly to perform their function to the highest possible standard.


18.        Rules and Regulations for Timestamp Service Providers. The ESA also regulates time
stamping services that are provided by the Timestamp Service Providers (TSPs). The TSPs have to
adhere to similar laws and regulations as CSPs. The timestamp is simply a piece of information

                                                                                                Page 193 of 218
that attests to the occurrence of an event at a specific time. The ESA does not define timestamps
in great detail, but it ensures that timestamped data cannot be tampered with or amended without
invalidating the timestamp itself.


19.     Personal Data Protection Act. Personal Data Protection Act regulates the use of personal
data and databases containing personal data by public authorities and private entities. Data
Protection Inspection is the government body overseeing that the requirements of the act are met
and enforcing compliance, if necessary. The strategy for data protection and ID card in Estonia is
that the card may contain as little private data as possible. Instead, the data may be kept in
databases at relevant authorities, and a person can use the card as the key (authorization method)
to access his/her data in the database. Requests by third parties (e.g., representatives of
authorities) for private data are logged and logs are available online for the individual on request
(via the citizen’s portal).


20.     Digital Certificate of Identity. More commonly referred to as Digi-ID, this is a state digital
document for personal identification in an electronic environment and for issuing a eSignature.
Unlike the ID card, Digi-ID is not designed for visual personal identification; therefore, it does
not carry a photo - just the name, personal identification number and validity end-date. Also,
the personal data file is empty on a Digi-ID card, except for the document number field.
Cryptographically, it is a smart card similar to the ID card. While the issuance of an ID card can
take up to a month, Digi-ID cards are issued within minutes from the service points of the Police
and Border Guard Board.


21.     Electronic Residence Card. Issued to foreigners residing in Estonia who are not citizens of
the European Union, the electronic residence card carries the data of the residence permit. In
terms of available electronic services, the functionalities of the residence card and the ID card are
the same. The main difference is that the ID card issued to citizens of Estonia and the EU can be
used as a travel document within the EU, while the residence card cannot be used for travelling
outside of Estonia. Another difference is that the residence card also carries a contactless chip
with the user's fingerprints and face image.


22.     Mobile ID. Given that the penetration of mobile phones in Estonia is more than 100
percent, the government introduced the concept of mobile ID for electronic personal
identification and digital signing to accelerate the adoption of the eID for accessing its eServices.
Mobile ID is an electronic document of personal identification that can be used for electronic
personal identification and digital signing with a mobile telephone, where the mobile phone with


                                                                                    Page 194 of 218
its SIM functions simultaneously as the ID card and the card reader. For using a mobile ID, a
specialized SIM is required to enable the service. It may be obtained by signing a service contract
with a mobile operator. The mobile ID may become usable after it has been activated in the
electronic application environment of the Police and Border Guard Board, where the necessary
certificates are requested. Unlike other documents, certificates of a mobile ID are not saved on
the SIM. Unlike the ID card, a mobile ID cannot be used for document encryption – otherwise,
both DigiDocService and the mobile phone operator may see the decrypted data.


23.        The mobile ID is issued by the national mobile operators in Estonia such as Elisa, EMT48,
at Tele2 at their local stores. Residents approach their mobile operator for the issuance of the
mobile ID at the nearest local store. Residents present their ID card with valid certificates for
getting the mobile ID. A resident has to sign a contract (mobile ID subscription agreement49) with
the mobile operator to get the mobile ID. The government has delegated the responsibility of
issuing mobile ID to the national mobile operators.


24.        Mobile ID Certificate Activation. Residents have to activate the service on their handset
with the specialized SIM. To activate mobile ID service or to apply for certificates, the resident
has to go to the website of the Police and the Border Guard Board50 and submit an application for
the issue of new certificates. To get the certificate for mobile ID, the resident has to fill an online
application form on the police website and enter the ID card into the card reader and follow the
instructions.


25.        The mobile operator charges the resident for the mobile ID service. The charges include
a one-time subscription fee and monthly fees. If the mobile ID is used outside of Estonia, each
mobile ID transaction is charged at the cost of sending one text message as per the package’s
price list.


26.        The government implemented four main operating procedures for implementing the
mobile ID in Estonia. They are:
           a. SIM Provision. The resident may go to any of the service providers offering mobile ID
                service for registering the new mobile ID SIM. The service provider forwards the

           application to the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) and informs the resident of the
           location from where to pick up the SIM. The MNO identifies the user using the ID card
           and, on successful authentication, hands over a new SIM card to the resident or installs
           the software into the resident’s SIM as needed. As part of the provisioning process,
           the SIM is attached to a unique secure signature creation device (SSCD) for the unique
           resident; the SSCD may be later used for issuing a qualified certificate. The SSCD
           certificate is declared active for a particular SIM and is made available to all the TSPs.
           The MNO provides a unique code to the resident for activation of the qualified
           certificate.
       b. User Registration/Certificate Activation. The purpose of the certificate activation
           process is to create and activate a qualified certificate. Residents issue a request to
           activate their qualified certificate using their mobile phone with the new SIM. The
           Registration Authority (RA) initiates the signing request to a resident’s mobile device
           to sign the personal data. The resident verifies the data and signs it by inputting
           his/her device certificate activation code. The RA receives the personal data signed.
           The RA enters additional data including the device certificate and forwards the request
           for certification activation to a Certification Authority (CA). The CA creates and
           activates a qualified certificate and publishes it.
       c. Usage. The service provider requests identity service from a TSP and uses a Global
           System for Mobile Communication (GSM) subscriber number and/or personal
           identification code to identify the resident. The TSP generates the signature request
           and sends it to the resident’s mobile phone. The resident signs the request by entering
           his/her PIN. The TSP receives the signature data and checks its validity and that of the
           certificate. The service provider receives the identity-related services from the TSP.
       d. Termination. It is possible for the resident to stop using the mobile ID for several
           reasons: e.g., the resident may not be using the service, a lost/compromised SSCD,
           the qualified certificate expired, or the resident has violated the user-CA agreement.
           In case of certificate revocation, the RA informs the CA of certification revocation, the
           CA immediately revokes the certificate, and the certificate revocation list (CRL) is
           updated. In case of SIM blocking due to loss or SIM damage, the device certificate is
           taken out of the list of valid SSCDs available to all TSPs.


27.    Interoperability. These auxiliary services have been designed to ensure that they can be
integrated with the existing and planned primary service delivery systems of service providers in
Estonia to enable functionalities such as eSignature, electronic authentication and document
encryption. The interoperability requirements were met by:


                                                                                   Page 196 of 218
      a. Employment of standardized workflows. A standardized workflow was made possible
         by adopting a common document format applicable to each service independent of
         its provider (DigiDoc) and a central common public, service-rendering resource that
         connected national databases.




      b. Centrally provided unique identification number for each Estonian resident. A central
         database of unique identification numbers allocated to each Estonian resident was
         established providing authentication of the cardholder (i.e., the applicant or
         signatory). A centralized infrastructure of a national, unique identification number for
         each Estonian resident was employed to serve their authentication in electronic
         processes.
      c. Common public, service-rendering resource to connect national databases. To enable
         identification and authentication for the various services via a corporate infrastructure,
         a common public, service-rendering resource called X-Road was developed. Based on
         the Internet, X-Road connects public databases and information systems, tools
         centrally developed by the State (i.e., the State Portal Center) and the X-Road Center
         (management and control of the gateway) with the Certification Center for the eID
         cards.
      d. Central single point of access to public services (eCitizen portal). The eID card of
         citizens is just a secure token for various purposes to which access is provided by a
         single point of entry: the eCitizen portal.
      e. Standardized workflows using a uniform document format (DigiDoc). To digitally sign
         documents, a communication model using standardized workflows in common
         document format called DigiDoc was employed. The DigiDoc format is based on the
         XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES) standard. The XAdES defines a format
         that structurally enables storage of signed data, signature and security attributes
         associated with eSignature; hence, it lends itself well to having a common
         understanding.


28.   The key organizational roles required for the wPKI/mobile ID operation are:




                                                                                 Page 197 of 218
           a. Mobile Network Operator. The MNO provisions the new SIM to the resident when the
               latter applies for mobile ID. The SIM includes SSCD function as per Directive 1993/93
               EC51.
           b. Registration Authority. The RA is responsible for the user registration and activation
               of the mobile ID.
           c. Certification Authority. The CA manages activation, suspension, and revocation of
               certificates.
           d. Trusted Service Provider. The TSP acts as the central interface in the wPKI
               infrastructure. The main tasks include accepting authentication and signing
               transactions from service providers, passing requests to mobile operators, and
               checking certificate and signature validity.
           e. Relying Party/Service Provider. The SP is a third party that is interested in
               authentication and/or eSignature of the users.


29.        The Estonian ID card scheme is the overall responsibility of the Estonian Governments’
Citizen and Migration Board (CMB). It is responsible for the issuance of identity documents to
citizens and alien residents as required by the governments’ National Identity Act. The CMB is the
institution that physically receives card application forms from residents.


30.        Public-Private-Partnership. The process is managed through a tight public and private
partnership with two key private organizations. AS Sertifitseerimiskeskus (SK), which is a joint
venture formed in 2001 between two of Estonia’s largest banks (Hansapank, Eesti Ühispank), and
telecommunications organizations (Eesti Telefon and EMT) act as Certification Center. TRÜB Baltic
AS, a subsidiary of the TRÜB financial services organization and headquartered in Switzerland, is
the company that personalizes the card itself — physically and electronically. TRÜB receives the
card application from CMB and manufactures the card, printing and engraving the personal data
on the card, generating keys on the chip and embedding the certificates.


31.        SK functions as the certification authority for the Estonian ID card project and manages a
complete range of associated electronic services, including Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) directory service, Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) validation service, and other
certificate-related services. SK manages the end-user distribution channel through its parent
retail bank outlets. SK is responsible for the development and maintenance of the ID-software

that is installed on the resident device for accessing eID services offered by the government. It is
similarly responsible for ID-software installation packages, instructions and video instruction that
is published on the government’s public portal. SK runs the call center and provides email support
services to the resident on behalf of the government.


32.        For processing and controlling eSignatures, the following authorities and agencies are
relevant:
           a. Certification Service Providers. According to the Estonian ESA, the CSPs certify actual
               individuals identifiable by name and ID code. CSPs could be legal entities fulfilling
               specific legal requirements.
           b. Timestamping Service Providers. The ESA also regulates the work of TSPs). The
               requirements for TSPs are generally the same as those for CSPs. According to the ESA,
               a timestamp is simply a data unit that proves that certain data existed at a certain
               moment.


33.        The Estonian Information System Authority52 known as RIA coordinates the development
and administration of the State’s information system; it organizes activities related to information
security, and handles the security incidents that have occurred in Estonian computer networks.
RIA advises the providers of public services on how to manage their information systems as per
requirements, and monitors them. It is also responsible for providing technical support and
national shared IT Infrastructure and services to the government agency responsible for delivering
identity services.


34.        ID-software. The government of Estonia provides the software that are to be installed on
the residents’ Internet-connected device (laptop, desktop, etc.).                        The software, collectively
referred to as ID-software, allows the residents to use their ID card electronically to access private
and government eServices, digitally sign documents, and encrypt documents for safe transfer.
The government provides on its public website53 the steps for installing the ID-software on the
device. During ID-software installation, three programs are installed on the computer:
           a. ID-card Utility. The utility is used by residents to check the functioning of their ID-
               card and the certificate validity, and to extend it when necessary, to change and
               unblock PIN and PIN Unlock Key (PUK) codes, and to configure the @eesti.ee email
               address.

           b. DigiDoc3 Client. This is used to sign digitally with the ID-card and mobile ID, to check
               the validity of eSignatures, and open and save documents inside the signature
               container. Digitally signed containers are files with .bdoc or .ddoc extensions.
           c. DigiDoc3 Crypto. This enables residents to secure files for safe transfer using the ID-
               card and to view secure documents (decrypt). The files are encrypted using the ID-
               card’s authentication certificate and added to the secure container file with the .cdoc
               extension.
           d. Browser Plug-in. This is installed on the residents’ device when accessing the portal
               for the first time. The plug-in requests for the residents’ certificate and the
               corresponding PIN to authenticate their identity before allowing them access to the
               service provider.


35.        Web Portal. The portal is located at http://digidoc.sk.ee; it is available to all cardholders
free of charge. Its functions are similar to the client program — one may use it to generate and
verify eSignatures. In addition, one may use it to have a document signed by a number of people.
With a few clicks of the mouse, the user is able to designate the people whose signatures are
needed on the document, and they can all sign it on the same portal. Every user has a directory
of his/her documents that no one else sees; however, anyone can send documents for the user’s
signature.


36.        SK, together with its partners, delivered the comprehensive eSignature architecture known
as DigiDoc54. It is a universal system for giving, processing and verifying eSignatures. It can be
connected to any new or existing piece of software. Its components are a stand-alone client
program, a web portal and a web service based on Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)55
enabling easy integration of the functionality of digital signing, signature verification, and
authentication with other information systems. The service is usable in different development
environments and platforms featuring SOAP 1.0 encoded support.


37.        SK based the DigiDoc document format on the XML Signature (DSig) standard. In February
2002, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) published its extensions to
XML-DSig as ETSI TS 101 903, also known as XAdES56. DigiDoc document format is a profile of

                                                                                         Page 200 of 218
XAdES, containing a subset of its proposed extension. The XAdES profile of XAdES-X-L (i.e.,
extended long term) is used in the DigiDoc system but “timemarks” are used instead of
“timestamps” and signing and certification validation time comes from the OCSP response. This
profile provides the following information on the signed document:
           a. Certificate used for signing
           b. Signing time
           c. Place of signature
           d. Signer role and resolution
           e. Incorporated full certificate validity information within the signature
           f.   OCSP response
           g. OCSP responder certificate


38.    Based on the document format, a library was developed in the C programming language
that binds together the following:
       a. DigiDoc document format
       b. SK's OCSP validation service
       c. Interfacing with the user's ID card using Windows' native CSP interface or cross
           platform PKCS#11.


39.    eCitizen Portal. The eID card of the resident is a secure token for providing eID services
on the single point of entry: the eCitizen portal. The eID card is used for identification purposes
at the eCitizen portal. After identification, the validity of the citizen’s certificates may be
confirmed using OCSP service; a timestamp is given to the eService application. Using X-Roads,
the Internet gateway, the application messages are securely exchanged.


40.    In order to drive the adoption of eSignatures within the region, the availability of software
and technology to the parties looking to incorporate compatible applications was critical. The
government was not able to find a domestic generic application or implementation that could
fulfill this requirement. Still, it made the decision to not rely on a foreign software or technology
vendor to provide and guarantee support for a critical piece of national infrastructure. A reliance
on foreign suppliers could have detrimental impact on the country’s day-to-day functioning
going forward. Because of these considerations, a bespoke software model was developed
specifically to cater to Estonia and its eSignature constituents.


41.    It is possible to verify signature validity without any additional external information; the
verifier may trust the issuer of the signer’s certificate and the OCSP responder certificate.


                                                                                   Page 201 of 218
42.    Original files along with signatures, validation confirmations and certificates are
encapsulated within container with “SignedDoc” as the root element.


43.    The DigiDoc system framework consists of base libraries, intermediate libraries, web
service and end-user applications.
       a. Software Library. The DigiDoc library is available to all developers as a program library
           in C programming language and as a Windows Component Object Model (COM). It can
           be connected to any existing or new software. For instance, one could add DigiDoc
           support to accounting software, document management system, web and intranet
           applications, and so on.
       b. OCSP Server. On the server side, DigiDoc provides an RFC2560-compliant OCSP
           server, operating directly off the CA master certificate database and providing validity
           confirmations to certificates and signatures.
       c. In order to ensure realtime validity of the certificate, certificate validity information
           may be obtained from a live database rather than from CRL and the time value in the
           OCSP response may be the actual one. To achieve long-term validity of eSignatures, a
           secure log system is employed within the model. All OCSP responses and changes in
           certificate validity are securely logged to preserve eSignature validity.


44.    DigiDoc Security Model. One of the most challenging issues in eSignature systems is the
question of validating a signature long after it was given. Often, the hassle of ensuring the validity
of a signer’s certificate at the time of signing is left to the verifiers. In DigiDoc based on
OpenXAdES, the proof of validity of the signer’s certificate is obtained at the time of signature
creation. This proof may be obtained in the format of the OCSP response from the standard OCSP
service and stored within the signed document.


45.    DigiDoc service provides separate methods for mobile authentication and mobile signing,
namely MobileAuthenticate, MobileSign and MobileCreateSignature. All three methods accept
mobile ID users’ personal identification code and/or phone number as input parameter. Using
just the phone number for user identification is not recommended as mobile numbers are public
and may result into security issues. It is recommended that both phone number and personal
identification code be used since the latter is not public information and may be a safer option.




                                                                                    Page 202 of 218
46.        Wireless Public Key Infrastructure57. Mobile ID is based on the wPKI specification that is
the wireless implementation of the PKI. With wPKI, mobile phone operates as a smart card reader
with display. The communication between the PC/service and the mobile phone goes through
mobile signing/authentication service on the phone and mobile gateway of the GSM operator.


47.        The mobile gateway uses the Over-The-Air (OTA) technology58 to communicate and run
the applications on the SIM of the mobile phone without being connected physically to the card.
The DigiDoc service sends the authentication/signing request (wPKI Request59) to the back-end
system of the network operator that, in turn, sends the request to the OTA gateway/server. The
OTA gateway transforms the request into short messages and sends them onto a Short Message
Service Center (SMSC) that transmits them to the residents’ mobile phone. The OTA gateway gets
the service request using the OTA gateway API. The OTA gateway maintains the database of cards
issued and activated with details such as SIM vendor, the card’s identification number, the
International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and Mobile Station International Subscriber
Directory Number (MSISDN). The OTA gateway has a set of libraries that contains the formats to
use for each type of SIM that it uses for formatting the service request into a message that can
be understood by the residents’ phone. The OTA gateway sends the message to the SMSC using
the right parameters as described in GSM 03.48. The SMSC may send a message of a maximum
length of 160 alphanumeric characters to and from the mobile phone. If the mobile phone power
is off or has left the coverage area, the message is stored and offered back to the subscriber
when the mobile phone is powered on or has entered back into the coverage area of the network.
The communication between the SIM and the OTA gateway is done by SMS exchange using the
SMS channel.


48.        The mobile phone should be Phase 2+ in the GSM standard60 and could have the SIM
Application Toolkit (STK)61 with the OTA services support compliant with the GSM standards62.

49.        In Estonia today, usage of eID cards as a proof of identity is more common among
professionals and enthusiasts. This is due mainly to the time needed for people to change their
mindset, the lack of applications, initial technical glitches that discouraged some first-time users,
and the relative higher cost of ID card readers. The ID card is widely used as a token for
verification of valid eTickets in the public transport system and it are cheaper than paper ticket.
The eID function of the bank card is more frequently used than the ID card. As the use of eID
card is cost-effective to banks and assuring to citizens in terms of Internet security, economic
common sense may support the shift from bank cards to eID cards for public service applications.


50.        The government of Estonia has taken the following measures to improve the adoption of
the eID by residents:
           a. To encourage eID use among residents, the government has published on its public
               portal the steps necessary to installing its ID-software on residents’ Internet-
               connected devices. The video instructions for software installation have also been
               uploaded to further guide residents.
           b. The public portal also provides video instructions for digitally signing eDocuments
               using the ID-card or mobile-ID using DigiDoc service.
           c. A test service installed by the government for use by residents to check the
               performance of their ID-Software and card reader, is working properly; it gives access
               to eID services.
           d. The government has also set up a call center and email support for residents needing
               assistance with software installation and eID services.
           e. The government provides the Digidoc63 and other services specification documents
               that may be useful to service providers wishing to access the eSignature functionality
               in their delivery applications.


III. Belgium

Official Web Site: http://eid.belgium.be/en/

1.         Belgium has three statutory electronic identity documents: the eID for citizens over the
age of twelve, the kids-ID for children under twelve, and the foreigners’ card for foreigners living
in Belgium.




63   DigiDoc Service Specifications - http://www.sk.ee/upload/files/DigiDocService_spec_eng.pdf

                                                                                                  Page 204 of 218
2.         The identity card is the proof that the residents’ personal information has been entered
in the National Population Register in Belgium. The residents can use the ID card to prove their
nationality and identity. All the citizens of Belgium automatically receive an electronic identity
card at the age of twelve. They provided by the local registry office. The citizens above the age
of 15 years are required to carry the identity card at all the times.


3.         In Belgium, the eID has been implemented using the electronic identity card. The Belgium
eID card is a smart card with a built-in chip. The chip contains authentication and signature
certificates along with the PIN for each certificate.


4.         The eID card is used to deliver electronic identification and authentication, and eSignature
services. The authentication certificate is used to confirm the identity of residents at the time of
logging on to a website with the residents’ eID. The signature certificate enables the eSignature
for the residents. Residents are eligible to use their eSignature from the age of 18 years. Residents
go to local registry office to activate the signature certificate on the card.


5.         The kids-ID using Hello Service64 provides kids the extra protection in case of emergency.
The service makes it possible to contact parents (or family, friends, neighbors, etc.) by phone if
a child is in difficulty. Once the service is activated, people who find a missing child could have a
number to call; the application automatically calls the number that has been specified. A user
may specify up to seven numbers. If no one answers, the call is automatically transferred to the
emergency number of Child Focus that is available 24 hours a day.


6.         To use the eID with the government and private sector service providers, the resident
requires a computer with supported operating system and a card reader attached to the
computer.


7.         The resident could have to install the eID software that enables the eID to be used on the
computer. The software recognizes the card in the card reader as an electronic identity card and
ensures that the data on the card’s chip are read.


8.         The Federal Public Service for Information and Communication Technology (Fedict) has
developed simple software for supported operating system to install the eID software on the




64   Hello Service - http://www.halloouders.be/

                                                                                     Page 205 of 218
computer; it is called eID QuickInstall65. The software is available for download on the website of
the government of Belgium‘s public portal for eID66. Residents may install the software by
following onscreen instructions that show up by running the program. The software checks the
configuration of the computer and installs drivers for the card reader and eID software. On
successful installation the software, using the testing service67 provided by Fedict, reads the data
on the card to check if everything is working as designed. The software also provides the
mechanism to install regular updates to the software.


9.         The eID works with a PIN code and PIN Unlock Key (PUK) code. The PIN code is issued by
the government and is found in the sealed letter from the local government when collecting the
eID. The PIN code is a 12-digit number and can be updated by the resident. The letter also
includes the PUK code. The resident is advised to visit the local registry office with the PIN and
PUK codes that could then be used to activate the microchip on the eID card with assistance from
staff. The PIN code is the personal code used by the resident each time an eID-based service
delivery application is accessed; it could also be used for issuing eSignature. The PUK code is only
for activating or unblocking the eID.


10.        Fedict has set up its own online service desk to support residents in solving software
installation and usage problems. The residents may fill a contact form68 on the Fedict website to
report problems.


11.        Federal Public Service Home Affairs along with Federal Public Service Foreign Affairs,
Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation and the Federal Police has set up free DOC STOP
service69 and the CheckDoc Service to protect the privacy of the data on the card and prevent
identity fraud. DOC STOP helps to avoid risks of fraudulent use as well the unfavorable financial
consequences. It enables residents to block the identity card immediately if it is lost or stolen.
The resident could have to call a toll-free DOC STOP number to report the card lost or stolen and
to have it blocked. The service is available 24 hours every day year-round.

12.        CheckDoc70 enables verification in realtime of the validity of the Belgian identity
documents; it also identifies stolen, lost, expired, invalid or never-used identity documents. To
use the service, the resident or the user organization has to fill in a form and access the website
with the user name and password provided on successful registration.


13.        The government portal provides a list of eID-supported public and private sector
applications71.


14.        Fedict has opted for Open-Source Software (OSS) and intensive collaboration with
developers. The source code for the eID initiatives is, therefore, available to interested parties
who may view the software and propose and/or make improvements. This cross-fertilization in
which experts worldwide make modifications, improves the stability and quality of the source
code. In line with this approach, Fedict has produced an eID Developers’ Guides72. They contain
guidelines for developing eID applications by means of examples.


15.        Fedict is promoting the use of eID in both the public and private sector applications by
providing developers with eID building blocks73, the basic blocks of eID applications. It provides
services to the government departments in the integration of the eID into their own applications.
The services provided by Fedict are available on their public portal in the identification and
security74 section.


16.        The eID building blocks includes:
           a. eID-Software and eID Applet75. The eID software ensures the use of the eID on the
                resident’s computer. The software provides the user interface and it recognizes the
                card in the card reader as an electronic identity card. The source code is available as
                an open source project76 and Fedict maintains an online mailing list and discussions
                for developer support77.

           b. ESignature Service78. The ESS is a service that can be used by web applications to
               apply or check a eSignature against an eID. ESS supports various document formats
               and provides all the necessary interactions with the user. Signatures applied via the
               ESS comply with XAdES specifications and European Directives 2009/767/EC. The
               source code is available as an open source project79.
           c. eID Identity Provider80. The eID identity provider allows a web application to be made
               accessible using the eID. This building block contains all the functionalities needed to
               correctly authenticate the user of an application with an eID. The source code is
               available as an open-source project81.
           d. Quick Key Toolset82. The EZ Key or Quick Key Toolset means that a Java smartcard can
               behave like an eID. In this way, the EZ Key is opening the door to the future, when
               electronic identity may be less dependent on possible carriers. The source code is
               available as an open-source project83.


17.        Fedict also provides an eID Software Development Kit84 to enable the developers to use
the content of the eID card from the desktop application. The Software Development Kit (SDK)
includes the eID Middleware85 and is based on Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #11.


18.        Fedict86 is responsible for developing the software for the elD card. It defines and
implements the federal eGovernment strategy. It uses innovative information and communication
technology to help the various federal public services to improve their service portfolios. To this
end, Fedict tailors technology to meet the needs of the general public, business and civil servants.
