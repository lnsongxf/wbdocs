Context
Climate change is a threat to the core mission of the World Bank Group
(WBG). Current weather extremes already affect millions of people, putting
food and water security at risk, and threatening agricultural supply chains and
many coastal cities. Without further action to reduce extreme poverty, provide
access to basic services, and strengthen resilience, climate impacts could push
an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030. Climate change presents
enormous challenges and opportunities for development, making it essential
that climate and development be tackled in an integrated way.
   The world needs to feed nine billion people by 2050, provide affordable
energy access to all, and extend housing and services to two billion new urban
dwellers—and to do so while minimizing emissions and boosting resilience.
Recent global developments favor bold climate action by the WBG. At the
most recent Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, 140 World Bank cli-
ent countries committed to implement their Nationally Determined Contri-
butions (NDCs) as part of an agreement to limit global warming to less than
2°C by 2100, and make best efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. Countries start
from different points and have different emission levels, and therefore need
differentiated actions and support. These differences translate into different
climate commitments in the NDCs, and into different needs in terms of sup-
port that the WBG can and will provide.
   In Sub-Saharan Africa, the World Bank’s Turn Down the Heat report has
shown that food security will be the overarching challenge derived from cli-
mate change, with dangers from droughts, flooding, and shifts in rainfall.
Between 1.5°C–2°C warming, drought and aridity, will contribute to farmers
losing  40–80 percent of cropland conducive to growing maize, millet, and
sorghum by the 2030s–2040s, the researchers found. In a 4°C warmer world,
around the 2080s, annual precipitation may decrease by up to 30 percent in
southern Africa, while East Africa will see more rainfall, according to multi-
ple studies. Ecosystem changes to pastoral lands, such as a shift from grass to
woodland savannas as levels of carbon dioxide increase, could reduce food for
grazing cattle. The World Bank’s Climate Change Action Plan reconfirms the
WBG’s commitment to increase the climate-related share of its portfolio from
21 to 28 percent by 2020 in response to client demand, with total financing
(including leveraged co-financing) of potentially $29 billion per year by 2020.
   The Transport Chapter to the African Climate Business Plan is strongly
aligned with the corporate priorities of the institution highlighted above. It also
acts as a first step in streamlining the work of the Transport & ICT Global Prac-
tice with the priorities of our client countries in the current and future reality of
climate change. Further work is already underway to strengthen that effort with
deeper changes in the way we do business. The Transport Chapter meets WBG
policy purposes: that is, to achieve climate co-benefit targets, and to include
transport as part of the broader ACBP. It is unique because it is a first attempt to
match our investment projects with INDCs of African countries and thus

illustrate a more comprehensive strategy on how to mainstream climate change
mitigation and adaptation components into our project pipeline.



Background
The objective of this Transport Chapter, a component of the broader Africa
Climate Business Plan (ACBP), is to begin to mainstream climate benefits
into the World Bank’s transport program for Sub-Saharan Africa, the better to
assist African countries in bringing their climate change efforts to scale. It is a
first step towards mainstreaming responses to the climate challenge into
transport programs in Africa, and it represents the first time the Transport &
ICT GP has produced a work plan for its investment and technical assistance
operations that takes into account the content of countries’ Intended Nation-
ally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and attempts to align World Bank
support to the goals stated therein.
   The transport work plan under this Africa Climate Business Plan will con-
sist of up to $3.2 billion in investments and technical assistance over the
2016–2020 period—including $2.8 billion in World Bank funds. Those
investments will help to make progress on two strategic objectives: (1) improv-
ing the resilience of African transport infrastructure to climate change by
defining four pillars of resilient transport; and (2) improving the carbon-
efficiency of transport systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. The sections below
describe the approach taken to each in greater detail.
   Climate change is of substantial concern to the governments and people of
African countries, and this Transport Chapter represents a first step towards
a normative goal of broad and systematic incorporation of resilience and low-
carbon design into future planning and investment in the transport sector.
The Chapter and its work plan will be adjusted in the future as countries and
financing agencies learn together how best to approach these challenges. The
World Bank hopes to contribute to that learning through its own program of
advisory services and analytics to refine the tools and techniques available to
meet the climate challenge in transport. Over time, in this manner it will be
possible to better define a new climate business plan for transport in Africa,
one which does business in a fundamentally different manner than it has in
the past.



1. Climate Change: A Resilience Challenge
for African Transport Systems
The demand for safer, more efficient and more affordable transport in
Sub-Saharan Africa is enormous. Two-thirds of Africa’s rural population still
lives more than two kilometers away from an all-season road. In some of the
countries on the continent, transport costs represent up to 30 percent of the
poorest households’ monthly income.1 Like elsewhere in the world, African
people depend on transport to bring their children to school, to go and sell their

4	              Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Transport in Sub-Saharan Africa
products at local markets, to access job opportunities as well as other social and
economic services. Transport is also essential to African rural economies:
increased transportation connectivity is needed to allow increased harvests to
find their way to markets, to enable efficient distribution of agricultural inputs,
and to allow for efficient movement of food products. Moreover, disruption to
the main road network has a major impact on the economy at various levels,
both in terms of trade at the national level and for affected communities who
face a loss of marketing opportunities, and shortages and higher costs of house-
hold consumables. In South Sudan for example—where the World Bank helped
build rural roads—farmers could not think beyond subsistence farming because
they had no means to bring their crops to markets.
   Climate change has already started to affect African countries’ efforts to
provide better transport services to their citizens. In the African context,
transport operations and the infrastructure on which they depend are both
vulnerable to different kinds of climate impacts and vulnerabilities manifest
themselves in different ways. African transport systems are vulnerable to
multiple types of climate impact: sea level rise and storm surge, higher fre-
quency and intensity of extreme wind and storm events, increased precipita-
tion intensity, extreme heat and fire hazard, overall warming and change in
average precipitation patterns. The increased frequency and intensity of
extreme climate event challenges the year-round availability of critical trans-
port services: roads are damaged more often or are more costly to maintain;
expensive infrastructure assets such as ports, railway or airports can be dam-
aged by storms and storm surges and they have a more limited life span and
capacity than expected. Ultimately, these new factors can overall place
increased stress on national transportation systems, increasing the risk of fail-
ure if sudden extreme events occur. The weakest points in transport systems
are the first ones to suffer from the impact of extreme climate events. Yet, the
location of these critical points and the areas with the greatest exposure to
extreme climate events are rarely known. Critical infrastructures, such as
bridges, continue to be built based on assumptions and risk patterns from the
experience and data of prior decades.
   Ignoring the trend of greater exposure of transport infrastructure assets to
climate risk has a significant cost. Transport is a capital intensive sector and
most if not all African countries are undergoing significant budget constraints
and they have multiple competing priorities. Much transport infrastructure
finds its economic justification in the long term (20, 30 or even 50 years). A
shorter lifetime because of a poor appreciation of exposure to climate risk can
significantly jeopardize the development benefits of expensive transport
investments.
   Improving the resilience2 of transport infrastructure is generally not cost
neutral. Global estimates suggest that the cost to adapt to climate change in a
2 degrees-warmer world range from $70 billion to $100 billion per year per
2050.3 Urban infrastructure accounts for about 54 percent of infrastructure
adaptation costs, followed by railways at 18 percent, and roads (mostly paved)
at 16 percent. Very often, investment decisions in transport infrastructure
end up in a difficult trade-off between either building more or building better.

Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Transport in Sub-Saharan Africa	                5
Without a proper vulnerability assessment, a poor appreciation of the expo-
sure to the climate risk can ultimately lead to unnecessary, over-dimensioned
infrastructure, at the expense of increased access, often to the poorest
segments of the population. Finding the “sweet spot” between under-
dimensioned existing standards and poor planning practices, and over-
dimensioned infrastructure or overly conservative planning is essential. In
order to be effective, such an exercise has to be properly informed by a credi-
ble vulnerability and risk assessment. Proper investment assessment method-
ologies can help decision making under uncertainty. These methodologies do
not rely on predictions of the future in project design but rather are intended
at answering the question “what are the future conditions that make the trans-
port system fail?”
   Risk screening is one of the tools that are available to decision makers in
order to identify at an early stage the climate and geophysical hazards that
could impact the design of a strategy or a project. The World Bank has devel-
oped a suite of climate and disaster risk screening tools, including those rele-
vant to transport systems.4
   Many of these notions are already very familiar to African nations. Six of
the “V20” or “Vulnerable 20” group of the top nations from all over the world
that are most affected by the catastrophes rooted from climate change are
African (Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Rwanda and Tanzania). Most
INDCs prepared by African countries in preparation to COP21 had identi-
fied transport as a major sector of focus to reduce GHG emissions in key
contributing sectors. In addition, several of these INDCs had highlighted the
adaptation dimension (i.e., assessing the climate risk and improving the resil-
ience of transport infrastructure) as one of the most important issues to be
tackled as part of their climate change strategy.
   Globally, transport is a major contributing sector to climate change and
actions to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and stabilize warming
at 2 degrees Celsius will fall short if they do not include the transport sector.
In 2012, emissions from transport comprised approximately 23 percent of
total energy-related CO2 emissions worldwide, making it the second-largest
emitting sector after electricity and heat generation. Moreover, with annual
growth averaging well above 2% from 1990–2012, transport emissions may
now be growing faster than those of any other energy end-use sector. Africa
has the lowest historical greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of any continent,
but its emissions are also now growing rapidly, driven by a sharp increase in
fossil fuel use. In large African cities like Lagos or Dakar, inefficient transport
modes are not only contributing to climate change through poor carbon-
efficiency, but also generating other negative externalities such as health or
road safety concerns. Urban air pollution in African cities is on the rise, due
to rapid economic and population growth and an increase in motorization. It
is now estimated to cause roughly 49,000 deaths per year in the region.5 Also,
Africa has less than 3 percent of the world’s motor vehicles, but more than
11  percent of global road fatalities. Similarly, railroad transport can both
lower the cost of moving large quantities of goods and improve carbon effi-
ciency. For example, an independent study commissioned for the US Federal

6	              Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Transport in Sub-Saharan Africa
Railroad Administration, found that on average, rail was four times more fuel
efficient than trucks, reducing GHG emissions by 75 percent.6 A modal shift
to more carbon-efficient transport modes such as public urban transport or
rail transport can therefore generate both significant climate and develop-
ment co-benefits.
   Many of these issues are also very familiar to World Bank teams who are
helping developing countries in designing and implementing their transport
programs in development countries all over the world, including in Sub-
Saharan Africa. Maximizing development benefits through the identification
of the best investment options is often at the core of the policy dialogue of
many transport programs. However, concretely addressing the resilience
challenge of African transport systems, caused by climate change, is still a
new area which has just started to be operationalized in World Bank opera-
tions. The objective of the proposed business plan is to assist African coun-
tries in bringing this topic to scale.



2. Africa’s Commitment to the Climate Agenda
and the Role of Transport
Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) are a new legally
binding instrument created under the UNFCCC at the Paris COP in 2015,
documenting actions that countries (both developed and developing) intend
to take on climate change and representing a bottom-up, nationally deter-
mined process. INDCs may also give new life to transport-specific Nationally
Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA), by making them a critical short-
term measure to prepare for emission reduction or adaptation strategies in a
post-2020 framework. The Partnership on Sustainable, Low Carbon Trans-
port (SLoCaT) has reported that so far 38 Sub-Saharan African countries
have submitted their INDCs to the UNFCCC as of December 2015. Of those
submissions 84 percent (32 INDCs) have explicit emission reduction inter-
ventions proposed for the transport sector and 42 percent committed to a
transport sector specific emissions reduction target. Some Sub-Saharan Afri-
can countries, such as Burkina Faso, have even committed to transport emis-
sion reduction targets that are higher than economy-wide targets (see Table 1).
   Transport related emission reduction measures of most INDCs submitted
by African nations focus on the development of low-carbon transport tech-
nologies which encourage, among other policies, an increased efficiency of

vehicle technology and fuel efficiency (i.e., Cameroon, Uganda and Gambia),
and reduction of black carbon pollutants from diesel-fueled vehicles (i.e.,
Mauritania and Central African Republic) and the promotion of urban and
public transport initiatives (i.e., Congo, Gabon and Guinea). A number of
countries have established indirect transport emission reduction targets in
their INDCs, including target variables such as public transport mode share,
renewable energy share or fuel consumption reduction, as a means to reach
desired emission reductions (see examples in Table 2).
   Some Sub-Saharan African countries are also prioritizing improvement in
vehicle inspection and maintenance, fuel quality and vehicle emission stan-
dards, which could provide significant reductions in air pollutants. For exam-
ple, Benin has pledged as part of its INDC to improve traffic flow in large
cities, introduce duty relief for taxes on public transit vehicles, develop a
river-lagoon transport system with navigable rivers, modernize and extend its
rail infrastructure, and further develop its urban public transport. Another
notable champion in emphasizing transport-specific emission reduction
measures is Rwanda which has committed itself to developing efficient and
resilient transport systems by 2030. In particular, the country has pledged to
develop an efficient resilient transport systems by implementing Standard-
ized Route Optimization planning and implementation, building a 17 km Bus
Rapid Transit corridor and 6 modern interchanges which will result in GHG
emissions reductions estimated at 1,260,000 tCO2e; enforcing fleet renewal
and scrapping; and setting emission standards (equivalent to Euro standards)
for new vehicles.
   Other INDCs have also made explicit reference to the capital expenditures
necessary to reach domestic transport emission reduction targets using quan-
titative approaches such as cost-benefit analysis, multi-criteria analysis,
co-benefits and marginal abatement curves, which can help to further sup-
port investment needs analysis. Table 3 gives examples of projected invest-
ment requirements to implement proposed transport emission reduction
measures among INDCs. Increasing details on needed investments can help
to ensure that bold transport measures proposed in INDCs will be matched
with required sources of funding.

                     Fewer countries have included transport-specific adaptation measures as
                  part of their INDCs. The transport sector is mentioned in general terms
                  among climate adaptation measures that focus on climate proofing of infra-
                  structure investments in at least 18 percent of all INDCs submitted by
                  Sub-Saharan African countries. Most references to indirect adaptation mea-
                  sures mention vulnerability assessments and infrastructure resilience plan-
                  ning (see examples given in Table 4).
                     However, some African countries have already demonstrated their leader-
                  ship in implementing a Transport Adaptation agenda more concretely as part
                  of their INDCs. Liberia has committed to implement and reinforce design
                  standards and planning codes for roads and other infrastructure to cope with
                  flooding, sea level rise and windstorm whilst maintaining and upgrading
                  roads with appropriate drainage systems. It supplements its policies by fur-
                  ther strengthening early warning systems and evacuation planning for intense
                  rainfall events and floods and install signs high above the ground that can
                  alert pedestrians and motorists of unsafe zones, such as low-lying areas.
                     Other countries have further invested in national capacity building and
                  knowledge sharing policies; for example, Equatorial Guinea is integrating cli-
                  mate change and climate variability issues in policy and planning processes at
                  national, regional and local levels. The government is addressing the impor-
                  tance of strengthening institutional capacity by emphasizing the integration
                  of climate risk management in coastal areas and disseminating lessons learned

3. Vulnerability of African Transport Systems
to Climate Change
The Impact of Climate Change on Transport Systems
The vulnerability of a transport system is a function of the potential impact of
climate change—based on location and thus its exposure and sensitivity to
climate change—and its adaptive capacity, broadly defined to include both
providers and users.7 The exposure is determined by the type, magnitude,
timing and speed of climate events and variation to which a system is exposed
(for example, changing onset of the rainy season, higher minimum winter
temperatures, higher maximums, more frequent high temperatures, floods,
storms and heat waves.8 The sensitivity of a system depends on its structural
characteristics—for example, poorly maintained assets are more sensitive
than better maintained assets. Location also matters: settlements and hence
transport assets are often concentrated in coastal areas, particularly in West
Africa, where climate hazards are particularly challenging.
   The adaptive capacity of the road system is also essential. The ability to
quickly deploy resources to repair damaged roads and bridges is essential.
With the assistance of the World Bank, many African countries have set up
road maintenance funds, generally financed by fuel levies and other ear-
marked charges and taxes. Many of these funds have established a specific
provision to finance emergency maintenance and quickly restore the continu-
ity of the road system. The Road Maintenance Fund of Cape Verde is a good
example: in order to be ready to address the country’s high exposure to cli-
mate shocks, this Fund has allocated a dedicated amount of resources for
emergency repairs and maintenance. Sound adaptive capacity could also
include the ability to close the road and reroute traffic with minimal delay.
Moreover, alternative systems for immediate response such as force accounts
should be considered for their potential to reduce the time taken to secure
funding and procure permanent repairs.
   The potential impacts of climate change on transport systems include dam-
age to the physical infrastructure and disruptions of transport operations (see
Table 5).
   A transport system that has low resilience to actual and expected climate
change can impose high costs for maintenance and repair. A World Bank-led
study combining 95 future climate scenarios for all of Sub-Saharan Africa
forecasts that maintenance costs on the existing road network will experience
an increase of between 60% and 160% over current levels by 2050 using only
reactive adaptation to climate change. The corresponding increase in

                     primary roads in Sub-Saharan Africa has been estimated at $5.2 billion. Using
                     a proactive adaptation policy, the additional cost would decrease to $2.64 bil-

                     high vulnerability to extreme weather was demonstrated by the floods of
                     2000, 2001, 2012 and 2013, which together carried a restoration cost of

4. Proposed Framework for Climate-Resilient
Transport in Sub-Saharan Africa
The objective of the proposed business plan is to present a strategy and work
program to mainstream the climate challenge into transport programs in
Sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the proposed business plan focuses on two
strategic objectives: (i) improving the resilience of African transport infra-
structure to climate change; and (ii) improving the carbon-efficiency of trans-
port systems in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Improving the resilience of African transport infrastructure to climate
change. In the context of climate change, African decision makers should be
able to evaluate a range of climate resilient options by taking into account
future climate risk and weighting it against the economic and social costs and
benefits of each option. However, in practice, there are four major factors
which greatly increase the complexity of this task:10
••     Information is incomplete and futures are often deeply uncertain: past
       records are no longer reliable indicators for the future and “stationarity”
       can no longer be used to guide decisions;
••     Transport assets tend to be long-lived: during the operational life of trans-
       port infrastructure, the climate may go through considerable changes;


12	                   Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Transport in Sub-Saharan Africa
                  ••   Adaptation to new norms takes time: adaptation sometimes requires tech-
                       nological changes (such as innovative materials for asphalt that can with-
                       stand long periods of flooding) and involves transitional phases (such as
                       ensuring redundancy in the connectivity of the transport system);
                  ••   Adequate adaptation may not always be possible: Especially in many tropical
                       areas such as in Sub-Saharan Africa, climate change will expose infrastruc-
                       ture and transport services to extreme weather conditions and events that
                       may exceed design thresholds. For example, temperatures that exceed the
                       threshold for the stability of asphalt make roads paved with it unusable.
                     Measures to improve the climate resilience of transport systems can take a
                  number of forms. They can consist of hardening the design of key infrastruc-
                  ture to be more resistant to expected impacts, or conversely designing infra-
                  structure to be cheaply and easily replaced if damaged. Finally, they can
                  consist of increasing the flexibility of “soft” systems so that they can “bounce
                  forward” rapidly to a new high functioning state when shocks occur.
                     In view of this, the approach proposed herein to integrating resilience into
                  transport systems in Africa will rest on four pillars presented in Table 6, below.
                  By combining measures under these four pillars, transport infrastructure and
                  institutions can be made more resilient to climate shocks.

                  Improving the carbon-efficiency of transport systems in Sub-Saharan Africa.
                  Lowering the carbon emissions from all economic sectors is the key to man-
                  aging current and current and future climate risk. In parallel with measures to
                  protect transport systems from the impact of climate change, therefore, part
                  of the challenge is to minimize the overall carbon footprint of transport activ-
                  ity. This is critical to reducing Africa’s exposure to future climate impacts,
                  and, as the second largest emitting sector of CO2, the transport sector is an
                  essential part of the solution.
                     Because of their energy consumption and preponderant reliance on fossil
                  fuels, transport activities emit carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and


Table 6  The Four Pillars of Resilient Transport11
                               The Four Pillars of Climate-Resilient Transport
1.    Sectoral and strategic spatial planning that is informed by assessments of risk and vulnerability whilst
      being aware of the implications climate uncertainty might impose on an institution’s capability to do
      strategic planning and implementation.
2.    Resilient infrastructure solutions, which comprise investments in physical infrastructure, new
      technologies, and community-based adaptation, all designed to ensure that the transport system is
      robust, redundant, and resilient. There are two approaches to infrastructure resilience—for example, in
      the case of flooding, either to design new infrastructure with sufficient capacity to withstand future floods,
      or to design it to be overtopped in recognition of the uncertainty around the future design values that
      should be adopted. Decisions have to be made on a case-by-case basis considering the local context.
3.    Enabling environment: institutional and capacity support, awareness raising, finance to enhance the
      capabilities of the relevant stakeholders at the policy and regulatory level, climate information services
      and hydromet services that entail investments in systems that collect, organize, store, analyze, and share
      climate data.
4.    Post-disaster risk and recovery support to ensure that short- and long-term climate change risk and
      resilience is integrated into rebuilding efforts.

Table 7  The Avoid, Shift, Improve Framework for Low-Carbon Transport

             The Enable, Avoid, Shift, Improve (EASI) Framework for Low-Carbon Transport
1.     ENABLE an efficient and responsible governance system, capable of anticipating needs, guiding action
       and ensuring integrated management and development of the transport system under a low-carbon
       transport framework.
2.     AVOID unnecessary movements of people or goods where possible by changing behaviors or changing
       spatial arrangements to minimize the need for motorized trips; for example, favoring urban plans that co-
       locate residential and commercial uses so that workers can live near their places of work.
3.     SHIFT unavoidable movements from high-carbon modes onto lower-carbon modes; for example,
       encouraging the use of public transit versus private vehicles.
4.     IMPROVE the carbon efficiency of the modes we use; for example, by switching to electric vehicles, or
       improving the fuel efficiency of locomotive engines.




contribute to the risk posed by climate change. However, through careful
investment it is possible to put transport onto a low-carbon development
pathway. Such investments would reduce the emissions associated with trans-
port compared to overall levels of activity as well as emission rates measured
either in absolute or relative terms of emissions per ton-kilometer or passenger-
kilometer, and must be considered an important element of the overall strat-
egy to manage climate risk. Means of lowering the carbon footprint of trans-
portation fall into the four general categories of the Enable, Avoid, Shift,
Improve (EASI) framework, as shown in Table 7.
   Because of long capital life cycles of transport infrastructure, it is important
to avoid investments in carbon-intensive infrastructure that may be afford-
able under current market conditions but become uneconomical in a future
scenario in which the cost of carbon is substantially higher. Such investments
could lock countries into uncompetitive transport systems and cause them to
remain on higher-risk climate pathways for years or decades into the future.



5. The Climate Dimension in On-Going World Bank
Transport Work in Sub-Saharan Africa
Transport is a large sector for the World Bank in Sub-Saharan Africa. The
portfolio of World Bank transport investments currently active in Africa con-
sists of 42 projects amounting to almost US$ 8.4 billion distributed between
21 countries. This large portfolio reflects the capital intensity of transport
investments as well as the high demand for financing in transport from
Sub-Saharan countries. But investment needs remain enormous: the Pro-
gramme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), which was
endorsed in 2012 by the continent’s Heads of State and Government outlined
an ambitious plan to close Africa’s infrastructure gap and enable per capita
income to rise above US$ 10,000 in all the countries of the continent by 2040.
To do so, PIDA calls for an expansion of 37,000 km of highways, alongside
goals for hydroelectric power generation and water storage.

BOX 2  Climate-Resilient Road Construction Standards
and Institutions in Mozambique
Mozambique is vulnerable to widespread and severe flooding due in part to cyclones—notably
in 2000 when a succession of three cyclones affected 650,000 people, including 500,000 displaced
in the Limpopo basin, left 700 dead, and caused an estimated US$ 600 million in damages. It
also has dramatic hydrological characteristics, with 104 river basins, the majority of which have
a torrential regime of 3–4 months of high waters and low flows during the remainder of the year,
corresponding to the marked wet and dry seasons. The country’s approximately 30,000 km of
roads, of which 24,000 km are unpaved, are susceptible to damage from climate and weather
induced problems.

The Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance Project, in addition to repairing damages
from 2013 flooding, is assisting the government to institute the following additional resilience
measures: (i) a comprehensive rewrite of the national design standards and specifications to be
more climate resilient; (ii) setting up an emergency response unit in the national roads agency;
(iii) setting up an immediate response contingency fund; (iv) requiring mandatory climate risk
screening of all road projects; and (v) assessment of climate vulnerability of rural roads to identify
and pilot low-cost resilient designs and alternative maintenance solutions.




                  With the advent of climate change, new practices are emerging. Much of
               the infrastructure financed by current investments may be vulnerable to
               changes in climatic patterns, the direction and magnitude of which are sub-
               ject to substantial uncertainty. In some countries, there may be a need to
               adapt by altering the standards to which infrastructure is constructed. In oth-
               ers, standards may be adequately prescribed but inadequately applied in prac-
               tice. In still others, the best approach may be to identify which elements of
               infrastructure are most vulnerable in order to prioritize them for remedial
               work. In virtually all cases, such as in Mozambique (see Box 2), institutional
               strengthening will need to be an integral part of building resilience to climatic
               events, as institutions are charged with preparing for climatic events as well as
               restoring the system to a functioning state following any disruption. Assess-
               ment tools are needed to evaluate institutional vulnerability.
                  On the mitigation front, important programs such as the Lagos Urban
               Transport project (Box 3) have been highly successful in improving urban
               mobility in one of the largest African cities while at the same time incentiviz-
               ing a significant modal shift to less carbon-incentive urban transport modes.
                  The World Bank began tracking the specific climate co-benefits of its proj-
               ects in fiscal year 2011 (FY11) so some active projects approved before that
               time, such as the Lagos Urban Transit Project or the Mozambique Roads and
               Bridges Management and Maintenance Project, are expected to have climate
               co-benefits that are not captured in Bank records. The current active portfolio

  BOX 3  Developing Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) Systems—
  Experience from Lagos, Nigeria
  Lagos is one of the largest and fastest growing megacities in the world. Before the development of
  the Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) solution, city public transport was limited to non-reliable, expen-
  sive and polluting 75,000 mini-buses (danfo) and shared taxis (kabu-kabu), making 16 million
  trips daily. The poor half of the population paid a fifth of their disposable income in transport. A
  typical journey from the main residential areas to Lagos Island would take two hours.

  The World Bank-financed Lagos Urban Transport Project identified bus services as a key
  component of an overall plan to overhaul the transport system. A “BRT-light” solution was
  selected—this roadway-based rapid transit system offers higher capacity transit services than
  conventional buses by operating on dedicated lanes in city streets. In March 2008, this 22 km
  project connecting Lagos mainland with the island became the first dedicated bus route in
  Sub-Saharan Africa. Before the recent expansion, the BRT ran a 16-hour operation, using 220
  buses to move more than 200,000 passengers daily. In its first two years of operation, it moved
  more than 120 million passengers. The World Bank provided technical advice and a US$ 100
  million IDA credit.

  As a result, journey time along the corridor in its first year of operation was reduced by an aver-
  age of 25 minutes from Mile 12 to Lagos Island and fares have gone down from 230 Naira to
  100 Naira. The BRT carried 25% of all trips along the corridor whilst accounting for just 4% of
  vehicles. The BRT generated 2000 jobs for drivers, bus conductors, inspectors, ticket sellers, and
  mechanics. An additional 10,000 indirect jobs were also created to operate formal and informal
  park-and-ride facilities and mini-fast-food services. In addition to these social benefits, the BRT
  project in its first year of operation, reduced CO2 emissions by 13% and GHG emissions by 20%.
  The BRT reduced the total number of vehicle-kilometres traveled along the corridor and allowed
  a more continuous flow of buses, leading to a less polluting mode of operation. The success of the
  BRT led to further expansion and improvement of BRT services, financed by the World Bank.




of US$ 218.5 million in adaptation and emission reduction co-benefits (see
Table 8) therefore severely underestimates the current status of engagement
on climate-resilient transport. The wider application of new climate-resilient
and low-carbon practices will allow this to scale up to a major fraction of new
commitments as climate co-benefits move into the project mainstream.

                   6. Contribution of the World Bank to Bring
                   Climate-Resilient Transport to Scale
                   The transport work plan under this Africa Climate Business Plan will consist
                   of up to $3.2 billion in investments and technical assistance—including
                   $2.8  billion from the World Bank, to assist the countries of Sub-Saharan
                   Africa increase the climate resilience of their transport systems and meet the
                   ambitious climate targets they have set for themselves in their INDCs.
                      This work plan is organized along the two strategic objectives of the pro-
                   posed framework for climate resilient transport in Sub-Saharan Africa
                   described in section 4: (i) improving the resilience of African transport infra-
                   structure to climate change; and (ii) improving the carbon-efficiency of trans-
                   port systems in Sub-Saharan Africa.
                      While an optimal approach would consist in including activities pertaining
                   to the four strategic pillars under objective 1 “improving the resilience of
                   African transport infrastructure to climate change,” evidence from the policy
                   dialogue on these issues seems to show that a sequential approach is often
                   necessary in order to fully mainstream the climate dimension into transport
                   development programs. Specifically, in countries where climate risk aware-
                   ness is not yet widely observed in the transport sector, a vulnerability assess-
                   ment of parts or the whole of the transport system is often a good starting

point (pillar 1). A second step, if the program includes an infrastructure
investment component, is to make sure that resilience is included in invest-
ment design, building on the conclusions of the vulnerability assessment (pil-
lar 2). For example, the Burundi Infrastructure Resilience Emergency Project
includes measures to protect slopes, stabilizing embankments, rehabilitating
drainage systems, and redirecting groundwater. A third step would be to
review and eventually update the applicable standards for infrastructure con-
struction, operation and maintenance to make sure that all new infrastruc-
tures to be built would be climate resilient (pillar 3). For example, Madagascar’s
National Unit for the Prevention and Management of Disasters developed
building codes for weather-resistant transport infrastructure. The country
was divided into risks zones based on hydro-geological characteristics, exist-
ing assets, river morphology, and projected climate change scenarios. The
codes were developed at very low cost and relied extensively on local knowl-
edge and dedicated national champions. The enforcement of such standards
also needs to be ensured. In the case of Madagascar, the new decree on build-
ing codes was kept very simple to help ensure compliance.
   The case of Morocco is a good example of a situation where the World Bank
has been working with a client country on a resilient transport program com-
bining pillars 1 and 3 (see Box 4). Another example from Mozambique has led
to an ambitious resilient-transport program combing pillars 1, 2 and 3.
   For objective 2 “improving the carbon-efficiency of transport systems in
Sub-Saharan Africa,” the World Bank will follow the four pillars of the EASI
framework (see section 4). The first pillar encompasses the legislative and
economic context in order to remove barriers to improving the carbon effi-
ciency of transportation. The second pillar applies spatial principles to lay out
urban areas in such a way as to reduce the need for motorized transport—
avoiding vehicle trips by locating residences within easy walking distance of
essential services. The third seeks to shift passenger or freight traffic onto the
most efficient available mode, generally public transit in urban areas and rail
or waterways for freight. The fourth seeks to improve the carbon emissions
profile of vehicle fleets through the use of fleet management mechanisms
including scrapping programs.
   The full list of projects follows, along with an indication for each of the link
with the INDC of the country in question and the climate component(s) that
each will contain (see Table 9).

BOX 4  Climate Vulnerability Assessment Methodology:
Roads in Morocco
Morocco is subject to extreme climate events whose frequency and intensity are likely to increase
because of climate change. These climatic events have serious adverse effects on economic activ-
ity and cause large direct and indirect losses. Between 2009 and 2015, repairs of weather-related
damage to the road network cost a total of 4 billion Moroccan dirhams (US$ 408 million), of
which about 3 billion (US$ 306 million) was drawn from the road maintenance budget. Today
intense rainfall can lead to large-scale mudslides, flooding, and roadway erosion, sometimes sev-
ering main roads such as the Rabat-Casablanca highway.

In 2015, the World Bank conducted a study on the adaptation of the Moroccan transport sector to
climate change and developed a methodology to assess the vulnerability of specific road sections
to climate risk. The method classified road sections according to four types of vulnerability and a
set of characteristic indicators of the observed risk. Its bottom-up approach integrates socioeco-
nomic and technical factors into a decision tool that helps road managers prioritize investments
to improve the resilience of the road network under current conditions (Figure B4.1).

The outcome is a prioritized list of vulnerabilities—a kind of “shopping list”—and ranked engi-
neering improvements that will enhance the climate resilience of the road network. This ground-
based work can be integrated with larger-scale network analyses of vulnerabilities and form part
of a comprehensive toolkit for assessing and improving the climate resilience of road networks.

While the methodology was prepared in the Moroccan context, it can be adapted to other coun-
tries and broadly applied.

8. Fundraising/Financing Plan
At present, the proposed business plan has a total cost of up to $3.2 billion of
which up to $2.8 billion are expected to be financed by the World Bank. In
addition, up to $300 million would be financed by other development part-
ners and $128 million from domestic resources. In the countries where exten-
sive vulnerability assessment of transport systems will be conducted,
additional financing needs are likely to emerge.

ANNEX C—Description of Climate Resilience
Elements in Transport Work Plan Projects
Lesotho Transport Infrastructure and Connectivity: Incorporate climate
resilience criteria in the performance and output based contracts for rehabil-
itation and maintenance of a small secondary road network, with strength-
ened climate resilient specifications and design for most vulnerable sections.
Funding not available within this project to survey the entire national road
network for resilience.

Cameroon Transport Sector Support Project: There is potential to add a
road resilience study.

Mozambique Integrated Feeder Road Development Project: This project is
likely to target flood plain of Zambezi River. Climate risk will inform the proj-
ect design and related project activities. Intends to build upon the climate-
related work initiated under the ongoing Roads and Bridges Management
and Maintenance Program—Phase II: Revision of design standards and spec-
ification, and pilot of mapping climate vulnerability of unclassified road
network.

Tanzania Dar es Salaam Urban Transport Improvement Project: Aims to
implement the following: (i) establish the third phase of the BRT system in
Dar es Salaam city, (ii) improve an intersection along the BRT phase 1 through
implementing an overpass (grade separation), and (iii) institutional strength-
ening for public transport operation, TOD, IE, and supporting open data in
public transport. The BRT system will be operated by competitively procured
private operators, therefore will replace 89 existing routes currently being
operated by minibuses and the minibus owners will be incorporated in the

Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Transport in Sub-Saharan Africa	                  37
operating companies as local content. The project is still under preparation
(as there are some BRT operational issues being addressed by the Govern-
ment on BRT phase 1—under ongoing Project) but it is tentatively scheduled
for Board approval towards the end of FY16 or Q1 of FY17.

Ghana Transport Sector Improvement Project: Do not at present exactly
know the funding envelope and can therefore not commit to formal studies.
Plan to include climate resilience work in the assessment study TORs once
the scope and extent of the Project are agreed.

Regional Lake Victoria Transport: There is considerable scope for climate
related work—more on adaptation of the lake port infrastructure, ferry termi-
nals, navigational implications, dredging, etc.

Lake Tanganyika Transport Program: Same as for Lake Victoria, above.

Guinea Bissau Transport Project: The project could have two components,
a road one and a maritime one. Each component could include climate-
related activities. Under the road component, a critical point approach could
make roads more resilient to heavy rainfall, which would reduce service dis-
ruption during the rainy season. Under the maritime component, given the
topography of the country (many islands and rivers), promoting fluvial trans-
port and cabotage could foster a shift from road transport for freight and
passengers.

South Sudan Rural Roads AF: Supporting development of gravel standard
low-volume road. Road design and civil works already address key climate
prone elements with respect to flooding and drainage issues in flat, rolling or
mountainous terrain. Common adaptation measures are 1)  raising of road
embankments; 2) sealing the road surface using asphalt or concrete; 3) provi-
sion of adequate culverts; and 4) adequate vertical clearance and length/
number of spans in bridges to account for 100-years’ flood. These are already
part of the road design standards. Tackle the lack of funding for asphalt sur-
face with low-cost community-based maintenance of these gravel roads,
which will be part of these two projects. Including a separate climate related
component may not happen in both of these projects per se. Once these proj-
ects are started, we can certainly think about doing ASA to address (including
climate) some of the country-specific challenges in delivering sustainable
long-lasting roads.

Rwanda Feeder Roads AF: As per South Sudan, above. In Rwanda’s moun-
tainous terrain, the road designs take into account slope stability issues (land-
slides) and risk reduction measures in road alignment, balancing it with the
limited resource envelope for these low standard feeder roads. Parallel Impact
Evaluation Study under DIME but that will be for the overall impact of road
construction. Once these projects are started, we can certainly think about
doing ASA to address (including climate) some of the country-specific chal-
lenges in delivering sustainable long-lasting roads.


38	             Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Transport in Sub-Saharan Africa
Ivory Coast—Transport TA: Will explore the carbon emissions reduction
potential of retiring older vehicles through a fleet management system to be
designed and piloted by the project.

Burkina Faso—Transport TA: Will explore the carbon emissions reduction
potential of retiring older vehicles through a fleet management system to be
designed and piloted by the project.

DRC High Priority Roads Reopening and Maintenance: Will undertake a
critical points approach based on road vulnerability assessment.

Senegal Dakar BRT: Will assess the expected carbon emission reductions
associated with modal shift to public transit, as well as any climate resilience
measures if appropriate.

Kenya Airport Modernization: Will explore the possibility of assessing air-
port design for climate resilience and recommending resilience measures if
appropriate.

Kenya Rural Roads Project: It is possible to include a road vulnerability assess-
ment to understand the need for any special measures for enhanced resilience
in the design and construction of the proposed roads. The vulnerability assess-
ment would focus on a subset of the selected counties within the project; that is,
counties most at risk to be impacted by climate change related factors.

Sierra Leone Transport Infrastructure Development: Sierra Leone is quite
vulnerable to extreme climatic conditions. Can undertake a critical points
approach based on road vulnerability assessment.

Ethiopia Addis Urban Land Use and Transport Support: Will explore the
potential for carbon emission reductions due to higher-density spatial plan-
ning. The Transport Systems Improvement Project will also contribute to
increased resilience through the development of a drainage masterplan for
the city of Addis Ababa and the improvement of drainage systems on selected
corridors and intersections. It will contribute to emissions reduction by
reducing congestion through better traffic management, improving public
transport, and supporting the vehicle inspection and registration systems in
the country, in addition to exploring the potential for carbon emission reduc-
tions due to higher-density spatial planning.

Kenya National Urban Transport Improvement AF: Will assess the expected
carbon emission reductions associated with modal shift to public transit, as
well as any climate resilience measures if appropriate.

Senegal Transport and Urban Mobility AF: Will assess the expected carbon
emission reductions associated with modal shift to public transit.

West Africa Dakar-Bamako Logistics Corridor: Explore expected carbon
emission reductions associated with improved logistical efficiency and fleet
management.
