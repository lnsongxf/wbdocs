PREFACE

Informing farmers’ production decisions with timely weather forecasts and related
climate information services is a fundamental means of improving agricultural pro-
ductivity. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where agriculture is overwhelmingly rainfed and
yield gaps are very high, access to these information sources will be instrumental in
reducing the vulnerability of African smallholders by enabling them to manage risk
more eﬀectively. The information and communication technologies needed to improve
and expand agro-meteorological observation systems are widely available and readily
transferable from one setting to another.

In addition to news and weather services that farmers can use in making immediate
and short-term decisions, these channels are useful for longer-term, educational pur-
poses as well—purposes that in more industrialized countries typically fall under the
rubric of agricultural research and extension. In countries like Ethiopia and Kenya,
which are the focus of this report, the generation of adaptive farming technologies
and methods and their eﬀective dissemination to producers who are prepared to
use them will determine a great deal. The farmer who is comfortable referring to
sources of information that he or she has come to trust can be an active agent in what
Theodore Schultz once called “transforming traditional agriculture.” Farmers who
remain unreached by these services are far less well positioned to do so. And we should
remember just how much we are asking of them as we seek to “enlist” them as agents
of change and even drivers of economic development.

Schultz is more than a passing reference here. In 1964 he argued persuasively that
farmers in low-income countries were rational actors who made eﬃcient use of the
resources available to them. He depicted them as rational but highly constrained in
terms of access to resources and knowledge. This may seem intuitive now, but back
then in the larger ﬁeld of development economics, it was revolutionary—enough so to
eventually earn him a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1979. Our language has changed
somewhat, and Shultz’s use of the term “knowledge” clearly encompassed information
available to the farmer and the farmer’s skill and know-how. And the issues touched
upon in this document touch upon those as well.

This is not only about the farmers themselves, however. It also relates to the institutions
and policies of the country in which they live and operate. As its name clearly suggests,
“agricultural meteorology” is very much an interdisciplinary ﬁeld. This is more than a
question of what academic discipline agro-meteorologists consider themselves primarily
aﬃliated with, or whether they consider themselves agriculturalists or meteorologists. It
also has much to do with how a national government organizes itself institutionally—in
this case how jurisdiction over agricultural meteorology is divided between and assigned

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


BACKGROUND
Agriculture sustains humanity.1 The global population stands at some 7.3 billion as
of 2014 (Population Institute 2014). Combined with rising incomes and changing
consumption patterns and expectations about living standards typical of urbanizing
populations throughout much of the developing world, along with population growth
and rising demand for food and other agricultural products, agricultural production is
severely challenged, locally, regionally, and globally.

Further complicating this challenge are the approximately 860 million people living at
or below the US$1.25 per day poverty line. As many as 75 percent of these individuals
live in least-developed countries and work small plots for both subsistence and local
markets. In these countries, agricultural production tends to be a proportionately sig-
niﬁcant driver of economic development.

Most smallholder farms are less productive and less proﬁtable than they could be, and
the gaps between actual and potential yields are very large. Smallholders lack access to
inputs such as modern seed and fertilizer and to services such as credit and information
which are instrumental in enabling more modern farmers to manage risk and optimize
production using more productive technologies and management practices. This lack
of information and technical knowledge results in a skills gap that inhibits their adop-
tion of these technologies and practices and reduces their eﬃciency when smallholders
attempt to modernize their operations (World Bank 2007). Public extension programs
tend to be underfunded and have limited contact with farmers in low-income coun-
tries, and they are generally not eﬀectively supported by agricultural research systems
that generate applied knowledge. Supporting infrastructure is most often lacking as
well, making coordination between the diﬀerent actors in the supply chains linking
farmers to consumers diﬃcult and expensive, increasing costs and lowering revenues.

 “Agriculture” is deﬁned here as the art, practice, and science of farming, including cultivation of the soil for the
growing of crops (food, animal feed, ﬁber, industrial feedstock, and fuels) and the rearing of livestock and poultry for
meat, milk, eggs, hide/fur/leather, feathers, bone, sinew, wool, and dung. More broadly it also encompasses forestry,
ﬁsheries, and aquaculture.

CHAPTER ONE
AGRO-METEOROLOGICAL
OBSERVATION NETWORKS
While the national agricultural meteorology programs in Ethiopia and Kenya are very
limited, a number of international development agencies and NGOs are operating
in both countries and have been implementing various agro-meteorological services
as components of more general initiatives to improve agricultural productivity and
resilience. Although a comprehensive review of all of the actors at work in the area of
agro-meteorology and agro-climatology in the two countries was far beyond the remit
or the resources of this study, a number of the more prominent agencies and organiza-
tions at work in the ﬁeld are described in this chapter.

IGAD CLIMATE PREDICTION
AND APPLICATIONS CENTRE
The countries of East Africa and the Horn of Africa are prone to extreme weather
and climate events such as ﬂoods and droughts which have severe impacts on agricul-
tural production. In 1989, 24 countries in eastern and southern Africa established a
Drought Monitoring Centre with headquarters in Nairobi (the DMCN) and a subcen-
ter in Harare called the Drought Monitoring Centre Harare (DMCH) in response to
devastating weather-related disasters. In October 2003, the heads of state and govern-
ments of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) held their 10th
Summit in Kampala, Uganda. The DMCN was adopted as a specialized IGAD insti-
tution and renamed the IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC)
in order to more fully reﬂect all its mandates, mission, and objectives within the IGAD
system. A protocol integrating the institution fully into IGAD was signed on April 13,
2007. Today, the center is responsible for 11 member countries: eight IGAD member
countries, namely, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Republic of
South Sudan, and Uganda, as well as Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania.

CHAPTER TWO
TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL
AGRO-WEATHER OBSERVATION SYSTEMS
Observations and measurements of both atmospheric and biological variables are
essential in any agro-meteorological or agro-climatological endeavor. In order for
agro-meteorologists and agro-climatologists to assist farmers and others in the agricul-
ture sector with planning, forecasting, and other services that can be essential to per-
sonal survival and economic success, data, quantitative and qualitative, are required
which describe the ever-evolving states of the atmosphere and the biosphere. Parallel
agricultural data are also needed to assess the impacts of agricultural activities and
processes on the environment and climate.

The necessary types of observations and measurements and their spatial density and
temporal frequency depend on the purposes for which the data will be used. Charac-
terization of the agro-climate of a region, monitoring and prediction of the evolving
climate, and management of natural resources requires local, regional, and national
coverage over a period of a few decades of a number of atmospheric variables. To
ensure that the observations are representative of an area, spatial density of observations
depends on the topography of the region of interest, with complex, mountainous terrain
requiring many more points of observation than open plains.13 For climatologic pur-
poses, a temporal frequency of once or twice per day measurements is often satisfactory.
To detect small climatological trends in data from a limited number of years of observa-
tion requires careful selection of instruments and a good QC/QA process (see below).

Long-term climatological information provides the background conditions within
which day-to-day weather and farming operations are carried out. Such operations

   Agriculture in mountainous regions is often highly dependent on small regions with favorable microclimates scat-
tered within larger regions that are generally unfavorable to farming or herding. Even in open country, observations are
likely representative of a region only 3 to 5 kilometers in radius around the observing point.

ADOPTION BARRIERS FOR
AGRO-WEATHER OBSERVATIONS
As may be inferred from previous comments, this report recommends each nation
have a comprehensive agricultural meteorology program supported by a nationwide
observing system. However, there are a number of signiﬁcant adoption barriers to
establishing and sustaining such national programs. These can be classiﬁed as cultural,
bureaucratic, and ﬁnancial.19

CULTURAL BARRIERS
Cultural barriers can crop up in many guises, including the all too familiar, “we’ve never
done that before and are not going to start now,” in bureaucracies. Here we comment
on cultural barriers likely to be encountered in the ﬁeld, where agro-meteorologists,
working with and through agricultural extension agents, attempt to encourage small
landholders to make better use of modern weather knowledge. Around the world,
farmers tend to be conservative in their farming practices. This seems to be particu-
larly true with small landholders living at or near the subsistence level and in areas
where local village or tribal links remain strong. In many settings, local indigenous
weather predictors rely on close observation of plants, animals, and other natural indi-
cators. Many have long experience with farming and weather events in the area. Local
lore, such as the phenology of plants and animals in the area, can provide insights into
local, microscale weather and climate phenomena, as can careful study of the clouds
that come and go overhead.20

   Due to the lack of materials either published or posted to easily identiﬁed websites, this section is necessarily some-
what broad and lacking in speciﬁcity. There may well be tighter connections between the NHMSs in Kenya and Ethio-
pia, their respective Ministries of Agriculture and their research institutes, and farmers than what is suggested here.
However, those connections are not readily apparent from a distance. The thoughts expressed here were formulated
after a careful reading of several reports by nongovernmental organizations operating in the two countries and from
what could be gleaned from the various websites of the organizations of interest, and after discussions with individuals
who had worked in those countries.
20
   Phenology is the study of periodic plant and animal life cycle events and how these are inﬂuenced by seasonal and
interannual variations in climate, as well as habitat factors (such as elevation).

Quantifying the costs and beneﬁts associated with an agro-meteorology program is
a challenging exercise. It is particularly challenging in developing countries such as
Ethiopia and Kenya where agricultural production is based on a very large number
of often very small farms that cultivate a wide variety of crops and raise a variety of
diﬀerent livestock animals.

Because no comprehensive study of the costs and beneﬁts of agro-meteorological ser-
vices appears to have been carried out anywhere in East Africa, this analysis is limited
to a review of the few relevant studies that have been undertaken, and to reporting
preliminary results that are indicative in nature.

ESTIMATING A COST-BENEFIT RATIO
FOR AGRO-METEOROLOGICAL SERVICES
Experience in other countries shows that agro-meteorological services help guarantee
that farming is as eﬃcient as possible (minimizing costs) and results in a good quan-
tity of high-quality agricultural products (maximizing the return on farmers’ invest-
ments). These beneﬁts come through improving the bases on which farmers make
decisions. Each such decision that is informed by enhanced meteorological or climato-
logical information results in reduced costs for routine farming activities and enhanced
income at the end of harvest.

The beneﬁts stemming from ordinary farming decisions made with enhanced weather
and/or climate information have been the subject of a number of studies. The most
relevant of these appears to be that by Ansalehto et al. (1985). This study was a joint
project of the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the Agricultural Research Centre, and
the Association of Agricultural Producers in Finland. The goal was to identify the
requirements for further agrometeorological research and the need for daily services

MODELS FOR SUSTAINABILITY OF
AGRO-METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATION
SYSTEMS
National hydro-meteorological services face a wide variety of challenges. These include
all or some combination of severely constrained budgets; limited infrastructure, with
little or no technical support, internal or external; noncompetitive salaries, so limited
ability to train and then to retain talented staﬀ; lack of access to training or the latest
information on weather and climate monitoring and forecasting in their region. Thus
setting up, operating, and sustaining a nationwide (or at least agricultural region-wide)
agro-meteorological observing network that collects data centrally in real time may
seem to be an impossibility.

To overcome the various obstacles to setting up and sustaining an agricultural net-
work, the leadership of the national hydro-meteorological service must look outward,
ﬁrst within the government, then to international aid organizations, and ﬁnally to the
private sector. The ministry of agriculture is an obvious partner, but the ministries of
energy, transport, natural resources, environment, and emergency services should also
be considered as potential partners. A business case speciﬁc to each agency can be
developed showing the value of real-time data and the tailored products and services
that ﬂow from such data to the accomplishment of that agency’s mission. While not all
agencies can provide ﬁnancial support, access to land, facilities, professional and techni-
cal staﬀ, and morale support in budget requests can be in-kind outcomes. International
development agencies can provide capital funds for initial equipment purchases and
training of staﬀ, as well as access to technical expertise not otherwise available. How-
ever, most such aid programs are for a speciﬁc period of time, usually just a few years.

Perhaps the greatest obstacle to operating and sustaining an agricultural network that
provides data in real time to a central oﬃce is the cost of required telecommunica-
tions network. This cost is one that few national hydro-meteorological services can
cover. Unless the national government operates a nationwide telecommunication net-
work (and some do, for law enforcement, military coordination, and the like) which

CHAPTER SIX
BEST PRACTICES FOR INSTITUTIONAL
STRENGTHENING AND CAPACITY BUILDING
For an agro-meteorological program to have a signiﬁcant impact on overall national
agricultural production, the organizations involved—primarily the national hydro-
meteorological service, but also the extension program of the ministry of agriculture—
must change to faster, more focused ways of providing decision support services to
farmers. The comments that follow focus mainly on the national hydro-meteorological
service, but parallel remarks likely apply to the extension program as well.

Currently, the national hydro-meteorological services in many African countries base
their forecasts almost completely on numerical model output from various meteoro-
logical centers in the developed world provided at no cost through the World Mete-
orological Organization.26 This model output is coarse in spatial resolution, with new
output usually available every three, six, and twelve hours each day. Such output is
suitable for forecasting on the synoptic (large) scale and, to some extent, on the sub-
synoptic scale, but not for forecasting on the meso- and micro- (or “farm”) scale, the
scales on which the weather events that impact people, livestock, and crops occur. In
the current forecast process, only limited use is made of local data in part because of
the small amount that are available. A consequence of this situation is that farmers do
not receive timely agro-weather information at temporal and spatial scales of real use
to them in planning and conducting day-to-day activities.

Once the enhanced traditional observing network is in place and providing high
spatial density, once-per-day observations of a few key variables, and the network of
automatic weather stations starts to extend across key parts of the nation (speciﬁcally,
the agricultural regions), forecasters at the national hydro-meteorological service will
start to have timely access to much more local data. Applied meteorological studies
utilizing these new data streams will produce new analysis and forecast products tai-
lored to support farmers’ decisions.

26
  These centers include, among others, those of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
the United Kingdom Met Oﬃce, the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Météo France, and
the Japanese Meteorological Agency.

CHAPTER SEVEN
FINAL THOUGHTS
Ethiopia, Kenya, and nearby countries in Africa urgently need to ﬁnd more eﬀective
adaptation strategies to manage growing weather and climate risks. This is particularly
the case in regard to their agricultural base since so many of their citizens are small-
holder farmers working at or just above subsistence levels. These weather and climate
risks present such a complex set of challenges that government institutions, NGOs,
and donor organizations cannot address them one at a time, in isolation from the
others. A comprehensive systems approach—in the broadest sense of that phrase—
appears to be essential.

Enhancing and strengthening the capabilities and capacities of key government
agencies, more speciﬁcally the national hydro-meteorological services together with
the ministries of agriculture, water, energy, and emergency management, will be
essential to build levels of resilience to the environmental changes anticipated to
unfold in the next few decades. Given the limited resources available, it is likely
that everyone involved in agriculture in this region, from the farm to the national
ministry, will need to adopt novel collaborative approaches and become much more
ﬂexible in terms of plants sown and agricultural techniques used if farmers are
going to continue to produce the food needed by the people of these nations. This
will include utilizing new types of partnerships and collaborations, in particular ones
involving the private sector.

There are numerous issues that must be addressed to provide the range of agro-
meteorological services that are almost certainly going to be essential in the
medium future. This report has discussed some of them, focusing somewhat nar-
rowly on possibilities for improvements to surface observations and measurements,
given that the resulting data are the foundation for producing many types of prod-
ucts and services, and particularly so for those supporting agricultural decisions at
all levels.
