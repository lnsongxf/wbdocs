SCHOOL FEEDING                                                                                     SABER Country Report 2015




     SABER School Feeding Policy Goals—Current Status

     Policy Goals                                                                                            Status
      1.   Policy Frameworks
           School feeding is mentioned under the Multisector Action Plan for Nutrition as one of the
           main interventions to address nutrition issues. A National School Feeding Policy in Sri
           Lanka currently does not exist; guidelines and directives are in place to regulate the school
           feeding program. However, a SABER-SF exercise stimulated the discussions to develop a
           technical policy for school feeding in Sri Lanka by the government in the near future.

      2.   Financial Capacity
           A national budget for the school feeding program is part of the national planning process
           and is revised annually. The budget line for school feeding is at the national level only. The
           budget allocated for the national school feeding program is not enough to cover the
           identified needs, and funds are disbursed to the implementation level intermittently.

      3.   Institutional Capacity and Coordination
           The School Health Promotion Steering committee has representatives from more than
           three ministries; a management unit for school feeding programs is in place in Sri Lanka,
           but they are understaffed and need additional resources. However, coordination
           mechanisms with the school level are in place and functioning, and national guidance
           occurs for the school feeding program. This guidance is made available in the form of
           directives and guidelines but is not yet fully functional across all schools.

      4.   Design and Implementation
           A monitoring and evaluation system for school feeding is defined and functional. Targeting
           criteria and methodology exist as well as national guidelines on food modalities and food
           baskets, but specific procurement guidelines for the school feeding program are not in
           place. Nevertheless, national procurement guidelines by the government of Sri Lanka are
           applied to the national school feeding program.

      5. Community Roles—Reaching Beyond Schools
           In Sri Lanka, School Feeding Management committees, subcommittees of the School
           Development committees, are currently in place and are active in the implementation of
           the school feeding program; they comprise parents, teachers, and community
           representatives. A need is seen to develop mechanisms through which committees can
           hold the school feeding program accountable at the regional and national levels.

The last policy goal is community roles reaching beyond
schools. School feeding programs that are locally owned,
incorporate contributions from local communities, and
respond to specific community needs are often the
strongest. These programs are most likely to make a
successful transition from donor assistance to national
ownership. Community participation should be
considered at every stage, but without overburdening
community members.

Use of Evidence-Based Tools
The primary focus of the SABER–School Feeding exercise
is gathering systematic and verifiable information about
the quality of a country’s policies through a SABER–
School Feeding Questionnaire. This data-collecting
instrument helps to facilitate comparative policy
analysis, identify key areas to focus investment, and
disseminate good practice and knowledge sharing. This
holistic and integrated assessment of how the overall
policy in a country affects young children’s development
is categorized into one of the following stages,
representing the varying levels of policy development
that exist among different dimensions of school feeding:

    Latent: No or very little policy development
    Emerging: Initial/some initiatives toward policy
    development
    Established: Some policy development
    Advanced: Development of a comprehensive policy
    framework

Each policy goal and lever of school feeding is
methodically benchmarked through two SABER analysis
tools. The first is a scoring rubric that quantifies the
responses to selected questions from the SABER–School
Feeding questionnaire by assigning point values to the
answers. The second tool is the SABER–School Feeding
Framework rubric that analyzes the responses, especially
the written answers, based on the framework’s five
policy goals and levers. For more information, please visit
the World Bank’s website on SABER–School Health and
School Feeding and click on the “What Matters”
Framework Paper under Methodology.

Conclusion
Based on the above findings and results of discussions
with stakeholders, the majority of the policy goals in Sri
Lanka are at the “Emerging” stage. It is noteworthy that
in many indicators, Sri Lanka is very close to being at
‘’Established’’ stage. The Design and Implementation
policy goal, however, is already at the “Established”
level. It is important here to stress that the SABER
framework focuses on policy and the systems level and is
not an assessment of the implementation side of the
school feeding program.

The following policy options represent possible areas in
which school feeding could be strengthened in Sri Lanka,
based on the conclusions of this report.

Policy Options
There is recognition of the need for developing a
technical policy for the national school feeding program;
in addition to policy, technical and financial support will
be needed from donors and stakeholders to ensure
implementation.

Additionally, there is a need to further look into and
develop the alternative implementation modalities
currently used in the school feeding program in order to
identify the most effective and feasible modality in line
with the specific contexts and situations in different
schools and the distinct characteristics of various parts of
the country .

Where feasible, Home Grown School Feeding (HGSF)
needs to be further strengthened and integrated into the
school program. Linkages should be made between
small holder farmers and schools, especially in rural
areas, but also within the urban context.

Additional linkages between the school feeding program
and other social safety nets in the country are necessary
to ensure that, when needed, beneficiaries can smoothly
transition into another safety net upon graduating from
school.

     The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative
     produces comparative data and knowledge on education policies and
     institutions, with the aim of helping countries systematically strengthen
     their education systems. SABER evaluates the quality of education
     policies against evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic
     tools and detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all parties
     with a stake in educational results—from administrators, teachers, and
     parents to policy makers and business people—an accessible, objective
     snapshot showing how well the policies of their country's education
     system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth learn.
