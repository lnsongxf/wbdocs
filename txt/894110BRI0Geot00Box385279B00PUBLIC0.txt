                                                 ABSTRACT


                                                 T    his paper presents a statistical study of the geothermal resource risk
                                                      in Indonesia, specifically, that the resource base and well productiv-
                                                 ity are adequate and that the drilling cost per well is reasonable. This
                                                 paper is timely because the Government of Indonesia is now embarking
                                                 on an ambitious plan to rapidly scale up geothermal power capacity
                                                 and eventually achieve a longer-term target of 9,500 MW by 2025. This
                                                 study relies on the resource base estimates made by the Indonesian
                                                 Government-owned enterprise P.T. Pertamina (now subsidiary Pertamina
                                                 Geothermal Energy, or “PGE”) for nearly 80 sites, and productivity data
                                                 on 215 wells in the country in the GeothermEx archives; these wells
                                                 comprise some 80% of the total production wells drilled in Indonesia.
                                                 Such a thorough national inventory of the geothermal resource base
                                                 is available from very few countries. The geothermal resource base
                                                 (proved-plus-probable-plus-possible) at a given site ranges from 10 MW to
                                                 800 MW with a log-normal distribution. More than 70% of the known
                                                 Indonesian fields have a resource base greater than 50 MW and at least
                                                 half of the fields (about 40) offer a resource base of 100 MW or more.

                                                 than 40 MW, with a median value of 9 MW; this range and median are
                                                 larger than seen in most countries; we believe the most likely range
                                                 of well productivity worldwide is 4 to 6 MW. The commercial wells

producing from typical high-temperature liquid-dominated
wells, as found in many countries. However, given that the
Mode 3 and Mode 4 wells have much higher commercial
value, the assumption of an 8 MW well capacity for the
analysis of  the resource risk in  Indonesia significantly
overestimates this risk. Let us examine what underlying
resource conditions the Modes 3 and 4 wells may represent.
     Figure 9 is a plot of the MW capacity versus tem-
perature of all 215 wells. This figure indicates two clus-
ters of wells, one in the 230°C to 250°C range and the
other in the 300°C to 340°C range. It can be shown that
most of the Mode 3 wells falling in the 230°C to 250°C
range typically represent wells producing from a 100%
saturated steam reservoir, and the Mode 4 wells falling
