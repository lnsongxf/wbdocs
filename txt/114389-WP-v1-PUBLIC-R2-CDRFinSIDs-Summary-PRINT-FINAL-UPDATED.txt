    INTRODUCTION

    Natural disasters and climate change severely affect the
    growth trajectory of SIDS and their ability to achieve
    sustainable development. SIDS are located in some of the most
    disaster-prone regions in the world and comprise two-thirds of
    countries with the highest relative annual losses due to disasters.
    With the effects of climate change compounding the intensity
    of these disasters, this trend is set to continue, creating new
    developmental challenges for SIDS. Natural disasters and climate
    variability severely impact major economic sectors in SIDS, hinder
    economic growth and affect the most vulnerable populations.
    Lacking relatively stable and strong fiscal revenues and domestic
    savings, SIDS governments often need to divert scarce public
    resources from essential social and economic development
    investments to address disaster-related needs, compromising the
    pace and scope of future growth. Development in SIDS, therefore,
    is subject to a range of interconnected and mutually reinforcing
    economic, social and environmental challenges.

    Building resilience at individual, institutional and private-
    sector levels is essential to achieve sustainable development
    in SIDS, but available financing for this purpose is limited
    and difficult to access. The responsibility, expertise and funding
    for climate and disaster resilient development is scattered across
    a large number of actors, creating a complex global architecture
    of funds and providers. While several market-based financing
    mechanisms have become available globally, they are not equally
    and easily accessible to all SIDS, and concessional finance from the
    international community remains a key source of financing to foster
    climate and disaster resilient development. Understanding how much
    SIDS are actually receiving and in what ways becomes, therefore,
    pivotal to help the international community more effectively support
    SIDS in building climate and disaster resilience.

    TERMS: between 2012-14, annual
    average funding was USD 5.3 billion,
    22% below the annual average of
    2009-11. A small fraction of this finance
    supports climate and disaster resilience,
    averaging 14% a year (equal to USD
                                                                 2009-11 Average Annual                       2012-14 Average Annual

                                           THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COULD DO MORE TO HELP SIDS



Supporting SIDS to create an enabling policy environment for climate and disaster
resilience. This includes public policies and regulations, which can promote climate resilience by
influencing the choices of private actors in various sectors.




Enhancing information on resilience and information management systems. This can be
done through multi-country and regional partnerships and the innovative use of technology, which
could prove cost-effective and increase impact.




Supporting SIDS to integrate climate and disaster risk into national planning and
budgeting. This will require supporting collaboration across a large set of ministries and departments
to identify and integrate priorities, and highlight linkages and synergies across sector-level policy
objectives. It may also require the adoption of contingency funds or financing buffers to allow for
better preparedness and immediate response following disasters.




Supporting public administration systems and institutions responsible for managing
natural disasters, climate finance and risk. This includes supporting SIDS to further develop their
public financial management systems and capacities to access and manage concessional funds – for
example, by reinforcing central units as a one-stop shop for all incoming funding proposals – thus
enabling investments to be prioritized and channelled more efficiently.




Increasing the use of financing mechanisms that enhance capacity and coordination.
Donors should consider further ways to pool resources to reduce SIDS reliance on a single source of
concessional funds, while avoiding the high level of project fragmentation currently experienced.




Providing predictable and more programmatic funding. Funding that is more programmatic
and long term (typically 10-15 years) could also help build resilience for the smaller and more frequent
disasters that can lead to larger cumulative damage over time.
RECOMMENDATIONS


ENHANCE CLIMATE AND DISASTER RESILIENT DEVELOPMENT BY:



  Providing predictable and more programmatic funding. Investing in pre-emptive measures
  to build resilience requires access to more reliable financing. Funding that is more programmatic
  and long term (typically 10-15 years) could also help foster the policy, institutional and behavioural
  change needed to help build resilience to climate and disaster impacts.



  Facilitating access to funding from global climate funds through simplified application
  and management procedures for SIDS. Development partners should use their influence to
  support adoption, by the global climate funds, of proportionate and streamlined approaches to
  encourage greater direct access and project implementation and greater national ownership.




  Using financing instruments that can help SIDS at risk of debt distress improve their debt
  situation and avoid using financing mechanisms that can undermine debt sustainability. In
  recent years, a number of instruments to deal with the debt situation of SIDS have emerged, which
  could be further scaled up and replicated. While some can provide temporary relief, the international
  community should also help SIDS address the drivers of debt accumulation. Furthermore, while
  greater concessional lending to Upper Middle-Income SIDS in recent years has increased the
  financing available for resilience, care should be taken to avoid endangering their debt sustainability.




  Facilitating an international dialogue on the eligibility criteria for concessional finance
  with the aim of ensuring that SIDS are able to access the finance they need at terms and
  conditions most suited to their specific circumstances. Currently, SIDS face a complex web
  of eligibility requirements that must be met in order to access different sources of concessional
  financing for resilience. With eligibility to several multilateral and bilateral funding sources relying
  heavily on per capita classification, SIDS have called for a coordinated effort by development
  partners to review the rules governing access to concessional finance.




  Investing to build national capacities and expertise. The sustainability and ownership of
  resilience programmes depends on striking the right balance between temporary solutions to fill
  human resource gaps and longer-term investments in national capacities across the full spectrum
  of institutional needs. Innovative approaches and the use of new technologies could help tailor
  capacity-building approaches to the specific context of SIDS.
