           REPORT?
     The rest of the report is organized in five chapters plus
     annexes. The cross-cutting indicators are discussed in
     Chapter 2. The thematic elaborations on methodology and
     results of energy access, renewable energy, and energy
     efficiency are outlined in Chapters 3, 4, and 5. These
     chapters also articulate the proposed refinements for the
     global rollout of RISE planned for 2015. Finally, Chapter 6
     aggregates the results of the three pillars and illustrates the
     relationships between RISE and achievement of the SE4ALL
     goals, as well as highlighting plans for the global rollout.

       Box 4-2: Evolution of feed-in tariff policies in Kenya

       Kenya adopted a feed-in tariff (FIT) policy in March 2008; a second iteration was released in 2010; and the policy was further
       revised in December 2012 (see table).

       By mid-2012, 84 expressions of interest had been accepted by the FIT committee. Wind represented 76 percent of
       potential installed capacity and 40 percent of all applications. Hydro-based projects remained prominent on number of
       applications (38 percent) although the project sizes were small, accounting for only 7 percent of the potential installed
       capacity with biomass accounting for 9 percent. Most of the solar project developers were targeting higher off-grid tariffs.

       Despite the growing interest from local and international investors, only one operational project (Imenti Tea Small Hydro)
       has been completed under this policy. However, several other projects have closed financing arrangements and are at an
       advanced stage.

  ANNEX II

  RISE METHODOLOGY
  This annex is divided into three different areas of methodology that have been used for RISE.
  I.	 Arriving at the short list of pilot indicators
  II.	 Selecting the unit of analysis for data collection
  III.	 Calculating indicators based on raw data


  I. 	       ARRIVING AT THE SHORT LIST OF PILOT INDICATORS
  A preliminary long list of indicators was initially identified based on literature reviews and consultation with various stakeholders. An
  individual expert was hired in each of the 17 countries that fielded a questionnaire to elicit responses on these sub-indicators.

        Many countries share the vision for a secure energy future for all people. But for most
        countries, realizing this vision requires massive investment in sustainable energy and a solid
        enabling environment of policies, regulations, and institutions. The Readiness for Investment
        in Sustainable Energy (RISE) can help countries get to where they want to be. Through a
        suite of indicators, RISE will provide a global reference point for countries to see how they
        are performing in energy access, renewable energy, and energy efficiency—and what policies
        and other instruments they may need to move toward their sustainable energy vision. RISE
        highlights good practices across countries that can foster a good enabling environment for
        sustainable energy and support peer learning.
