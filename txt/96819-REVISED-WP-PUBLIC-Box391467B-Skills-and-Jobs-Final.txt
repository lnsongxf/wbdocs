    The best-known institutional arrangement for addressing the contractibility problem between
    employers and employees is the apprenticeship. The best examples are found in countries with a long
    tradition of apprenticeships and where this tradition works as an enforcement mechanism. This is the
    case in some African countries and in some European countries, in particular Germany.

    Traditionally, apprenticeships have two components—the contract and the certification. Governments
    usually support the apprenticeships through a subsidy to the individual or firm and the contract is a
    private agreement between apprentice and the firm. The training content is usually designed by the
    firm but the governments ensure its quality and relevance. Apprenticeship programs can have both
    classroom and workplace training. Apprentices benefit from the training and acquire a certification
    at the end of their training programs. Employers benefit from the lower cost of labor during the
    apprenticeship period and can screen potential future employees.

    An example of such system in the German apprenticeship program, a dual system based on class-
    room training in vocational institutions and training in the workplace. The structure of the program,
    in terms of transparency and quality, curriculum, content and time structure of the training are regu-
    lated by the Federal Institute for Training and other national committees.

    Apprentices’ wages are lower than productivity but after training, they typically grow higher. The
    evidence shows that apprentices, especially in large firms, increase their employability. However, the
    post-training retention rates for firms are low as apprentices get general skills that can be applied in
    other firms than the one which trained them. In addition, training costs are far from negligible. The
    strongest constraint in the transferability of such programs is that they require a strong institutional
    framework, in particular a clear legal framework.

    DEMAND-LEAD PRE-EMPLOYMENT T VET FOR ECONOMIC GROW TH IN SINGAPORE

     Singapore’s pre-employment TVET system is widely known for its quality, owing much to the skills
     development schemes sponsored by Singapore’s Economic Development Board (EDB) during the
     agency’s first decade.

     Facing an inauspicious start (failure of the training-production workshops and retraining schemes),
     the EDB decided to partner with leading international firms with proven training systems in order to
     learn the training business from them, train their requirements and adapt the methods for local needs.

     EDB’s first training partner was Tata Group, a large Indian conglomerate. It led to the creation of the
     Tata-Government Training Center to supply workers for Tata’s engineering plant in Singapore. The
     Singapore Government provided the land and buildings, contributed 70% of the center’s operating
     costs and paid the stipends of the trainees. Trainees were committed to work with EDB or any com-
     pany directed by the agency for 5 years. Twice as many people as Tata required were trained in order
     that the rest of the graduates not recruited by Tata would be an asset to attract other engineering
     firms to Singapore, contributing to the growth of an industry cluster.

   Jovenes Programs refer to a series of programs that have been implemented in Latin America since
   1991, aimed at improving youth employability and human capital. Targeted at disadvantaged young
   workers, they combine training and work experience as well as life skills, job search assistance, coun-
   seling and information. This model began in Chile and was subsequently replicated in Venezuela,
   Argentina, Paraguay, Peru, Colombia, Panama and the Dominican Republic.

   Financial incentives are given to both trainees and employers to ensure both sides participate.
   Training is provided on a competitive basis by private sector firms, while training institutions coordi-
   nate courses and internships. This ensures the skills taught in the program fit with the needs of the
   productive sector.

   Evidence shows that these programs contribute to an increased employment probability and
   increased earning of participants upon graduation, compared to their control group. For example,
   women’s employment probability has increased by 10% thanks to Proyecto Joven in Argentina, while
   monthly earnings also increased by 10%. On average, labor market impacts of these programs are
   higher for women and younger beneficiaries than for men and older cohorts.
