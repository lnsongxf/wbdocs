EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
     The Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR) provides its members with
     overviews of the potential solutions to recover and monetize the flared and/or
     associated gas.

     This study analyses the LNG chain concept which can be used for the
     monetization of small volumes (1 -15 MMscf/d) of associated gas.



    The LNG business background
    While the LNG industry has traditionally focussed primarily on development of
    ever increasing plant capacities, the maturity of the technology has allowed
    development of technologies applicable for small volumes to be competitive and
    potentially economically attractive. The main challenge for small scale LNG
    applications is therefore not technical but economic.



    The LNG chain
    Traditionally the LNG chain was composed of three elements: liquefaction plants,
    transportation by ship and receiving terminals. However, attention is now being
    given to the diversification of LNG to increase gas distribution flexibility and to
    reach new consumers through small scale facilities, LNG distribution by trucks,
    LNG refuelling stations, etc.

    Natural gas liquefaction is a process which typically involves several steps: the
    various feed gas pre-treatments followed by liquefaction as shown in the block
    flow diagram below.




                          5
At the receiving end, facilities are required to store the received LNG and
reconvert it back to gas for use by consumers.




Alternatively, where the LNG will be used as a fuel directly e.g. in trucks, only
storage and a loading facility is required.


Mini/micro LNG liquefaction Technologies
Mini/micro LNG facilities currently mainly consist of LNG liquefaction plants
supplying LNG satellite stations with annual LNG volumes up to 0.2 mtpa. As an
indication, these LNG quantities correspond to the yearly LNG demand for a
power plant up to approximately 100 MW.

The mini-LNG chain is virtually identical to the conventional LNG chain, differing
only in scale. One difference is that for small gas volumes, LNG transport is
feasible using trucks (onshore) or barges (offshore) rather than large marine
carriers.

While the purpose of this study is not provide a tool to estimate the cost of the
chain but to provide an overview of the main elements that should be taken into
consideration when evaluating the potential for specific projects, it is important to
give some indication of potential cost (capital and operating) of an LNG chain.

The sizing and cost of the different elements of the chain depend on the specific
characteristics of each project such as: gas volume and composition, distance to
consumers, storage and infrastructure requirements, geographical location etc..

The unit cost (capital and operating) for four scenarios have been evaluated: Gas
volumes of 3 and 10 MMscf/d, and short and long distances to customers. It must
be noted that these cost estimates are only indicative as specific circumstances (e.g.
a challenging physical environment, high labour costs in an overheated business
environment such as the Bakken in N. Dakota, high import duties), can affect the
costs and hence economics significantly.

In summary, where specific circumstances do not adversely affect cost, for gas
volumes between 3 and 10 MMscf/d and distances up to 800 MN/1000 miles, total
unit costs (capital plus operating) for mini/micro LNG projects range from 12 to 6
US$/MMBTU.

Mini/micro LNG market overview
An analysis of the market for mini LNG facilities in the US and China has been
performed in order to explore potential opportunities to commercialize small LNG
volumes from associated gas in low and middle-income economies in
economically beneficial ways.




                                                     Figure 1: LNG Plants in USA and China

Small-scale LNG solutions have been implemented in the following situations:

      Restrictions of infrastructure:
   -   In USA, peak shaving was used to solve pipeline network restrictions or
       deficient storage capacity.
        -   In China, domestic gas demand had a boom which could not be
            matched by the required infrastructure development (gas
            transportation and transmission). LNG virtual chain provided a
            transitional solution to solve the gap.
        -   Demand does not reach the minimum volume required to invest in
            traditional gas infrastructure transportation.
      Emission reduction policies (already implemented in China and expected in
       USA in the near future).
      More competitive prices of natural gas in the transportation sector against
       petroleum derivatives.


Similar small scale LNG models could be implemented in countries such Nigeria,
Iraq and Indonesia among others, which have high flaring levels.

Nigeria and Iraq present some similarities to the aspects which made China and the
USA consider small scale LNG: restrictions on power supply & transmission and
security issues hindering the development of the most economically suitable
infrastructure for large scale flaring solutions. Also, Indonesia offers further
opportunity for economic use: LNG as fuel for ships.

Conclusion
LNG technologies are readily available making it possible for “fast -track”
implementation of mini LNG facilities with relatively low investment (compared
to pipelines or large scale facilities).

Small-scale LNG can enable rapid establishment of power plants or industries
(fertilizers, food industry, ceramic, etc.) in areas limited by lack of infrastructure.

Use of small-scale LNG as a fuel for the transportation sector - trucks, buses, ships
- is increasing, stimulated by the increasing cost of conventional fuels and
environmental concerns.

1.     INTRODUCTION
       The purpose of this report is to analyse the LNG chain concept, using different
       technologies available in the market for small volumes (1-15MMscf/d), in order to
       monetise small volumes of associated gas and avoid or reduce the current gas
       flaring.
       The LNG technology is mature, in use for over 50 years. This maturity allows
       applications for small volumes to be competitive and economically attractive.
       As part of the chain analysis, an overview of the existing micro/mini LNG
       liquefaction technologies will be provided with their main characteristics. A
       recommendation will be done for the most suitable processes for the volumes and
       characteristics of this study.

2.   BACKGROUND
     The Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR) is a public-private
     partnership, hosted by the World Bank, which brings together a wide range of
     countries and companies to work together to reduce gas flaring and utilize the gas,
     currently flared, in economically beneficial ways.


                           13
       The GGFR Partnership was initiated in 2002 and has been active since in
       providing advice and guidance to GGFR Partners on a wide variety of flaring
       related issues including regulation, measurement, reporting, and utilization
       technologies.
       The World Bank intends through this study to provide all GGFR partners an
       overview of the potential solutions to monetise the associated gas in order to
       decrease the global associated gas flaring.




3.     LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG)

3.1.   LNG business evolution in a nutshell
       The idea to liquefy the natural gas appeared after some centuries of gas
       experiments as a solution to bring large volumes of gas from the source to the
       consumers in an economical way. The LNG reduces the volume of natural gas
       approximately 600 times.
       The LNG provides:
        gas transport across long distances where pipelines are not feasible or too
         expensive
        flexibility of gas importation
        secure supply from different suppliers



       The first LNG commercial plant started operations in 1940 in Cleveland, Ohio,
       USA. It was a peak shaving plant to cover the high gas demand during the winter
       period. The terminal was in operations for almost four years until a fatal accident
       occurred in 1944. This accident postponed the implementation of new LNG project
       for several years.
       In 1959, Great Britain received the first LNG carrier, the Methane Pioneer, from
       the US.
       LNG international trade started in 1964 between Algeria and France and the UK.
       The first liquefaction facilities in Algeria, the CAMEL (Compagnie Algérienne du
       Méthane Liquide) project had a capacity of 1.2 mtpa and the process was
       developed by Air Liquid and Technip and used three separate cooling cycles
       (propane, ethylene and methane).
       Since then, 26 LNG exporting facilities have been built all over the world (17
       countries) with a total capacity of 280 mtpa, with capacity range from 1 to almost
       8mtpa per train. As mentioned, the LNG technology is mature and the excellent
       safety record demonstrates the strong standards and regulations, and industry
       commitment to risk management.




                             14
The LNG industry has historically developed import/export projects of ever
increasing capacity to capture economies of scale as illustrated on Figure 1. The
maturity of the technology, however, now allows development of other LNG
applications, often of smaller scale, that increase gas distribution flexibility and to
reach new consumers as illustrated on Figure 2.

                       15
       In this new market approach, the demand for small scale LNG is growing both to
       monetise small gas fields or associated gas and to deliver gas to a new and
       different type of customer.



3.2.   LNG terminals main codes and standards
       LNG industry has a remarkable safety record mainly due to the strict application of
       standards and best practices from the design to the operation of the facilities. The
       most stringent code categories are applied.
       As a general rule, the following order of priority is applied to the design and
       operation of LNG facilities:
        Local/ national laws and regulations,
        Requirements of design and construction specifications,
        Referred codes and standards.
       There are two widely used standards for the design of LNG facilities:
         EN 1473: European Standard for Installation and equipment for LNG – Design
          onshore installations
        NFPA 59A: American Standard for the Production, Storage and handling of
          LNG.
       There are other national standards, like Recommended Practice for LNG Facilities
       (JGA-102) from Japanese Gas Association, which are only applicable in Japan.
       In addition to the general LNG facilities standards, additional standards are
       followed specifically for LNG tanks, civil works, piping, equipment, insulation,
       electricity, instrumentation, safety, communications, etc. Some of them are
       International Standards developed by International Standardization Organization
       (ISO) and some others are local or European or American. The appliance of each
       one it will depend on the area where the project is developed.
       Regarding the mini/micro LNG facilities, the dedicated standards are applicable
       either for vehicular use or for a specific range of capacities, for instance:
          EN 13645: Installations and equipment for liquefied natural gas - Design of
           onshore installations with a storage capacity between 5 t and 200 t
        NFPA 57: LNG Vehicular Fuel Systems Code
        ISO 16924: Natural gas fuelling stations — LNG stations for fuelling vehicles
           (still under development)
       If those codes are not applicable, the LNG facilities shall follow the general LNG
       standards previously mentioned.




                             16
4.   LNG EXPORTING FACILITIES
     Natural gas liquefaction is a process which typically involves several steps: a
     number of feed gas pre-treatments and liquefaction as shown in figure 3: block
     flow diagram.




                             Figure 4: Liquefaction Block Flow Diagram




     The gas pre-treatment will depend on the feed gas composition and on the
     requirements of the liquefaction process, but basically it consist of:
      Acid gas removal unit: to remove acid gases (CO2 and H2S) to prevent freezing
       out and blockage in the downstream liquefaction unit.
      Dehydration: to remove water to prevent ice and hydrate formation in the
       liquefaction unit.
      Mercury removal: to reduce mercury level in the feed gas to prevent corrosion
       in heat exchanger (aluminium).
      Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) (condensate) extraction: to remove heavy
       hydrocarbons to prevent freezing in the cryogenic sections and/or to meet the
       required LNG specification (i.e. High Heating Value (HHV) or Wobbe Index).


     Once the feed gas has been treated and conditioned, it is liquefied in the
     liquefaction unit and stored as LNG in the storage tank(s) and then distributed to
     the consumers by ship or truck (or train). Liquefaction is achieved by cooling,
     liquefying and subcooling the hydrocarbons to a temperature ranging from -145°C
     to -160°C, depending on the operating pressure. The subcooled hydrocarbons are
     then flashed at atmospheric pressure. In these conditions the LNG is at about -
     160°C. There are several processes to liquefy natural gas developed by different
     companies under licences.



                          17
       The LNG specification will be fixed according to the consumers' needs; however
       as general rule a typical LNG specification is as follows:

            Composition (mol %)
           C4+                                    2.0 max %
           C5+                                    0.1 max %
           N2                                     1 % max
           CO2                                    50 ppm max
           Benzene (mg/Nm3)                       4 ppm max
           HHV (BTU/SCF)                          37–43 MJ/Sm3
           Wobbe Index                            48-53 MJ/Sm3


                                     Table 1: Typical LNG Composition




4.1.   LNG liquefaction process for standard size
       terminals
       There are four main large-scale liquefaction process:
        Propane Pre-cooled Mixed Refrigerant Process (C3MR) designed by Air
         Products & Chemicals, Incorporation (APCI)
        Optimized Cascade Process (Cascade) designed by Conoco Phillips.
        Double mixed refrigerant process (DMR) designed by Shell
        Mixed Fluid Cascade designed by Linde



       The APCI C3MR is the most installed process for LNG exporting terminals with
       around 86% of the market, followed by the Conoco Phillips Cascade with 10%,
       DMR by Shell with 3% and Linde process with 1%.
       The different process block flow diagrams are shown here below.




                             18

                          Figure 8: Mixed Fluid Cascade- Linde




These processes are complex and require a very significant investment; therefore
they are mostly installed in plants of more than 1 mtpa capacity.
In order to develop small/mini LNG liquefaction projects, the processes have been
simplified using a different design approach to make them economically viable for
small volumes.




                     20
5.     MINI/MICRO LNG LIQUEFACTION
       TECHNOLOGIES
       Small scale LNG facilities typically refer to facilities with a capacity between 0.2
       to 1 mtpa.
       Mini/micro LNG facilities are the LNG liquefaction plants and LNG satellite
       stations with capacities below 0.2 mtpa. These mini/micro LNG quantities
       correspond to the yearly LNG demand of a power plant up to 100 MW (as
       indicative value).



5.1.   General
       Many liquefaction technologies use a refrigeration cycle and can be classified
       based on the characteristics of this cycle. A limited number of technologies do not
       use refrigerant, and are described by specific features.
       When classifying the liquefaction technologies according to the refrigerant cycles
       they employ, one usually finds the following wording:
          Closed or open cycles
        Single or multiple cycles
        Single or mixed refrigerants (one single component or a mixture of several
           different components)
       Additional functions like pre-cooling, which improve the efficiency of the
       refrigeration cycle, are also options in many of the liquefaction technologies.
       The following list covers a wide range of liquefaction techniques:
          Pre-cooled Joule-Thomson Cycle
          Nitrogen Expansion Cycle (also called closed Brayton or Claude cycle)
          Cascade Cycle
          Mixed refrigerant cycle
          Open cycle (includes Open Claude cycle)
          Gas expansion
          Stirling cycle
          Liquid nitrogen open cycle evaporation
          Thermoacoustic driver orifice pulse tube refrigerator (TADOPTR)
       Out of these technologies three are of particular interest for the 1-15 MMscf/d
       range:
        Nitrogen and gas expansion
        Mixed refrigerant, and
        Single Mixed Refrigerant




                             21
5.2.     Peak Shaving
         When looking at small capacities it is to be mentioned that peak shaving has been
         implemented since several decades. Therefore it is deemed of interest to briefly
         review the technologies typically used for this type of application. These
         liquefaction technologies were/are:
          Gas Expansion
          Nitrogen Expansion
          Mixed Refrigerant
          Cascade



5.2.1.   Gas Expansion
         The gas expansion process is attractive when a facility is located where a large
         volume of natural gas can be let down from a high pressure to a low pressure gas
         distribution system. The process is often applied with no compression or minimal
         compression, which helps reduce power requirements. The process liquefies about
         15% of the feed gas and the balance is discharged to a low pressure system
         (pipeline). The ratio of high to low system pressures drives the process. A ratio of
         approximately 16:1 to 20:1 (in absolute pressure) is needed for the process to be
         applied efficiently with little or no compression. Lower pressure ratios drive the
         process to liquefy less of the feed gas.
         A typical gas expansion process is shown here-below. All of the feed gas is
         dehydrated before it enters the process. Two expander/compressors are then used
         to boost the pressure of the gas. After compression and cooling, the gas is split into
         parts. The major portion is expanded and used as refrigerant, and then dumped to
         the low pressure system. The minor portion to be liquefied is sent to a carbon
         dioxide removal unit and then to the cold box. The major portion of the feed gas is
         cooled and expanded in two steps to provide cold streams for liquefying the gas.




                          Figure 9: Gas expansion process (Courtesy of Black & Veatch)

                                22
         The major benefit of this technology is the reduction in power consumption. For
         many situations, no compression is required; however, the process is capital
         intensive due to the complexity of the cycle with multiple expander/compressor
         systems, multiple exchangers and the need to process a much larger gas stream,
         due to the fact that this type of gas expansion process requires that some of the
         feed gas being used at low pressure without being liquefied. Another issue with
         expansion plants is the sensitivity to feed gas pressure and composition. Pressure is
         related mostly to capacity, but the composition is critical (it determines the CO2
         allowance in the gas to be liquefied) in the cold separators and in the carbon
         dioxide solidification area.


5.2.2.   Nitrogen Expansion
         The nitrogen refrigeration process utilizes nitrogen to accomplish liquefaction.
         The process works by compressing the nitrogen(either produced on-site or
         purchased) and then cooling and expanding it in two steps to produce temperatures
         low enough to liquefy the feed gas. This process has been used for many years, but
         it has had limited application recently because of the large amount of power
         required to circulate the nitrogen. In the recent years the nitrogen refrigeration
         process has been mostly applied on small-scale projects where refrigerant power
         consumption is not a primary consideration. Indeed this arrangement is rather
         simple but its efficiency is poor as the feed gas is cooled, condensed and subcooled
         again a single component, single phase refrigerant. It is to be noted that the
         refrigerant is entirely in its vapour form. Efficiency improvement can be obtained
         by implementing additional levels of expansion. However this efficiency increase
         will have to be weighed against cost and complexity increase.
         It is to be noted that nitrogen is an efficient refrigerant in cryogenic applications
         but shows poor efficiency at higher temperature levels of the liquefaction process.
         As a consequence many nitrogen cycles include a precooling unit that provides
         refrigeration duty at higher temperature levels. Again this efficiency increase has
         to be weighed against cost and complexity increase.

                                23
5.2.3.   Single Mixed Refrigerant (SMR) process
         A SMR is a single cycle using a mixture of different components (nitrogen plus
         hydrocarbons from methane to isopentane) as a refrigerant. A SMR can tightly
         follow the feed gas cooling curve, and thus has a better thermodynamic efficiency.
         The SMR process is widely used in the LNG industry. This process is based on a
         single mixed-refrigerant (SMR) system to perform the liquefaction. The system
         includes a refrigerant separator, upstream the main heat exchanger, which produces
         vapour and liquid streams. The coolant liquid flow rate (and, therefore, the vessel
         holdup) can be changed in the distributed control system. This liquid flow rate
         combined with a constant high pressure (HP) vapour stream determines the
         molecular weight of the refrigerant in the main exchanger. Therefore, the
         refrigerant can easily be adjusted for changes in feed conditions while the plant is
         in operation, which allows to ensure a level of efficiency by adjusting the process
         to the modified cooling curve. Gas or nitrogen cooled liquefaction processes
         cannot alter the composition of the circulating refrigerant; the only adjustment
         available is flow rate (of refrigerant). This ability to adjust to changes in feed gas
         conditions and composition is the primary reason that mixed-refrigerant systems
         are more flexible.

                                 24
5.2.4.   Cascade
         Higher efficiency can be achieved by using several single components in separate,
         sequential refrigeration loops to better match the cooling curve of the natural gas.
         The architecture of cascade processes follows this principle. As each loop contains
         a single component refrigerant it supplies refrigeration at a given temperature
         level. The various refrigerant loops are cascaded in series in order to reach the
         temperature needed to liquefy the natural gas. The loops typically contain propane,
         ethylene and methane. The efficiency of the cascade cycle is higher than the
         nitrogen expander. However there is still a loss of efficiency in trying to match the
         discrete refrigerant temperature levels (propane, ethylene…) with the condensation
         of the natural gas. The efficiency can be improved by increasing the number of
         stages of refrigeration or by utilising a greater number of refrigerants. In turn cost
         and complexity increase.
         This process is no longer used in the peak shaving/small scale applications.



5.3.     Associated Gas
         When producing crude oil from a reservoir and treating it for transport or storage
         vapour hydrocarbons are released. These vapours are called the associated gas.
         Such vapours result from the multiple flashes imposed to the crude oil during its
         treatment. These vapours also can come from the reservoir itself, should a gas cap
         be present or should the reservoir pressure be lower than the crude oil bubble
         point. In such case the reservoir fluid (the crude oil) is two-phase in the reservoir
         itself which means that gas and liquid are produced at the same time. As gas
         moves more easily in the reservoir than oil the gas to oil ratio tends to increase
         over time.
         In many cases, pressure in a crude oil reservoir decreases over time as the oil is
         produced. In these cases, the crude oil production rate generally is kept constant
         during a given duration (plateau) and then gradually decreases as the reservoir
         pressure does so. In surface the wellhead pressure decreases too, leading to the
         requirement to adjust the oil treatment pressure accordingly. As a consequence the
         associated gas will be produced at a flow rate, pressure and quality varying with
         time over the life of the oil reservoir.
         The mini/micro LNG plant should be designed based on the most probable
         associated gas production profile while maximising profitability. The gas pre-
         treatment over design or space reservation for additional treatment could be
         envisaged if there are some uncertainties on the gas composition/contaminants
         evolution over time. A modular approach could also be considered in order to
         adapt the liquefaction capacity to the associated gas flow. For this reason, reservoir
         studies are needed as the gas production, pressure and composition profiles will be
         estimated from these studies.
         As reservoirs are mostly made of water saturated rocks it is to be noted that the
         hydrocarbons produced from a well are generally water saturated.
         Crude oil reservoirs can contain impurities such as CO2, H2S, Mercury, Nitrogen
         and their nature is such that heavy hydrocarbon components are typically at higher
         concentrations than in gas reservoirs.

                                25
         Many liquefaction facilities in the range 1-15 MMscf/d exist across the world.
         However the vast majority of these facilities are fed with pipeline gas. Pipeline gas
         is a hydrocarbon stream already treated to meet pipeline transportation
         specifications. These specifications are not as rigorous as is required for
         liquefaction, but result in gas with much more favourable characteristics than
         associated gas, which is a raw untreated product.
         In addition, pipelines typically operate at pressures above 40 barg, which is high
         enough to feed a liquefaction unit. Pipelines also deliver a continuous supply so
         operation of the liquefaction unit is not interrupted by feed gas supply issues. In
         contrast, associated gas supply, by its nature as an oil production bi-product, is
         variable and can be interrupted, and is often at low pressure (which implies
         additional compression for some processes to reach their normal operating
         pressure)



5.4.     Current status overview (technology
         screening)
         There are different liquefaction technologies that could be applied for small
         volumes as considered in the present study, i.e. 1-15MMscf/d (equivalent to
         approximately 20-300 tpd or 0.0073-0.1095 mtpa).
         The products from several companies have been selected for the purpose of this
         project for deeper analysis – these companies are:
            Linde / Cryostar
            Black & Veatch
            Chart
            Wartsila / Hamworthy
            GE Oil & Gas
            Galileo
            Dresser-Rand

         This list is not exhaustive and some other players also have available technologies
         for this type of application (e.g. APCI or Cryonorm).


         Notes:
          Wood Group Mustang is also active on the LNG liquefaction market; however
           its current technologies (LNG Smart, OCX and NDX) are not deemed
           applicable to the 1-15 MMscf/d mini/micro LNG range;
          The CAPEX, OPEX/specific consumption and GHG emissions associated to
           the mini/micro LNG liquefaction technologies in the range 1-15 MMscf/d are
           discussed collectively in chapter 5.6.


5.4.1.   Linde / Cryostar
         The liquefaction technologies proposed by Linde can be classified as follows:
            The Mixed-fluid cascade (MFC) technology
                               26
              The StarLNG™ and StartLiteLNG™ products, covering Nitrogen Expansion
               and SMR technologies

5.4.1.1.   MIXED FLUID CASCADE
           The MFC is adapted to the 3 to 12 mtpa LNG capacity.
           This process uses three mixed refrigerant cycles. The process is comprised of
           plate-fin heat exchangers for feed gas precooling, Coil Wound Heat Exchangers
           (CWHE)for liquefaction and LNG subcooling. The process also includes three
           separate mixed refrigerant cycles, each with different compositions, which result in
           minimum compressor shaft power requirement. There are three cold suction
           centrifugal compressors in the cycle.




                                   Figure 12: MFC process (Courtesy of Linde)


           There is one reference for this technology – it is the Snohvit liquefaction facility
           located in Hammerfest, Norway. This plant has a capacity of 4.3 mtpa.
           As indicated the capacity range for this technology is far above the 1 to 15
           MMscf/d (0.01 to 0.12 mtpa). As a result it won’t be further discussed.

5.4.1.2.   STARLNG™
           As mentioned earlier the StarLNG™ product family covers liquefaction
           technologies based on Nitrogen Expansion as well as liquefaction technologies
           based on SMR cycles.

                                 27
NITROGEN EXPANSION
The StarLiteLNG™ plant, part of the StarLNG™ product family, is a standardized
product covering the liquefaction capacity range of 1 to 10 MMscf/d (20-200 tpd).
The process is designed and manufactured by Linde's fully owned subsidiary
CRYOSTAR.
The StarLiteLNGTM unit is based on Linde’s proprietary EcoRel system, used for
on-board re-liquefaction of boil-off gas (BOG) on LNG carriers such as the Q-Max
carrier (transporting world-scale LNG cargoes from Qatar to the Far East).
At the heart of the StarLiteLNGTM refrigeration unit is the compander, a
combination of compressors and an expander in a single machine, with an
integrally geared design, that is installed in the nitrogen refrigeration cycle.
The following figure shows the main principles of these units.
                                                                                                    N2

This technology is in industrial use with about 18 references. Most of these
references are for LNG carriers’ on-board re-liquefaction units. Currently there is
one 28 tpd unit (~1.4 MMscf/d) being delivered for a Biogas liquefaction plant
located in Indonesia.

The Nitrogen closed loop is a gas-gas cycle designed to be flexible in term of
turndown and gas composition, and able to cover a large range of feed gas
composition change in particular with nitrogen content, subject to be considered
during design stage.
The Nitrogen single expansion stage closed loop can operate with a pressure from
7 to 10 barg. Pressure above this value is possible but brings no added advantage
in term of power consumption due to the process in a single expansion stage.
The StarLiteLNGTM requires medium voltage electrical power, instrument air and
cryogenic quality nitrogen for seal gas.
Linde also offers StarLNG™ Nitrogen Expansion based units for capacities up to 5
MMscf/d (100 tpd) using its own expanders. This range of product is in
commercial use and there are approximately 10 referenced plants with Nitrogen
expansion technology designed and/or build by Linde in this range. It is to be
noted that 8 out of the 10 references were built between 1970 and 1990. The latest
project is the Gazmetro project in Montreal, Canada, which is currently being
developed, with ~6 MMscf/d (120 tpd) liquefaction capacity. This project is based
on a dual expander cycle.


SINGLE MIXED REFRIGERANT

The StarLNG™ SMR cycles were developed for capacities from about 5 MMscf/d
(100 tpd) up to 80 MMscf/d (1,600 tpd) with Plate Fin Heat Exchangers (PFHE) or
up to 150 MMscf/d (3,000 tpd) with CWHE.
These cycles are based on the LIMUM® products.
LIMUM® 1 is suitable for capacities below 80 MMscf/d (1,600 tpd); down to 5
MMscf/d (100 tpd).
In this cycle the low pressure (LP) mixed refrigerant is compressed in a two stage
centrifugal compressor and partially condensed against cooling water or air. Both
phases of the compressed mixed refrigerant are jointly fed to a brazed aluminium
PFHE, are fully liquefied and subcooled. After expansion through a Joules-
Thompson valve the mixed refrigerant is fully vaporized, and the cooling provides
the refrigeration for natural gas liquefaction and, if required, fractionation to
remove LPGs.

                     Figure 16: LIMUM® 1 process (Courtesy of Linde)


LIMUM® 3 is adapted to capacities ranging between 30 to 150 MMscf/d (6,00 to
3,000 tpd)
In this arrangement the LP mixed refrigerant is compressed in a two stage
centrifugal compressor and partially condensed against cooling water or air. The
heavy, liquid mixed refrigerant fraction is used in a CWHE to pre-cool natural gas
and to condense the light, gaseous mixed refrigerant fraction partially. The
resulting, intermediately boiling mixed refrigerant fraction serves as liquefaction
refrigerant, while the remaining light ends mixed refrigerant fraction sub-cools the
liquefied natural gas.




                     Figure 17: LIMUM® 3 process (Courtesy of Linde)

                      31
The LIMUM® 1 and LIMUM® 3 technologies are in commercial use and have
several references. The smallest referenced capacity is about 6 MMscf/d (120 tpd)
and there are 4-5 references in the range 6 to 15 MMscf/d (120-300 tpd).


GAS QUALITY REQUIREMENT

The gas quality requirement is independent of the size and technology of the
liquefaction unit. As a consequence the quality requirement is similar to all plants.


GAS QUALITY VARIATION

Composition variations can be handled within a certain range. However this
depends significantly on the gas composition, degree of variation and possible
measures within process design which can already be considered during the design
phase.


PRESSURE EVOLUTION

Below approx. 50 barg feed pressure, there is a strong impact on the energetic
efficiency. As a rule of thumb, a 10 bar pressure drop results in approx. +/- 10%
efficiency reduction. Above 50 barg feed pressure, the efficiency increase per
increase in feed pressure still increases but less pronouncedly.


UTILITY REQUIREMENT

Electric Power (alternatively for MR cycle: steam in case of a steam turbine driver
or fuel gas in case of a gas turbine driver).
Nitrogen for purging and seal gas, Instrument Air (IA) for pneumatic control
valves.
MR Make Up: Nitrogen (available as plant utility), Methane (from dry feed gas),
Ethane/ethylene, Butane (commercial grade, to be purchased).


CARBON FOOTPRINT

Depending on the design and operating philosophy, e.g. no flaring philosophy
except for emergency, carbon footprint of such a plant can be minimized and the
major CO2 generation will be related to the power consumption of the MR
compressors.
No environmental issues are known that have stopped LNG projects awarded to
Linde. Some of Linde’s reference plants have been built with close proximity (few
kilometers) of residential areas or next to environmental sensitive areas (sea, nature
reserves).




                       32
         APPLICATION IN LESSER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

         Make up refrigerant required for the SMR process only requires supply of
         commercial butane and ethane/ethylene which is normally available globally;
         especially if an NGL plant is nearby. Methane is taken from dry feed gas and N2 is
         available as plant utility at Site.
         Both process technologies require well trained, reliable and educated operational
         personnel. Even though SMR process operability is more demanding than a
         nitrogen cycle, the required skills of operators are similar and can be ensured
         through extensive training.


         APPLICATIONS IN SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS

         No such limitations are present. References exist for plants in operation under
         harsh climatic conditions (e.g. Northwest China, Norway).


         LINDE’S GENERAL REFERENCES

         Linde has a number of plants in operation:
          In remote areas
          With oil production associated gas application; however typically with
           upstream NGL extraction.
          With low pressure feed gas pressure application
          With significantly changing flow over time. In several of Linde’s plants, feed
           gas unavailability has led to plant operation at flow levels as low as 20% of the
           design capacity. Such turndown is only achievable with Linde’s proprietary
           CWHE design and the LIMUM® SMR process, which is typically applied from
           capacities of 300 tpd. The STARLNGTM process technology with PFHE is able
           to handle feed gas flow variation within a certain range (up to 50%).


5.4.2.   Black & Veatch
         Black & Veatch has developed a proprietary mixed refrigerant process, PRICO®,
         which has been used in base load and peak shaving applications. It is a SMR loop
         and a single refrigeration compression system. The MRt is made up of nitrogen,
         methane, ethane, propane and iso-pentane. The component ratio is chosen to
         closely match its boiling curve with the cooling curve of the specific feed gas
         composition. The closer the curves match, the more efficient the process becomes.
         The MR is compressed and partially condensed prior to entering the insulated
         enclosure known as the "cold box”.




                               33
The cold box contains a number of PFHE cores that allow multiple streams to be
heated / cooled to extremely close temperature differentials. The MR is fully
condensed and then flashed from high pressure across an expansion valve, causing
a dramatic reduction in temperature. This very cold vapour is used to condense the
MR stream, as well as the natural gas feed stream. The warmed LP MR vapour is
then sent to the compressor for recompression. The natural gas feed stream enters
the cold box and is initially cooled to about -35°C. The gas is then sent to a
separator to remove heavier components, which are sent to the fractionation plant.
The expanded MR then cools the remaining light components, primarily methane,
to liquefaction temperature.




                Figure 18 - PRICO® Process Flow (Courtesy of Black & Veatch)


The PRICO® process is in commercial use.
There are 14 references in the range 3 to 18 MMscf/d. Capacities from 1 MMscf/d
should be possible, as the technology is feasible at virtually any size.
The mixed refrigerant process has a low equipment count which helps in the ease
of operation and minimization of maintenance costs. Having only one compression
system, the mixed refrigerant process should have the highest reliability.
Black & Veatch’s standard unit includes gas treating (sulphur , mercury removal
and dehydration) capable of handling a wide range of feed gas compositions and
pressures and to prepare the gas for liquefaction. If other feed components like
benzene, n-hexane, and mercaptans are present that may cause issues in the cold
box additional gas treating may be required.




                       34
         The PRICO® process can handle a wide variety of feed gas compositions, ambient
         temperature conditions, and other operating parameters. By adjusting the
         refrigerant composition, plant production is optimized for the feed conditions at
         the time of start‐up. While a precise refrigerant composition is not necessary to
         operate the unit, the composition can be modified “on the fly” to maintain optimal
         performance of the unit. High purity refrigerant makeup components are not
         required and readily available commercial grade components, purchasable from the
         market even in lesser developed countries and/or remote areas, can be used.
         Black & Veatch has developed a modularized LNG plant, including all associated
         gas treating, storage and off-loading, and it is available in the following
         approximate sizes: 8 MMscf/d, 16 MMscf/d, 24 MMscf/d, and 32 MMscf/d. All
         these designs are in modular units which can be mixed and matched as desired,
         Black & Veatch provides EPC services for the full turnkey design and build of
         LNG facilities, including the PRICO® LNG one-time non-transferrable
         technology license and its associated guarantees. Black & Veatch do not currently
         have a leasing or rental scheme but this could be considered on a project by project
         basis.

          Integrated Pre-cooled Single Mixed Refrigerant(IPSMR) – see figure below
          IPMSR+ which includes an additional pre-cooling with Chart’s core-in-kettle

These technologies are proposed as part of the following product line:
 C100N which has a 165 tpd (8.25 MMscf/d) liquefaction capacity – this
  technology is based on a nitrogen cycle
 C250IMR which has a 400 tpd (20 MMscf/d) liquefaction capacity - this
  technology is based on a mixed refrigerant cycle
 C450IMR which has a 725 tpd (36.25 MMscf/d) liquefaction capacity - this
  technology is based on a MR cycle


The principle features of all the plants are as follows:
Chart's scope includes all equipment required to liquefy and store pipeline quality
natural gas (Cold Box, Air Cooled Heat Exchanger (ACHX),Brazed Aluminium
Heat Exchanger (BAHX), Compressor, Expanders, Storage Tanks).
Plants can incorporate ‘bolt on’ modules to handle gas pre-treatment, nitrogen
rejection and NGL recovery for a variety of different raw gas compositions (refer
to IPSMR figure).
Plants feature Chart designed and manufactured BAHXs for improved thermal
performance and operating efficiency.
Key equipment, comprising heat exchangers, cold box and storage tanks, is
designed and manufactured in-house.
Chart’s EPF (Engineering, Procurement, Fabrication) business model offers
maximum flexibility in the execution strategy for these plants. Based on typical
engineering, equipment build, site construction and commissioning schedules, the
anticipated cycle time from order to first liquid is approximately 18 to 24 months,
depending on the plant capacity.

5.4.5.     GE Oil & Gas
           GE Oil & Gas offers liquefaction technologies from its ‘Small Scale LNG’ product
           line. Please note that GE Oil & Gas product line is evolving and now includes the
           Salof technologies.
           The ‘Small Scale LNG’ portfolio includes various technologies:
            Expansion with BOG or nitrogen refrigeration
            Pre-Cooled Mixed Refrigeration (PCMR)
            Single Cycle Mixed Refrigeration (SCMR)

           GE's 'Small Scale LNG' portfolio covers the range 2 to 300-400 MMscf/d (40 to
           6,000-8,000 tpd).

           The working principle of the nitrogen expansion cycle (LH side of figure) and boil
           off gas expansion cycle (RH side of figure) are shown below:

GE Oil & Gas has about 10 references in the 1-15 MMscf/d range. GE Oil & Gas
(Salof) has references for each type of liquefaction technology (GE do not provide
additional information)
GE Oil & Gas offers fully integrated plants. For these plants, the smaller the size
the higher the modularity, they can be:
 Stick built
 Modular
 Fully Modular Plug-n-Play

5.4.6.   Galileo
         Galileo proposes a liquefaction technology from its Cryobox® product line.
         Galileo’s Cryobox® system is a compact natural gas liquefaction plant in trailer-
         size modules capable of producing 12 to 16 tpd of LNG per module (equivalent to
         about 0.6 to 0.8 MMscf/d).




                                   Figure 27: Cryobox® (Courtesy of Galileo)


         Cryobox® Liquefaction technology is based on a compression and expansion
         process; no more detailed information on the liquefaction process is available.
         The pre-treatment technology is made up of zeolite adsorption modules (=
         molecular sieves). More modules are added according to the gas composition if
         needed.



                                40
         Cryobox® can easily be deployed with no need of major infrastructure. The only
         requirements are ground levelling and inlet/outlet connections. If there is no
         electrical power available, the best options are natural gas fired generator(s) or a
         (higher cost) natural gas motor.
         Although Galileo´s technology is new in the market, there are already seven in
         operation in Argentina and one is scheduled to start production in March 2015 in
         North Dakota (USA), for flaring mitigation applications.
         Sale and rental options are available. Rental schemes are adapted to each
         operation, where full on-site service support is provided, with production volume
         supply and quality guaranteed by contract, and technological updates at no cost
         during contract duration. Companies which prefer not to take on the technological
         risk find this approach extremely beneficial.


5.4.7.   Dresser-Rand
         Dresser-Rand offers liquefaction technology from its LNGo™ product line.
         Dresser-Rand’s LNGo™ system is a modularized, portable natural gas liquefaction
         plant capable of producing 10 to 14 tpd (equivalent to about 0.5 to 0.7 MMscf/d).
         The production plant is a standardized product made up of four packaged skids: a
         power module, compressor module, process module and a conditioning module.
         The unit is powered by natural gas which is also used as the process refrigerant to
         eliminate complexity and maintenance.

       demonstration unit (for which only limited information is available).



5.5.   Liquefaction Process Gas Pre-Treatment
       Requirements
       No differentiators were identified between the various liquefaction technologies in
       terms of gas pre-treatment requirements.
       Before entering the liquefaction unit the gas must be treated in order to remove the
       impurities that otherwise would be detrimental to the process. These impurities
       typically are water, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, oxygen and mercury as
       well as COS (Carbonyl Sulphur) and other sulphur compounds. In addition, heavy
       hydrocarbons (C5+) must be removed s they cause freezing problems in the
       cryogenic heat exchangers.
       The typical gas specifications at the liquefaction section inlet are:
        Water: 0.1 ppmv max
        Carbon dioxide: 50 ppmv max
        Hydrogen Sulphide: 4 ppmv max

       A number of technologies are available to achieve these specifications. Typically,
       the following are used:
        Molecular sieves for water removal
        Molecular sieves, Amine unit & Membranes for acid gas removal
        Chilling for heavy hydrocarbons removal



                                  42
         Pre-treatment of associated gas can be significantly more complex than pipeline
         gas as the impurities may be present in higher quantities, particularly heavy
         hydrocarbons. This will require greater equipment capacity, higher energy
         consumption, and increased impurities disposal and by-products management. It
         also can contain large amount of ethane, propane, butane that may have to be
         removed/reduced depending on the LNG specification requirements. Unless they
         can be spiked into the oil stream, these hydrocarbons will need to be stored and
         exported, increasing CAPEX and requiring additional space and logistics. It is to
         be noted that, should ethane have to be removed, there is no guarantee that there
         would be a (local) market for this product..
         Depending on the associated gas supply pressure, compression may have be
         required, if deemed globally beneficial( as it is usually more economical to add a
         feed gas compression rather than operating on a low pressure liquefaction basis).
         This will increase the CAPEX and space requirement, and potentially reduce
         availability/reliability.

             expansion nitrogen refrigeration) or PCMR or SCMR
         (3) To be confirmed.
         For lower capacities around 1 MMscf/d, the new “micro LNG” solutions proposed
         by Dresser-Rand (LNGo™), Galileo (Cryobox®), GE (LNG in a box™) and Linde
         / Cryostar (StarLiteLNG™) seem promising; however these solutions are just
         beginning to be commercialized.
         For higher capacities, a more proven single “mini LNG” plant (as proposed by
         Black & Veatch, Chart, GE, Linde or Wartsila) can be used, as a conventional
         plant, or in a modular approach. As an alternative “micro LNG” units could also be
         used (e.g. the BUQUEBUS LNG station; see next figure), depending on the overall
         costs and planning of a specific project.

         According to information provided by some of the potential suppliers and / or

         mini/micro LNG liquefaction plant (including some “standard” gas pre-treatment
         but no LNG storage) in the range 1-15 MMscf/d should be in the range 4-27
         MMUSD (2014), as shown by the following graph (N2 = nitrogen cycle; Gas = gas

It was not possible to make a clear distinction between the equipment CAPEX of
the different technologies (nitrogen cycles or gas expansion cycles; no specific
equipment CAPEX was available in the 1-15 MMscf/d range for mixed refrigerant
cycles). This is in accordance with some information that can be found in the
literature.
In order to obtain the total installed cost (in MMUSD 2014), the above values
should approximately be doubled:

           The above cost data include gas treatment equipment for a "typical" pipeline gas
           composition (i.e. low carbon dioxide, nitrogen, heavy hydrocarbons, water content,
           and minimal sulphur compounds or mercury); however the information provided
           by the suppliers did not include details as to the gas pre-treatment. Therefore there
           would likely be additional CAPEX for gas pre-treatment unit for associated gas as
           feed gas, the amount depending on the specific gas composition. There could also
           be additional CAPEX depending on the gas composition and / or LNG quality
           specification; for example if a lean LNG is required from a rich associated gas, a
           LPG extraction unit would be required, or if the associated gas nitrogen content is
           too high, a Nitrogen Rejection Unit could be required.
           The above cost data are considered reasonable as indicative values for an
           associated gas recovery project economic evaluation. Each project, however, has
           its own specific constraints that could lead to increased cost.

5.6.2.1.   GAS PRE-TREATMENT UNIT
           Mini/micro LNG liquefaction plants typically include a “standard” gas pre-
           treatment train consisting of:
             Mercury removal unit;
            Acid gas removal unit (amines);
            Dehydration unit (molecular sieves).
           The CAPEX for this level of processing is included in the liquefaction cost vs
           capacity plot above. If .the feed gas quality is such that additional treatment is
           required, this will entail additional CAPEX.
           The CAPEX for such additional gas pre-treatment is estimated to be ~19 MMUSD
           for a 15 MMscf/d plant. According to the previous chapter this could represent an
           increase of about 35% of the CAPEX of a “mini LNG” liquefaction plant (of about
           15 MMscf/d), and even more in case of a “micro LNG” plant (of about 1
           MMscf/d).

           Gas quality is therefore a key factor that could impact the economics of an
           eventual associated gas recovery project, especially at the lower end of the
           foreseen 1-15 MMscf/d capacity range.


5.6.3.     Operating cost and specific consumption
           Apart from the maintenance cost and of the eventual operator(s) cost (depending
           on the plant size and level of automation), the OPEX of a mini/micro LNG
           liquefaction plant mainly comes from the power consumption.
           According to information provided by different potential suppliers and / or
           gathered from the literature, the specific power consumption of a mini/micro LNG
           liquefaction plant in the range 1-15 M MMscf/d should be in the range 0.7-1.1
           kWh per kg of LNG produced, as shown by the following graph:

                                                                                              Plant Capacity in MMSCFD



                                                                              Figure 33 – Equipment CAPEX vs Plant Capacity


         All the above data comes from nitrogen or gas expansion cycles; no specific
         consumption figure was available in the 1-15 MMscf/d range for MR cycles.
         According to the literature, nitrogen cycles should have higher specific
         consumption of 15 to 35 % compared to MR cycles, depending on the liquefaction
         plant data (feed gas quality and supply pressure, ambient temperature…).
         One supplier claims that he can reach a specific consumption as low as 0.6 kWh/kg
         for a plant capacity of ~1 MMscf/d with a non-mixed refrigerant cycle, but this is
         still to be confirmed on an actual real associated gas project.
         Unless a specific project and location is defined, it is therefore not really possible
         to compare the specific consumption of the possible LNG liquefaction solutions
         proposed by the different suppliers.


5.6.4.   Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
         The following processes lead to GHG emissions in a mini/micro LNG liquefaction
         plant:
                                                   Power generation;
                                                   Heat generation;
                                                   Acid gas removal unit vent;
                                                   Dehydration unit regeneration gas vent;
                                                   Emergency or maintenance venting.
         The main GHG emissions from a mini/micro LNG liquefaction plant are due to
         fuel gas combustion for power generation from gas engine(s). However if the
         mini/micro LNG liquefaction plant uses electrically driven compressors without
         on-site electrical power generation, there will be no on-site GHG emission for
         power generation.
                                                                              47
           The requirement for heat generation for gas pre-treatment depends on the type of
           gas pre-treatment required; heat is generally required for the amine regeneration
           reboiler and for the dehydration molecular sieve regeneration. If the mini/micro
           LNG liquefaction plant uses gas on-site gas engine(s), heat can usually be
           recovered from the flue gas. The level of GHG emissions associated with heat
           generation thus depends on the gas pre-treatment configuration, on the type of
           power generation, and on the degree of heat integration of the plant.
           The acid gas vent is a small flow, mainly consisting of carbon dioxide and the
           hydrogen sulphide initially present in the feed gas, plus some water and a small
           amount of methane. The GHG emissions associated with this stream thus depend
           on the feed gas composition.
           The dehydration unit regeneration gas is a flow mainly consisting of natural gas
           and water. It can be burnt as fuel gas for power generation (in case a gas motor is
           used), or recycled internally, or even vented if the regeneration flow is very small,
           as this is an unnecessary loss of feed gas. The GHG emissions associated with this
           stream thus depend on the gas pre-treatment configuration, the type of power
           generation, and on the degree of heat integration of the plant.
           Emergency or maintenance venting needs to be evaluated on a case by case
           analysis. It has to be noted that gas expansion or mixed refrigerant processes will
           lead to hydrocarbons release to the atmosphere in case of venting of the
           liquefaction cycle loop, while it won’t be the case for nitrogen cycles.

5.6.4.1.   POWER GENERATION BY GAS ENGINE
           If the mini/micro LNG liquefaction plant is equipped with on-site electrical power
           generation based on gas engine(s), the estimated GHG emissions due to the power
           generation are about 0.4 to 0.9 t CO2eq per t LNG produced; the exact value
           depends on the associated gas composition, gas engine efficiency and liquefaction
           plant specific consumption.


5.6.5.     Pros and cons of the main liquefaction processes
           The following table provides a basic qualitative comparison between the different
           types of liquefaction processes discussed in the previous chapters of this report
           (“+” is more favourable, “-” is less favourable):

                                      Nitrogen               Mixed            Gas expansion

               (1) In the 1-15 MMscf/d range.
               (2) No hydrocarbons in the liquefaction cycle.
               (3) Gas expansion cycles as proposed by GE Oil & Gas, Galileo or Dresser-Rand,
                   without a dedicated low pressure gas utilisation (other than the fuel gas for
                   internal power generation).
               (4) This type of liquefaction process has actually no real commercial reference.
               It can be concluded from the above table that no liquefaction process has all the
               advantages and no disadvantages. The nitrogen or mixed refrigerant cycles are
               credible and proven alternatives for the 1-15 MMscf/d range, while the gas
               expansion cycles are promising solutions for the lower side of this capacity range.
               Some project specific constraint (like safety or flexibility) might be in favour of
               the nitrogen cycles, while the increased flexibility of the mixed refrigerant cycles
               might be required to match a specific associated gas production profile (with
               changing composition).


5.6.6.         Applicability to offshore projects
               Some of the above mentioned “main” LNG liquefaction plants suppliers, such as
               Black & Veatch and Linde, have some experience and / or have made some
               developments in offshore applications. Therefore it should be possible to
               implement an offshore LNG liquefaction plant in the range 1-15 MMscf/d with
               this kind of supplier; however it would be on a case by case basis (to be
               confirmed).




6.             LNG STORAGE
               There are two main types of LNG storage tanks: vertical cylindrical flat bottom
               tanks (or self-supporting) and vacuum insulated pressurized tanks (bullets).
               As a general rule, the main selection criterion to choose one or the other is the
               volume of LNG to be stored. For larger LNG volumes, vertical cylindrical tanks
               are the optimum solution, due mainly to their lower cost per m³ of LNG and lower
               space requirement (mainly for full containment type1).




1 Single and double containment type are not considered for this study due to the space required for the secondary
containment




                                         49
                   Figure 34 Vertical cylindrical flat bottom tank



For small volumes the vacuum insulated tanks are the best option for several
reasons: short delivery time, can be built in the workshop (maximum volume of
per unit of 1,000m³), simpler and less expensive foundation system, allows
modular and sequential construction, better behaviour in seismicly active areas and
lower boil-off gas generation from heat ingress.




                      Figure 35 Vacuum insulated pressurized tanks



The breakeven point between one technology and the other is between 10,000m³ to
15,000m³; below10,000m³ vacuum insulated tanks are recommended, while above
15,000m³ flat bottom tanks are preferred. For intermediate volumes (from 10,000
to15,000m³) the storage type should be analysed case by case.
Analysis the cost per m³ for both technologies, we obtain:
   Cost of LNG storage for bullets is roughly 2,000 USD /m³ (for a storage
    volume of 1,000 to 15,000m³)

                      50
            Cost for LNG self-supporting tank is roughly 1,000 to 1,300 USD/m3 (for tanks
             from 15,000 to 30,000m³)

7.       LNG TRANSPORTATION
         LNG distribution from the liquefaction facilities to consumers could be either by
         land using LNG trucks/trailers or by water using LNG ships/barges. Railway
         transportation is not considered in the scope of this study.
         The selection of one or the other will depend on several factors:
            Location: sea side, waterway,
            Required investment: infrastructure, number of units, etc.
            LNG production (volume to transport)
            Existing infrastructure: roads, traffic
            Distance to consumers

         All these factors will determine the most suitable transportation system although
         marine transport obviously requires easy access to the sea or suitable waterways.



7.1.     LNG transportation by truck/trailer

7.1.1.   LNG trailers characteristics
         The LNG trucks or trailers are designed for cryogenic temperature.


                                      51
         They are double walled, with internal containment in stainless steel or aluminium
         and external in carbon or stainless steel and vacuum isolation in between with
         super insulation (multilayer) or perlite. This system reduces the production losses
         due to heat transfer; moreover some studies confirm that the LNG can be stored in
         a trailer for more than 45 days without any venting due to the pressure increase
         from the boil-off gasses.




                                          Figure 36: LNG Trailer




7.1.2.   Safety
         The LNG trailer is equipped with safety equipment to protect it against over
         pressure; a pressure relief device should safely release the gas to the atmosphere if
         the tank pressure exceeds the maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP).
         A safety assessment is recommended in order to identify the potential risks during
         the truck transit on public roads and highways as well as their consequences and
         probability of occurrence.


7.1.3.   Codes and standards
         The codes and standards applied for the LNG road transport on trailers are
         different in each country. However the USA standards on LNG are considered a
         benchmark and are also followed by other countries such as Australia and Canada.
         In the USA, the LNG trucks shall follow the Department of Transportation’s
         design standards DOT CFR49 specifications– 49 CFR parts 173.318 and 178.338
         (MC-338) and also the specifications of NFPA 52 ‘Vehicular Gaseous Fuel
         Systems Code’.
         In Europe the LNG road transport is regulated by the European Agreement
         International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR).




                               52
7.1.4.         LNG trailer costs
               The cost of LNG trailers varies from one country to other, therefore is very
               difficult to provide an order of magnitude that could be applicable worldwide.
               As reference, an average cost in the US of an LNG trailer of 40m³ (capacity for
               maximum allowed weight in the US) is in the range of 300k USD including the
               tractor.


7.1.5.         Methodology for truck number calculation
               For estimating the required number of trucks for a specific project the following
               elements have to be considered:
                  Maximum allowed weight in the country
                  Maximum allowed speed of the truck
                  Distance from the source to the consumer
                  Truck traffic regulation (for instance night driven allowed?)
                  Loading & unloading time
                  LNG demand at the consumer

               For instance, for a project in the USA where the consumer is located at 150km
               from the source, average truck speed of 50km/h and an equivalent LNG
               consumption of 60m³/hour, the optimum number of trucks would be 14. Two spare
               trucks are included to cover the unavailability of the trucks due to maintenance
               activities. This means that the terminal would receive around 35 LNG trucks per
               day.



7.2.           LNG transportation by ship/barge
               If the liquefaction facilities are located at sea or waterway side, LNG
               transportation by ship or barge could be more interesting than trucks due to the
               possibility of transporting bigger volumes and longer distances.
               The small LNG vessels are a range in size from 1,000 m³ to 18,000 m³ and are
               basically mini versions of conventional LNG carriers. The smallest current LNG
               carrier is the Knutsen Pioneer with a capacity of 1,100m³.
               The high cost of small LNG carriers (between 25,000 to 40,000 USD/day),
               together with a maximum recommended occupancy of 80%2, make their use very
               difficult its use for mini/micro LNG facilities.




  2   The ship maximum occupancy is calculated to have some allowance for maintenance, inspections and bad
      weather conditions in order to minimize the impact in the LNG facilities operation.




                                         53
8.     RECEIVING FACILITIES
       LNG receiving facilities have three main functions:
         Unloading
        Storage
        Send-out and measurement
       The LNG is unloaded, sent to the LNG storage and, from there pressurized and
       vaporized before feeding the gas grid or dedicated consumer.




8.1.   Unloading facilities
       The unloading facilities are significantly different if the LNG transportation is by
       truck or by ship. In the case of supply by ship, the terminal requires: jetty platform,
       unloading arms or hoses, gangway, fences and hooks, dolphins, unloading lines,
       recirculation, etc.
       If the LNG is supplied by truck, the facilities are much simpler and therefore less
       expensive. The main components of LNG truck unloading facilities are:
         weigh-bridge
        unloading bay composed of the following elements
         - unloading pump
         - LNG unloading arm or flexible hose
        safety equipment
        associate utilities


       The number of unloading bays is calculated according to the LNG volumes and
       consequently the number of LNG trucks per day.

8.2.     Storage
         Options for storage at the receiving facility are the same as at the liquefaction
         plant. See Section §6.



8.3.     Re-Gasification and Send-out
         LNG will be pressurized from the storage tank(s) by LNG pumps up to the
         consumer pressure level and sent to the vaporizers.
         There are four main types of vaporizes:
          Open rack vaporizer (ORV): which uses sea/river water as the heat source, is
           composed of panel-shaped heat transfer tubes. LNG flows upward inside the
           finned heat transfer tubes, while water flows down along the outer surface of
           the tubes.
          Submerged combustion vaporizer (SCV): a fired heat source LNG vaporizer
           using low pressure fuel gas coming from the boil-off gas system. The SCV uses
           a heat transfer coil installed in a water bath, with the liquid LNG flowing inside
           the coil. The conventional vaporizer is equipped with submerged combustion
           burners firing into the water bath.
          Shell and Tube vaporizer (STV): uses a liquid as heating media to evaporate the
           LNG. The LNG flows through multiple tubes and the heating fluid enters in the
           shell surrounding the tubes. If an open loop is used, sea/river water is used as
           the heating fluid. If a closed loop is used, a variety of fluids can be used: glycol,
           water, propane, etc.
          Ambient Air vaporizer (AAV): uses air as the heating medium, either with
           natural or forced draft.

                For low volume facilities, ambient air vaporizers are in most of the cases the most
                suitable choice for the LNG re-gasification mainly due to the negligible OPEX
                and environmental impact even if CAPEX is the highest. This type of vaporizers
                have been proven in small scale LNG Terminals since many years ago with a very
                good performance even in adverse weather conditions like Norway.
               Once re-gasified, the natural gas is sent to the consumers/grid through the metering
               station.



8.4.           Utilities and buildings
               In addition to the main systems, the importing facilities will requirethe following
               utilities and buildings:
                  Electricity
                  Instrument air
                  Nitrogen system
                  Water system

8.5.           Capital cost
               The capital cost of a receiving facility varies as a function of a number of
               parameters: storage capacity, send-out capacity, send-out pressure, unloading
               facilities, local conditions (supply of equipment and raw material, manpower cost),
               etc.


 3ORV    OPEX is lower than STV if close loop due to the water and air heaters
 4   The number/design of the buildings will depend on the size of the facilities. It should be analysed case by case.

       facility with the following characteristics:
          Storage capacity of 4,000m³ (3 days)
          Send-out gas at medium pressure (~45barg)
          Ambient air vaporizers
          3 truck unloading bays
          Utilities and buildings

       would be around 35 MMUSD.



8.6.   Operating cost
       The operating cost (OPEX) of LNG Terminal is mainly composed of:
         Personnel (salaries, training, consultant, etc.-)
        Consumables (water, nitrogen, oil, dry powder, emulsifier, electricity, etc.)
        Maintenance (outsourcing, spare parts, etc.)
        Other costs (insurances, customs and taxes, etc.)
       being the consumables (mainly electricity) and personnel the most important
       components. Both strongly depend on the local conditions.
       In general, the OPEX of LNG importing facilities is estimated between 3 to 5% of
       the CAPEX.




9.     LNG MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES OF
       AMERICA

9.1.   Overview of the natural gas market in the
       USA
       Since the mid-1950s, domestic consumption of energy - used by industry,
       transportation, commercial and residential users - has exceeded the domestic
       production in USA. The gap has increased over time, reaching a maximum in
       2005. Since then, technological development has provided new methods to take
       advantage of unexploited energy resources and improvements in the efficiency of
       traditional energy production, reducing the gap. The USA has experienced a rapid
       increase in natural gas and oil production from shale and other tight resources in
       recent years. Nowadays, the USA is the largest producer of petroleum and natural
       gas in the world.

 Primary energy consumed in the United States is mainly in the form of fossil fuels:
 coal, oil and natural gas. Together, they represent more than 80% of total
 consumption. Particularly, Coal was the main energy source until the middle of the
 20th century, when it was surpassed by crude oil and natural gas.

                       Since 2005, the country's unconventional gas production grew at a rate of 35% a
                       year. In 2007, shale/tight gas production was around 8% of total natural gas
                       produced in the USA6. Today, unconventional gas share has reached 40% of total
                       gross gas production. Furthermore, unconventional gas production's share by state
                       has significantly changed in the US, with major producers currently located in
                       Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Arkansas.

         Thanks to the continuous increase in shale-gas production, it is expected that,
         rather than being an LNG importer, the USA will become an important player in
         the LNG export market. Its first liquefaction plant will start operations late
         2015/early 2016. Furthermore, liquefaction capacity under construction or study
         would reach around 12,000 Bcf/y (approximately double of current regasification
         capacity).

9.2.     Overview of Small-scale LNG in the USA
         This section presents an outline of the uses and main drivers of mini/micro LNG
         liquefaction technologies in USA, with particular focus on those applicable for use
         with small volumes (1-15 MMscf/d) of associated gas.


9.2.1.   Peak shaving plants
         Within the USA, LNG was initially applied to “peak shave” natural gas use. Peak
         shaving by LNG consists of liquefying and storing natural gas during the off-
         season (summer) and then vaporizing and releasing it back into the pipeline
         network during high demand periods (winter).
         Extremely low temperatures affect gas demand mainly in northern states, resulting
         in daily peak loads often 1 to 2 times larger than during regular winter days.
         Distribution companies must take this peak demand into account when contracting
         their transport capacity to assure adequate supply. This is a very inefficient way to
         secure peaking services, since the additional capacity is paid for on a 365 day
         basis, while it is used for just a few days (or even, a few hours) a year, depending
         on the weather.

                  Currently, the USA has 68 peak shaving plants where LNG is produced and stored.
                  Their total liquefaction capacity is around 7.75Mt/d, with a range from 20 tpd to
                  470 t/d per plant. Considering these plants liquefy during 200 days, in average, the
                  total liquefaction capacity is 1,550 Mt/y. The total regasification capacity is 4,817
                  MMscf/d, providing around 5 to 15 days of storage at the maximum send out rate.

                  The significant reduction in peak shaving plant additions after 1980 was due to gas
                  supply curtailments, the development of more economically attractive peaking
                  supply options (underground storage and LNG import terminals) and, recently, the
                  boom in gas availability.

         In recent years, peak shaving liquefaction facilities are also being used to supply
         heavy vehicle fleets. This supply source would appear to be an ideal (but limited)
         LNG vehicle fuel because the investment in plants has already been made. The
         following table shows the 14 peak shaving plants which currently also supply LNG
         to heavy vehicles.

         There are, however, a number of challenges associated with dual-usage of the
         facilities: Some peak shaving facility owners are reluctant to drawdown their LNG
         reserves for other than their primary purpose of peak shaving. Utility regulatory
         agencies are cautious about approving such plans due to the potential requirement
         of partial reimbursement to ratepayers, who originally paid for the capital
         investment through tariff in the gas price. Finally, peak shaving plants are not
         necessarily located near areas of LNG vehicle fuel demand.




9.2.2.   LNG as a fuel
         The most prevalent purpose for 'new' small-scale LNG facilities in the USA is the
         production and dispensing of LNG as a vehicle grade fuel. The following table
         shows the 14 liquefaction plants exclusively dedicated to vehicle fuel supply.

The Production-to-Dispensing model mainly employs a centralized liquefaction plant
from which the LNG is distributed in special trailers to local storage and dispensing
sites. There, the LNG is dispensed to heavy-duty vehicles directly as LNG or, after
regasification, to light-duty vehicles as CNG.
There are 38 additional private stations serving only own vehicles, customer fleets or
government fleets. According to the US Department of Energy, another 70 stations
– public and private - are under construction or in planning stages.

The LNG infrastructure dedicated to supplying LNG as fuel has developed to date in
discrete location where deployment of LNG vehicles has been accompanied by
development of infrastructure (e.g., Los Angeles and Phoenix). LNG vehicles currently
in operation are therefore limited in range by the distribution of stations and, unlike
diesel vehicles, are not yet able to traverse the entire country. However, as the
infrastructure continues to develop, broader opportunities for LNG vehicle markets will
emerge. Development of corridors to connect various hubs is in progress, including the
joint UPS-Clean Energy effort to connect Southern California to Las Vegas.
The USA consumes 37 billion gallons of diesel per year and 10 billion gallons of diesel
per year, which suggests a huge potential market for cheaper alternative fuels such as
LNG.

Developing infrastructure to support these new LNG trucks is the major hurdle.
The current 63 LNG public stations compare with 157,000 gasoline stations. The
LNG fuel industry needs to reach critical mass of infrastructure to persuade
operators to switch over. In trucking, major investors are partnering with filling
(conventional gas/diesel) station operators to orchestrate nationwide LNG filling
networks.
Clean Energy Fuels has been one of the first companies to provide a network of
LNG fueling stations, with 27 stations completed and 60 more planned in the near
future. Additionally, with two liquefaction plants, Clean Energy Fuels will take
part in both stages of the supply chain: production and marketing.

Another company with large investments in US LNG fueling infrastructure is
Chinese-owned ENN. They have plans to build up to 500 LNG stations, and have
partnered with a small Utah company, CH4 Energy, to create Blu LNG, a joint
venture trading company. ENN also expects to build LNG liquefaction plants in
the future.
Shell is also investing in both LNG liquefaction and refueling infrastructure. The
two liquefaction facilities planned will support two new LNG refueling networks
located in the Gulf Coast Corridor (Texas and Louisiana) and the Great Lakes
Corridor. Shell has partnered with Travel Centers of America in long-term plans to
develop a commercial LNG fuelling network spanning the USA as shown in the
map below.

Finally, UPS is working with the US Department of Energy to advance the LNG
technology deployment in the marketplace. Launched in 2009, the program's
objective is to encourage the reduction of petroleum usage and reduce greenhouse
emissions. Part of that mandate is to increase investment in infrastructure, assist in
the purchase of LNG equipment, and construct fuelling stations. The targeted LNG
corridor stretches from Los Angeles, in California, to Nevada and Utah. UPS has
already purchased 700 LNG tractors and built 4 new fueling stations.
In conclusion, the LNG market as a vehicle fuel has grown, but is still a small
portion of the fuel market in the USA. Some barriers individually or in
combination could limit the deployment of LNG facilities, such as:
 Capital Cost of LNG Plants: When attempting to match the size and capital
  cost of LNG production facilities with the customer base, there is a tension
  between economic production volumes and product demand. That is, larger
  facilities with capacities of 50,000 gallons/d and more achieve reasonable
  economies of scale. However, they require a larger customer base than exists,
  especially before the LNG plant is built. The development of LNG
  infrastructure and its success as a transportation fuel requires a different
  strategy from that adopted historically for other fuels to break the “coordination
  problem” between supply (infrastructure) and demand (fuelled vehicles) . LNG
  needs significant infrastructure investment along the supply chain including
  liquefaction facilities, LNG distribution trucks and LNG stations before
  significant vehicle adoption will occur. On the other hand, small facilities (less
  than 4 MMscf/d of production) cannot be built cost-effectively with the
  technologies that have been deployed to date.
 Cost and range of LNG Vehicles: LNG buses and heavy-duty trucks currently
  cost up to USD 50,000 more than those conventionally fuelled, which is
  difficult to justify for vehicles that do not travel a large number of miles each
  day/week. Moreover, LNG trucks have a reduced resale value.

                    The range of single-tank LNG trucks today is around 300 miles, half that of
                    diesel trucks, requiring up to twice as many refuelling stations for the same
                    coverage. A solution is dual-tank LNG trucks, but this implies a significant
                    additional cost per vehicle, and may not be viable except on trucks with the
                    longest distance duty cycles.
                   Engine Options: LNG is more suitable as a fuel for heavy-duty trucks or buses
                    than CNG, since the latter is not a viable option for the provision of long
                    distance services due to the weight of its tanks and/or the lack of travel range.
                    The natural-gas-fired engine industry has been slow to respond to the need for
                    high-horsepower engines, which are necessary for the heaviest long-haul trucks.
                    Nevertheless, several engine producers are now offering heavy-duty gas-fired
                    engines.
                   Fuel Prices: The gap between diesel fuel and LNG prices, with the equivalent
                    energy content, needs to be high enough to encourage public and private fleets
                    to substitute LNG for diesel. This gap has increased with the boom in shale gas
                    production and the related fall in natural gas prices in the US. The gap is
                    however reducing again with the drop in oil price.
                  Alternative fuel station deployment suffers a “coordination problem” - the
                  uncertainty in timing of station building and vehicle purchases - which dissuade
                  either party from committing to the vehicles or station that depend on each
                  another9. In this regard, Federal and State governments have been asked to provide
                  incentives, tax credits, and subsidies to encourage development of the
                  infrastructure.


9.2.3.            Liquefaction projects at oil production sites
                  From 2008 to 2012, North Dakota accounted for 0.5% of total gross natural gas
                  production in the United States but flared 22% of the total natural gas that was
                  either flared or vented in the USA (EIA).

9   The “coordination problem” is common in social science, representing situations where all parties can realize mutual
    gains, but they are no individual incentives to take decisions in a cooperative way. This problem is usually analyzed in
    game theory by means of “coordination games”, which are a class of games with multiple pure strategy Nash
    equilibriums. A common application is the choice of technological standards. Not by chance, a common application of
    this theoretical tool is the analysis of technological alternative standards.

Natural gas production in North Dakota's portion of the Bakken formation has
grown significantly, alongside the rapid rise in oil production in the State. Natural
gas production has outpaced additions to the State's gas pipeline and processing
facilities capacity. As a result, the amount of non-marketed natural gas output
continued to grow, rising to an average of 0.31 Bcf/d by the end of 2013, almost
twice the level of 2011 (0.16 Bcf/d), according to the North Dakota Department of
Mineral Resource.
Several projects have come online in the past years to improve North Dakota's
ability to bring new gas production to market including expansion of gas treatment
plants and pipelines and the application of General Electric’s CNG in a box system
(GNG).
North Dakota LNG LLC (NDLNG), part of the oil and gas services company
Prairie Co. LLC, brought the first LNG liquefaction facility online in North Dakota
during 2014. The facility is located adjacent to Hess Corp’s recently commissioned
natural gas processing facility near Tioga, N.D. Using Hess supplied feedstock gas,
the ND-LNG facility initially produced 0.8 MMscf/d. The capacity of the facility
is expected to increase to 6 MMscf/d.
Although the NDLNG facility will provide LNG to more than just the oil and gas
industry, the first use will be for drilling rigs operated by Slawson Exploration Co.
The volume of diesel used for drilling operations varies, but can be as high as 0.2
MMscf/d.
The trucking and transport arm, Prairie Field Services, will supply each rig site
with storage for the LNG along with staff to help implement the use of the LNG to
power the rigs. It is also expected to use LNG in its vehicles.

In the zone of Bakken formation (shale oil/gas fields in Montana, North Dakota,
Saskatchewan and Manitoba) will provide dual-fuel (gas and diesel) basis
equipment (trucks and construction machinery, among others) allowing them to
switch fuel sources in case of lack of gas supply.

        In 2010, Prometheus Energy Group Inc., Encana Oil, Gas (USA) Inc. and Ensign
        United States Drilling, Inc. worked together to repower two diesel fuelled drilling
        rigs with natural gas fuelled engines. Prometheus Energy designed, built and
        commissioned LNG mobile storage and vaporization equipment, and provided the
        LNG fuel for the project. The dedicated LNG fuelled rigs, the first of their kind,
        provided Encana significant cost savings, while also reducing NOx and particulate
        emissions by as much as 25%.
        Prometheus Energy's mobile LNG solution has now been used for drilling
        operations in Louisiana, Utah, Texas, Wyoming, Colorado and California. The use
        of natural gas in these drilling operations replaces approximately 1,500 gallons
        daily per rig of diesel, or over 500,000 gallons per rig annually.
        In 2006, Prometheus installed the world’s first commercial LNG liquefaction plant
        using landfill gas in Orange County, California. The entire output of the plant, with
        capacity of 0.4 MMscf/d, has been used to fuel public transport vehicles.




10.     LNG MARKET IN CHINA

10.1.   Overview of the natural gas market in China
        China is the world's most populous country, with a fast-growing economy, which
        has led it to be the largest energy consumer and producer in the world.
        Additionally, rapidly increasing energy demand, especially for liquid fuels, has
        made China extremely influential in worldwide energy markets.

              Oil was the second-largest source, accounting for 18% of the country's total energy
              consumption. While China has made an effort to diversify its energy matrix,
              hydroelectric (7%), natural gas (5%), nuclear power (nearly 1%), and other
              renewable energy sources (2%) accounted for relatively small shares of China's
              energy consumption. The Chinese government plans to cap coal use to below 65%
              of total primary energy consumption by 2017 in an effort to reduce heavy air
              pollution that has afflicted certain areas of the country in recent years.
              Although natural gas production and use is rapidly increasing in China, gas
              comprised only 5% of the country's total primary energy consumption in 2013.
              Major investment in upstream gas development and increased imports, including
              LNG, are likely to support significant growth in China's natural gas sector.

China has a number of natural gas producing regions, in the western and central
areas of the country and offshore. While continuing to develop natural gas fields,
China's oil companies are also exploring other gas sources such as shale gas and
coal-bed methane.
China's primary onshore gas producing regions are Sichuan Province in the
Southwest (Sichuan Basin); the Xinjiang and Qinghai Provinces in the Northwest
(Tarim, Junggar, and Qaidam Basins); and Shanxi Province in the North (Ordos
Basin). China efforts have been focused on several offshore natural gas fields
located in the Bohai Basin and the Panyu complex of the Pearl River Mouth Basin
(South China Sea).
Historically, natural gas exploration has been closely linked to the development of
oil fields, with the exception of the Sichuan gas field, which was, until recently,
the largest non-associated gas field. Nowadays, more than two-thirds of proven
reserves in the country are currently classified as non-associated gas. The three
majors NG basins are Tarim, Ordos and Sichuan.

From 2000 to 2012, China's natural gas production increased more than three fold.
However, this was not enough to meet demand, leading to a significant increase in
gas imports.
Investments in natural gas pipeline infrastructure aim to link production areas in
the western and northern regions of the country with demand hubs along the coast
and to allow greater imports from Central Asia and Southeast Asia. Over the past
years, China has ramped up imports of natural gas via pipelines as production from
Central Asia and Myanmar increased and as gas infrastructure in the region
improved. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline (CAGP) transports natural gas through
twin parallel pipelines from Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan to the
border in western China. The China-Myanmar gas pipeline has boosted China´s
gas imports and diversified its sources of supply. In 2013, CNPC officials signed a
framework agreement with Gazprom to purchase 1.3 Tcf/y of gas from the
proposed East Siberian pipeline, which is expected to connect Russia's Far East
and Sakhalin Island to northeastern China.

At the end of 2014, the 12 operating LNG import terminals had a total capacity of
35 mtpa. By 2018, when the planned 17 terminal come on line, regasification
capacity would grow to 75 mtpa.
So far, NOCs (National Oil Companies) have led natural gas development in
China. International players partnered with them when developing projects
requiring more technical expertise. Additionally, the changing landscape of China's
gas supply sources (toward greater imports) and the need to boost gas investments
recently led the government to implement price reforms and align domestic natural
gas prices more closely to market-based rates.

10.2.          Overview of Small-scale LNG in China
               This section reviews the uses and main drivers of mini/micro LNG liquefaction
               technologies in China.
               A series of factors sustain the growth of the small LNG industry.
               First of all, the demand-supply gas balance in China is very tight, while the
               pipeline grid is limited. Since China’s natural gas pipeline infrastructure density is
               significantly lower than developed countries such as the US, most communities lie
               outside the reach of pipelines, requiring LNG/CNG storage and trailers to transport
               gas to those regions. In eastern and southern China, many industrial and urban
               users11 still have limited supply of natural gas, especially for peak-shaving
               purposes during winter. However, gas use in those areas would increase boosted
               by the expansion of urban gas distribution networks, and tightening even more
               daily and seasonal peaks supply in the coming years. Therefore, development of
               LNG storage capacity is very important.
               Secondly, in regions far from the main transmission pipeline, where it is not
               economically viable to build pipeline connections, mini-LNG could be a viable
               alternative solution for gas supply. In addition, natural gas serves as an alternative
               fuel in the transport sector. Finally, from the gas producer's perspective, LNG is
               also a solution to unlock the potential of stranded gas fields.

              Regarding        liquefaction
              infrastructure,   the    first
              liquefaction    plant    was
              installed in 2000. Currently,
              China      has     a    retail
              liquefaction capacity of
              2,100 MMscf/d (16 mtpa of
              LNG), spread across 120
              small-scale plants12. Plants
              under construction or in
              planning stage would add
              another 2,400 MMscf/d to
              this capacity.

              LNG production is produced in the north-western (50% of total liquefaction
              capacity) and central-north provinces (40% of total capacity). The figure below

As LNG transport,               Example of traditional LNG tanker route: from
traditionally, trucks         Shan Shan LNG plant in Xinjian to satellite stations
travel across the                              along the coast
country from the
western and central
gas         producing
regions, often with
routes of more than
3,500 km long, to
supply LNG satellite
stations at major
cities along the
North-east and South
coast.
Nonetheless, as more
LNG            import
terminals come on
stream along the
East coast, the routes                            Source: Linde
for LNG trucks will
become shorter.
Ex-plant prices, which include wellhead prices and processing fees, have been
traditionally set by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)
for each well (onshore conventional gas) and each region. They are based on the
type of end-user – for example, industrial, residential, fertilizer and power sectors
– which are supplied.
Consumer affordability has been the key driver of ex-plant price regulation but the
determining factor is the production cost, which depends on the source of local
gas. Well-head prices are calculated from a base price (which takes into account
project cost, taxes and loan repayments), processing fees and an appropriate
margin for producers. Processing fees are determined by the quality of the gas and
subject to negotiations between the NDRC and producers. The ex-plant price
serves as a reference for producers and buyers to negotiate final prices within a +/-
10% band. It applies only to conventional gas since the price of unconventional
gas price is based on market rates.
In China there is an important spot market where the LNG is traded. Operations
are performed by electronic trading (West Center of Shanghai Petroleum
Exchange) or conventional trading. Regarding electronic way, LNG can be traded
on DES (Delivered ex Ship) or FOB (Free on Board) mode. There is also a freight
market. The local LNG competes now with the imported LNG, moved from the
large regasification terminals.

10.2.1. LNG as fuel for vehicles
        The national government has strongly encouraged the deployment of natural gas
        fueling infrastructure, especially for LNG stations. In 2013, there were 3,350 CNG
        stations, and more notably, 1,844 LNG stations. The 12th Five Year Plan (2011-
        2015) includes a target of 5,000 LNG stations. The CNG deployment - as well as
        LNG - is led by the three major Chinese oil and gas state-owned enterprises: China
        National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC, which do business as PetroChina and via
        its subsidiary Kunlun Energy), China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation
        (Sinopec), and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). Some private
        energy companies, such as ENN Energy Holdings, Xinjiang Guanghui Industry
        Investment Group, and Hanas New Energy Group based in Ningxia and Shandong,
        are also doing business in the area.

                Gas use in transportation sector accounts for around 13% (or 20.6 Bcf) of total gas
                consumption. Its significant share is supported by the government’s gas-use policy
                (especially its subsidy for LNG trucks), zero VAT on transport gas, favorable oil
                and gas price differentials and the rapid growth of natural gas refueling stations.
                An increasingly important vehicle segment for potential natural gas penetration is
                the heavy-duty long-haul freight trucks and semi-tractors. Natural gas use in this
                segment will be possible thanks to the use of LNG instead of CNG. An estimated
                63,000 vehicles in China were LNG-fuelled in 2013.

                In 2014, China LNG Group Ltd (a financial-investment company) has issued a
                statement declaring the Company and Sinopec Fuel Oil Sales Corporation Limited
                (Shanghai) have entered into a sales framework agreement. This would enhance
                the cooperation for the development of a LNG market, including the development
                of LNG refueling stations and the application of LNG heavy-duty trucks in China.
                As a pilot program, the contracting parties intend to select two highways - Ningbo
                Expressway (G60, connecting Shanghai and Hangzhou, 151 km) and Pu-Hangzhou
                Expressway (G15, connecting Pudong and Hangzhou, 112 km) -, adding LNG
                infrastructure to existing filling facilities13. Following successful implementation
                of such stations, Sinopec will increase the number of LNG fuel stations based on
                the demand and development of the company’s LNG businesses.
                PetroChina and Kunlun have been deploying a “gas -for-oil substitution” strategy
                since 2011. Natural gas for these stations has been sourced from conventional gas
                fields, as well as coke oven gas, coalbed methane, and LNG terminals. Large and
                small provinces, including Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Shanxi,
                Qinghai, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Hainan, and Guizhou have LNG
                stations under construction.


10.2.2. LNG as fuel for vessels
                China is beginning to pay attention to the development of LNG as a vessel fuel,
                which should achieve coastal and inland shipping "green environmental
                protection”. Vessel power changing to LNG would become the development trend.

Currently, the main experience carried out in China is “changing diesel to LNG”
for vessel fuel. In 2009, usage of vessel power for diesel-LNG hybrid technology
project in Suqian City, Jiangsu Province was officially launched. In 2010, "Su-Su
goods 1260" freighter in the Northern section of the Grand Canal began real ship
trials. Afterwards, a hybrid diesel-LNG ship, carrying 3,000 tons of sand, sailed
from Suqian City into Huai'an City. Currently, some Chinese companies, such as
Hubei Xilan, Beijing Youlu, Guilin Xin’ao, Xinjiang Guanghui, Fujian Zhongmin,
are in the process to change some vessels of their fleet from oil to gas.

in Wuhan city for the demonstration and application of LNG fuelled ships, and
developing the "gasified Yangtze River strategy".
Yangtze River is the longest and busiest river in China. The Yangtze River Delta
explains around 20% of China’s GDP and in 2012; almost 1.8 billion tons of cargo
were shipped on the waterway. The large number of ships (especially those with
large tonnage), the high utilization rate and, hence, high fuel consumption,
represent a huge potential market for LNG bunkering.

      Despite LNG represents many advantages as a marine power fuel its application
      and promotion is still facing many problems that should be solved in future.
      Firstly, the alternative cost of vessel is higher but the sailing time is too short.
      Although LNG storage tank volume is small, but the system is complex and layout
      is difficult. At the same time, installing cylindrical LNG storage tanks will reduce
      part of the carriage space. Secondly, the biggest obstacle for promoting LNG as a
      marine vessel fuel in China is a serious deficit of supplying facilities. Nowadays,
      gasoline facilities are very spread in the marine network, while LNG is still giving
      its first steps in this field.
      In the next section, some lessons from USA and China developments in the small-
      scale LNG industry will be summarized.




11.   LESSONS FROM USA AND CHINA
      Based on the described experiences in USA and China, several lessons on the
      promotion of small volumes of LNG can be learned.
      First of all, small-scale LNG is an already proved technology. It has been
      implemented in USA since 1950 and in China since 2000. However, its
      development curve has been extremely steep in this Asian country.
      Secondly, small-scale LNG solutions have been implemented in the following
      way:
       Restrictions of infrastructure:
        - In USA, peak shaving was used to solve pipeline network restrictions or
           deficient storage capacity.
        - In China, domestic gas demand had a boom which could not be matched by
           the required infrastructure development (gas transportation and
           transmission). LNG virtual chain provided a transitional solution to solve
           the gap.
       Demand does not reach the minimum volume required to invest in traditional
        gas infrastructure transportation.
                            82
       Emission reduction policies (already implemented in China and expected in
        USA in the near future). It kind of policies can improve the economics of the
        projects.
       More competitive prices of natural gas in the transportation sector against
        petroleum derivatives.


      Third, strategic public policies - through laws and national companies - were a
      relevant factor to reduce the “coordination problem” in the natural gas market,
      improving LNG penetration and creating critical mass for the emerging LNG
      market, mainly in the case of China. In the USA, LNG market was developed by
      mean of market incentives.
      Last but not least, several barriers for the development of LNG have been found,
      such as: the “coordination problem” for investment decisions (for infrastructure
      development), the minimum scale (demand / supply) required assuring economic
      viability and the prices that the demand is willing to pay for the new equipment. In
      the case of China, the “coordination problem” was solved by the action of the
      state, the vast majority of times by means state-owned enterprises investments.




12.   APPLICATIONS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES
      The small volume LNG technologies existing in USA and China could be
      developed in countries with less developed infrastructure. In this respect, a
      particular analysis will be done for Nigeria, Iraq and Indonesia (small island-based
      markets) taking into account underlined lessons of USA and China in the previous.
      Firstly, a brief general, energy and infrastructure outlook of those countries will be
      presented. It is essential to provide an understanding of the situation of potential
      suppliers, clients and current infrastructure (e.g.: transportation network) to
      introduce LNG technologies. Finally, a preliminary analysis of several
      opportunities for small scale LNG developments in those countries will be offered

               The Federal Republic of Nigeria is a federal constitutional republic of West Africa.
               It has 36 states and its capital is Abuja. Nigeria the Gulf of Guinea (Atlantic
               Ocean) and shares borders with Benin, Chad, Cameron and Niger. As a tropical
               country, Nigeria´s seasons are determinate by rainfalls14 (South east receives more
               than 3.000mm a year, while the southwest 1.800mm15). Regarding the temperature,
               it does not present a significant variation in the south16 (average 27.5°C) but, in the
               north, ranges can be very wide17. As a result, climate might not be a significant
               conditioning factor for the Nigeria energy sector18.
               Nigeria has 173.6 million inhabitants, which become in the most populous country
               in Africa. The next table and graphs offer a geographical and general economic

12.1.1. Macro perspectives
                Nigeria became the largest economy in Africa in 201119. Oil sector represents 96%
                of exports revenues, which makes the economy of the country very vulnerable and
                dependent on international oil prices. In fact, the international Monetary Fund
                (IMF) estimates Nigeria´s growth rate will drop 5% in 2015 due to the oil´s price
                fall and the expected depreciation of the currency.
                However, the improvement of non-oil sectors (agriculture, trade and services and
                communication technology) might be the key factor to soften the drop of expected
                economy´s growth20, in which the Government of Nigeria has been making efforts
                in this way21.


12.1.2. Industry sector
                Based on the Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan22 (NIRP, 2014), manufacturing
                sector result weak in comparison with most developed manufacturing nations23.
                Power and transportation deficiencies seem to be the most important reason of this
                delay. Any effort aiming to accelerate the manufacturing sector will not be as
                efficient if these issues are not solved.
                Industries are concentrated on the shore (especially in the southwest), and some
                cement textile and motor vehicle industries are spread in the center and northwest
                of Nigeria24.


12.1.3. Transportation network
                Last decades, Nigeria has developed an extensive national road network. Its
                density is more than twice as high as these for resource-rich African countries,
                although only half of the levels found in Africa’s middle-income countries.

  21   Non oil sector contributed around unprecedented 40% to GDP in the third quarter of 2013and it is expected
       significant results based on Agriculture Transformation Agenda (2011). The industrialization of the agriculture
       sector - main driver of non oil sector - could be the major boost to maintain GDP at acceptable levels.
  22   Nigeria is envisaging an industrialization of the country, particularly in adding values to its commodities, as the
       agriculture field.

              The length of federal road network was 36,172 km in 2009. Nigeria´s paved
              network represents 65% of the system (of which 2/3 is in fair/good condition).
              However, the unpaved network share is 35% (of which 1/3 is in fair/good
              condition).
              Road maintenance remains underfunded and the network might suffer a significant
              fall in the quality of service level in the following years. In this regard, Nigeria
              created a federal road maintenance agency (FERMA), in order to aside the
              required budget to face the problem. FERMA has been addressing a reasonable
              amount for rehabilitation, but far deficient for prevent maintenance in countries in
              the region26.
              In terms of security, theft and violence in the routes are not insignificant issues.
              Government reaction was to spread police officer all over the national network as

12.1.6.1.   GAS POLICIES
            In 2008, Nigeria launched the National Gas Master Plan (GMP) in order to exploit
            the gas potential and accelerate the economic development. The GMP was
            followed by extra regulations that completed the gas framework: Domestic Gas
            Supply, Gas Pricing Framework, Gas Infrastructure Blueprint.




                                                     89
               In February 2008, the Federal Executive Council approved the Domestic supply
               Obligation (Domgas), in order to set aside a percentage of the country´s reserves
               and production for supply the domestic market, especially for the power
               generation. The Domgas also empowered the Ministry of Petroleum to periodically
               stipulate the quantity required and to penalize36 International Oil Companies (IOC)
               which does not comply with their obligations. The regulation stipulated an
               increasing curve of domestic supply37. Since IOCs stated its disagreement 38 on the
               new law, the policy was revised and the initial obligation supply for 2009 dropped
               to less than half of the previous stipulation. In May 2013, the target stated by the
               Government was 942 MMscf/d39 shared by IOCs, which shows a lack of
               compliance of the forecast developed in 2008.
               In addition, a gas pricing framework was also approved. As a result, domestic
               market was categorized in the following groups:
                Cost of Supply Basis: addressed to strategic domestic sector, particularly power
                 sector40.
                Product Netback Basis: strategic industrial sector (gas as feedstock)41.
                Alternative Fuels Basis: for commercial sector42.




36    With $3.5/MMscf, restriction on exports or both.
37    Starting at 3,000 MMscf/d in 2009 and forecasting an obligation supply of 5,000 MMscf/d by 2013 - The Nigerian
      Gas Policy: Issues, Challenges and Way Forward – Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
38    This policy was not welcomed by major operators due to the difficulty of breaking down long term contracts
      already signed. Furthermore, they stated the first step should be to secure the domestic gas supply
      infrastructure, and not to warrantee the gas supply.

40    The stipulated price was USD 0.4/MMscf to power with gradual increase, in order to reach USD2/MMscf by 2013
40.   In the period 2014-2016, the formula is expected to include the inflation rate of 5%.
41    The stipulated floor price was USD 0.9/MMs cf and the capped price, USD3/MMscf.

42    The stipulated price was USD 2/MMscf in 2010 stepping to USD 2.5/MMscf in 2013 and USD 3/MMscf by 2014.

               Nigeria has the lowest net electricity generation per capita in the world and
               frequently suffers blackouts and reliance on residential and commercial customer´s
               private generators. In order to revert the insufficient power system and encourage
               investments in the sector, Nigeria launched the “Power Sector Reform Roadmap”
               in 2010, which major goal was unbundling the electricity sector chain and promote
               private investments. Furthermore, the reform included several fiscal incentives to
               investment, as 30% reduction tax for power plants using gas.

  43   The CPF indentified were West Delta (Warri), Obiafu (North Port Harcourt) and Akwa Ibom /Calabar Area). In
       addition, transportation infrastructure was focused in 3 gas pipeline transmission systems: South North, Western
       System and interconnection.

              The Republic of Iraq, which is located in Middle East of Asia, is compounded by
              18 provinces or governorates. Its capital is Bagdad and it shares borders with
              Syria, Turkey, Iran, Jordan and Suadi Arabia. Iraq has a small coast on the Persian
              Gulf. Its climate is broadly hot desert, and average rain fall are 240 mm per year.
              Temperature has a wide range between winter and summer. The average
              temperature is above 40°C in the hottest months, while during the winter
              temperature can drop below 0°C.
              Since 1979, Iraq lived for almost 3 decades under a violent scenario that it has
              produced several problems for the energy infrastructure of the country.

12.2.1. Macro perspectives49
                 After 3 decades of war, the Ministry of Planning developed a four years economic
                 plan, which seeks the development of a better market economy by improving the
                 foreign and transit trade, (creating free zones) and re-creating financial, fiscal and
                 monetary policies.
                 Furthermore, the plan encourages the gradual shift towards the private sector, and
                 the restructuring of state-owned industries by promoting strategic partnerships with
                 foreign and local investors. It also aims to activate government-owned and private
                 banks.
                 Regarding resources, the plan emphasizes on the wiliness to increase oil and gas
                 production, in order to improve Iraq financial sustainability. Several politicians
                 made focus on the importance of private investments attraction50.


12.2.2. Industry sector
                 Iraq was historically strong in petrochemical and military sectors. Oil sector
                 contributed for 47% of the GDP, but less than 1% of Iraqi employment. However,
                 both were devastated by the wars and internal conflicts. It is important to note that
                 Iraq was by dominated state-owned enterprises, letting a small share to private
                 sector51. The private sector development program for Iraq (PSDP-I)52 sought to set
                 an effective framework for private investment development in the country. UNIDO
                 launched a project53 aiming “to support promotion of investment and development
                 of the private sector in the country” focusing in Baghdad and Basrah Governorates
                 (Al Faw), with additional locations to be determined.

  50   Prime Minister affirmed at the World Economic Forum – Davos “We turn now from the system controlled by the
        government to a mixed economy more active, as we privatize key sectors, and explore partnerships between
        the public and private sectors, and entering into joint ventures with international companies (…)” and
        Mohammed Saleh adviser stated “the solution is the need for the development of commodity secto rs, and today
        the state is moving strongly towards the revitalization of agriculture, manufacturing, and began a strong
        movement in this aspect.”

               In the province of Basrah are located some of the largest oil field, and the large
               majority of Iraq production are exported through the ports of the area. In addition,
               the port of Kohr Al Zubair is a free zone located 40km southwest of Basrah. Based
               on Investor Guide of Basrah54 the major industries in the region are oil, oil
               processing, shipping, agriculture, tomato paste, dates, fishing and fisheries, and the
               potential area investments are plastics, fertilizers and other petrochemicals,
               expansion of existing port facilities, trade logistics and tourism.


12.2.3. Transportation network
               The road network has                                          Iraq´s road network
               48,000km length. Poor
               maintenance       of     the
               network has enormously
               increased accidents in the

               Currently, there are no gas export facilities. But some ideas have been discussed
               last years. More than 3 decades ago, Iraq exported natural gas to Kuwait through a
               160 km pipeline. Ministry of Oil proposed to rehabilitate the pipeline, but there
               was no progress on the idea. Furthermore, other projects are the Pipeline to
               Nabucci (Turkey)60, to link the network with Arab Gas Pipeline (Egypt)61, to
               export gas through a Liquefied Natural Gas plant in Basrah region, and finally, to
               participate of the Friendship Gas Pipeline.

12.2.6.1.        GAS POLICIES
                 Iraqi gas policy is compunded by several laws and articles of the Constitution64.
                 The lack of a unique gas framework let several ambiguities opened. As a result,
                 Iraq have been experiencing the Kurdistan (KRG) - National Government
                 disagreement65 -, which focus on the rights of the resources. In 2007, new package
                 of laws and a draft hydrocarbon framework were issued by the National
                 Government in order to solve the differences with (KRG). However, the Council
                 of Representative´s Oil and Gas Commitee stated it will not proceed until National
                 Government and KRG reach a political agreement. The pressure to bring closer
                 regional and central government had no success and regulatory framework keeps
                 uncertain. As a result, every organism responsible for bidding and award moved
                 forward. In 2009, Iraq launched a 20 years bid, where several foreign companies
                 participated. Nowadays, the market is open to national and international
                 investments.

12.3.          Indonesia
               The Federal Republic of Indonesia is an archipelago country between South East
               Asia and Oceania. It is compounded by 34 provinces, which are spread in more
               than 17,000 islands. Its capital is Yakarta and it shares borders with Malaysia and
               Papua New Guinea. Indonesia has almost 250 million inhabitants, which make it
               the 4th most populated country in the world.
               As a tropical country, Indonesia´s seasons are determinate by rainfall (average of
               2,700 mm per year). Regarding the temperature, it does not present a significant
               variation ranges (average of 27°C)70. It is important to note that Indonesia is almost
               entirely mountainous and tectonically speaking, highly unstable.
               The following table and graphs offer a geographical and general economic context

12.3.1. Macro perspectives
               Indonesia has reported an average GDP growth of 5.8% over the last 10 years and
               it is, currently, the largest economy in Southeast Asia. Although the international
               crude oil prices dropped, Indonesia could sustain its rate growth in the future,
               supported by the recovery of the investment demand and the raise of manufacture
               exports71.

                contribution of non oil and gas sector to industry share of the GDP74 and become a
                high income country by 2020. Several strategies were stated, focusing in 8 main
                programs: agriculture, mining, industry, marine, tourism, telecommunication, and
                the development of strategic areas75.
                Furthermore, Indonesia´s industrial market is open to foreign investments, with the
                exception of sectors listed in the Negative List.

12.3.3. Transportation network

12.3.3.1.       ROAD NETWORK
                In the 1980s, Indonesia´s road network have been benefited by a significant
                expansion, which was followed by a liberalization of the sector in the 1990s and an
                economic Crisis in 1997. Over that decade investment declined and level and
                quality of services have never been recovered77.
                In 2012, the length road network reported was 477,000 km. Its network´s density78
                is internationally average; nonetheless, it keeps low compare with neighboring
                countries79.
                Lack of investments in maintenance derived in an increasing share of poor
                condition roads. At the national level (8% of the global network in 2009), 88% of
                the network is in good condition. Nevertheless, 75% and 60% of provincial and
                district/city level (11% and 81% of the global network in 2009), respectively, are
                in fair/good condition.
                In the case of Indonesia, it is important to note the share of the network for each
                island. As an interesting fact to be underlined, Java and Bali, which are the most
                populous islands (60%) have only 25% of the network share.

                In the PPP Book81 for 2014, several transportation projects were prioritized: 3
                railway projects82 (Java), a toll Bridge83 (between Java and Sumatra) and 4 toll
                roads84 (North Sulawesi, north Java, South Kalimantan and south Sumatra).

12.3.3.2.       MARINE NETWORK
                As an archipelago, the country strongly depends on sea transportation. Indonesia
                has approximately 1,700 seaports and had a trade volume of 968 million tons in
                2009, from which 44% were domestic cargo and the rest international85. It is
                important to note that just a few ports dispatch international load and work as hubs.
                Thus, a significant share of the domestic shipping to these ports have, in fact,
                international final destination, and the volume bulk should be categorized as part
                of the international trade.

               Regarding inland infrastructure, in 2009, 5 ports concentrated 94% of the cargo:
               Tanjung Priork, Tangung Perak and Tanjung Emas in Java and Belawan and
               Panjang in Sumatra. Based on World Bank Logistic Performance Index, the
               infrastructure quality of Indonesian ports is considerably lower than
               ASEAN+6´s86. Regarding the fleet, the number of ships operated in Indonesia by
               local companies was 9,835 in 2010.
               There are several private-owned ferry companies, which take the biggest share of
               passenger transportation volume. Pelayaran National Indonesia (PELNI) is the
               national shipping company, which provides goodies and passenger services,
               ensuring accessibility to the most remote islands.

12.3.6.1.       GAS POLICIES
                In 2012, BPMigas was dissolved and SKKMigas was created as an upstream Oil
                and Gas Regluatory Special Force. The new company acted as an interim
                regulator, managing Production Share Agreements (PSC). Among other decisions,
                SKKMigas rejected to renew some PSCs. The issue rose to the court, and the
                generalized climate got uncertain. The Government admitted revision of the laws
                and a package of reforms are required to attract investments. However, there have
                not been signals yet.
                According to a survey by auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, investors pointed
                the following challenges in Indonesia gas regulation: interference from other
                government agencies, contract sanctity, unclear roles (central and regional
                regulations), new regulations and uncertainty about cost recovery and BPMigas

              Indonesian electricity demand´s growth has been increasing in a higher rate than
              generation, leading to frequent and long power shortages. An inadequate
              supporting infrastructure, difficulties in obtaining land-use permits, subsidized
              tariffs, and an uncertain regulatory environment were the main issues during the
              2000 decade leading the country to the current electric status.
              Finally, strictly regulated electricity market, subsidized selling prices and
              difficulties to diversify electric supply sources are key barriers that prevent a
              healthy development of the electricity sector.
              In the next section, a preliminary analysis on small-scale opportunities to develop
              in Nigeria, Iraq and Indonesia will be offered, based on their special features and
              lessons learned from the experiences in USA and China.



12.4.         Opportunities for small scale LNG
              Considering experiences of USA and China on ways to economically seize small
              LNG volumes and main identified drivers, this section outlines some
              recommendations towards the development of this kind of market in less
              developed economies with smaller infrastructure, such as Nigeria, Iraq and
              Indonesia. Some barriers to the implementation of small scale LNG solutions will
              be underlined for Nigeria, Iraq and Indonesia.

               Lessons from China and USA and barriers to the implementation of small scale
               LNG solutions in Nigeria, Iraq and Indonesia
               It is important to notice there is a main difference between USA and China cases
               that could be considered as a basic lesson regarding the implementation in less
               developed countries. In China, small scale LNG developments are mostly
               supported and carried out by State-owned companies as part as development
               policy. On the contrary, in the USA, development seems to be linked to
               decentralized market decisions (although peak shaving operations are framed in a
               regulatory scheme). Each alternative implies significant challenges and risks,
               especially in low and middle income economies.
               In the market-type solution (the case of USA), a first issue to deal with is a
               coordination problem, frequently posed by economists at a theoretical level: the
               development of an efficient and sustainable scale means supply96 and demand97
               decisions should be almost simultaneously taken. The weakness of this kind of
               strategy is when no one is willing to make the first move. The strength of the case
               of China is the weakness of USA: the coordination problem is “solved” - with
               diverse levels of efficiency - by the State, who acts as a “market-maker” enabling
               the existence of demand and/or supply until the industry reaches a sustainable
               scale.
               Regardless environmental benefits and even lower operative costs in some cases,
               the differential in cost of capital to be afforded by the introduction of the new
               technology is another arising problem. As in any LNG development - no matter the
               scale -, investment represents an important share on LNG final price. Every asset is
               fully committed to the project and loses its value if any link of the chain breaks.
               For example, an LNG-fuelled truck would lose practically its total resale value,
               when its purchase cost would have been 40% higher. Once more, in China’s case
               the Government is able to finance and assume risks, becoming effective in
               developing the market - regardless the efficient or inefficient use of public
               resources -. Considering the Chinese economy and its high demand of energy
               required for growth and development, LNG projects proved to be the right bet.

             However, state-based market creation solutions not always take into account the
             frequently diminished institutional capabilities present in developing countries,
             usually represented in the failure - or at least ineffectiveness - in the development
             and implementation of public policies, in this particular case, energy policies.
             Furthermore, some experiences show that foreign direct investment, usually
             performed by private companies, represents a way of transferring know-how,
             technology and financing for the implementation of a policy that the developing
             country could hardly achieve98. At the same time, some economists have argued
             that FDI contributes to economic growth only when a sufficient absorptive
             capability of the advanced technologies is available in the host economy99.
             First, it must be pointed out that Nigeria and Iraq show very important flaring
             levels (ranked second and third, respectively in the world’s flaring ranking list), in
             absolute as well as relative terms related to their natural gas production. Rather
             than Nigeria has many small flares near communities without electricity, Indonesia
             presents lower volumes perfectly suitable for small-scale LNG projects
             considering its marine network.
             LNG for electricity generation
             Other characteristics shared by Nigeria and Iraq - and therefore making them
             comparable – are the restrictions on power supply & transmission and security
             issues, hindering the development of the most economically suitable infrastructure
             for large scale flaring solutions (i.e. pipelines).
             Regarding power supply, there are thermal generation assets with fuel supply
             problems, especially in Nigeria and Iraq. Although small scale LNG would not
             completely solve the issue of access to power supply in the country, it would
             certainly improve the situation. Depending on gas demand volume and distance to
             supply sites, a small LNG project could be feasible where a pipeline is not. A small
             LNG chain (up to 15 MMscf/d) could supply up to 70 MW average base. The
             same option would be available to replace liquid fuels-fired generation. In general
             terms, small LNG chains result competitive against diesel and fuel-oil. A more
             detailed analysis of flare locations/volumes compared regions without electricity
             supply could be made but it is beyond the scope and aims of this study.

As already mentioned, these countries present restrictions on power transmission
as well. Therefore, some regions within each country operate as isolated
subsystems. In most cases, these subsystems can be described as small demand
supplied by diesel or fuel oil engines (scale is not enough to operate with several
generation units and need flexibility to response to demand variations). Given
geographical characteristics, Indonesia is a clear example of this situation. In the
eastern part of the country, there are several islands consuming less than 200 MW
and operating as isolated systems, considering there are no power connections
between them. A small LNG chain involving maritime transportation could be
analyzed to supply this area, achieving a competitive cost supply when comparing
to diesel (currently used) and with lower levels of greenhouse effect emissions.
Other uses of Mini LNG: strengths & weaknesses
Indonesia’s geography offers another opportunity for economic use: LNG as fuel
for ships. Cargo maritime transportation is a particularly intense flow in this
world’s region. China’s experience becomes greatly relevant in this case: the
gasification project on the Yangtze River has an LNG supply station in operation,
and other experiences on ship conversion developed by companies interested in the
use of this technology.
On the other hand, experiences from China and USA were directed to supply
residential, industrial and transport demand. Two characteristics of this technology
worth highlighting are the “fast-track” implementation and the relatively reduced
investment (compared to pipelines or large scale facilities), making possible the
rapid settlement of industries with high positive impact on a country economic
growth. For example, small LNG chains may enable the installation of fertilizer
companies, boosting the food industry, or the installation / expansion of
construction industry, a very dynamic sector of the economy of any country. Small
scale LNG can replace other fuels, like LPG, in industries looking for clean
combustion (food industry) or heat control (ceramic industry).
Regarding transportation sector, experience in China and USA shows natural gas
as a competitive fuel against diesel and gasoline. The LNG, presenting less volume
than CNG, is recommended in large vehicles, running long distance and, therefore,
needing longer range. Giving the size of these countries’ economies and the
extension of their lands and routes, this kind of vehicle is a growing trend.
However, uncertainty arises when trying to assess the existence of a critical mass
to make LNG a viable fuel for large vehicles in countries such as Nigeria, Iraq and
Indonesia. In these cases, CNG for vehicles (VNG) would have more chance for
success: is more suitable for light and mid vehicles, more numerous and with a
range limited to urban areas. Nevertheless, LNG could be part of a transport supply
chain if, considering distance from gas fields and demand size, the technology
results the most convenient to supply VNG stations.




                     114
                Regarding LNG road transportation, conditions of road infrastructure and security
                must be considered, especially in Nigeria and Iraq. Difficult access or temporary
                floods, for example, result on higher supply costs because of stock shortage or
                redundant storage and transport infrastructure. In terms of security, LNG chains -
                like any other fuel - are vulnerable to piracy and terrorism, worsened by the fact of
                being a flammable fuel. But LNG would have an advantage: it is not a fungible
                asset, meaning it cannot be consumed if not in proper facilities; therefore it would
                have practically no resale value for illegal markets. Nevertheless, the validation of
                this assumption would need a deeper study on the subject.
                Other potential demand should be taken into account when outlining local market
                creation strategies for small scale LNG in Iraq and Nigeria. However, considering
                the volume to deal with, these measures would not solve the flaring issue.
                When analyzing Indonesia, potential demand seems to be limited to power
                generation in some of the islands, especially considering existing plans for
                generation decentralization policies. In addition, existing China’s experience on
                fuel substitution for the navy industry could be considered to apply in this country.
                In the following subsections, some recommendations will be given to Nigeria, Iraq
                and, particularly, Indonesia.


12.4.1. Nigeria
                From the point of Akinrogunde (2014), the most likely applications for small-scale
                and micro LNG in Nigeria are: the replacement of liquid fuels (diesel or gasoline)
                in transportation (i.e.: trucking, mining, marine and rail transport); and natural gas-
                based power generation for remote locations (virtual pipeline) both for industrial
                and residential use100. The reasons are: significant price advantages with liquid
                fuels and the non-grid power generation in parts of the country without pipeline of
                gas.
                Akinrogunde have argued that the best opportunities for mini-LNG projects are in
                the industrial clusters located in parts of the south-east, middle-belt and northern
                Nigeria. Other parts of the country (south and south-west) have pipelines or they
                are already being served by Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). The key to develop
                Mini-LNG are the isolated big customers without pipelines and with too high
                requirements to be served by CNG. The use of LNG for power generation is quite
                difficult because the relatively low tariffs. However, there is room for private
                power plant operators serving industrial clients with higher willingness to pay for
                reliable electricity.
                Additionally to the securing an anchor customer, some challenges remain for mini
                or micro LNG projects development in Nigeria, including: access to gas molecules,
                technology selection, securing project financing, road infrastructure and safety.

                Some international companies are analyzing casing & flare gas recovery
                opportunities in Nigeria by the hand of the, between others101, micro-LNG plants.
                For example, the firm Clearstone Engineering Ltd has accomplished a 2 years
                plan102. Particularly, the actions of the first year plan were: indentify strategic
                facilities to assess vent and flare gas, quantify flare/vent gas rates and
                compositions, develop a mitigation plan, make preliminary economic evaluations.
                The procedures of the second year plan were: potential small-scale demonstration
                project, piloting of a continuous monitoring system, actions to transfer technology
                (i.e.: workshops) and the development of policy and regulatory tools. As a result,
                the key findings were: a) an adequate time-series monitoring of casing-gas flows is
                important to determine the true potential production, and b) noteworthy amounts of
                heavier hydrocarbons were discovered in several casing gas cases. This last
                discovery should be underlined because it improves feasibility of casing-gas
                recovery projects because heavier hydrocarbons usually are 5 times more valuables
                than methane fraction. Additionally, a plant of LNG could be favored by gasoline
                and liquefied petroleum gas present in flaring and the possibility of substitution of
                diesel.


12.4.2. Iraq
                Opportunities for mini-micro LNG developments are not only an economic
                alternative but also an energy security option in Iraq. The actions of violent groups
                and its advance in the Northern and large part of the Central Iraq is a potential risk
                for possible disruptions of pipelines and other energy infrastructure. In fact, supply
                disruptions in the north escalated in 2014 (Iraq-Turkey -IT- oil pipeline flows were
                fully halted in March) and shut downs were caused in the northern in June.
                Taking into consideration the underlined security risks, mini-micro LNG might be
                an alternative to offer a security of supply back up for some power generation
                plants and industries in the northern (including the Kurdish region). In the south,
                the problems are the inadequate midstream infrastructure (storage, pumping and
                pipeline capacity for natural gas), the sufficiency of power generation and the
                losses in the electricity distribution system.
                Lack of enough infrastructures (pipelines and other infrastructure to facilitate
                consumption and export) is the main reason because natural gas is flared.
                Alternatively, there are plans for large scale LNG utilization. An example is the
                initiative of Shell and Mitsubishi (Basrah Gas Company), who signed an
                agreement with the Iraqi state-owned South Gas Company, to capture, to process
                and sell gas for power generation. They could export the gas not bought for Iraqi
                power generation plants. However, this plan to export LNG remains controversial
                because natural gas is claimed to Iraq’s electric power plants and there are delays
                in the pipelines developments.




  101   Others alternatives are: small scale power generators and micro-condensers units.

                The link between oil and gas production is power generation. Large scale
                increments in oil production need large increments in power generation. However,
                as it was explained before, Iraq suffers electricity shortages frequently because the
                electricity demand is growing faster than supply. The gap between electricity
                demand and supply is a key aspect to look for small scale LNG business
                opportunities in Iraq, especially in the oil sector. Iraq’s authorities have allowed
                foreign oil companies to build small power plants for their operations. It might be
                an anchor demand for the development of the small scale LNG market in that
                country.
                The vast majority of Iraq’s electricity supply was generated from domestic power
                plants and it has increased from 2008 to 2012 (13% annual average), distribution
                losses have also increased (36% average of total electricity supply). In addition, on
                the demand side, summer peaks are greater than 50%. Residential and industries
                have expensive private, off-grid, diesel fuelled generation (an additional 1GW of
                capacity only in Baghdad). It could be other mini/micro LNG opportunity to
                develop a market in Iraq.
                In this context, the government has launched a master plan to install new power
                generation (24.4 GW), adding steam and gas turbines capable of running on fuel
                oil or natural gas. However, one of the central problems to achieve those goals is
                the delay to build new natural gas infrastructure. Additionally, the government
                plan said that in the short term, Iraq will use only renewable energy (wind and
                solar) at remote off-grid locations.
                All in all, solutions in off-grid power generation systems for residential an
                industrial demand and projects to supply isolated power generation for the oil
                sector appear to be the most reasonable anchor demands to develop a small scale
                LNG industry in Iraq. Additional demand can be studied analyzing the Kurdish
                electricity market, with lower problems than the rest of Iraq, but having taken into
                consideration back up alternatives of energy security to supply power generators.
                Military facilities could have similar problems to be supplied by pipelines or more
                expensive fuels in the conflictive north.


12.4.3. Indonesia
                Indonesia has the 14th gas reserves in the world; spread in several fields (Natuna,
                South Sumatra, East Kalimantan and Tangguh Papua). A large share of these gas
                resources are committed to long term supply agreements with other countries
                (through LNG liquefaction terminals).
                Regarding the domestic consumption, PLN103 has been making efforts to supply its
                existing power plants (currently fuelled by liquids) with natural gas. However, the
                gas supply in some islands would be quite complex (especially in the east), due to
                the lack of close gas fields in the area and infrastructure to receive the resource
                from other part of the country.
                In the following map, it is shown the flaring areas, power plants, regasification
                facilities and current and planned liquefaction plants in Indonesia.

              As part of the main electrical plan, PLN seeks to implement small scale LNG
              plants in Kalimantan and Sulawesi, in order to generate supply existing power
              plants during the peak demand periods. The LNG source for those plants would
              come from Simenggaris (25 MMscf/d, on stream in 2017104) and Sengkang (128
              MMscf/d, on stream in 2017) LNG projects. In Kalimantan, the estimated
              consumption of the 4 power plants included in this plan (100 MW each one) is
              between 3 and 9 MMscf/d105. In Sulawesi, the estimated consumption of the 2
              power plants included in the plan (150 and 450 MW) is between 5 and 19
              MMscf/d.
              Regarding isolated electrical systems, PLN aims to use LNG as fuel in base load
              generation and peaks. The range of power plants in these cases can drop to 40-50
              MW and the daily unitary gas requirement would be between 4 and 18 MMscf/d.
              The biggest demand of these electrical systems (18 MMscf/d) would be supply by
              Donggi Senoro LNG project (2 mtpa or 256 MMscf/d), which is under
              construction and the supply to PLN’s plant would start in 2016.
              Regarding compressed natural gas, PLN have a CNG project to supply Lombok
              Peaker power plant from Gresik CNG Plant (green spot on the above map) by a
              GNC vessel (1,000 km in round trip). The estimated demand would be around 4.5
              MMscf/d.
              It is important to note that there is no certainty on the other planned gas fueled
              power plants supply.

13.           RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SMALL LNG TO
              SUPPLY SMALL ISLANDS IN INDONESIA
              Gas flaring in Indonesia is around 400 MMscf/d. Unfortunately, it is disseminated
              in the west region and far away from the small islands in eastern Indonesia.
              However, several recommendations have been analyzed to encourage its use.
              For a success implementation, it is important to achieve an anchor demand and to
              ensure a source of supply. As in many other parts of the world, the most important
              potential demand in the small islands of eastern Indonesia would be the electricity
              sector. Most of the energy generated in these areas is fuelled by diesel and fuel oil,
              which may be substituted for natural gas.
              Regarding the offer, one of the most challenging achievements for small scale
              demand systems is to get an LNG supply source. Most of the power plants are
              located in the coast areas, due to the proximity to ports and facilities to manage
              fuels. LNG or CNG´s receiving terminals can leverage its investments with
              existing thermal power plants.
              The alternatives sources for small scale systems supply are large or small
              liquefaction plants and regas or FSRU. That is, the large-scale infrastructure can
              also be used to supply liquefied gas to mini-LNG. An objection to large
              liquefaction plant is that its output is usually already engaged in large GSA and,
              and as a result, it may require additional investments to load LNG small-scale
              vessels or containers. There are already three regas facilities dedicated to supply
              large power demands in Sumatra and Java, where additional storage could be
              accommodated via FSU. This new capacity might be used to load the LNG in
              small-scale vessels or containers. A small-scale liquefaction plant project should
              take into consideration the specific location of gas supply (production, reserves
              and infrastructure facilities)
              It remains uncertain the gas supply of the power generation sector set by PLN plan,
              which considers a minimum of liquefaction capacity requirement of 4 MMscf/d or
              0.03mtpa106 in the east islands of Indonesia.
              Last but not least, after the first stage of natural gas penetration in the electricity
              sector, it would be feasible to wider the gas supply to transportation or industrial
              fuel, in order to replace liquid fuels.




14.           CONCLUSIONS
              It is clear that LNG technology could be a solution to monetise small volumes of
              associated gas (1-15 MMscf/d) and thus to reduce the current gas flaring. It is a
              proven technology with very high safety records.


 106   Corresponding to an aggregated liquefaction capacity around 50 MMscf/d or 0.4 MTPA




                                        119
      There are several options available in the market to liquefy associated gas in order
      to easily transport it to the consumers. These consumers could be isolated markets
      not connected to grid (domestic and/or industrial), power generators, LNG
      refuelling stations, etc.
      The simplified processes and optimised design of the full LNG chain (liquefaction,
      distribution and receiving) make this type of projects economically viable.
      Countries like United States and China are a good example of successful
      implementation of mini LNG applications. The lessons learnt in these countries
      could inspire similar solutions for less developed countries as Iraq, Nigeria and
      Indonesia.
