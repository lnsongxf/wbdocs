          Sustainable Solutions for Financial Protection
                    Against Disaster and Climate Risks
The financial impact of disasters caused by natural hazards is growing.
Financial losses from natural disasters continue to rise, with developing countries and their
low-income populations feeling the greatest effects. Direct financial loss reached an average of
US$165billion per year during the last 10 years. This compares to about US$135 billion of official
development assistance in 2013.
Natural disasters are increasingly recognized by governments as an important source of contingent liability and budget

volatility. They can generate fiscal risk that results in deviations of fiscal outcome. Those risks create direct contingent liabilities (such as
                 ///




the costs of restoring public buildings and infrastructures affected by a disaster) and indirect contingent liabilities (such as ad hoc financial
support to the affected population). When they materialize, natural disasters can create major budget volatility, especially in the short term,
as governments need to finance emergency assistance and early recovery activities.

Effective disaster risk finance instruments contribute to the achievement of the World Bank Group’s twin goals. The 2014

•	        Quantify disaster-related contingent liabilities;
•	        Build disaster risk layering strategy to match post-disaster short- and long-term financing needs, that combines financial tools including
          reserves/savings, contingent loans, and sovereign market-based risk transfer solutions;
•	        Strengthen public financial management for mobilizing, allocating, and disbursing funds following disasters;
•	        Enhance disaster risk insurance programs of public buildings and infrastructure;
•	        Develop tools/approaches for crisis response including support to scalable social protection.

Disaster Risk Insurance Market Development helps governments develop efficient disaster risk markets, and leverage private sector
