     increasing the number of people having access to                     health financing and UHC is by using WHO’s
     health services, although this is clearly one important              “building blocks” framework. WHO defines a health
     dimension of UHC, but also about ensuring that                       system as “…the sum total of all the organizations,

        reflecting new service delivery data that are being collected from a national sample of public and private primary-care facilities.
     2	 The three dimensions of UHC (“depth”, “breadth”, and “height”) are neither independent nor mutually exclusive: ensuring depth of

        coverage has implications for the breadth and height of UHC as well. Universal availability of the benefit package for all–not just
        those who are well-off and live in urban areas–is a key aspect in ensuring that UHC is not a hypothetical aspiration but a realized
        policy designed to enhance health and improve social protection. High out-of-pocket (OOP) payments–that is, the low height of
        UHC–can (and is) often a result of poor depth of coverage if patients have to pay OOP for drugs or seek care elsewhere in private
        facilities that are outside the network.

     the risk profile of beneficiaries and their utilization
     rates, the costs of inputs, the nature and extent
     of benefits provided, and how health systems
     are organized and financed to deliver services. At
     the same time, resource availability for financing
     UHC is dependent on the willingness and ability
     of beneficiaries to contribute, the administrative
     capacity of countries to collect contributions, the
     fiscal capacity of governments to subsidize coverage
     for those who are not able to contribute, and the
     extent of cross-subsidization from richer to poorer
     beneficiaries, among other factors.

     Health financing, however, is not just about the
     sufficiency of resources; it is also about the efficiency,
     equity, and effectiveness of how such resources
     are raised, pooled, allocated, and utilized to attain
     the desired health system outcomes, such as
     UHC (Hsiao 2007). Implications of health-financing
     strategies can also include assessments related to
     financial sustainability and the impact of reforms on
     the broader economy. UHC-related health-financing
     reforms can potentially improve health outcomes,
12   mitigate household vulnerability, and reduce the
     risk of impoverishment from catastrophic health
     spending. Health financing reforms can, however,
     also have unintended consequences, for example,
     policies to improve revenue collection may result
     in increasing labor costs, encouraging informality,
     as well as unduly raising the fiscal burden on
     governments (Wagstaff 2010).

     Rising health care costs, if not mitigated by strategic
     purchasing and efficiency improvements, can
     threaten the financial sustainability of health care
     reforms. With implementation of UHC in countries
     that have externally financed programs, there are
     additional challenges related to whether or not
     benefits packages adequately stipulate and deliver           UHC. These subareas of focus are not necessarily
     comparable services to those that were previously            mutually exclusive, and some of the trade-offs and

      In Summary
        1.	 Indonesia has made significant progress and has a positive macroeconomic outlook with
            economic growth projected at a respectable 5-6 percent annually for the next five years.
        2.	 Inflation and unemployment are low and Indonesia has manageable levels of debt and fiscal
            deficit.
        3.	 There has been an overall decline in poverty, but rising income inequality and a persistence in
            labor market informality.
        4.	 National (central plus subnational) spending is low relative to other countries with comparable
            income level, and the national revenue collection is also low.
        5.	 Revenue collection is largely centralized, while expenditure and service delivery has been
            decentralized to the district level. There is a clear disconnect between revenue collection and
            expenditures.
        6.	Indonesia’s intergovernmental fiscal transfers of revenues are large, fragmented, and complex.
        7.	 Conditional, earmarked capital grants are allocated by central government as an equalizing
            mechanism to prioritize some service sectors, including health.

Indonesia has made significant progress since the                     Indonesia’s GDP grew at an average annual rate of

      In Summary
        1.	 Indonesia’s health status has improved significantly–life expectancy has increased steadily,
            infant and under-five child mortality rates have declined, and fertility and population growth
            rates have fallen.
        2.	 The country is facing challenges due to:
            •	 Demographic transition: population aged 65 years and above is currently around 5 percent
               and is projected to double by 2030 and to reach 25 percent in 2070.
            •	 Epidemiological transition: the cause of disease has shifted to NCDs, and the emergence of
               overnutrition, while maternal mortality and stunting remain persistently high.
            •	 Large inequality: The national average masks regional and widespread income-related
               disparity.
            •	 Persistent health challenges: especially in maternal health and childhood nutrition.
        3.	 The implementation of national Social Health Insurance (JKN) that aims to cover everyone by
            2019 is one of the instruments for Indonesia to attain UHC.
        4.	 Using the WHO-WB UHC monitoring framework to assess country progress towards UHC,
            Indonesia’s performance is mixed when it comes to preventive/promotive/treatment service
            coverage and financial coverage indicators.
        5.	 OOP expenditures on health have pushed a significant percentage of the population into
            poverty or further into poverty.
        6.	Performance-based financing can serve as a tool to incentivize health systems and health
30          providers to move towards UHC.

   example, handwashing, access to sanitation, access to water), individual health indicators (percentage of population with
   diarrhea, pneumonia, hypertension, diabetes), health inputs (ratio of midwives to villages, ratio of doctors to puskesmas),
   maternal health services (skilled birth attendance), and nutrition status (underweight, stunting, and overweight)

   Population Division (WHO 2015). There is some uncertainty about the exact level of MMR in Indonesia; the Institute of Health
   Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model estimated an MMR of 189 in 2011; IDHS 2012 estimates based on sibling-survival data
   indicate an MMR of 359, although it is important to note that this latter estimate is derived from a sample occurrence of only 92
   maternal deaths over a five-year period; the 2010 Indonesian census indicates an MMR of 278.

Box 3.1
Improving Performance for UHC through Provider Payments:
Some Global Experience

ESTONIA
Through the Quality Bonus Scheme (QBS)–a joint initiative between the Estonian Health Insurance Fund
and the Estonian Family Physician Association–primary care providers receive “points” for achieving
coverage targets across weighted domains of: (i) disease prevention (including child immunization,
child preventive care, and cardiovascular prevention); (ii) chronic disease management (for example,
diabetes and hypertension); and (iii) specific additional activities (for example, primary care provider
training, maternity care). Achievement of at least 80 percent of the points allows the providers to
receive a pro-rataed lump sum (negotiated annually) in addition to other payment sources (that is,
capitation, travel allowance, and fee-for-service payments for diagnostic procedures). Primary-care
physicians determine how the bonus is distributed to nurses and other staff.

ARGENTINA
Argentina’s Plan Nacer was initiated in 2004 to provide coverage for the poor in provinces located
in the northern part of the country. The program is designed to provide results-based financing to
provincial governments based on the number of enrollees in the program, as well as performance on
a set of basic health indicators. About 60 percent of intergovernmental fiscal transfers from the central
government to the provincial governments are based on the number of enrollees and the remaining
40 percent is tied to attainment of ten tracer indicators, such as immunization rates and average                   41
weight at birth of newborns. Service delivery is contracted out by the provincial governments to
certified public and private providers, with patients free to choose among the providers. The program
finances a conditional matching grant from the central government to provinces that pays one-half
the average per capita cost of a basic benefit package covering 80 cost-effective maternal and child-
health interventions to uninsured mothers and children up to six years of age. The program has built-in
incentives for increasing enrollment rates as well as for provision of quality care. Capitation-based and
unit-costed payments encourage negotiation with providers and efficiency in delivery of services.

NEW ZEALAND
The Primary Health Organisation (PHO) Performance Programme–which is transitioning into the
Integrated Performance and Incentive Framework (IPIF)–incentivizes eligible PHOs to achieve
population health and inequality priorities measured via clinical indicators (for example, childhood
vaccination; influenza vaccination in the elderly; cervical and breast cancer screening; cardiovascular
risk assessment); process/capacity indicators (for example, progress against performance plan); and
financial indicators (for example, pharmaceutical and laboratory expenditure against benchmarks) by
paying a flat-rate bonus every six months on the basis of percentage attainment of targets.

UNITED KINGDOM
Providers receive quarterly payments when they can prove that at least 70 percent of cohorts of
children aged two years registered under the providers have completed immunization for certain types
of vaccines. Achievement of a 90 percent target enables providers to receive three times the amount
providers would have been eligible for if they had achieved a 70 percent target. Providers also receive
an additional payment per child, if the registered child has completed all rotavirus, pneumococcal and
meningitis C/HiB booster doses. Recent large intergovernmental transfer programs such as Village
Fund also provide an opportunity for performance-based mechanisms to improve immunization
coverage at the local level.

      In Summary
        1.	 Outpatient and inpatient utilization have increased, especially among the bottom 40 percent
            and at inpatient private facilities, although geographic variation remains high.
        2.	 Utilization patterns at facilities suggest that puskesmas were generally pro-poor while public
            hospitals were pro-rich.
        3.	 The number of hospitals has doubled over the past decade, more than one-half were private
            hospitals.
        4.	 The bed-density ratio has increased although it is still below the WHO standard of 2.5 per 1,000,
            and there is maldistribution of beds across the country.
        5.	 There has been little improvement in the readiness to provide key health services since the 2011
            health facility census (Rifaskes).
        6.	Many Indonesians face significant physical and time barriers to accessing health care.

      In Summary
        1.	 Total health spending, and government health spending has increased for the past few years
            and is expected to increase further to meet the government’s target of 5 percent of General
            Government Expenditures (GGE) in 2016, however, it remains one of the lowest in the world. The
            low spending is the result of low prioritization and ability to generate revenue.
        2.	 OOP spending continues to be the largest share of THE, around 45 percent in 2014; partly due
            to a large population that is still uncovered. The vulnerability to be pushed into poverty due to
            health shocks remains high.
        3.	 Government spending is around one-third of THE; more than 60 percent spending occurred at
            the subnational level with complex intergovernmental transfer.
        4.	 JKN is one of the largest SHI schemes in the world covering 57 percent of Indonesia’s
            population, while it accounts for a small fraction of THE. Challenges of mistargeting and
            covering nonsalaried, nonpoor workers remain.
        5.	 Comprehensive benefit package without adequate financing leads to limited service availability.
        6.	Indonesia spends two-thirds of THE on curative care; more than 65 percent of JKN expenditures
            were for hospital-based inpatient and outpatient care.
        7.	 External financing for health remains at a low level (1 percent of THE), but it continues to play a
            significant role for several key health programs.

     External Financing for Health



     Over the past five years, only about 1 percent of THE                             Even though external financing is a relatively small
     has come from external sources in Indonesia (Figure                               share of total health spending, donors provide a
     5.16). This proportion–following an increase in the                               significant share of resources for key priority areas
     post-crisis period of 1997-2000–has generally been                                such as TB. For communicable disease programs, the
     declining over time in the past decade or so (Figure                              external share of the total program spending can be as
     5.17). Indonesia’s low and declining dependence on                                high as 60 percent for TB; it is lower for immunization

     annual health-related disbursements of only about                                 loss in financial resources for immunization as well as

     52	In January 2011,
                       Gavi established a country eligibility threshold of US$1,500 GNI per capita. The first year of ileligibility is considered
       a grace year and no change is made in the cofinancing requirement. Once a country enters the graduation process, its cofinancing
       requirement increases rapidly to reach 100 percent by the fifth year, where countries will fully finance their vaccines.

      In Summary
        1.	 Financial and technical support from external resources is important for the immunization
            program in Indonesia, however, Indonesia needs to be ready for transitioning from external
            financing.
        2.	 Indonesia has made progress in increasing coverage rates, although large inequalities across
            regions and economic status still exist.
        3.	 Vaccine availability in puskesmas was generally good, but several issues remain, such as human
            resources (availability and expertise) and cold-chain management.
        4.	 At the household level, physical and time barriers pose a challenge to accessing immunization
            services.
        5.	 The total cost of immunization in Indonesia must also take into account all nonoperational
            immunization activities.
        6.	JKN’s benefit package covers routine immunization, but there are concerns about the usage of
            capitation payments to improve immunization service delivery.
        7.	 New vaccines are currently being planned for introduction and several key factors, such as
            scientific evidence, financing, production and political support, must be addressed.

      TOBACCO TAX INCREASES AND THE RISK OF ILLICIT
      TRADE

      The tobacco industry and other vested interests
      argue that tax increases on tobacco products fuel
      illicit trade. Accumulated international experience,
      however, exposes the flaws in this argument. While
      high taxes may create incentives for illicit trade,
      different country experiences show that illicit trade
      can be controlled by legal means and by increased
      law enforcement, controls over the distribution chain,
      improved technologies, and better use of data help
      to reduce illicit trade and complement tobacco tax
      reforms (Marquez 2015a).83


      THE WAY FORWARD

      Tobacco taxation reform, including the drastic
      reduction in tax tiers for different categories of
      cigarettes, is a major potential policy tool for the
      Government of Indonesia to use to reduce the severe
      public health burden of smoking-related disease and
128   premature mortality in Indonesia. Tobacco taxation
      can also be a significant contributor to state revenue
      collection for expanding the fiscal space to support
      UHC and other essential investments that benefit all.
      Given fiscal pressures and of unmet health needs
      of the population in Indonesia, now is a particularly
      relevant time to focus on using tobacco taxation
      increases as a source to raise public revenue over the
      near and medium term.
