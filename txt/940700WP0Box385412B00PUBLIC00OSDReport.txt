Executive Summary
The World Bank’s Office of Suspension and Debarment (OSD), led by the Chief
Suspension and Debarment Officer (SDO), provides the first level of adjudication
in the World Bank’s suspension and debarment, or “sanctions,” system. Over the
past six years, 60% of all sanctions cases have been resolved on the basis of the
determinations and recommendations made by OSD. The remaining cases have
been decided on appeal by the World Bank Group Sanctions Board.
	
OSD is a critical component in ensuring an efficient, effective and fair sanctions
process. It is the World Bank unit that is charged with reviewing, prior to the
issuance of any sanctions case, the sufficiency of the evidence against the firms
and individuals that have been accused of fraud and corruption on World Bank-
financed projects.

Sanctions cases are selected and prepared by the World Bank’s Integrity Vice
Presidency (INT) on the basis of INT investigations. If INT believes that it has
gathered sufficient evidence to show that a firm or individual (referred to in the
sanctions system as a “Respondent”) has engaged in sanctionable misconduct, it
submits a sanctions case to OSD for review. This initial adjudication by OSD allows
for the early disposition of cases without the necessity of full sanctions proceedings
in every case. OSD also plays an important role in protecting the World Bank by
imposing temporary suspensions on Respondents once OSD has determined that
they have more likely than not engaged in sanctionable misconduct.

The data and statistics in this report are drawn from OSD’s first six fiscal years of
operations and are current through June 30, 2013 (the end of the World Bank’s
2013 fiscal year). They pertain only to sanctions cases arising from projects
financed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
and the International Development Association (IDA) within the World Bank
Group. The private sector operations of the World Bank Group, including
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA), have their own sanctions systems that are similar to
those of the World Bank.

          The World Bank has developed detailed guidance on the principal conditions for                in its Response, INT’s Reply, the parties’ presentations at a
          release from debarment, which focus on the debarred party demonstrating that it has in        hearing, if applicable, and any other materials contained in
          place, and has implemented for an adequate period, an integrity compliance program            the record. The Sanctions Board reviews the case de novo
          satisfactory to the World Bank. World Bank staff engaged in extensive consultations           and is not bound in any way by the SDO’s determination or
          with both public and private sector stakeholders, and studied international best
          practice models, including the OECD Good Practice Guidance on Internal Controls,
          Ethics, and Compliance, in developing the integrity compliance guidelines against
          which the compliance programs of sanctioned parties are evaluated.

          There is an emerging global consensus as to the principles and components required
          for an effective integrity compliance program. The guidance developed by the Bank
          reflects this international consensus. At the same time, the guidance recognizes the
          need for flexibility in applying fundamental principles to the particular circumstances
          of sanctioned parties, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, which play a
          major role in World Bank-financed operations in developing countries, and for which
          a full-blown compliance program may be unnecessary or prohibitively expensive.
          Program elements need to be tailored to the party in question, taking into account
          such criteria as its size, business sector, and particularly its risk areas, as well as the
          legal environment(s) in which the party operates.

          The World Bank Group’s Integrity Compliance Office (ICO), housed within INT, has
          been established for the purpose of providing guidance to sanctioned parties in
          establishing appropriate integrity compliance programs in order to fulfill the conditions
          for their release from debarment (or, in the case of conditional non-debarment, the
          conditions for continued non-debarment). The ICO also monitors the implementation
          of such programs and decides whether the conditions have been satisfied.38                    Hassane Cisse, World Bank Deputy

The third panel focused on MDBs. Since their mission
is to promote economic development, the focus of their
suspension and debarment systems is improving productivity
and efficiency in the distribution of aid. MDBs do not have
open-ended discretionary systems; the rules generally provide
for the imposition of sanctions in the event that misconduct
is established, with the range of possible penalties defined by
the procedures of the MDBs.



2014 COLLOQUIUM

The focus of the second Colloquium on May 15, 2014 at
the World Bank was comparative system analysis. Sessions
examined the purposes of suspension and debarment
systems, different approaches regarding the standard for
exclusion, the level of due process and the role and profile of
the decision-maker, and the relationship of suspensions and
debarments to other corrective measures and remedies (how
exclusion relates to criminal prosecution, civil actions, fines
and payment of damages). When available, proceedings will         Top Row (left to right): Juan Ronderos, Sanctions Case Officer, Inter-American Development Bank; Daniel I. Gordon, Associate Dean

                                            managers who need a snapshot of activity in the sanctions system, both on a current basis and in comparison to historical
activity. The dashboard shows, on a quarterly basis, all key case activity since OSD’s inception, including the number of cases and settlements submitted by INT, the number
of suspensions imposed by OSD, and the number of final sanctions imposed by OSD and the Sanctions Board. For each such measure, there is a further breakdown showing
the status of active cases (for example, how many cases are with OSD for review, or how many issued cases are with Respondents pending their decision to appeal).

  DURATION OF CASES THROUGH FINAL SANCTIONS DECISION
 A common question posed to OSD is “how long does a sanctions case take?” This chart shows all sanctions cases (excluding settlements) that have been submitted to OSD
 since its inception. The chart measures the time taken up in the investigative phase and in each phase of the sanctions process through final resolution. It should be noted
 that some cases, particularly those submitted in FY12 and FY13, are still active, and therefore the timelines for these cases are not complete, potentially skewing the overall
 picture to a small degree.

While this data gives a useful overview of the activity in the sanctions system and the typical life cycle of sanctions cases, it
must be noted that many factors can have an impact on the timeline of a particular case, such as the complexity of the matters
involved, stays for unsuccessful settlement negotiations during investigations, the need to obtain legal and procurement policy
advice on case-specific matters, extensions to submission deadlines and additional submissions requested by the parties.

  RECEIVED BY TYPE OF SANCTIONABLE PRACTICE
  This chart shows what percentage of the cases and settlements received by OSD since its inception involved claims of each type
  of sanctionable practice: fraudulent practice, corrupt practice, collusive practice, obstructive practice and coercive practice. The
  total of the percentages exceeds 100% because a number of cases have involved claims of more than one type of sanctionable
  practice (for example, payment of a bribe (corrupt practice) and the submission of false documents (fraudulent practice)). For a
  further breakdown of the types of fraudulent practice claims, see Typology: Breakdown of Fraudulent Practice Claims.

TYPOLOGY: BREAKDOWN OF
FRAUDULENT PRACTICE CLAIMS
This detailed case-by-case breakdown shows the different types of fraudulent practice claims that have appeared in sanctions cases received from
INT. First, a distinction is made between fraud cases that involve the forgery of third-party documents and those that involve other types of fraud.
Then, within each of these two streams, a further categorization is done to reflect the specific type of forgery or other fraud. For example, within the
forgery stream, common instances are bid securities, performance certificates and manufacturer’s authorizations. Within the other stream, common
instances are misrepresentations of experience, over-invoicing and failure to make required disclosures of conflicts of interest. The totals at the bottom
of each column show how often INT has sent each such type of claim to OSD for decision-making.

DETAILED BREAKDOWN OF DURATION OF CASES
This detailed chart shows all sanctions cases (excluding settlements) that have been submitted to OSD since its inception. The chart measures the time taken up in the investigative phase and in each
phase of the sanctions process through final resolution. It should be noted that some cases, particularly those submitted in FY12 and FY13, are still active, and therefore the timelines for these cases
are not complete, potentially skewing the overall picture to a small degree.

While this data gives a useful overview of the activity in the sanctions system and the typical life cycle of sanctions cases, it must be noted that many factors can have an impact on the timeline of a
particular case, such as the complexity of the matters involved, stays for unsuccessful settlement negotiations during investigations, the need to obtain legal and procurement policy advice on case-

*Pending as of June 30, 2013.

Notes:
1. All data as of June 30, 2013. Includes all submitted cases (SAEs and RTSs), and as such averages may be skewed slightly downward because of cases that are pending in each stage (e.g., as of June 30, 2013,
Case No. 266 had been with OSD for initial review for 2 days, but the initial review remained pending, such that the final number of days for this stage can be expected to be greater than the 2 currently shown as of June 30, 2013).
2. In cases with multiple Respondents, the date given for (i) delivery of Notice, (ii) receipt of Response, (iii) date of extension and/or (iv) uncontested determination is the latest applicable date (e.g., if the Notice is delivered on three different
dates to the three Respondents in a case, the latest date is used).
3. Four cases (Case Nos. 98, 100, 103 and 111) that were initially issued between July and September 2009 were reissued under the new Sanctions Procedures in March 2011 to permit constructive delivery. Since it relates to a delay in
delivery, the intervening time has been attributed to the Respondents, as have delivery delays under the new Sanctions Procedures.
4. For uncontested cases for which the Notice was issued to the Respondent on or after September 15, 2010, OSD issued a determination reflecting the imposition of the sanction recommended by the SDO in the Notice. For uncontested
cases for which the Notice was issued prior to such date, the Sanctions Board issued a determination imposing the SDO’s recommended sanction.

  ANNEX B
  DETAILED TYPOLOGY WITH BREAKDOWN
  OF FRAUDULENT PRACTICE CLAIMS
  This detailed case-by-case breakdown shows the different types of fraudulent practice claims that have appeared in sanctions cases received from
  INT. First, a distinction is made between fraud cases that involve the forgery of third-party documents and those that involve other types of fraud.
  Then, within each of these two streams, a further categorization is done to reflect the specific type of forgery or other fraud. For example, within the
  forgery stream, common instances are bid securities, performance certificates and manufacturer’s authorizations. Within the other stream, common
  instances are misrepresentations of experience, over-invoicing and failure to make required disclosures of conflicts of interest. The totals at the bottom
  of each column show how often INT has sent each such type of claim to OSD for decision-making.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
My team and I are grateful to many colleagues in the World Bank for their ongoing
assistance with technical and policy matters. In particular, we would like to thank
President Jim Yong Kim and Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer Sri
Mulyani Indrawati for their strong support. We are also grateful to the World Bank
Group Sanctions Board, now chaired by L. Yves Fortier and ably supported by
a Secretariat led by Elizabeth Lin Forder, together with our committed investigative
colleagues in INT, led by Vice President Leonard McCarthy, Director of Operations
Stephen Zimmermann, and Lead Specialist and Head of the Special Litigation Unit,
David Hawkes. Thanks are also owed to World Bank Group Senior Vice President and
General Counsel Anne-Marie Leroy and the dedicated team in the World Bank Legal
Vice Presidency, led by Frank Fariello and Giuliana Dunham-Irving, as well as to our
counterparts at IFC, MIGA and the World Bank’s guarantee operations and General
Services Department. In addition, we have benefitted tremendously over the past six
years from the insight of our colleagues in the World Bank’s procurement function,
who have been generous with their time and support. OSD is part of the World Bank’s
multidimensional Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC) effort; we work with the GAC
advisors in the World Bank’s Regional Vice-Presidencies, and many of these advisors,
including Lisa Bhansali (Latin America and Caribbean) and Sahr Kpundeh (Africa), have
provided invaluable suggestions, for which we extend our gratitude. We also remain
appreciative of the ongoing support that we have received from the Audit Committee
of the World Bank Board of Executive Directors.

This effort would not have been possible without the legal expertise of my colleagues
Paul Ezzeddin and Jamieson Smith. I appreciate their dedication more than I can say.
Our open and frank discussions are essential to the rigorous analysis applied to our
cases. We, in turn, could not have done our work without the help we have received
from many talented legal interns who have served with us during the past six years,
many of whom have now embarked on their own impressive careers in the private
and public sectors. I have also learned a great deal from interactions and vigorous
discussions over the past five years with the students in my seminar at the Georgetown
University Law Center (“International Efforts to Combat Corruption”) as well as with
the lawyers at the American Bar Association and International Bar Association Anti-
Corruption Committees.

Our former colleagues Marie-Christine Balaguer and Sharon Louis were instrumental
in designing and maintaining our data collection system, now capably managed by
JungSoo Kim. Special thanks to my colleagues Katherine Sylvester, Teresita Perez
and Soramon “Ploy” Urapeepatanapong for the production of this report as well as
their tireless efforts in our day-to-day operations. We are grateful to Edith Wilson for
her invaluable strategic counseling, including the conceptualization of this report from
beginning to end.
