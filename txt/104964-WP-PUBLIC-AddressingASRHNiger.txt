Abstract: The aim of the study is to better understand adolescents’ sexual and
reproductive health (SRH) needs in order to inform the design of interventions and policies
that improve access to and use of adolescent SRH services in Niger. A mixed-methods
study was conducted and included: (i) a quantitative analysis of Niger’s Demographic
Health Survey/Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (DHS/MICS) 2012; (ii) 17 focus group
discussions conducted in urban and rural areas among 128 adolescents; and (iii) a set of
recommendations to improve access to and use of SRH services for adolescents in the
country. The study found that age at first marriage among adolescent females is 15.7
years and is followed soon thereafter by sexual debut (15.9 years). According to focus
group discussions (FGDs), adolescents boys and girls start spending time together at 12
years in urban areas and 10 years in rural areas; this may lead to sexual intercourse in
exchange for material and financial resources. Over 70 percent of adolescents have given
birth by 18 years of age. Although knowledge about modern contraception is high (73
percent among female adolescents 15-19 years of age), the majority of adolescent girls
do not use contraception due to societal and cultural beliefs. Moreover, FGDs reveal that
the main barriers to use of SRH services is a lack of privacy and confidentiality, as well as
finances, despite the government’s elimination of user fees. The government has
increased supply side interventions for adolescents and prioritized adolescents on the
national agenda by approving the Family Planning Action Plan (2012-2020) and the
National Plan for Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (2011), however these
plans need to be monitored and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in reaching this
population group. There is also a need to increase multi-sectoral demand-side
interventions in the country.

Adolescents and youth 1 (10-24 years of age) represent 31.0 percent of the total population in
Niger today (UN DESA, 2015), the largest cohort of young people in the country’s history.
These young people play an important role in Nigerien society, however, they face challenges
to reaching their sexual and reproductive health (SRH) potential, such as early marriage and
childbearing. In 2012, for example, the median age at first marriage among young women was
15.7 years while the adolescent fertility rate was estimated at 210 births per 1,000 15-19 year
olds (DHS/MICS, 2012). Importantly, early marriage and childbearing are associated with an
increased risk of experiencing unplanned pregnancies, unsafe abortions, sexually transmitted
infections (STIs), and maternal mortality and morbidity. They are also negatively associated
with a range of health and development outcomes, including poorer educational outcomes
and a higher risk of exposure to violence. Adolescent childbearing affects not only the health
of young women and their children but also the mother and child’s long-term education and
employment trajectories. Ultimately, inadequate access to health information and services, as
well as inequitable gender norms, contribute to a lack of knowledge and awareness about
puberty, sexuality, and basic human rights.

Although over twenty years have passed since the International Conference on Population
and Development (ICPD) first put adolescent sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR)
on the political and public agenda, support and protection for adolescent SRH (ASRH) and
SRHR programs and policies have developed at a slower pace in Niger. Adolescents and
youth in the country lack knowledge about their SRH and SRHR, while access to quality health
services is limited. Given that these young people are the next generation of adults, they will
greatly influence the achievement of the sustainable developmenent goals (SDGs). Therefore,
investments in multi-sectoral SRH interventions should be prioritized, taking into consideration
equity and rights, within the universal health coverage (UHC) framework.

Acknowledging the importance of SRH, the World Bank Group, with support from the Bank
Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP) Trust Fund, is pleased to present Addressing
Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health in Niger. This report is based on data collected
through quantitative and qualititve research, presenting the opportunities and challenges that
adolescents in Niger face to meeting their SRH needs.

Protecting the health and wellbeing of adolescents and youth is a priority for the World Bank
Group. This report is intended for visionary leaders responsible for shaping social policies and
for decision makers concerned with the comprehensive health and development of
adolescents and youth. It is our hope that, by disseminating evidence on ASRH and policies
at the country level, decision-makers and key stakeholders will invest in the improvement of
adolescent and youth SRH, thereby securing the health and well-being of future generations.

 The World Health Organization (WHO) defines young people as individuals between the ages of 10
and 24 years of age. Adolescents represent the 10–19-year-old age group and youth the 15–24-year-
old age group.

                              PART I - INTRODUCTION

1. The Republic of Niger is a landlocked sub-Saharan African country, with 50.3
   percent of the population living below the poverty line (WBG, 2011). In 2013, the
   country's social indicators were among the worst in the world. For example, less than half
   (47.5 percent) of the population had access to health centers within a 5 km distance; 29
   percent of the population was literate, while primary school enrollment stood at 59 percent;
   and more than half of the population in rural areas did not have access to drinking water.
   In 2012, the country ranked last out of 187 countries in the United Nations Devleopment
   Programe (UNDP) Human Development Index (HDI), with a gross domestic product (GDP)
   per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP) of US$ 701 in 2010, one of the lowest in the
   world (WBG, 2014).

2. There has been significant improvement, in recent years, in infant and under-five
   health and access to health services in the country. Infant and child mortality rates
   have declined sharply in Niger since the beginning of the 21st century. The infant mortality
   rate fell from 107 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1998 to 63 deaths in 2012, representing a
   41 percent reduction over 12 years. Similar trends were found with the under five mortality
   rate, which fell from 245 deaths per 1,000 live births to 114 deaths over the same period,
   signifying a 54 percent decline (Figure 1). In addition, use of curative child health care
   services improved with the removal of user fees in 2007 and the introduction of an effective
   Child Survival Strategy. Challenges remain, however, to ensuring effective coverage of
   life-saving interventions for newborns as neonatal mortality has not declined as rapidly as
   infant and under-five mortality (Lagarde, Barroy and Palmer 2012; Barroy 2013).

3. Niger has the highest total fertility rate in the world, estimated at 7.6 children per
   woman in 2012. This rate varies by residence, education, and wealth quintile. The fertility
   rate is higher in rural areas at 8.1 births per woman in comparison to 5.6 births per woman
   in urban areas (Figure 2) (WBG, 2014). Women without an education have a total fertility
   rate of 8.0 births per woman in comparison to women with a secondary education or higher
   at 4.9 births per woman. Meanwhile women in the poorest quintile have an average of 8.2
   births per woman in comparison to 6.1 births per woman in the wealthiest quintile.

4. The population of Niger was estimated at over 17 million inhabitants in 2012, with
   an inter-census population growth rate of 3.9 percent, one of the highest in the
   world. If this growth rate continues, the population will double within the next 15 years. In
   addition, Niger has a predominately young population, with 50 percent of the population
   below 15 years of age. This is particularly concerning as there has been limited investment
   in human capital, raising concerns about the country’s ability to eventually benefit from the
   demographic dividend; this transition has not yet started in Niger, despite increased use
   of contraception and a sharp decline in infant and child mortality (Guengant 2012).

5. Progress towards the reduction of maternal mortality has been modest. Niger has a
   higher maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in comparison to other countries in the West African
   Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) region (Figure 3). The MMR declined from 1,000
   per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 630 per 100,000 in 2012, representing a 37 percent
   decrease in 20 years. Although mortality reduction gains have occurred, the achievement
   of MDG 5 (175 per 100,000 live births) will not be attained in the country by 2015 (World
   Bank, 2014).

6. Early marriage and childbearing have been identified as key drivers to high fertility
   and maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (PRB, 2011). In Niger, the median age
   of first marriage and childbearing for women is 15.7 years and 18 years respectively, the
   youngest in the region (DHS/MICS, 2012) (Figures 4 and 5). Meanwhile, trends in
   marriage and childbearing have not changed significantly over the past two decades in the
   country. Importantly, adolescent fertility and childbearing not only increases the young
   woman’s risk of poor pregnancy outcomes but also maternal death. In fact, adolescent
   (15-19 years of age) maternal deaths account for over one third (34.4 percent) of all deaths
   among women in Niger. Additionally, early marriage and childbearing has long-term
   consequences on the adolescent mother and child, impacting their education and
   employment prospects (WHO 2011, World Bank 2001).

7. Women in Niger are disadvantaged from a young age. Niger ranks near the bottom of
   the gender-related development index (155th out of 157 countries). Young women face
   limited educational opportunities, arranged marriages, and female genital cutting (over 90
   percent experience cutting). Once married, women move in with their husband’s family
   where men have legal authority over their wives and mothers in-law have strong intra-
   familial power. Moreover, the feminization of poverty illustrates gender inequality issues in
   the country. For example, in 2008 per capita consumption was 45 percent lower in
   households headed by women; they also had less access to credit (17.5 percent of
   demand met as against 27.4 percent for men) and limited employment opportunities (27.4
   percent access for 51.1 percent of the workforce) (IMF, 2013).

8. Limited access and use of health and family planning (FP) services among women,
       combined with low education, is prevalent, particularly among females in rural
       areas. Use of (and demand for) modern family planning among women (regardless of age)
       is estimated to be lower in Niger than in the rest of the sub-region, except Mali (Figure 6).
       Contraceptive prevalence has, however, increased in recent years, from 5 percent in 2006
       to 12 percent (DHS/MICS, 2012). One study found that women do not demand
       contraception as they are “prohibited by their husbands and imams because they
       denounce “Western” notions like birth control.” Women also are less likely to utilize
       contraception due to financial constraints. The government is working to overcome this on
       the supply side, by reducing finances to FP commodities, however, the literature indicates
       that thus far there has been little effect (Guengant 2012).

9. Coverage of SRH services is low in Niger. Health service coverage, measured by the
       proportion of people living within a radius of 0-5 km from an Integrated Health Centre (CSI),
       was estimated at 47.5 percent in 2011 2. In theory, it is the proportion of the population with
       access to the Minimum Package of Activities (PMA). The proportion has been declining
       since 2010 due to slowdown in investments for the construction of CSIs. It indicates that
       less than one out of every two persons is covered by the health system, excluding health
       posts 3 (figure 7).

10. According to national health statistics, Niger has made progress in increasing
   antenatal care (ANC) coverage in recent years. The proportion of pregnant women,
   regardless of age, who went to a health facility for an ANC visit increased from 46 percent
   in 2006 to 83 percent in 2012.

11. At the national level, the percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel
   increased between 2006 and 2012 (from 18 to 29 percent). Furthermore, the
   percentage of women in urban areas who benefitted from the assistance of skilled health
   personnel at birth was estimated at 83 percent in 2012, in comparison to 21 percent in
   rural areas. Regional inequalities in births attended by skilled health personnel also exist
   with 57 percent of births attended by a skilled health personnel in Diffa in comparison to
   98 percent in Niamey. The spatial distribution of skilled birth attendants indicates wide
   disparities between Niamey and rural areas. The ratio between the two groups is almost
   3 to 1 (World Bank, 2014).

12. Removal of user fees for maternal and child health (MCH) services has been positive
   in Niger. Evidence indicates that in Niger, the removal of user fees for children under five

                                                                5
   (curative services) and pregnant women (ANC, c-Sections) has contributed to an increase
   in the use of services (Lagarde, Barroy and Palmer 2012).

13. Nigerien women are dissatisfied with the "state of consultation and hospitalization
   rooms and the cramped premises, all of which are major obstacles to privacy. In
   addition, the waiting time is too long, and there are delays due to staff absences”
   (MSP, 2011). A 2008 User Satisfaction Survey found that 40 percent of patients were
   dissatisfied with the quality of health care and services. For example, 27 percent of visitors
   were informed about HIV/AIDS transmission and prevention methods, while 28 percent
   were offered an HIV test (DHS/MICS, 2012).

14. While supply and demand-side determinants to accessing reproductive health
   services among reproductive-aged women have been documented, little
   information has been gathered on adolescents in Niger. Evidence from low and
   middle-income countries (LMICs) indicates that major barriers to accessing SRH and FP
   services are associated with socio-cultural norms and economic conditions, as well as
   supply-side constraints related to the availability and quality of health services (Table 1)
   (Chowdury, 2013). However, there is a lack of evidence on the barriers that Nigerien
   adolescents face, as well as their needs, in comparison to older age groups. In addition,
   there is a lack of evidence on policies that can better address those needs and barriers in
   order to improve ASRH and FP outcomes.


15. This study aims to inform country policy-makers and development partners about
   ASRH needs within Niger’s development context. The overall objective is to help in the
   design of better tailored interventions and policies that aim to improve access and use of
   ASRH services in the country. Using the framework of analysis below (Figure 8), the study
   will address the following specific objectives:

   (i)        Investigate adolescent’s socio-economic profile
   (ii)       Analyze ASRH status and its determinants from a demand and supply-side
              perspective
   (iii)      Assess effectiveness of existing adolescent friendly initiatives and programs
   (iv)       Recommend a set of policy options to improve access and use of services for
              adolescents in Niger


16. The study uses a mixed methods approach that includes the following:

   •       An analysis of the most recent Niger DHS/MICS data (2012) focusing on adolescent
           health.
   •       17 focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted in 18 urban neighbourhoods and 2 rural
           villages among 128 adolescents 10-19 years of age. Groups were divided by age (10-
           14 and 15-19 years) and education status (in school or out-of-school). Eighty-six
           adolescents were interviewed in urban areas and forty-two adolescents were
           interviewed in rural aras. FGDs were conducted in order to understand the
           experiences, difficulties, and challenges that adolescents (10-19 years of age) face
           regarding their SRH.
   •       Policy and program review, including interviews with stakeholders and beneficiaries’,
           as well as on-site visits.

4Quality FP service is described as having six key elements that clients perceive to be critical for making an
informed choice. These are: choice of method, information given to users, technical competence, interpersonal
relations, follow-up or continuity mechanisms, and appropriate constellation of services (Bruce 2009).

              PART II - ADOLESCENTS IN NIGER: GROWING UP
                      IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC HARDSHIP

17. Adolescents (10-19 years of age) represent almost a quarter of the population (23.4
   percent) in Niger and are largely affected by poverty. When analyzed by age group,
   adolescents 10 to 14 years and 15 to 19 years represent 13.2 percent and 10.2 percent of
   the population respectively. Approximately 80 percent of adolescents live in rural areas
   (Figure 9), while 64 percent live below the poverty line. Disparities exist between urban
   and rural areas in Niger. Niamey, the capital of the country, is home to the wealthiest
   population, with over 92 percent of the wealthiest households. Meanwhile, 8 percent of the
   rural population is considered rich (DHS/MICS, 2012).

School Enrollment

18. Access to school is limited for Nigerien adolescents. School enrollment among
   adolescents 15 to 19 years of age is low. Among adolescent girls 15-19 years of age, 63.0
   percent have no education while 0 percent have completed secondary education. In
   addition, approximately 4 percent of adolescent females 15-19 years of age and 7 percent
   of boys the same age completed primary school in 2012. Although educational
   achievement has improved over the years, girls are more vulnerable than boys to not
   receiving an education (Table 2). Low enrollment and completion rates among adolescent
   females in secondary school may be attributed to having to be placed in foster families in
   order to attend school. Also, participation in housework and early marriage contribute to
   low enrollment and completion rates. As illustrated in figure 10, the wealthier the family (as
   measured by the wealth index), the greater the likelihood of attaining a higher education
   for both adolescent boys and girls (DHS/MICS, 2012).

Young People in the Workforce

19. A majority of adolescents work. Adolescents less than 14 years of age are most likely
   to work in the family business, on family land, or contribute to housework. In fact, 74
   percent of adolescent boys (12-14 years of age) and over 80 percent of adolescent girls
   the same age work in the family business or on family land. They also engage in external
   economic activity (14 hours per week more or less). Among adolescents 15 years of age
   and older, 58 percent of young men and 15 percent of young women are employed in
   wage-based work activities. The majority of males are employed in agriculture (65.3
   percent), while females work mainly in sales (60.7 percent) (DHS/MICS, 2012).




                                            10
20. A large portion of adolescents are placed in foster care. Overall 35.9 percent of
   children aged 10 to 17 years do not live with either of their biological parents, while 19.5
   percent of them lost one or both parents. Whether for work activities or for ensuring access
   to nearby schools, a large proportion of adolescents are placed/entrusted with members
   of the broader family or community. This is also likely to influence their social and economic
   vulnerability (DHS/MICS 2012).

Cultural Norms about Young People

21. Cultural and social norms tend to disempower adolescents in Nigerien society.
   Although the child is seen as a blessing and opportunity for the family, considered worthy
   of investment, a vast hierarchical structure exists to ensure that young people obey their
   elders. This restricts their ability to express themselves and make decisions within their
   family and community. For adults, youth represents inexperience and recklessness, a
   phase in which young people lack the clarity of mind and the wisdom required to know
   what is good or bad for them (Lejean, 2014).

22. The prevalence of the division of employment based on gender indicates that men
   and women work in separate areas. Adolescent girls build their identity in the private
   and domestic sphere, while boys do so publicly. This leads to different opportunities for
   both sexes. A 2010 survey (Lafia Matassa, 2010) found that adolescent girls' vulnerabilities
   are mostly driven by social status and gender bias in social relationships. The patriarchal
   nature of Nigerien society may restrict young girls from their right to free speech and
   decision making power. According to Lafia Matassa (2010), the study found that society
   emphasizes the reproduction for girls, thus limiting their development and learning
   opportunities.

23. Evidence on sexual violence among adolescents in Niger is mixed. A 2011 study
   found that nearly 30 percent of adolescents 15-18 years of age were victims of sexual
   violence. Sexual violence is more likely to affect younger adolescents (26 percent of
   victims of sexual violence were younger than 18 years) than older adolescents and young
   women (12.6 percent of 19-25 year olds and 8.6 percent of 25 year olds experienced
   sexual violence). The study also revealed that violence against women is mainly
   perpetrated by men who are older than 25 years (50 percent), most of which occurs within
   marriage (NIS/Oxfam/UNFPA 2011) (Table 3). In contrast, adolescents in the FGDs stated
   that sexual violence was rare in Niger as it was socially condemned. Victims of sexual
   violence were often young women who went out late at night. FGDs revealed that in urban
   areas, sexual violence victims seek justice through the authorities, however in rural areas
   families are more likely to handle the retribution as opposed to the authorities.

   PART III - ADOLESCENT SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN
              NIGER: STATUS AND MAIN DETERMINANTS

24. Early marriage and childbearing greatly affect maternal and child health. Maternal
   mortality accounts for 35 percent of all deaths to adolescents 15 to 19 years of age
   (DHS/MICS 2012). Early childbearing also increases the risk for dystocia, fistula, and other
   damaging outcomes to the reproductive system (WHO, 2011). Births to adolescents 15-
   19 years of age have the greatest risk of infant and child mortality, as well as a higher risk
   of morbidity and mortality for the young mother. In addition, evidence (Ousmane et al.
   2013 ; Nayama et al, 2007) from Niger has found that neonatal mortality is high among
   adolescent pregnancies. Fifteen percent of children born from a sample of 1,659 married
   adolescent girls were stillborn or died soon after birth. Also, 14 percent of adolescent
   mothers gave birth to a child weighing less than 2.5 kilograms. Although data is scarce,
   there is evidence indicating that elective abortion (EA) among adolescents negatively
   influences their chance of survival. A recent study found that out of 151 EA cases
   performed on adolescents below 19 years of age, 13 deaths were reported (about 10
   percent) during or following the intervention (Nayama et al, 2009).


Marriage, Sexual Debut, and Childbearing: An Early Start for Adolescent Girls

Gender interactions before marriage


25. Adolescent boys and girls begin to interact before marriage. FGDs held in urban
   Niamey indicate that girls and boys start spending time together at 12 years of age; in rural
   areas, they start spending time together at 10 years. In urban settings, school may explain
   the early onset of spending time together. Adolescents in FGDs stated that by the time
   they reach middle school, some girls think they are grown-up and therefore entitled to start
   chatting with boys.

26. Adult behavior may influence when and how girls and boys begin to spend time
   together. Given limited adequate housing, parents and children often have to sleep in the
   same room. In the FGDs, adolescents stated that this may lead to becoming sexually
   active at a younger age because they may witness parental sexual behaviour. FGDs also
   revealed that peer pressure may influence early onset of sexual activity. Young people
   often want to immitate their friends who are already in a relationship.

27. Flirting leads to premarital sex, which is occurring at increasingly younger ages due
   to financial and material reasons, despite societal disapproval. Adolescents in FGDs
   stated that girls often initiate sex at younger ages than boys because of money and
   material benefits. According to FGDs, girls in rural areas sleep with boys for less cash than
   girls in urban areas. Parents’ response to premarital sex varies with some tolerating or
   encouraging the behaviour, as they rely on their daughters’ financial resources obtained
   from dating.




                                              13
Early marriage as social promotion for women


28. Women are more likely to marry at younger ages than their male counterparts. Sixty-
   one percent of females aged 15 to 19 are already married in comparison to almost three
   percent of men the same age (DHS/MICS, 2012). Among 15-19 year old married women,
   19.5 percent are in a polygamous marriage. Nationally, the median age at first marriage is
   15.7 years for women and 24.2 years for men, but disparities exist between urban and
   rural areas. Female median age at first marriage is 19.5 years in Niamey and 15.6 years
   in rural areas. For men, the median age is 28.7 years in Niamey and 24 years in rural
   areas. In addition to urban living, education is also associated with marriage delay. Age at
   first marriage for women without an education is 15.6 years in comparison to 21.1 years
   for women who have a secondary education or higher (DHS/MICS, 2012).

29. In many cases, marriage is seen as a socially valued-option for adolescent girls,
   moreso than schooling or professional training. Given that marriage is perceived as
   enhancing their social standing and increasing their dignity and respectability within the
   community, early marriage is valued in Niger. Marriage also serves a social purpose:
   preventing potential family humiliation associated with early sexual behavior and
   premarital pregnancies (IntHEC, 2010). This was confirmed in FGDs, as adolescents (14-
   15 years of age) stated that early marriage was socially valued and prevented “the shame
   of having an unplanned pregnancy”. In Niger, men value youth and virginity; for them,
   marriage positively contributes to “body control” and limits “bad behaviors”. For girls,
   unmarried adolescents are considered “old maids”. Their single status is considered a sign
   of their inability to be “useful to the society”.

30. Given that the median age at first marriage for young women is similar to the median
   age at first sexual intercourse (15.9 years), it can therefore be determined that
   sexual initiation begins with marriage. Also, young women become sexually active at
   younger ages in comparison to their male counterparts. For example, among women 15-
   25 years of age, 24.5 percent reported that sexual initiation began before 15 years of age,
   in comparison to 1.1 percent of men the same age. Similarly, 73.9 percent of women aged
   15 to 24 years stated that their first sexual experience occurred before they turned 18
   years, compared to 10.9 percent for men of the same age (DHS/MICS, 2012). Disparities
   in age at sexual debut exist between urban and rural areas as well.

31. Trends indicate that rural female adolescents (15-19 years) are more likely to initiate
   sex before 15 and 18 years of age in comparison to their urban counterparts (Figures
   11 and 12). Regression analyses indicate that education and place of residence have a
   significant impact on sexual initiation before 18 years of age. In fact, for each additional
   year of education, the likelihood of early marriage is reduced by 4.5 percent; meanwhile,
   rural residence increases the likelihood of early marriage by 18 percent (DHS/MICS,
   2012).

32. Adolescent boys are less likely to initiate sex at a young age in comparison to their
   female counterparts, regardless of urban/rural residence. It appears that adolescent
   boys initiate sex before 18 years of age. Although a larger proportion of adolescent boys
   initiate sex in rural areas before 15 years and 18 years of age, this difference decreases
   over time (Figure 13 and 14).

Early childbearing


33. Given the large proportion of adolescent girls marrying and initiating sex at a young
   age, they become mothers before the age of 19 years. The median age at first childbirth
   is 18.5 years in Niger. However, 30.8 percent of them have had their first child by 16 years
   of age (table 4). These numbers mask disparities between rural and urban areas. In 2012,
   the adolescent birth rate in rural areas was more than twice that of urban areas (231.2
   births in comparison to 112.2 births per 1,000 15-19 year olds respectively) (Figure 15). In
   addition, adolescent fertility was three times higher among adolescents without an

                                                             15
   education (50 percent) in comparison to adolescents with a secondary education or higher
   (15 percent). Furthermore, although the adolescent fertility rate declined between the 1992
   and 2006 DHS surveys, it increased between 2006 and 2012 (from 199 births in 2006 to
   206 births per 1,000 15-19 year olds in 2012) (DHS/MICS, 2012).

34. Inequalities in early childbearing exist between wealth quintiles, with poorer
   adolescent girls (15-19 years of age) more likely to give birth than their wealthier
   counterparts. Almost 70 percent of the poorest 20-24 year olds had a child before 18
   years of age in comparison to 41 percent of their wealthier counterparts. Furthermore,
   trends indicate that early childbearing is decreasing among wealthier quintiles in
   comparison to their poorer counterparts (World Bank 2011).

35. Adolescent (15 to 19 years of age) live births represent 20.6 percent of all births
   born each year in the country. Adolescents are also more likely to have shorter birth
   intervals (26.5 months among 15-19 year olds in comparison to 29.6 months among 20-
   29 year olds and 32.1 months among 30-39 year olds) and a smaller desired family size
   in comparison to their older counterparts (8.1 children among 15-19 year olds in
   comparison to 8.6 among 20-24 year olds and 9.1 among 25-29 year olds) (DHS/MICS,
   2012).

Knowledge about Sexual and Reproductive Health issues

Reproductive cycle


36. Female adolescents (15-19 years of age) have limited knowledge about their fertile
   period. According to the DHS/MICS (2012), 12.3 percent of female adolescents (15-19
   years of age) knew that they were most fertile in the middle of their cycle. Awareness of
   the fertile period increases with age, as 7.2 percent of female adolescents 15 years of age
   knew about their fertile period in comparison to 18.8 percent of their 19 year old female
   counterparts. Education also affects awareness of the fertile period: 19.3 percent of
   adolescents (15 to 19 years) who completed high school and beyond knew when they
   were fertile, in comparison to 10.5 percent of those without an education (figure 16).
   Analyses indicate that poverty and residence are not associated with awareness about the
   fertile period (DHS/MICS, 2012).

Family planning


37. Knowledge about modern contraception has improved among adolescents over
   time. Although female adolescents lack awareness about their reproductive cycle and
   fertile period, their knowledge of modern family planning methods is high and has
   improved over time. In 2012, it was estimated that 73 percent of female adolescents (15-
   19 years of age) were knowledgeable about contraceptive methods at the national level.
   This knowledge increases with age, as more than 80 percent (83.4 percent) of female
   adolescents 18 years of age (83.4 percent) were aware of modern family planning
   methods (table 5) (DHS/MICS, 2012).

38. Wealth, residence, and education influence the level of FP awareness. Knowledge of
   modern contraceptive methods is higher in urban than in rural areas (Figure 17),
   particularly among the youngest adolescents. Similar trends are found among wealthier
   female adolescents, particularly among younger adolescents in comparison to their poorer
   counterparts (Figure 18). In fact, 54.9 percent of the poorest female adolescents (15 to 19
   years of age) were aware of a modern method, compared to 83.2 percent of their richer
   counterparts. Education also influences awareness of modern contraceptive methods.
   Almost 70 percent (68.5 percent) of young women aged 15 to 19 who never attended
   school were aware of at least one modern method, in comparison to 83.8 percent among
   those who completed high school (DHS/MICS, 2012).

39. While quantitative surveys indicate that adolescents are generally aware of the
   existence of modern contraception, FGDs reveal that youth may lack precise
   knowledge about the exact role, utility, and prescription of contraception. FGDs
   reflected the misperceptions associated with the use of contraception (see section 2.3).
   In particular, rural adolescent females (15-19 years) have limited knowledge about the role
   of modern FP commodities, and how to access and use them. It was also revealed that
   girls tend to also prefer using “non-visible” methods (i.e pills) to avoid disclosure to relatives
   and/or spouses.

                                                                    18
HIV/AIDS and STIs


40. Although adolescents (15 to 19 years) have heard about HIV (80.5 percent of
   females, 90.8 percent of males), their in-depth knowledge is limited. In fact, 12.3
   percent of 15 to 19 year old females have a comprehensive understanding of HIV
   prevention and transmission, in comparison to 21.3 percent of adolescent males of the
   same age. Further, 13.3 percent of adolescent females (15-19 years) and 39.4 percent of
   adolescent males the same age know where they can buy condoms. However, knowledge
   of a condom supply source increases with age (DHS/MICS, 2012) (table 6).

41. Knowledge of condom supply sources vary by residence, education, and wealth
   quintile. Almost 30 percent (27.6 percent) of urban adolescents between 15 and 19 years
   of age know one condom supply source, in comparison to 9.7 percent of their rural
   counterparts. Furthermore, 10.1 percent of adolescents (15-19 years of age) without an
   education knew of one condom supply source, compared to 26.4 percent for those with at
   least some secondary education. In addition, 8.5 percent of adolescents (15-19 years of
   age) in the poorest quintile know about one condom supply source, in comparison to 25.5
   percent of adolescents in the wealthiest quintile (DHS/MICS, 2012).

Values and Perceptions of Modern Family Planning and ASRH services


42. The main barriers to adolescent use of FP services are social and cultural beliefs
    and values. In 2006, almost 50 percent of adolescents (15-19 years of age) (42.6 percent)
    surveyed opposed use of FP services due to social and religious values and
    misperceptions about FP commodities for medical reasons (DHS 2006) 5. In fact, mores
    couples were opposed to FP due to social and cultural beliefs and values (28.9 percent)
    than couples that were opposed to FP due to medical reasons (8.9 percent) (DHS 2006).

43. Utilization of modern FP services is misperceived and generally not understood by
    husbands, especially early on in the marriage. FGDs revealed that husbands physically
    and verbally condemned the use of contraceptive pills by their adolescent wives. Reasons
    for opposing the use of contraception early on in the marriage included “perceptions of
    betrayal” and “misunderstandings about childbearing”. Abstinence was perceived as a way
    among both sexes to ensure birth spacing.

44. Parents influence social and cultural opposition to SRH related health services
    among young people. Parents were strongly opposed to adolescent sexual education in
    Niger. For example, a majority of parents were opposed to teaching adolescents (12-14
    years of age) about how to use a condom (67.8 percent of mothers and 51.8 percent of
    fathers) (DHS/MICS, 2012).



Use of SRH and family planning services


45. Despite being knowledgeable about modern FP methods, adolescents (less than 19
    years of age) rarely use contraception. 93 percent of adolescents (15-19 years) who
    are currently married, do not use any form of contraception. Similarly, 93.7 percent of 15-
    19 year old adolescents did not discuss FP with a health professional, in the field or in a
    health facility (DHS/MICS, 2012).

46. An overwhelming majority of adolescents (15 to 19 years) have never been tested
    for HIV/AIDS, despite having initiated sex. In fact, 89.4 percent of women and 97
    percent of men have never been tested. Furthermore, testing rates remain low among all
    age groups. Among adolescent females, rates of HIV testing are low but increase with at
    least a primary education (Figure 19). HIV testing is lower among adolescent males, with
    primary school completion or higher increasing the testing rate (DHS/MICS, 2012) (Figure
    20).




5 The present study analyzed reasons for non-use of FP services among Nigerien adolescents, including:
infrequent sex, respondent opposed, spouse opposed, others opposed, religious prohibition, other opposition to
use, health concerns, fear of side effects, inconvenient to use, interfere with body.

47. Despite Niger's current low prevalence rate for HIV/AIDS (under 1 percent), young people
   rarely use condoms. The 2011 Second Generation HIV/AIDS Monitoring Survey (CISLS,
   2011) shows that young people aged 15 to 24 rarely use a condom. In fact, 36 percent
   who were never married did not use a condom during their latest sexual encounter.
   Analysis shows that young people find it difficult to negotiate ways to prevent unprotected
   sex, when there is a potential or actual risk (Table 8).

Access and Use of SRH Services among Adolescents

Antenatal care coverage


48. For adolescents, access to adequate ANC services is limited and varies by
   residence, education, and wealth. In fact, 16.4 percent of adolescents (15 to 19 years
   of age) did not receive any ANC during their pregnancy. Furthermore, 82.1 percent of rural
   female adolescents (15-19 years) attended at least one ANC visit, in comparison to 98.1
   percent of urban adolescents. Moreover, 81.5 percent of adolescents without an education
   had at least one ANC visit, in comparison to those who had at least a secondary education


                                                         21
   (100 percent). In addition, 70.4 percent of the poorest adolescents had at least one ANC
   visit in comparison to 91.1 percent of wealthier adolescents (DHS/MICs, 2012).


Delivering at home
49. Although female adolescents (15 to 19 years of age) attend ANC, they do not deliver
    in formal health facilities. Indeed, 63.4 percent deliver outside of the health facility,
    without skilled birth attendants, and often at home (table 9). In addition, of the young
    women (less than 20 years of age) who delivered in a health facility in 2012, most delivered
    in a public health facility (32.5 percent) in comparison to a private health facility (0.4
    percent) (DHS/MICS, 2012).

50. Residence, wealth, and education influence the labour and delivery site for female
   adolescents. In urban areas, 18.2 percent of female adolescents aged 15 to 19 years
   gave birth most recently outside of a health facility, without medical assistance, compared
   to 68 percent in rural areas. Young women (less than 20 years of age) were most likely to
   be assisted by traditional birth attendants (32.5 percent) followed by nurses/midwives
   (31.8 percent), or parents (24.8 percent). They were least likely to be assisted by doctors
   (0.7 percent). Also variations exist between economic groups: 78.4 percent of the poorest
   adolescents do not give birth in a health facility in comparison to 36 percent of the richest.
   In terms of education levels, 68.7 percent of female adolescents aged 15-19 without an
   education gave birth most recently outside of a health facility and without proper medical
   assistance, compared to 38.6 percent of those with at least a primary education
   (DHS/MICS 2012).


Main barriers to accessing health services


51. Among female adolescents (15-19 years of age), 64.5 percent stated that they faced
   at least one problem when trying to access SRH services (table 10). A lack of financial
   resources was cited as the main barrier to accessing health services (52.3 percent), while
   distance and transportation constitute the two other main barriers (for respectively 38.7
   percent and 38.3 percent of the surveyed female adolescents). It is worth noting that in
   over 20 percent of the cases adolescents need approval to seek healthcare from their
   family or their husbands/in-laws (DHS/MICS 2012).

52. Adolescents are reluctant to use formal health care services. FGDs revelaed that
   location, purpose, and utility of health services are generally ignored among adolescents.
   Unmarried adolescents tend to seek self-medication first and then traditional medicine
   when health issues emerge. Adolescents are also swayed by misinformation about
   condoms, the existence and effectiveness of remedies, and the role of health practitioners
   in adolescent health issues.

53. Low quality SRH services and a lack of adolescent-friendly approaches within
   public facilities are main supply-side barriers. Adolescent respondents in FGDs
   highlighted the lack of privacy in public facilities and the importance of confidentiality (“not
   being seen by neighbors”) in order for them to effectively use SRH services and avoid
   stigma and discrimination among the family and community.

54. A 2013 Gender and Health Survey found inadequate behavior from health personnel
   toward adolescents’ health issues. Only 37.5 percent of surveyed adolescent boys and
   25 percent of girls used SRH counseling services. The barriers to health services most
   cited among adolescent females and males at the community level were a lack of money
   to buy medications, unavailability of staff, and prior negative experiences. For example,
   bad reception, absences, and delays. The study recommended greater stakeholder
   involvement, particularly the participation of young women in the management of health
   facilities, providing attention to their needs and the organization of health care service
   delivery (World Bank, 2014). The FGDs revealed that non-accompanied adolescents and
   youth are stigmatized if they attend health facilities alone. Social norms in the country
   encourage adolescents to use health services with relatives.

PART IV - NATIONAL STRATEGIES AND INTERVENTIONS IN SUPPORT
           OF ASRH: BEST PRACTICES AND CHALLENGES

National Strategies: Focus on Supply

An increase in youth issues within the national agenda


55. Adolescent-friendly policies are increasingly being mainstreamed within national
   strategies for poverty reduction, health, education and employment. As an example, the
   2011 National Strategy for Economic and Social Development aims by 2024 to “ensure
   that adolescents and youth are able to contribute to the country’s sustainable
   development”. Four main pillars directly refer to adolescents and their role in economic
   progress: (i) population control through increased use of FP services; (ii) integration of
   young people in the economy through inclusive growth, increased involvement in decision-
   making and professional skills development; (iii) improvement in adolescent and youth
   SRH through free provision and community-based distribution of FP commodities; and (iv)
   reduction of gender-based inequalities, focusing on education and employment. However,
   according to the mid-term review, adolescent specific outputs and the national capacity to
   effectively mainstream adolescent and youth SRH issues across programs needs to be
   strengthened and prioritized (MSP, 2011).

56. In the development of the SRH agenda, adolescent and youth issues in the policy
   formulation process have been prioritized in Niger. The adoption of the Reproductive
   Health Law in 2006 marked a milestone in acknowledging SRHR as a top priority for
   government action, particularly for young women. It recognized the right to access
   adequate health care and prevention services for pregnant and reproductive-aged women.
   Decrees in 2006 and 2007 also eased financial access for women to SRH services, by
   removing user fees for ANC, c-sections, and gynecological cancers in all public health
   facilities.

57. The Family Planning Action Plan (2012-2020) incorporates adolescent specific
   issues. The Action Plan aims to reduce maternal and child mortality in Niger, by increasing
   contraceptive use from 12 percent in 2010 to 25 percent in 2015 and 50 percent by 2020.
   The goal is to enhance FP delivery mechanisms, by mainstreaming FP throughout the
   private and public sectors, while setting-up mobile clinics in remote areas. It also seeks to
   increase demand for FP, including combatting misperceptions related to FP through mass
   media campaigns; national information communication technology strategies (NICTs); or
   through community mobilization, with support from religious and traditional leaders, local
   elected officials, women's and youth groups. For adolescents, the action plan also seeks
   to improve the way FP is taught in middle and high school classes, and in adolescent
   education generally through in-school peer mentoring programs (MSP, 2012).

58. Adolescent-focused policies have been incorporated into the agenda within recent
   years. A National Youth Plan adopted in 1998, acknowledged the right to health for
   adolescents and youth (article 9) without discrimination, and access to health education
   and information (article 10 et 11). The Plan did not, however, contain provisions for SRH.
   In 2011, a Strategic Action Plan for Youth was adopted with the aim to “reduce the
   vulnerability and improve the wellbeing of at least 70 percent of young Nigeriens aged 15
   to 35 years by 2014”. The Plan outlines three key actions for adolescents: (i) increasing
   awareness and access to information and media to improve youth protection against risks;


                                              24
   (ii) developing youth support centers providing a minimum wellbeing package including
   health education; and (iii) professional skills development (MSP, 2011).

59. A National Plan for ASRH was adopted in 2011 in Niger. Niger was one of the first
   countries to introduce strategic guidance for the sector in the sub-region. The Action Plan
   outlines four main strategic pillars: (1) improving access to information that responds to
   adolescent and youth needs; (2) improving adolescents and youth access to, and use of,
   health services; (3) promoting an environment supportive of adolescent and youth health;
   and (4) improving the management of operations targeting adolescents and youth. The
   Action Plan is detailed in table 11 below (MSP, 2011).

Government action towards ASRH: supply-side interventions


60. Government interventions have focused on strengthening the supply of adolescent
   health and wellbeing services. Youth centers have been set up throughout the country.
   Also, Counselling Centers have opened under the leadership of the Ministry of Youth,
   through the United Nations Population Fund’s (UNFPA) support, providing recreational
   activities, advice, and active counselling to adolescents, including issues related to SRH.
   Further prioritization needs to be given to the youth centers, however, in order to ensure
   that they are fully operational, providing access to SRH services and HIV/AIDS testing,
   particularly in rural areas (Table 12). In contrast, implementation of demand-side
   interventions have been scarce.

61. Efforts to increase the national capacity to provide user friendly ASRH services is a
   priority. To date, 48 health centers (8 in each province) have been labelled adolescent-
   friendly, with staff trained on adolescent specific health issues and the provision of
   adequate services and commodities. Specific guidelines were developed on standards
   and norms for adolescent-friendly services and health personnel were trained accordingly,
   with support from development partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO)
   and UNFPA. Training was provided to over 50 percent of the health personnel in the
   country. In daily medical practices, however, health provider behavior remains largely
   influenced by cultural and religious norms that condemn sexual intercourse before
   marriage and the use of FP commodities before marriage (IntHEC 2010).

62. Government interventions should be implemented multi-sectorally with inputs from
   the education, health, and employment sectors. Strategic partnerships between
   schools, health facilities, and youth centers should be developed in order to ensure better
   dissemination of SRH information among adolescents. Importantly, youth centers work as
   an “entry point” for many adolescents. They can therefore be useful in guiding youth in
   health care services.

63. The political environment has slowed down government efforts towards better
   integration of adolescent issues in policy and legislation. For example, legislation on
   age at first marriage for adolescent girls has become a political and decision making issue
   in recent years. A law developed to “protect female adolescent students”, initiated by a
   government coalition was rejected by Parliament. Within Article 6 of this law, parents had
   to seek permission from a judge before marrying their daughter or face sanctions. This
   created upheaval within the community and government: religious leaders strongly
   opposed it and elected representatives refused to vote.

Need to Scale-Up Demand-Side Interventions

64. Actions that generate demand have been implemented on a small scale but are
   largely under-funded. The three main activities that have been implemented to generate
   demand for ASRH services include life skills development, peer education, and behavior
   change. While these interventions aim to improve knowledge and practices about SRH
   services, they also contribute to increasing adolescents’ position within Nigerien society.
   For example, adolescent life skills development programs have helped strengthen both
   individual and collective life skills within several communities. Despite producing good
   practices, geographical coverage of these interventions remains limited (Box 1).

      Box 1: Life skills development programs: “Tontines”

      CARE international implemented a program based on traditional community saving
      systems (referred to as tontines). Community groups were first developed (with a
      management committee and bylaws) and then received training and support on
      financial education and community life. Community group membership fees are paid
      during weekly meetings, with the tontine made available to finance income-generating
      activities when a group member requests. Community groups also receive support for
      community diagnostics and planning when an important project needs to be developed
      and implemented. These groups provide a forum for debate and dialogue, in which
      members learn about democracy at the local level, citizen participation in government,
      reproductive health, gender, and gender based violence (GBV). It has been found that
      young women (15-16 years of age), single or married, have benefited from group skills
      enhancement, ultimately promoting leadership.

      Plan Niger has also provided support to enhancing group skills in Niamey and its
      surrounding areas, Tillaberi and Dosso. Programs target established groups of young
      people, especially young women in order to: (i) Increase income through internal
      resource mobilization; (ii) Expand life skills: SRH, leadership, ability to speak-up,
      community life/self-esteem/health/communication-listening/conflict management and
      peace/FP/Leadership/conflict management; and (iii) Promote the leadership skills of
      young women. This program helps increase participation and prioritization of young
      participants within each group, providing them a greater voice in advocating with
      authorities.

65. Peer education activities are common among youth-oriented organizations,
   however these programs need to be scaled up. Peer education activities are practiced
   on a voluntary basis with many peer-based interventions implemented informally. One of
   the challenges to these programs is that turnover of peer educators is high, as youth
   continue on with their studies or become involved in income-generating activities. Also,
   given that peer educators are unpaid volunteers, they have limited time to invest in these
   activities. Furthermore, peer education is largely under-supervised and requires greater
   supervision and guidance in order to be effective on a larger scale (Box 2).




                                             29
     Box 2: Peer education: DIMOL and ANBEF, two youth-based local initiatives

     DIMOL, a local civil society organization (CSO), includes a sex education program
     ("DIMOL Adolescents") in which students and teachers go into the community to speak
     with adolescents and youth in schools and informally. They also participate in
     community radio programs, providing information on reproductive heath issues. The
     program also provides “spaces” to improve outreach to young people, in which groups
     of young people gather to talk about adolescent and youth issues, sometimes
     separated by gender and age (for example, when discussing SRH issues).

     ANBEF, another local organization, relies on peer educators and Youth Action
     Movements to address low adolescent attendance in health centers. Youth Action
     Movements, generally students, provide support and tutoring. These young adults are
     25 years of age an older. They are tasked with sensitizing young students at school
     on various topics (for example, SRH, responsible parenthood, early marriage, among
     others).


66. Behavior change communication programs have been developed by numerous
  partners, with good results at small scale. For example, “My Right, my Voice”, a
  coalition of NGOs and initiatives (DIMOL, Education for All [EFA], Vie Kandé ni Bayra and
  Oxfam) partnered to better inform young people about their SRHR. In implementing the
  "My Right, My Voice" Program, partners designed activities to promote and disseminate
  information on adolescent and youth SRHR by training young people and working with
  community radios to broadcast weekly programs (Oxfam, 2013). Other communication
  strategies are being introduced, relying on multiple channels, including mass media,
  traditional community-based media and innovative solutions (interactive plays, mobile
  cinema and self-videos) (Box 3).

     Box 3: Multi-media approach to reach adolescents: Amina Sutura

     Anima Sutura, a Niamey-based organization, adopted a multi-media, integrated
     communication approach. The approach relies on a series of thematic plays
     based on daily life and is broadcast on national and local radios. These plays
     are designed to depict people in relatable situations, providing them an
     opportunity to form an opinion on essential SRH issues. "Plays involving known
     local actors contain music, proverbs and advice spoken by a typical Nigerien
     celebrity, such as the griot played by the famous singer Fati Mariko. Because
     he speaks, sings and plays music, the griot is in fact the only social celebrity
     who can say aloud what people think, and what the ideal citizen should do".
     These broadcasts lead to periodic radio debates. Campaigns last 12 to 32
     weeks. Each week, a radio clip on a specific issue is broadcast 3 times a day
     on all 73 partner radio channels across the country. This is then followed by a
     national debate on the weekend. While these plays address various topics (e.g.,
     early marriage, abortion, unwanted pregnancy, girl's schooling, HIV, FP, among
     others), they always focus on prevention and on promoting reproductive health
     (RH). Anima Sutura also uses a mobile team approach to reach communities,
     which is composed of facilitators to recruit local relays. Mobile teams provide
     Listening Clubs and support community radios.



                                           30
       Mobile Digital Cinema (MDC) is a tool used for behaviour change, increasing
       awareness and disseminating information in order to reach the most remote
       rural areas through 3 mobile cinema teams (giant screens set above off-road
       vehicles). The program provides movies and a forum for discussion on
       practices, behaviours, and social standards, and is popular among adolescents
       (10-19 years of age). In "fada video", the population is encouraged to film a
       documentary about SRH issues.

67. Assessing adolescent and youth activities, through FGDs, provides insight
    on the usefulness and adequacy of the activity. Life skills activities are
    generally well perceived and appreciated by adolescents and youth, and appear to
    be an appropriate vehicle for initiating income-generating activities among
    adolescents. Peer education faces inadequate capacity (for both peers and
    content), however, it seems to be an appropriate channel for condom distribution
    and informal sex education. Behavior change activities tend to reach their audience
    when using media and community-based approaches, through trained relays and
    local media. Scaling-up these pilot activities would reach a larger audience through
    mass media communication campaigns (Table 13).

68. Strengthening individual and community potential, as well as female social and
    institutional networks, has been effective in empowering girls and communities.
    Through CSOs, female adolescents acquire tools that give them more control over their
    socioeconomic environment and ability to make decisions. They are then better equipped
    to defend their rights. Use of health and other social services have generally increased
    among supported groups (Box 4).

        Box 4: Holistic, integrated and cross-sectoral approaches for girls’ empowerment

        The work conducted by Mercy Corps and Lafia Matassa, that target female
        adolescents, provides useful insights on the strengths and weaknesses of this type of
        approach. Mercy Corps has implemented a five-year Food for Peace program since
        mid-2013, with support from USAID, in the Maradi and Zinder regions. The program
        reaches an estimated 116,000 beneficiaries in 8 districts and 62 villages. It focuses on
        health and nutrition, and targets vulnerable populations, particularly pregnant women,
        breastfeeding mothers, and adolescents 12 to 18 years of age. It seeks to build
        capacity and empower women and reduce food insecurity and poor nutrition. From
        2010 to 2013 two NGOs, Lafia Matassa and Équilibres & Populations, partnered to
        implement two pilot projects 6 which aimed to improve ASRH by addressing their SRH
        needs and care, through holistic outreach activities and community mobilization. These
        projects targeted socially vulnerable (e.g., never enrolled in school, out of school,
        orphans, among others) female adolescents (10 to 14 years of age) in the rural area
        of Loga and the urban area of Gamkalley in Niamey. Girls meet twice a week in a
        secure location (youth center in Niamey, health center in Loga), and prepare and share
        a meal at the end of the session.

        Through this program, girls acquired technical knowledge (financial management,
        literacy, better awareness of available social and health services and of their rights as
        users, self-awareness, communication, SRH, gender, among others) and practices
        (IGAs, sewing, opening a bank account) through training modules. Change was also
        observed in communities. Through this type of holistic and integrated program, young
        girls were able to become more actively involved in the community and bring about
        social change. Furthermore, since all program facilitators were community members,
        they had a solid knowledge of people, networks, local circumstances and sources of
        influence, and were able to work closely with communities. As for communities
        themselves, there has been a noticeable change as well. Communities acknowledged
        the: (I) capacities, potential, improved image and status of female adolescents.; (II)
        improved interactions between girls and boys; and (III) commitment and mobilization
        of community actors (parents, leaders, female relays, health personnel) through their
        involvement in the project.

             PART V - CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS


Conclusions


The study illustrates the ASRH determinants and the multifaceted challenges that adolescents
(10-19 years of age) face to reaching their SRH potential in Niger. Adolescent females are
married at a young age (15.7 years), limiting their educational and employment opportunities
as most drop out of school in order to start having children. To address this, the government
attempted to pass legislation to protect adolescent female’s right to education by ensuring that
parents seek legal permission for the daughter to leave school and marry, however the bill
was met with societal resistance and was not approved. This indicates that barriers to
improving adolescent health and development exist at the societal level, such as the positive
value that society places on early marriage and pregnancy.

Although Niger’s median age at childbirth is 18.5 years, 73.1 percent of adolescents have had
a child before reaching 18 years of age. Early childbearing not only places the adolescent
mother at risk for poor health outcomes but also ther infant. The government has been working
to ensure access to health care and prevention services among pregnant women, including
adolescents, by passing the Reproductive Health Law (2006), the National Plan Adolescent
Sexual and Reproductive Health (2011), and the Family Planning Action Plan (2012-2020).
However, the study suggests that monitoring and evaluation of these plans and policies should
be carried out to ensure that they are effectively being implemented and reaching adolescents.

Despite being knowledgeable about modern contraception, use remains low among
adolescents. The study found that adolescents do not use contraception because of societal
and cultural beliefs. One way that the government is combatting FP misperceptions and
increasing FP demand is through the Family Planning Action Plan (2012-2020), by using mass
media campaigns to educate the population on the importance of FP. Lafia Matassa and
Equilibres et Population have implemented similar programs, to empower adolescents in their
SRH.

Adolescents face several barriers to accessing SRH services. In fact, almost 65 percent of
adolescent females face at least one barrier to accessing health services. Adolescents do not
seek SRH services due to financial reasons, despite legislation eliminating user fees. Also,
adolescents do not seek health services due to a lack of privacy and confidentiality. The
government has increased efforts to provide adolescent user-friendly SRH services by
expanding 48 health centers to include adolescent-friendly health services and trained health
personnel.

The analysis also shows that demand-side initiatives are able to effectively promote change
at the community level, and have a positive impact on the positioning of a community in favor
of young women’s health, their role in the family, and in the economy long-term. Such
initiatives must therefore be scaled-up to ensure a more profound change in the country. The
achievement of those results will additionally require multi-sectoral and well-coordinated
interventions in key sectors (health, education, employment and training). In parallel, the
supply of services must continue to be adapted, to ease access to adolescent-friendly
services, especially in rural areas. Youth centers, such as those already available in Niger,

                                              34
largely rely on peer education and should be assessed and extended to rural areas depending
on future needs of youth. Also, adolescents and youth should be involved in program design
and implementation, a critical element for adolescent’s empowerment and to ensure
effectiveness and sustainability.

Based upon the results of the study, the following recommendations were developed.

The aim of the study is to better understand adolescents’ sexual and reproductive health (SRH) needs in order
to inform the design of interventions and policies that improve access to and use of adolescent SRH services
in Niger. A mixed-methods study was conducted and included: (i) a quantitative analysis of Niger’s
Demographic Health Survey/Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (DHS/MICS) 2012; (ii) 17 focus group
discussions conducted in urban and rural areas among 128 adolescents; and (iii) a set of recommendations to
improve access to and use of SRH services for adolescents in the country. The study found that age at first
marriage among adolescent females is 15.7 years and is followed soon thereafter by sexual debut (15.9 years).
According to focus group discussions (FGDs), adolescents boys and girls start spending time together at 12
years in urban areas and 10 years in rural areas; this may lead to sexual intercourse in exchange for material
and financial resources. Over 70 percent of adolescents have given birth by 18 years of age. Although
knowledge about modern contraception is high (73 percent among female adolescents 15-19 years of age),
the majority of adolescent girls do not use contraception due to societal and cultural beliefs. Moreover, FGDs
reveal that the main barriers to use of SRH services is a lack of privacy and confidentiality, as well as finances,
despite the government’s elimination of user fees. The government has increased supply side interventions for
adolescents and prioritized adolescents on the national agenda by approving the Family Planning Action Plan
(2012-2020) and the National Plan for Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (2011), however these
plans need to be monitored and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in reaching this population group.
There is also a need to increase multi-sectoral demand-side interventions in the country.
