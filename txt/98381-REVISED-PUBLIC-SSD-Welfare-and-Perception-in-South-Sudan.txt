Monitoring Welfare and Perceptions in South
Sudan 2012 – 2014
Findings from the High Frequency South Sudan Survey 1, 2

    Summary

    Since early 2012, the World Bank’s High Frequency South Sudan Survey has collected a panel data set to monitor the welfare and perceptions of citizens in
    a selected number of state capitals in South Sudan. This note presents the findings of all six rounds of the survey on the topics of (1) Security, (2) Economic
    Conditions, (3) Assets and Consumption, and (4) Access to Services. The results are based on 143 households in Juba, Wau and Rumbek revisited six
    times. The analysis is restricted to households present in all rounds and, thus, is not statistically representative but only provides a descriptive narrative of the
    livelihood of the selected urban households in Juba, Rumbek and Wau. These cities are not among the cities most affected by the conflict.

    The analysis retrieves a gloomy picture of the situation of the selected households. Since December 2013, security deteriorated considerably with one in three
    households being looted. The majority of households reported elections as main prerequisite for peace, followed by ending the ethnic conflict. A detrimental effect
    on markets had translated into shortages and led to pessimism about the economic future. The conflict had destroyed income opportunities, especially for
    households with low incomes, and generally affected daily life negatively. Insecurity had prevented children from attending school. Households reported fewer
    assets and more often hunger.


1            Background
1.         South Sudan is a landlocked oil-dependent country and was exposed to several shocks in the last years. South Sudan
became independent on July 9, 2011 after a six year transitional period (2005 – 2011) that followed the signing of the 2005 Comprehensive
Peace Agreement (CPA). Outside the oil sector, livelihoods are concentrated on low productivity, subsistence based agriculture and
pastoralism, which engage about 78 percent of the population despite their share of only 15 percent of GDP. In 2012, South Sudan
decided to shutdown oil production followed by military skirmishes along the border with Sudan, resulting in a border closure for several
months. The conflict was resolved in late 2012 but left the government with large debts. Since December 2013, the Government of
South Sudan and its opposition led by the former vice president started to engage in military campaigns, leaving parts of the country
devastated and under control of the opposition. In late 2014, the international oil price dropped from above US$ 100 per barrel to less
than US$ 70 per barrel. The drop in the oil price severely affected the fiscal position of the government and the economy overall because
of the reliance on oil revenue for fiscal revenue and foreign exchange. After briefly reviewing each of these shocks, the note will contrast
the macro impact of these shocks with a detailed analysis of the socio-economic well-being and perception from 2012 to 2014 of South
Sudanese citizens living in selected state capitals based on data collected as part of the High Frequency South Sudan Survey.

2.       The oil shutdown in 2012 led to a collapse of GDP, large external debt and economic hardship. With independence,
South Sudan received 75 percent of the oil reserves of former united Sudan. Without large-scale refineries in place, South Sudan exported
the crude oil via pipelines in Sudan through Port Sudan. Disagreement about transit fees as well as accusations of theft motivated South
Sudan to shutdown oil production and exports in early 2012. This triggered subsequent military clashes and a closure of the border
between the two neighbors. The dispute between South Sudan and Sudan caused large shocks to the macroeconomic environment in
South Sudan with GDP dropping by almost 50 percent. The near complete closure of the Sudan-South Sudan border closed down an
important source of key staples for much – but especially the northern parts – of the country. This increased prices especially for food
products in geographically isolated areas in the northern states of South Sudan. The lack of oil revenues rendered government
expenditures unsustainable, forcing cuts in spending and taking up foreign debt in large amounts. This caused a contraction of the
economy as a whole, affecting people’s ability to purchase food in markets. The collapse of oil exports depleted foreign exchange,
weakening the domestic currency. This led to lower food imports, causing prices to rise, negatively affecting almost 40 percent of the
population and subsequently putting more than 300 thousand additional people into poverty. 3

3.        The internal strife between factions of the ruling party triggered military clashes since December 2013 leaving
thousands dead, hundreds of thousands displaced and destroying complete towns. The initial fighting spread rapidly from Juba
and escalated into a civil war, with military operations concentrated in Jonglei, Upper Nile and Unity States. While a cessation of hostilities
agreement was signed in Addis Ababa in February 2014, military clashes continued to affect six out of the ten states in South Sudan. An
undefined number of people have been killed during the conflict. As of January 2015, violence had internally displaced approximately
1.5 million people in South Sudan while 0.5 million people fled to neighboring countries. 4 The conflict left profound marks on the macro
economy and fiscal position with a cost of 15 percent of potential GDP and increases in prices by up to 30 percent within 2 months of

the onset of the conflict. Due to displacement, loss of harvest and increase in food prices, about 2.7 million people are estimated to have
been negatively affected by consumption losses with more than 700 thousand people pushed into poverty. 5

4.        The drop in the oil price negatively affects GDP, the fiscal balance and prices, resulting in increased poverty. Due to
its heavy dependence on oil, South Sudan’s economy is highly vulnerable to oil prices and output fluctuations. Oil production accounts
for almost the totality of exports, above 90 percent of fiscal revenue and about one-half of GDP. The recent decline in oil prices (nearly
50 percent since June 2014) is exacerbating the fiscal tensions generated by limited oil production. The impact of the oil prices decline
on real GDP growth is through lower government and private real incomes spilling over into lower public and private components of
GDP. In recent estimates, real GDP is expected to drop by 8 percent in 2014/15, from an increase by 31 percent in 2013/14. Average
inflation remained low until October 2014, but has surged in the following two months, accelerating to 20 percent and 10 percent in
November and December, respectively (year-on-year, mainly driven by higher food prices). The parallel exchange rate has been
depreciating to a weekly average over 5.5 SSP for 1 USD in late December 2013 from 3.8 SSP in late May 2014, and has reached above
SSP 9 to the USD in early 2015. An oil price of USD 70 per barrel is estimated to push about 300 thousand additional people into
poverty while affecting consumption of almost half of the population. 6

5.        The High Frequency South Sudan Survey collected household data from 2012 to 2014 gauging the pulse of South
Sudanese citizens living in selected state capitals. The three shocks had severe impacts on the macro-economy and are estimated to
have large negative impacts on poverty. This note complements the macro perspective with the individual socio-economic well-being of
a subset of the population. The High Frequency South Sudan Survey was conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics and the World
Bank. For more than two years, the survey followed a small number of households in four state capitals in South Sudan: Juba, Wau,
Rumbek and Malakal. Over the period of the survey, households were visited six times and asked about (1) safety and security, (2)
economic conditions, (3) assets and consumption, and (4) access to services.

6.         The analyzed subset of the sample is not representative for South Sudan but a descriptive view of some citizens in
Juba, Rumbek and Wau. In total, the survey conducted 2,018 interviews (round 1: 328, round 2: 364, round 3: 359, round 4: 361,
round 5: 360 and round 6: 246 excluding Malakal). The sample was drawn randomly based on a multi-level clustered design. The analyzed
subsample for this note was restricted to 143 households from Juba, Wau and Rumbek visited in each round to avoid mixing effects.
The households from Malakal are excluded because Malakal could not be visited in the last round due to the ongoing conflict. Comparing
the subsample to the full sample, mean respondent age, gender and household size do not differ at a statistically significant level. Thus,
the sample was drawn representative for the three state capitals but the analyzed subset is non-random and cannot be considered
statistically representative.

7.        Respondents became less secure especially since the conflict in December 2013. The frequency of physical attacks on
people fluctuated between 5 and 15 percent of interviewed households between August 2012 and October 2013. Since then, the number
of physical attacks rose to 19 percent in September 2014 (Figure 1). The frequency of theft fluctuated between 25 percent and 32 percent
from August 2012 to October 2013. The latest crisis aggravated theft beyond previous levels to 36 percent (Figure 2). Interestingly, the
proportion of households which experienced theft which had multiple incidences of thefts decreased over time, from almost half with
multiple incidents of theft in August 2012 to the large majority with only one incident in September 2014.

8.        Over one in five households had been looted since December 2013. In looted households significantly more people were
injured or killed relative to those households that were not looted (p-value <0.01, Figure 3). 7 In addition to the direct consequence from
the conflict, the deteriorating security is visible in a large number of households whose members were assaulted by police in the last 30
days (Figure 4). However, these incidents seem to affect households generally and unrelated to whether or not a household lost a member
in the conflict.

9.      Since December 2013, security became the most important problem incurring substantial costs to households.
Comparing only the last two rounds of the survey, households increasingly saw significantly more households list insecurity as the main
problem in their community (p-value <0.01) (Figure 5). As a result of the rise in perceived insecurity, households increased their relative
spending on security (p-value <0.01) with 27 percent of them moving it into their top three expenditures compared to 2 percent before
December 2013 (Figure 6).

10.       Daily life was negatively affected by the current conflict. Many households felt that a large number of aspects in daily life,
ranging from access to education over ability to walk around to livestock conditions, worsened since the conflict in December 2013
started (Figure 7). Only the relations within and across households were mentioned by more than 20 percent of households as having
improved. This could be explained by an increased solidarity within communities to deal with external stress from the conflict.

11.       The majority of households stated elections as the main prerequisite for peace. Those directly affected by the current
conflict focused on direct measures of conflict resolution (elections and ending ethnic conflict). In contrast, households not directly
affected by a killed or injured household member often cited elections, education, fighting corruption, markets, roads, health and
constitutional change as important for peace. Almost all households agreed that elections were crucial for peace (74 percent) as well as
ending the ethnic conflict (44 percent; Figure 8). From this perspective, it is particularly worrying that the government decided to
postpone elections to 2017. Also, respondents affected directly by conflict are actually less demanding than those that are not. They are
no more likely to call for elections or ending ethnic violence, just less likely to call for other measures.

12.       Over the last two years, the main sources of livelihood largely remained unchanged. Half of all households depended
on jobs with salaries, which is not untypical in urban areas (Figure 9); the remaining households obtained the main source of their
livelihood from private business (16 percent), from remittances (10 percent) and from rental income (10 percent). From June 2013
onwards, three trends can be identified: 1) an increase in households depending on remittances, 2) an increase in those depending on
income from private business and 3) a decrease in those depending on rental income. The rise in remittances was likely due to the
economic contraction as respondents sought help from family and friends abroad. The decline in rental income could be attributed to
parts of the population leaving Juba when the future outlook for the country worsened.
13.      The monthly income of households slightly declined for higher earners since December 2013. Before the conflict, about
one third of the respondents earned below 500 SSP per month, 37 percent between 500 and 1,000 SSP, and 26 percent between 1,000
and 2,000 SSP; only 2.5 percent of respondents reported a monthly household income of more than 2,000 SSP (Figure 10). After
December 2013, a small number of respondents reported higher incomes than in the previous round. With limited inflation of less than
4 percent between October 2013 and August 2014, it appears that real incomes increased slightly.

14.       For a large number of respondents, the current conflict deteriorated their ability to earn an income, especially for
households with low incomes. More than two thirds of households with a monthly income of 1,000 SSP or less reported a worsening
in their ability to make an income (p-value <0.01) compared to before the conflict (Figure 11). The number is less than half for better-
earning households with an income of more than 1,000 SSP per month. Most households made a living through a salary or private
business (Figure 12). The loss of a job or income is mitigated by receiving remittances as main livelihood.

15.      Markets had deteriorated recently leading to product shortages. There had been a sharp increase in respondents who
reported experiencing difficulties in getting products due to unavailability (Figure 13), this rose significantly from 39 percent in October
2013 to 54 percent after December 2013 (p-value <0.01). The same trend can be observed specifically for petrol. The number of
households affected by high prices remained stable above 90 percent.

16.      Respondents’ perceptions about the economic future of South Sudan have become more negative over the last two
years, reflecting the deterioration of markets. Between August 2012 and January 2013, the number of households with negative
economic expectations fluctuated between 18 and 24 percent. The percentage of very optimistic households dropped considerably in
February 2013 (Figure 14). In May 2013, respondents became generally more negative; this continued into October 2013. In September
2014, more than 70 percent of households reported a negative view about economic expectations, and only 15 percent expressed
optimism.

17.       Since early 2013, many households have lost assets like radios, mobile phones and mosquito nets. About 80 percent
of households owned a radio in 2012, but in September 2014 this number had decreased to 59 percent (Figure 15). Ownership of
mosquito nets also saw a deterioration from 93 percent to about 75 percent in 2013 and further down to almost 65 percent in 2014 (p-
value<0.01). The same trends are observed for other assets, including fridges and cars. The decline in asset ownership is worrying,
especially that of mosquito nets given its detrimental impact on health. The deterioration of assets might be caused by looting and theft.

18.       Diet consumption mostly remained stable from 2012 to 2014. The diet of households was measured by the number of days
selected food items were consumed. While some variation in the number of days an item was consumed was observed between 2012
and 2014, there was no peculiar downward or upward trend for most food products (Figure 16). Only the frequency of the consumption
of cereals and oils & fats deteriorated from late 2013 onwards, while vegetables were consumed more often in the same period. Although
it is estimated that consumption declined and poverty increased with the onset of the oil shutdown and the ongoing conflict (World
Bank, 2014f), the mix of items in the diet did not change. Thus, the negative impact on food consumption probably implies smaller
quantities consumed at each occasion.

19.        Households reported higher levels of hunger since the December 2013 conflict erupted. Hunger had been prevalent
among the selected households since 2012 with around 60 percent of households reporting that at least once in the last four weeks had
no food to consume (Figure 17). In September 2014, 79 percent of households reported hunger. At the same time, households reported
slightly less often that they had to consume food they did not want in the last four weeks (Figure 18).

20.       Since December 2013, perceived quality of medical care has deteriorated and household spending on medical
treatment declined. Prior to the conflict 54 percent of households assessed the quality of medical treatment in their area as fairly good
or very good while 37 percent assessed it negatively (fairly bad or very bad). With the onset of the current conflict, the number of positive
responses remained while the number of negative responses dropped to 11 percent (Figure 19). It is surprising to see an improvement
in perceived healthcare quality (p-value: 0.01) but it could be explained by additional efforts from the government and NGOs to deliver
health care. At the same time, medical spending by households fell from 66 percent spending 100SSP or more a month to 53 percent
(Figure 20). As household income did not fall in the same period of time, households probably re-allocated healthcare spending to
security expenditures (see above).

Education
21.      Insecurity prevented children from going to school. The number of households with at least one girl or boy absent from
school in the last two weeks remained relatively unchanged after December 2013. About 28 percent of households with girls enrolled in
school had at least one absent; the figure for boys was 24 percent (Figure 21). This may be because the areas surveyed were primarily
urban centers. Of households with absent children in the last two weeks, most cited insecurity as the main reason for this absence (Figure
22).

Service Provision
22.      The Central Government did not lose perceived responsibilities over law and order, land, tax and disputes. Before the
current conflict started, only one in five households felt that Central Government was responsible for law and order while most
households relied on the local government (Figure 23). Since December 2013, the number of households relating this responsibility to
the Central Government increased to nearly two in five (p-value <0.01). The same dynamics can be observed for collecting income tax
where the Central Government increased from 11 percent before the conflict to 19 percent after the conflict. Solving disputes was mainly
thought to be the responsibility of traditional leaders and members of the community and saw an increase towards traditional leaders
since December 2013. Allocating land was mainly linked to traditional leaders and members of the community without any change due
to the onset of the conflict.

6 Conclusion
23.        Conducting a tablet-based HFS is challenging in a fragile country but can succeed if managed closely. The main
difficulties can be grouped into design, implementation and monitoring issues. Starting with the questionnaire design, decisions have to
be made about the scope and in particular about the sensitivity of questions. Capacity is often limited to code the questionnaire for the
tablet. Enumerators and supervisors have to be trained in using tablets to capture responses. While tablets are helpful to ensure data
validity and enable real-time monitoring, trouble shooting of tablets in the field can be challenging. In addition, tablets must be charged
and protected against theft. Supervisors and field coordinators need to be trained to check recorded responses and make changes using
tablets rather than using paper surveys. However, these challenges can be overcome by introducing innovations into the design,
implementation and monitoring of tablet-based high frequency surveys. A separate note discusses these challenges and shows lessons
learnt from the HFS pilot in South Sudan, which made the pilot a success story. 8
24.      The HFS pilot captured the declining economic situation and service delivery. The HFS pilot started in 2012 and
continued until late 2014. In this period, South Sudan was subject to internal and external shocks with considerable impact on the macro-
economy and the livelihoods of the people. The HFS pilot was able to capture the evolution of a number of important indicators ranging
from perceived security over economic outlook and access to services to governance. Most of these indicators consistently deteriorated
over time culminating in large insecurity and dissatisfaction of service delivery since the conflict in December 2013 erupted. The conflict
had destroyed income opportunities, especially for households with low incomes, and generally affected daily life negatively. Only the
perception of health quality became less often negative; but insecurity had prevented children from attending school. Households
reported fewer assets and more often hunger.
25.       HFS data can provide feedback to government from their citizens and identify early on stresses. The HFS data suggests
that in October / November 2013 the economic outlook stabilized or improved slightly (Figure 14). At the same time, perceived
government performance was perceived less positively (data not shown) breaking the parallel trend of economic outlook and government
performance. Retrospectively, this might have indicated underlying tensions preceding the violent conflict in December 2013. The HFS
is also helpful to gauge public support for different solutions. For example, the majority of households reported elections as main
prerequisite for peace, followed by ending the ethnic conflict. Timely dissemination of the HFS results is essential for its effectiveness in
informing government and stakeholders. Especially in a fragile country like South Sudan, it can be challenging to receive adequate interest

for a tool like the HFS but also to publicize results possibly questioning government’s own perception. While some results of the HFS
have been shared (partly confidentially) with government and stakeholders, timely dissemination in the future should be improved.
26.       An ambitious expansion of the HFS is currently implemented to update poverty numbers. Based on the success of the
HFS pilot, World Bank currently expands coverage and depth as well as the methodology of the HFS funded by DfID and implemented
by the National Bureau of Statistics. 9 The expansion covers a representative sample of urban as well as rural areas in six states of South
Sudan. The questionnaire includes similar indicators as the pilot but also gauges consumption based on a newly developed rapid
consumption methodology. 10 The HFS data will allow to update poverty numbers for South Sudan and estimate the impact of the
conflict on livelihoods.
